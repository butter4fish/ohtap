Story_ID: 16792
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your, your parents.  And then we'll look at your mother's side of the family, then your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Would you state your mother's name and spell it, please, and her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her, her name was Martha Marie Parrish and, of course, Britton was her married name.  She was born in Erin, E-R-I-N, Tennessee.  Spelling her name is M-A-R-T-H-A, M-A-R-I-E, P-A-R-R-I-S-H, Parrish, born on January 26, 1905.
Speaker 1: All right, sir.  And your father's full name, date of birth and place of birth?

Story_ID: 16793
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about your mom [Martha Marie Parrish]'s side of the family, sir, if we could.  Did she grow up in Erin, Tennessee?  If not, where did she grow up and what do you, what else do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: She, the first few years of her life, she grew up in Erin. I would say maybe until she was eight, nine years old.  Then her father died, and her mother had to take care of the family, and had no opportunities to do so really in Erin, and took a risk and moved--the moved with herself and four girls to Nashville, Tennessee looking for opportunity.  So my mother grew up from around eight or ten years old on through life in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: In Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: She, it's my recollection, whereas her name was Parrish, the most, most people on her side of the family were Kirkpatricks.  I can't really explain how, how that happened, but I know there are a lot of Kirkpatricks in her family.  Her cousins, her, my, she--I think she had an uncle by that name.  Her mother, her mother's name I, I'm drawing a blank on it right now.  I may have put it down on there.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I think you indicated Marie on your--.
Speaker 2: That, yeah, that's correct.  I, I think that's correct, yeah.  And her father's name, I--.
Speaker 1: You also indicated on the form that he was named Milton.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's right.  I have a hard time remembering that some time because all of them were deceased when I, when I came along so I really didn't--never knew them.
Speaker 1: What stories have you heard your mother tell about your grandparents, Milton and Marie Parrish?
Speaker 2: She talked a lot about her mother and the fact that she was industrious and worked extremely hard in order to take care of her and her three siblings.  She spoke very lovingly of her mother, but she was never really expansive about it.  I don't know very much about my grandmother at all.  Her grand--I mean her father, Milton, was a sometime preacher.  I do remember that.  The reason I remember it because they were all pressuring me to be a minister because everybody, people, there were so many people on both sides of the family who were preachers.  And I decided to break the mold, and that was, that was just unheard of.  That was a no-no for--until I decided to what I wanted to do what I wanted to do anyway (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  All right, any other stories, anything else you know about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not on, not on that side, no, no.
Speaker 1: They were born after the era of slavery, were they not?
Speaker 2: My recollection was that the--yes, they were born after that era.
Story_ID: 16794
Speaker 1: As for your mother [Martha Marie Parrish], what do you remember most about her and how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: She was a very warm, soft person that had a will of steel.  She was, for instance, she was married to a minister, who at that time made very little money because he was an honest minister.  He, instead of taking a lot from his congregation, often gave what little bit of money they gave to him back into the church.  So that meant that she had to provide a lot of the support for the family from her teacher's salary 'cause she was a public school teacher.  And she did so absolutely without complaint.  She supported from my observation, one hundred percent.  Whatever he wanted to do was okay as long as it was doing the work of the church.  She was very religious.  She was deeply religious.  Well, let me, let me differentiate.  He--she was deeply religious in, in the sense of that time, not the way people seem to be spouting it these days because her, her religiosity was expressed in what she did, not in what she said, 'cause she didn't go around talking about it, you know.  She would have gone through fire for her two children.  She was just one hell--heck of a lady, she really was.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Any other attributes or memories of her that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a, she enjoyed teaching.  She really thought--.
Speaker 1: Public school teacher?
Speaker 2: Public school teacher.  She taught in the elementary grades most of the time.  For most of her career, she taught fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Fifth grade.
Speaker 2: At the, as her career began to wane, she began teaching third grade.  She left the school system before she really wanted to because I think she was just barely sixty when she, when she retired.  And she had left only because she was beginning to find that kids were coming to school undisciplined.  And she had a difficult time believing that she should rear children and also teach them.  And so she was getting a little tired of that, and so she did decide to retire.  But she loved teaching.  One of the stories that I can tell you, when she got into her eighties, and I was living in Washington [D.C.] at the time.  And I was, of course, concerned about her living by herself because my father [John Henry Britton, Sr.] had died by that time.  And I was trying my best to influence her to come live with me.  And I kept at her, and I kept at her, and she just kept saying no.  And, and I, you know, and I figured--and my brain said that she didn't want to leave the home place 'cause people, you know, people do fall in love with their homes and that kind of thing.  And so day I sat her down and just had a serious conversation.  I, I, I really, I guess it was really one of the first times I had conversation with her when I acted as her peer as opposed to her son.  And I said, "Well, you know, why won't you come live with me?  I live a good life.  I, I promise not to embarrass you."  And she said that it was, it was much simpler than that.  She said, and, if I moved to Washington, I would be known as John Britton's mother.  She says, in Nashville, I am Mrs. Britton, and I taught half the city (laughter).  So wherever I walk, there's somebody who's gonna look after me because most of them have been my students.  And that was true.  And so I let her alone.
Speaker 1: It made a lot of sense, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I let her alone after that, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is in Nashville, as opposed to Erin?
Speaker 2: Yes, this was in Nashville, right.
Speaker 1: This is, in part, during the era of the church school.  Are we talking teaching in the church schools or in the city school system of Nashville?
Speaker 2: She, well, she taught in Nashville always in the public schools.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Before she got her degree from Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], she taught in Kentucky.  It was like, almost the equivalent of practice teaching, except it wasn't practice teaching because as you probably recall, in that era, in black schools, there, there was no requirements that the teachers finish college.  So in order to get some money, in order to go back to Tennessee State and finish, she taught, and I'm drawing a black on the little town in Kentucky that's very close to Nashville.  But she, she taught in that, in the Kentucky system maybe two years.
Speaker 1: All right, sir.
Speaker 2: And, but that was also public school, not, not church.
Speaker 1: Did the fact that she had a profession as a teacher influence you in your educational pursuit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's hard to know what influenced me because, you know, when it was time to go to college for me, it was never in my mind, would I?  It was always just where.  So that influence came at me from both sides, my father and my mother.
Story_ID: 16795
Speaker 1: I want to see if there's anything else your mother or your grandparents on your mother's side.  Are there other relatives beyond your Grandma Marie [Parrish], and Grandpa Milton [Parrish], that you know of?
Speaker 2: I only knew some of her cousins.  Some of them had colorful, colorful backgrounds.  I remember one, one guy and in order--he was not well schooled, and he had to make a living.  So he was a, he was running illegal whiskey around town.  And I can remember seeing him passing our house going really fast in whatever little car he was driving.  And I've seen the police running after him, you know.  And they never caught him (laughter).  But his name was Jim Kirkpatrick.  He had another brother, I remember.  I can't think of the brother's, other brother's first name.  Well, those two people I knew, and then there, she had a, she had an aunt, my mother did, had an aunt.  And I'm drawing a blank on that name.  I just can't, can't come up with it right now.
Speaker 1: Very well, sir.  Did your mother's family originate from the plantation system there in Tennessee or have you heard stories about them being related to the Indian population or their African origin?  Do you know the origin of her family?
Speaker 2: My mother never talked to me about that kind of thing, but if you ever saw a picture of her, it would be clear that she has Indian features.  And it was never, and, and--she was just mother to me.  And I never got into that kind of thing.  And it, it never hit me until my wife said, looking at my mother's picture the first time, said, she's, she's, she's heavily Indian.  And I, I believe she probably was, but I don't which tribe.  I don't know, and because she never talked about that.  She was proud to be, to be black.  She, she, she used to--she used to kind of laugh at people who, who were, who were very concerned that everybody know that they were part Indian, you know.  She, she said, in this society, you either black or white.  You might as well forget about all that other stuff (laughter).
Story_ID: 16796
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father [John Henry Britton, Sr.] and his side of the family.  Father was a minister.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What else do you, do you--would you like to share with us about your dad?  Other occupations and the type of person he was and what you remember about him?
Speaker 2: He probably was the most honest, straight arrow that I have ever met.  He is the one preacher that I would follow and did, and I joined his church.  And I still am a member of that church, even to this day.  He's a man who did whatever was necessary to take care of his family, and it, his family means his immediate family, us, and he had twelve siblings.  Now, he was the youngest of the thirteen children and for reasons that I have to assume has to do with his integrity and his, his brainpower, his ability to think through things, he was the leader of the family.  They all turned to him when they had troubles, challenges, successes, whatever.  They turned to what, who--the person they called John Henry, Reverend John Henry.  He, I knew--you see, my father was forty-nine when I was born.  He was probably sixteen, seventeen years older than my mother, which will, which will probably explain something else I'm gonna tell you later on because his father was part of a, not only the slave system, but what is the--?
Speaker 1: Sharecropping?
Speaker 2: Sharecropper, that's right.  He was part of the sharecropper system because the reason that sticks in my mind is because my--well, well, my father finished his formal education at, in the eighth grade because in the South, as you probably know, in those small towns, you had these one-room school houses that took people to the eighth grade, and then you had to go great distances to get to the nearest high school.  Well, he finished the eighth grade and was going to go those great distances to go to high school, except for one thing.  He came home from school one day, and he said, and he tells this--he told this story a lot.  He, he came around the corner of his, where his dad was, and he saw a white guy pointing his finger in his daddy's face, threatening his daddy with harm if he did not produce more money.  And my father said he said to himself that that will never, ever happen again.  And my father quit school, went to work, started working as part of a team of guys who were building bridges, not only in Tennessee, but on up to Kentucky and on, as far up as Indiana.  They were building damns--no, not bridges, but damns, that's right.  And he took money he made, and he brought my dad--he brought his daddy a farm so that his daddy would have his own farm to work.  And that farm stayed in the family for many, many years.  I was probably, I was probably twenty-some years old before my dad decided to sell it because he could no longer work it anymore.  His brothers who used to, he--after his father passed, then my dad allowed his brothers to live on that property for nothing, you know, as long as you just keep the property up and, and do whatever farming that you want to do.  And he finally sold the, the property when those brothers, I think, passed.  And he didn't, he was now living in Nashville [Tennessee], so he didn't, he didn't any further need for it, he thought, at the time.  But that's why he didn't finish, he didn't go any further in school.  He, later on, he took, I guess what you now call continuing education courses at, at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And in particularly, he was--Fisk used to have courses in religious education, and he took those courses to qualify himself to become a minister.
Story_ID: 16797
Speaker 1: Now, the year of your dad's birth was?
Speaker 2: 1888.
Speaker 1: 1888.  Other memories of your father?
Speaker 2: He, he--sorry, he, he not only was a good preacher, and I, and I, I differentiate this for a purpose.  He was a good minister, but he was also a good preacher.  He, he, he--if you go to his services on Sunday or wherever he's preaching, you left with a message that stuck.  So that's good preaching.  He also was a good minister in that he did--he took care of his flock.  He, he, he--I, I, I know him, from the time I was a baby he pastored the same church for twenty-six years in the Methodist church.  That's almost unheard of.  What happened was, and this is, this is the family lore.  He asked by a, a bishop to do something that my father thought was unethical, and my father refused to do whatever that was.  And the bishop thought as punishment, he would send my father to this little place called Needmore, [Tennessee] you know, right outside--well, right now, it's right outside Nashville [Tennesee], but then it was way in the country cause they didn't have interstates and all that kind of thing.  Because my dad had been presiding elder over the Nashville district, he had pastored the, one of the two largest churches there in Nashville, he was very successful.  But the bishop decided he was gonna quote "punish" him.  He sent him to this little church in this little small town.  My daddy took it as a challenge, not as a punishment.  And he not only helped build the church, he helped build the spirit of the people and therefore the little town.  When my father first got to that little town, nobody, nobody had finished high school.  When he retired, twenty-some years later, twenty-six years later, those people's children, to a person, had all gone to college and finished college cause he preached education.  Almost one out of four sermons had to do with getting educated and educated.  He formed youth groups within the church, and he preached to them and pastored to them as hard as he did to their parents.  And education was always the center of it.  He used us, myself and my sister, as examples in his--and when we went to college, he really hammered it home to 'em because he said, he, he--and he was very diplomatic, but he let 'em know that y'all are not paying me enough to send my kids to college, but they going anyway.  And if I can do it, you can do it.  And one of the things that helped us go to college is because we scholarships.  So he used that to talk to these kids, you know.  You got to get something in your head so you can earn your way through college, if no other thing.  So he was at, he, he helped build the church, but more than that, he helped build the spirit of that community and helped build that town.
Speaker 1: It sounds like education, uplift and religion was a very active part of, not only your dad's life, but, but your family's life as well.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is the name of the little church in Needmore?
Speaker 2: Williamson Chapel CME [Christian Methodist Episcopal] Church, and the, the mailing address of that community now is called, is, is, it's Old Hickory [Tennessee], that have a Old Hickory zip code.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But it's, they still call themselves Needmore.
Speaker 1: Needmore, very well, sir.
Speaker 2: And the story about that is that in the old days, a black guy settled there to work at the DuPont [Company] plant, which is really in Old Hickory.  And they looked around in the community, and they say it was just men.  So we "need more" women over here.  So they named the town Needmore.  That's the, that's the story.
Story_ID: 16798
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad [John Henry Britton Sr.]'s mother and father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What are their names?  What's your dad's mom's name and your dad's, dad's name and?
Speaker 2: His mother's name was Amanda, and Mandi was what she was called.  And my recollection is that his name was John too, I believe.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you say they had thirteen children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your dad being one of them.  And what city did they live in?
Speaker 2: In Lagaurdo [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: In Lagaurdo.  All right.  Do you have any recollections of them at all?
Speaker 2: None at all 'cause they, too, had passed by the time I came along.
Speaker 1: Any stories you've heard about them, that impacted you?
Speaker 2: None that I can remember at this time.  I, and I just remember that my dad was, was crazy about them.  He, he--one of the reasons he did what he did for his dad is because he was, he was crazy about his daddy.  He was not gonna see his daddy embarrassed any more.  So that, that, I kind of think, kind of shows what he felt about his father.  I don't know of any story that will point out how he felt about his mother, but clearly he had respect for her.
Speaker 1: Any knowledge of any other relatives, any other ancestors of the Britton family, on your dad's side?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew, I knew about six of his brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know, you're gonna ask me their names.  One was Richard.  And Richard tried to be a preacher too, was never, was never a pastor of any particular church.  But he was sort of a circuit rider, I guess you would call them.  Richard, there was one named Palmore, and I don't even really know how to spell that name because nobody ever told me how to spell it.  But the way it sounds, it would sound like it's P-A-L-M-O-R-E.  Now, he--I remember him because he was a big fellow, kind of like me, but he died early because--he was the first one of the brothers I know to die.  He died because he was working in a rock quarry, and he was in the blazing hot sun working in a rock quarry, using the kind of equipment John Henry used, a, a, he just using a hammer to break these rocks in, in heat that must have been a hundred degrees.  And he just died from heat stroke.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: So it was Richard, Palmore, and the others are, the others names are escaping me, but I, I remember very well that I knew about six of them, yeah.
Story_ID: 16799
Speaker 1: My mother [Martha Marie Parrish] had three sisters too.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So I don't want to leave them out.
Speaker 2: All right then.
Speaker 1: She, I think I mentioned that there were four girls, didn't I?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And any brothers?  Your mom have any brothers?
Speaker 1: No, she didn't have any brothers, but her sisters, Willie Mae, Louise and Marie was also a sister's name, whose name--and the Marie is the one I didn't know because she died early.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I see.
Story_ID: 16800
Speaker 1: How did mom [Martha Marie Parrish] and dad [John Henry Britton, Sr.] meet?
Speaker 2: Like some young ladies these days, my mother had gone along with her professional career and had come to the conclusion that there were no more good men left.  She went to church one Sunday, and there was this man in the pulpit preaching what she described as a powerful sermon.  And she decided in her young head that she wanted to meet this man.  She somehow schemed up and did that.  And it was not love at first sight, but it certainly was interest at first sight.  In those days, as you know, women did not pursue men aggressively, but she made it very clear that would invite his attention if he, he cared to give it.  And so my dad had been player in his old--in his early days, so he understood the signals.  And he pursued it.  And that's, they ended up marrying.  And when I say that--let me just explain when I say he was "player".  He, he didn't, he was not, he was not always a preacher.  He, when he came out of the country, Laguardo [Tennessee], he was, he was quite a musician.  He never was trained, but he did what they called, played by ear, and he was one heck of a guitarist.  So every--everybody I've ever heard who knew him then said he was a tremendous guitarist.  He played the blues.  He played in little clubs.  The reason I can't attest to this is when he decided to become a Christian and become a minister, he put the guitar down and refused to even play it for--my sister and I begged him, and he never would.  But so, that's what I meant by he was player in his day because--and he was a fair, he was--I think most women considered him a good looking guy.  And he got around when he was young.
Story_ID: 16801
Speaker 1: Did any of that musical talent [from his father, John Henry Britton, Sr.] pass on to you?
Speaker 2: More, it was more so to my sister.  I, I, I did music, yeah.  I liked to, I play trumpet and, and did so on the band in, in, in high school and in college; wanted to really major in music, but that's another story 'cause I got turned around in Nashville [Tennessee] 'cause I, I was, I was part of a band really, that because of the segregated era, everybody who was black went to a single high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  So, therefore, there was a lot of talent there.  We had the best band in that region because of that.  I mean we didn't just have people from some neighborhood.  We had black guys from all over the city in this band.  And it was, it was a band of about a hundred, even in those days.  And, and what happened to me, and I'm, I'm getting to it--I'm, I'm being circular, I know.  At one point the people, the towns people in Nashville decided they were going to organize a Nashville Youth Symphony to go along with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.  They had blind auditions.  They were trying to make it fair.  So Pearl High's guy, Mr. Gunter, Marcus Gunter was our band director, tremendous guy, by the way, and tremendous trainer of, of musicians.  Marcus Gunter chose maybe a dozen of us to go to this, this blind audition.  All of us, either got first or second chair, based upon the audition.  The next week Mr. Gunter came to our band practice as normal and had bad news.  The bad news was that the people of the city had decided that they don't want the symphony orchestra, the youth symphony anymore.  They had not anticipated that we would have done that well because our guys were first chair in every section.  That suggested to me that maybe I didn't want to pursue music as a career.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: Even as we speak, the symphony orchestras of this country are bereft of black players.  You have a few with the National Symphony in Washington [D.C.].  You have maybe one in the New York Philharmonic, or maybe three at Baltimore [Symphony Orchestra, Baltimore, Maryland], but not very many.
Story_ID: 16802
Speaker 1: To return, just a minute to your dad [John Henry Britton, Sr.] and mom [Martha Marie Parrish], we know now how they met, and they had two children, is that right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yourself, and, and your sister.  And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Naomi Louise Britton.
Speaker 1: And she's older or younger?
Speaker 2: She was older.  She was four years older than I.
Speaker 1: All right, John.  Let's, let's talk a little bit about the early years of your life.  You were born in 1937, four years before the beginning, before the advent World War I [sic, World War II], started school during World War I--correction, World War II.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: World War II.  What are your earliest memories of growing up in view of the fact that the war was going on, and I guess--well, let's just start there.  What are your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I remember, I remember, I remember the whole concept of rationing.  I remember being sent to the store by my mother to pick up some things, and I remember people asking for this, these tickets or stamps or whatever they're called.  But I remember having, as parents do, they protect you.  I remember having a very good time as a kid.  I had a lot of playmates.  We lived, the first few years of my life in, in, in a shotgun tenement on, on Edgehill Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The address was 1303 Edge Hill.  That's funny how I can remember that and can't remember other things (laughter).  But we lived at 1301 Edge Hill, and it's now, all those tenements, of course, are torn down now.  I joke some time and tell people that where we lived was so bad they tore it down and built projects, you know, is what--(laughter).  Anyway, those were fun times for me, fun times for my sister.  I still know most of the people I grew up with in that neighborhood.  It was exactly two blocks from the elementary school that I went to and where my mother taught, by the way.  Now, they lived in this tenement, from what I hear, not because it's all they can afford.  But it was, you know, housing was restricted.  And they, for a great long time, could not find any place that they wanted to live.  So they continued living there until the, a certain--now, they were paying ten dollars a month rent.  I remember that.  And when the landlord decided to go up on the rent by 10 percent, which means it would have been eleven dollars, my father was furious and decided with my mother that they were gonna build their own house.  And they, they did that, that--and so the rest of my time was living on, at 1510 South Street, in, in, in Nashville, which was a much better neighborhood.  A matter of fact, Music City is around there right now, Music Row is what they call it.  But the people in that neighborhood--it's, it's very interesting there were--that so many people in that neighborhood ended up being in music.  I go to dances in Nashville right now, and it's either one or three or four people I grew up with in that neighborhood who are either, who are leading the band or in the band.  The people I can name for you who came out of that neighborhood that I used to play with every day, Bobby Hebb.  Bobby Hebb wrote the song named 'Sunny'.  You may have heard that song.  He was a guy I played with all the time.  I remember his parents were blind, and they used to stand on the street corner begging, you know, and Bobby would, along with his father and his other siblings would be playing their--they played the harp.  So, in order to get people to put money in the basket.  Those, those were some memories.  I remember in my childhood also having a fairly secure, I guess you might call it, neighborhood.  I really, we really didn't, except for buy clothing, we had really no need to go downtown for anything.  There, there were in our neighborhood a grocery store, owned by a black fellow, the Cottons, Mr. Cotton was his name, who had drugstores.  We had, we had to go across town, but it was also in a black section of North Nashville, to go to the movies.  We--the Ritz Theater [Nashville, Tennessee] was the black theater.  So except for, you know, like if you wanted to go into a restaurant, and, you know, at--but we really didn't have to go to the restaurants downtown, you know.  It was just a contained community.
Speaker 1: And black businessmen were--?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --were in charge of all of these?
Speaker 2: That, that's correct, yeah.  And, and also in the neighborhood, I, I remember very clearly, there were all levels of black folks.  The, the poorest guy lived two doors to the right of us.  It was, Sowell was his name.  He was probably the poorest guy in the neighborhood.  He used to run around delivering coal in an old wagon, you know, cause in those days, people heated by coal.  And his, he did pretty well, but not well enough to really live well.  His children were always hungry, and the reason I remember that because they were, they were virtually given lunch when the--in the, in the elementary school, and even before that was popular, but even before government started helping with that.  And then, but then also across the street and four houses down, one of the richest men in town lived there, Zema [W.] Hill.  He was, he had, he ran a funeral home [Zema W. Hill Funeral Home, Nashville, Tennessee].  And he was also a Baptist minister.  So he had sources of income coming from all kinds of places.  Down the street the McKissicks.  They were architects.  They're the ones who built the field down at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and all that kind of thing.  And so there was a, a rich conglomeration of people whose children I got to know and play with and grew up with.  And I don't, I don't, I don't know that that kind of thing can happen today.  But it's, it was certainly beneficial to all of us--.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --what we did in those days.
Speaker 1: Do you have other memories of growing up there in your community?  Those are wonderful memories, but are there others that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had my, one we call the baby aunt, that was Louise, my mother's youngest sister was Louise.  And she lived in East Nashville.  And she, she, she lived on McFerrin Avenue with her husband, Joe.  Joe was my uncle by marriage and one of my favorites, by the way.  He was a hell of a guy.  And he had brought, he had bought this land--it's right on the corner of McFerrin, and I can't think of the name of the street that came the other way.  And he would--he built out, he built his house out there on this land before anybody else got there.  So eventually, he was surrounded by white people because they liked living out there.
Story_ID: 16803
Speaker 1: The white community started surrounding him [Britton's uncle Joe] in this particular neighborhood.  So there became a point when these people decided that they, that Joe should leave.  And all Joe would do, I remember being told this, all Joe would do was sit out on his front porch every evening after he got through working--and he all, he also had a huge garden in this place.  That means we could go to Joe's house on Saturday--well, I'll, I'll finish that story later because we'd go there a lot because his--[Britton's aunt] Louise fixed hair, and so she fixed my mother [Martha Marie Parrish]'s hair, and we'd all go out there.  But anyway, we could eat out of Joe's garden.  We didn't, he didn't have to go to the grocer for anything except meats.  And he, and he really didn't have to do that because he also raised chickens there.  But anyway, where I was going with the story is that, this is where I learned, and this, visiting them is where I learned how things change, the older you get as a black male.  I had a lot of playmates in that section of town that were white kids.  And all of a sudden when I was eleven or twelve years old, they disappeared.  And I had no idea what the deal was.  And Louise decided, I guess, at that time in my life, not to tell me, you know.  And I kind of grew up thinking well, maybe I did something wrong.  And when I started going down that track, then they told me what the deal was (laughter), you know.  So I, I do remember--that's part of my memory of, of going over there.  And I, I remember also that, and when we moved on, and when we moved on South Street, it was, like I said, it was a very, much better neighborhood.  And this is an interesting story.  My parents had to purchase the land from the Witherspoons.  The Witherspoons included a father who was A, an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] minister and his wife who was a teacher.  And they had two girls, Jenny and Mary.  But the Witherspoons did know my parents, but Jenny and Mary knew my sister [Naomi Louise Britton] and me.  Mary knew my sister because she was at--the same age as my sister, in the same class.  Jenny knew me for the same reasons.  My parents got that land even--because the Witherspoons were about to say no because these are people coming from Edgehill [Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I don't know if I, we would--they would fit into our good neighborhood.  And Jenny and Mary told them that--about my sister and me and said that we were good kids and we probably couldn't be that way unless they had good parents.  So the prevailed upon their parents to sell my parents that land.  And they built, my parents built a house on that house, and we, I was, I guess I was maybe twelve when they moved in.  And I stayed there for about four years, and the reason I say four years because at sixteen, I went off to college.  And although I came back every summer, I really never lived there full-time any more.  But it was, it was another rich experience because I also picked really, really good--at least two really good friends as a result of being there.  One of the guys is a fellow named Maurice Black.  You know, we, we talk regularly, even, even, even as we speak, you know.
Story_ID: 16804
Speaker 1: Let's look at the schools you attended, starting with the elementary school, the name of the school and tell if there were any particular teachers that influenced you.  And if so, what were their names?
Speaker 2: Carter-Lawrence [now Carter-Lawrence Elementary Math and Science Magnet School, Nashville, Tennessee], Carter, dash Lawrence was the name of the elementary school.  And it still stands--well, the physical structure was torn and rebuilt, so, but the school is still in the same location.  Favorite teacher, yeah, Ms. Thompson, I guess was my favorite teacher.  She was my teacher, as I recall in the fifth grade--I think that's right.  And I guess she was my fav--one of my favorites because number one, she took no nonsense.  So that's, she kept us in line.  And number two, it just seems like we'd learn stuff without her really teaching.  And I don't, I don't know how she did that.  It, it never seemed that she was preaching to us.  It never seemed that she, she never bored us cause she was, and she was a feisty lady.  But somehow or another the knowledge got into our heads, and we were very well prepared.  And another thing too I liked about her, she didn't cut any slack with me or my sister.  She taught my sister [Naomi Louise Britton] also, just because we were my mother [Martha Marie Parrishj]--our, our mother's children because they taught together.  So my, my, my mother refused--and so that's another thing, my mother refused to teach us because she didn't want any--my mother never wanted anybody to, to think she was playing favorites.  If, if we happened to get good grade, we, we ought to be credited with earning those, not just because we were her children.  So she never wanted to teach us, and she never did.  But what she did do is she recommended to principal that she put us with Ms. Thompson.
Speaker 1: So she was a teacher in the same school?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother respected Ms. Thompson, and--very much, and so that's how we end--that's how I ended up in her class.
Speaker 1: Was there a separate middle or junior high school or?
Speaker 2: There was a junior high school and that, the name of that junior high school was Cameron Junior High School [now Cameron Middle School, Nashville, Tennessee].  It has gone through metamorphoses.  It, it was a junior high then.  It became a high school later on, and now it's, and these days, it is a middle school, right.
Speaker 1: Any favorite teachers there or, or any teachers who influenced you more than other?
Speaker 2: I guess the person who taught, who impressed me more than anyone else was the algebra teacher whose name, as I recall, is Mr. Jones, I believe.  And the reason Mr. Jones impressed me so much is for similar reasons.  I had real difficulty with Algebra.  I had, I had imagined difficulty with math, period, you know, being a liberal arts kind of--and I still am a lib--I'm more toward the arts.  And all of us, and particularly--I've not met anybody in journalism yet that didn't have problems with math.  But anyway, for similar reasons I, I, I really remember him because he approached me one day and told me I was doing real bad.  And that didn't make sense to him.  And I told him that I just couldn't, I just, I, I couldn't do algebra because I didn't see any use for it.  I don't know how algebra was gonna help me in life.  And he sat me down, and he, he talked to me.  I don't remember what he said or anything like that because it still didn't impress me, but from that point on, he began teaching his class again in a way that made algebra apply to everyday situations, and I was able to pick it up just like that (snaps fingers).  And I, I, I literally got an A in that class.
Speaker 1: Overall, what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was above average.  I came out of high school as the third in my class.
Speaker 1: Great, great.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was three, number three.
Story_ID: 16805
Speaker 1: What type of child were you?  What, were you well mannered, rambunctious or mischievous?
Speaker 2: A little bit of all of that (laughter).  Yeah, I was always very respectful of elders and, and that, that was 100 percent of the time.  But my, my friends now, particularly, the kids I, I grew up with in Needmore [Tennessee], you know, they're the ones probably I was close--am closest to because church was not just Sunday.  It, my father [John Henry Britton, Sr.] would be, go back and forth up there on, during the week or some need.  And the children in Needmore said that I was mischievous.  Well, they, they relate some things that I just don't remember, but I have to take--accept their word.  But I was, I was always respectful of elders.  I, I can't say that I was rambunctious because I don't think I was that.
Story_ID: 16806
Speaker 1: Did you have dreams and aspirations in middle school and in high school?  If so, what were they?
Speaker 2: Well, I still have dreams.  That's an interesting thing, you know, but, yeah, I did have--I had, I had aspirations then of being two things: one, music was still my, on my mind when I was in junior high school, and I aspired to be part of somebody's symphony orchestra and or I, I wanted to be the best trumpet in jazz.  I loved jazz.  Also at that time, I, I was developing a love for, for journalism, for writing.  I wrote little stuff to myself and showed it to nobody, but it was stuff that was emptying my brain of thoughts that were in my head.  And I looked at it and thought it was pretty good.  I, I had to write some compositions in, in school, and the teacher said it was nice.  So that was encouraging.  So I--and, and also at that particular time, I was encouraged by the fact, believe it not, that there was something called 'Jet' magazine.  I read those things every week that they came out.  And I look back now, and I, you know, I say, some of that stuff was garbage in those--'Jets' of that day.  I mean, why do, why do fat women make better love and that kind of stuff.  Well, being put out when the, when the magazine was edited by a fellow named Ben Burns who, who didn't quite understand how we, how much we needed something good to read.  It didn't change until John [H.] Johnson decided to put a, a black guy in there as managing editor, and then the whole tone changed.  But it was 'Jet' magazine--and, and the 'Pittsburgh Courier' and the 'Afro [American'].  Those were the things that I, with my allowance, went out and bought every week.  And I remember there was a reporter for the 'Courier' named  Trezzvant Anderson, who was, who became my hero because was a guy that was traveling the South, reporting all the civil rights stories, reporting all the lynchings.  And I, and I, when I grew up and started reporting for the 'Atlanta Daily World' here, I actually got to meet him and travel with him a couple of times.  And that was--but, yeah, I did have those kind of aspirations then.  And I did not see clearly how I was going to get to that.  There was no--yeah, I had confined, restricted my aspirations at that time to writing for a black publication because, as far as I know at that time, Ted Poston was probably the only black guy writing for a, a daily newspaper, that I knew about at the time.  And we knew, I knew Ted because he was in, he was, he was in class with my mother at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], so, you know, the family knew him.  Those, those are, those two things were my aspirations, music and, and journalism.
Story_ID: 16807
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?  And would you describe some of your experiences in high school, both curriculum and extra curriculum?
Speaker 2: I went to Pearl, P-E-A-R---P-E-A-R-L High School.  It had, it has now been merged with Cohn High School.  So it's now called Pearl-Cone [Magnet] High School [Nashville, Tennessee].  It, that was, to me, again, a rich experience because you were competing against all the kids in the city, not just from one little neighborhood or one little region like there is these days.  All the kids in the city were there.  So I think when a person was valedictorian in those days, it meant a lot because that meant they were number one in the city (laughter).  So that was a wonderful experience to have that competition, friendly competition, and I can't remember anybody who acted badly about anything.  And I can't remember anything like what's happening today, where people are saying that you're acting white, if you're trying to be smart.  I don't, I don't remember any of that.  I may not--it may have happened, but I, it--I didn't experience it.  I, I remember having English teachers that were extremely, extremely good.  They, they were people who were determined that we were gonna learn because if we didn't and moved to the next grade, it would reflect on them.  And they were not gonna have that, and, and so, Mrs. Walker was one of my favorite teachers.  She was an English teacher.  There was a Mrs. Crouch who was a science teacher.  She was the wife of a, of a dean out at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I can't think of her first name, but I remember that she was the first teacher I ever had a crush on.  I mean all the guys had a crush on her because she was gorgeous, you know.  And, and she was a heck of a good teacher too.  And I remember her very much.  And then there was Mr. Beasley, who, who taught gymnasium, but more than teaching gymnasium classes, he taught manhood classes.  He, he helped us understand that being a man had a lot more to do than with, than just being male.
Story_ID: 16808
Speaker 1: You were talking about Mr. Beasley, and the, not only teacher, but father figure and mentor he was in the lives of the young people at your high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: That's true.  He took a special interest in making sure, as I was saying that the young males knew that there was a difference between maleness and manhood.  And he never let us forget the kinds of things that showed manhood, and he was very effective in doing that.  Some of us needed it more than others, but he, he played no favorites.  The other person in, in, but--was our music teacher, Marcus Gunter.  I, I can't say enough about Marcus.  He, he was that way too.  I mean we were getting that message from him about manhood and maleness and excellence.  I mean he would not accept excuses for not being excellent.  If you came to his class, and you were unprepared in, in terms of not having practiced, you caught hell because he, he saw no excuse for that, you know.  So excellence was drummed into our heads in, in his class and also when we got in his band.  Another male teacher was, well, I can't think of his name right now, but he was a French teacher.  I very nearly got to be able to speak French fluently in high school because of this guy's influence in the classroom.  And, and I could tell you for a fact, when I became comfortable with my English, grammar, grammatical skills, I learned really in French class.  I, I, I learned the conjugations and what that all means, and I was able to take what I learned in French class, apply it into the whole English grammatical scene and, and, and that's why I attribute my--what little ability I have as an editor now, to what I learned in that French class, you know.  So Mr. Weed, I think was his name, yes.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like at your high school, as with the high schools of many of us during the era of segregation, there was not only good teaching, but nurturing and mentoring as well.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 16809
Speaker 1: Any particular courses you really were interested in other than journalism and music and it sounds like English, as well.  And, and what extracurricular activities did you participate in, if any, in high school, sir?
Speaker 2: To get to the first question first, I did, I did like biology.  I, that taught me about the little things that crawl around and those things that I have to be afraid of and not be afraid of and that kind of thing.  So I did like biology.  I liked the experiments and that kind of thing.  I also, I, I was never good at it, but I loved the woodworking class I took, you know, because again, that was about creating something, building something, you know, from scratch.  And I, I liked that.  I guess, I guess really--oh, and I'm sorry.  I, I meant to convey the fact that I loved French, I loved languages, still do (laughs).  I don't speak it anymore, 'cause, you know, you learn this French like I was doing, and you don't have anybody to talk to everyday, you start losing it.  So, and that, that, that hurt a little bit.  The other part of that question was--.
Speaker 1: Extracurricular activities.
Speaker 2: Extracurricular activities basically was the marching band, the concert band.  That really took a lot of time.  I mean a, a lot of people don't understand how much time a marching band--it, it takes as much time as practicing for football.
Story_ID: 16810
Speaker 1: Had you pretty much made up your mind that you wanted a career in journalism, and--at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes sir, I had because that's --when I went to college, that's what I started majoring in.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, of course, you knew you were going to college.  There was no doubt about that.
Speaker 2: Just where.  It was never a question of whether.
Speaker 1: Now, you finished high school at age sixteen, and headed off to college, and the year of your graduation from high school was?
Speaker 2: '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: '54 [1954], the year of 'Brown v. Board of Education'.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Which means that in spite--you had an excellent high school, but it was an excellent segregated high school.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you were prepared to, to matriculate at, at any college out there?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna, I'm gonna be very frank with you.  I didn't really know.  In those situations, I knew, I knew I had ability, but I also was listening to this other noise over here about what other people could do.  And it was always important to me to be able to test that, which is one of the reasons why, although I started out at an HBCU [historically black college-university] at Lincoln University [of Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri] in Missouri, I became a little anxious.  I wanted to test my wings, so actually, I transferred out of Lincoln my--after my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I started at [the University of Michigan at] Ann Arbor in Michigan.  That got to be a financial problem, so I had to go some place else, you know, after I took a first semester there really.  It was, it was--well, I have to back up and tell you a little bit, more about why, how I got the, to go to these schools.  But I decided to go on to Drake [University, Des Moines, Iowa], and it was at Drake when I knew for sure that I could compete against anybody, okay.  Now, to take you back a little bit, and this may help some people understand what was going on in those days, every year of my life in college, I had to reapply for a state-sponsored scholarship.  You may remember in those days that if you wanted to major in something, that the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] had, but the Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] didn't, the state would pay your tuition to go out of state to school.
Speaker 1: That--and why was that?
Speaker 2: Segregation.
Speaker 1: Segregation.
Speaker 2: They wanted to preserve segregation, but what they did is every year they made me prove that there was still segregation in Tennessee.  So I had to go through the process every year or applying to the University of Tennessee and getting turned down, and so (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: (laughs) My goodness.
Speaker 2: And so, well, what, what happened was, when I hit Michigan, even though the tuition was being paid, the room and board was way out of sight of what my parents could pick up, you know.  But Drake was okay.  And so that's why, that's why I ended up at Drake.
Story_ID: 16811
Speaker 1: Any opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, academic extracurriculum or athletic extracurriculum activities in college?
Speaker 2: In college, at, at Lincoln [University of Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri], I continued to play in the, in the band.  I was still into music there.  There were, as I recall, there was a campus newspaper that I worked for at Lincoln.  At [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], that one semester, I played in Michigan's band, which was a huge conglomeration at that particular point.  I tried to be part of the 'Michigan Daily', which was their student-run newspaper, but was turned down.  At Drake [University, Des Moines, Iowa], I again played in the band and was--I did not, I did not try for their newspaper, but I was just, it was just the band activity that I was dealing with there.
Speaker 1: All right.  Any other significant experiences from college that stick with you that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Some of them were negative.  I don't know if you want to get into--.
Speaker 1: If you have one you'd like to share.
Speaker 2: One of the things that happened to me over at Drake that, that, that taught me a lot--it didn't discourage me as some people might think, but I was in a reporting class, where you actually had to go out and report things and bring it back to class.  I remember very well that the lady who taught that class used to brag about being from Mississippi.  So, okay, I don't know why she keeps making a point of that, but that's all right; got to be from somewhere.  I was assigned to cover something, maybe a school board meeting or something that was meeting at night.  And I brought that back to her class the next morning.  The next day I saw that story in the 'Des Moines Register-Tribune' over, under her byline.  At that particular point in my life, I didn't know what to do about that.  So I let it slide, but that, that sticks out in my mind a great deal.  But that also said to me, 'cause it, it was, it appeared word for word; said, that said to me that I knew what I was doing (laughs), you know.
Speaker 1: Amen, exactly.
Speaker 2: So, so that, that, that gave me encouragement rather than discouragement, which is what I'm sure she meant to do.
Speaker 1: Sure.  And you graduated from Drake in nineteen--?
Speaker 2: '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 16812
Speaker 1: I did go to Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York] also for a master's degree, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and tell us about your experience at Syracuse and what year did you achieve your master's and in what area?
Speaker 1: I went to Syracuse, mid, mid-semester.  And that means I started in January as opposed to August or September.  And I was coming to, going to Syracuse from Atlanta [Georgia], the warmth of Atlanta, and I got to Syracuse, and there must have been twelve inches of snow on the ground.  And it, I'd never seen that before in my life.  And it, I had a lot of adjustments to do (laughs), so let's just put it that way.  But I was there on a mission, and that mission had a lot to do with the fact that by this time, my family's finances had improved, and my mother [Martha Marie Parrish] had promised that she would support through a master's degree.  But I know she could--I knew she could do it only about, maybe a year and a summer.  And so I had to get that master's after a year and a summer.  And I, and I was able to do that because I didn't get any sleep for one thing (laughs).  You know, I took a heavy load, and, but I learned a great deal.  I, I, and if you ask me who I remember at Syracuse, I will tell you, it is very simple, a guy named Byrd.  He was a research professor.  He taught research methods, and I got to tell you, that stands me in good stead today.  He taught us where to go to find almost anything you wanted to know.  Now, clearly things have changed now with the Internet and the computer and all that, but the basics he, he taught us were just fantastic.  And he was a very--and he was, we thought he was mean.  And it was, I can remember times when Byrd would load us up and say, I want a research paper on "XYZ" and I want it in two days.  Well--in the next class meeting, and, and we would say, "Well, you know, Dr. Byrd, we're also taking "XYZ" class."  He'd say, "Oh, really?"  And we'd say, "Yeah."  He'd say "Well, how long did you sleep last night?"  And we'd say maybe you got, we got maybe five hours.  He'd say, "You know, the problem with you guys is you sleep too much."  So we ended up, you know, while we were in his class, three hours of sleep was a good night's sleep, particularly, when, and when we took that part of is class that was in the summer.  And instead of doing research papers for every two, for, for every, for every week, we were doing them for every day.  I remember him very well (laughs).
Speaker 2: (laughs) All right, so you graduated from college, from Drake University in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: And yeah, you asked about the year at Syracuse.  I started at Syracuse, and I took a leave from the 'Atlanta [Daily] World' as I recall, in January of '61 [1961], and I think I came out of Syracuse in June '62 [1962].
Story_ID: 16813
Speaker 1: You graduated from Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York] in June of '62 [1962], and in the interim, you had begun your career in journalism.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was your first job, and what was it like--?
Speaker 2: My very first job--.
Speaker 1: --and where was it?
Speaker 2: --in journalism was in Buffalo, New York.  It was called the 'Empire Star'.  It was run by a fellow named A. J. Smitherman.  Mr. Smitherman, I, you know, I, I enjoyed what I did there because I learned something more than just writing and editing because at his paper, I had to do everything.  He had me going out selling ads.  There were days I came back in and had to help him run the, the, that old print press.  I learned to do that.  I learned to work a linotype machine, which was, you know, it used to be hot lead.  But Mr. Smitherman didn't pay me but once.  And I was there for three months, and now, it was fortunate that when I got there, some people who must have known about him took pity on me, and had me in a rooming house where the woman who ran the rooming house didn't charge me anything, particularly when I told her I wasn't being paid.  Well, after about another month and a half or two months of that, I, I decided that I was imposing on this woman because, you know, she, she's trying to make some money.  So I quit, and I went back to Nashville [Tennessee] with my tail tucked between my legs because I expected my mother [Martha Marie Parrish] to say, "I told you so" because she could never figure out how in the world I was gonna get a job in journalism.  She was, because she wanted me to be a teacher, but my mother, bless her heart, never said.  She never said, I told you so.  She just said, "What you gonna do?"  And I said, "Well, you know, I'm gonna send some letters out and with, with my resume and see what comes back."  So I, my sister [Naomi Louise Britton], with my sister's assistance, I sent out letters to at least 150 daily newspapers in this country.  I got only five responses.  Three of those five said, no.  One response came back--no, that wasn't from a daily.  The response that came back was from the 'Amsterdam News' in New York [New York], that was a weekly.  And the 'Amsterdam News' said, yeah, you can come on up, and we'll hire you, but we can only pay you twenty-five dollars a week.  And I said, New York, and twenty-five dollars a week.  I know this is just 1958, but gee, that sounds like a little bit of money.  So I turned that one down, and I turned down the 'Cleveland Plain Dealer' [Cleveland, Ohio] because they were offering less than that.  So I said to my mother, "I'm going to go on in the [U.S.] Army and just go on and see what happens in the Army and we'll go from there."  And she, she almost fainted cause she didn't want her, her baby boy going to the Army.  So she got on the phone--she, no, she made some inquiries around town.  And I don't know who she called, but the next I, I know she was on the phone calling C. A. Scott down here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And she told C. A. her story.  Her son was talking about going to the army.  He must be crazy, and he's tried everything he could.  He's a good boy, and the next thing I know, she had beaten C. A. into the ground, and C. A. finally said, well, send him on down.  We'll hire him.  So I got that job based on my mother's plea (laughs) and so, that's how it happened.  That's how it started.
Speaker 1: All right, and you worked for the 'Atlanta Daily World'?
Speaker 2: Correct, I worked there, except for the, the year or so that I was in grad school.  I worked there from '58 [1958] to '62 [1962].
Story_ID: 16814
Speaker 1: Any opportunity to interact with the political power structure in Atlanta [Georgia] during that time [while working for the 'Atlanta Daily World' from 1958 to 1962]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's--I came down to replace a fellow named Eddie Williams who was going at that point to Washington [D.C.].  Eddie ended up, of course, President of the Joint Center for Political Studies.  He just retired.  But at that point, he was going to accept a fellowship at the American Political Science Association, and I came down to take his place.  And it ended up that I was the only reporter that C. A. [Scott] hired.  So that meant that I had to cover everything, including politics, including the police department, the court--the, the local courts, the federal courts.  And that was a busy period in the federal courts with all the desegregation action, you see.  So, yeah, I got to, I got to interact with--and knew very well, Mr. Cochran, who was up at the [YMCA, Young Mens Christian Association], other names?  T. M. Alexander.  There was a heavyset, heavyset guy.  Oh, and I, and, of course, I got to know Mr. Dobbs.  He was the, he was the man, you know.
Speaker 1: John Wesley Dobbs?
Speaker 2: John Wesley, yeah.
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson's grandfather.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah.  And I just can't think of the name of the other guy who, who, who was really the person that used to go down and kind of negotiate with Mayor [William] Hartsfield and--.
Speaker 1: Was he a minister?
Speaker 2: No, he was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the, that's the interesting thing, and he wasn't a lawyer, well, humph.
Speaker 1: The opportunity will, will probably come again as we talk about it--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because the Civil Rights Movement is ongoing at this time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And here you are the only reporter in Atlanta--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the heart of the Civil Rights Movement.  Had--did you get a chance to interact with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] or any members of his family at that time?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, and my recollection is that King, he moved to Atlanta while I was with the Atlanta--maybe I was in graduate school when he first moved here, but when I came back, that was the--well, no, I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get it straight in my head.  I know that the student movement launched here in 1960, I believe, and I had covered that.  That was, that, that's how I got to know Lonnie King, who was really the leader of it, Benjamin Brown, Julian Bond, those were the, those were the three main ones that I really got to know.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so after covering--it's interesting though.  Even though I covered those guys, C. A. Scott would not let anything in his paper about the student movement.  So I was really covering it to keep up so I would know what was going on.  And what was happening was, at that particular time, Associated Press had reporters who were apparently afraid to come out into these mass marches where they thought there was gonna violence.  The Associated Press, having seen my byline in the, in the 'Atlanta Daily World' called me and asked me to cover it for them.  So I was--this was before they hired anybody black.  They, and, and I would send--I wouldn't send the story.  In, in those days, you'd pick up the phone, and you would dictate the story to somebody on the other end who would then type what you say.  So the stuff that I was dictating was coming out on the AP wire, but nobody had any idea who it was that was producing the information.  But it was me because I couldn't get it in the 'World', but I was getting it in the 'Associated Press'.
Speaker 1: Do you know why you were not able to get it, the story in the 'World'?
Speaker 2: Mr. Scott was extremely conservative.  He, he, I guess sincerely thought that a lot of news about the student movement would just upset the power structure in town.  And so he wanted to keep a lid on it.  Just a story, just to show you how he was.  The other guy that he mentioned as being interviewed, Paul Delaney, he came down here, and I think it was in '59 [1959].  That's when I got some help finally.  And Paul allowed himself to be interviewed for a "man on the street" interview that was done by what was then the 'Atlanta Inquirer' cause that had started up by then.  And Paul's comments supported the student movement, and I forgot the question, but the comment supported the student movement.  C. A. Scott called Paul to his office and told Paul he had to change, he had--and this C. A.'s words, these are C. A.'s words: "I'm a have to change our schedule".  And Paul said, "What does that mean?"  "Well, you can't work here anymore."  So he fired Paul for making those comments.  So that's how conser--he was, C. A. was so conservative.  He was the only black publisher that I know of in America that supported [Barry] Goldwater [in the 1964 presidential election] (laughs).  You know, and that was, that was, that was pretty conservative back in those days.  But it was, it was still an interesting experience there, yeah.
Story_ID: 16815
Speaker 1: From the 'Atlanta Daily World,' you went to 'Jet' magazine, is that correct?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  That had a lot to do again, with Bob [Robert] Johnson.  Bob was a, he was a loyal Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] man.  That's number one, but he was also loyal to anybody who had had his kind of experiences.  Bob had also preceded me at Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York].  And when I went to Syracuse and came back to Atlanta--well, I first came back to the 'Atlanta Inquirer' and then went back to the 'World'.  And Bob found out, he was reading my clippings, and he found out that I was Syracuse guy, and all that kind of thing.  Bob came looking for me, and that's how he, that's why I got the opportunity.
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement was really gaining momentum during the '62 [1962] through '66 [1966] era at 'Jet' magazine.  You left there and where did you go?
Speaker 2: When I left 'Jet'?
Speaker 1: In '66 [1966], yes.
Speaker 2: I went to Motown [Records].  No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  That's, that's not right.  In '66 [1966], I went to the Civil Rights Commission, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in, in, in Washington [D.C.].  And I went there basically because Carl Holman asked me to come.
Speaker 1: And from the Civil Rights Commission, what was your next assignment?
Speaker 2: Civil Rights Documentation Project.  That was the project that's now called the Ralph Bunche Civil Rights Documentation Project.
Speaker 1: Were you consciously focusing on jobs that caused you to be involved in some respect, as it relates to your profession, in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was conscious.  I wanted to make some kind of difference.  I wasn't sure--be very candid, I wasn't sure that I could deal with that nonviolence situation.  And I did not--I don't have temper, but I, I just never was sure that I could hold back if somebody spat on me or did whatever they, they were doing.  But I did want to make a contribution.  So I chose that route.  It, the documentation project was, to me, extremely important because I've always had a sense that history provides perspective.  And I also had a sense that nobody was going to do the history of these people that we were after the way we could do it on tape, and we knew for a fact that they were not gonna write their own.  And as it turns out, I don't know but maybe two or three guys who were actual participants in the Movement who have written books.  James Forman clearly has written several books.  I don't known any book Julian Bond has written.  I don't know anything that--and there was another lady who was key, a Ruby Doris Smith.  I don't think Ruby Doris made, wrote any books.  I don't, I know that, cause I was saying, Ella Baker didn't write any books, you know.  Martin wrote, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] wrote a, a bunch of books.  But he was a different kind of fellow than the kind of people we're talking about, but even though did interview--no, we never got to interview him because he got killed.  We were one week away from him when he got killed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are there other ways you felt you were contributing to the Civil Rights Movement by accepting the jobs you accepted during your earlier years?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, I, I knew--see, in my opinion, and some people may argue with this, but the black press in America was the Civil Rights Movement for years cause it was the black press that brought events that were happening to black people for black people, with black people or whatever, to public attention.  One example I can give you.  I was, had, no way involved with it, but I'll give you one example of how powerful the black press was at that time.  There was an apology recently for lynching that the Senate did, you know, in their cynicism.  But the thing that moved this country, in my opinion, to do something about that lynching, was the picture that 'Jet' had the courage to put in of Emmett Till.  That, that's, that was power.  And, and, and it was power for good.  And I wanted to be part of that.
Story_ID: 16816
Speaker 1: You were talking about the impact of the Emmett Till picture on America and the rest of the world.  Would you continue elaborate on that as well as the photographer, and or other, other people who worked with you on that and other stories during the Civil Rights [Movement] era?
Speaker 2: Okay, that, that, that story, of course, broke before--that picture happened before I got to 'Jet'.  So I was not a part of that.  I knew the people who were.  I knew the people who, who covered the trial and all that kind of thing.  But the impact it had on the nation was, it was just, it was tremendous.  I mean people who had willed themselves not to think about lynching or who had willed themselves not to think about black people at all, were suddenly awakened by, to the cruelty of what people are capable of doing in this country.  And I think that contributed to--somewhat at least, to people, other than black people becoming interested and doing whatever they could to ameliorate this, this hatred that was, they thought going on just in the South.  And so a lot of people, after that, began doing whatever they could do.  And I think things, several things were organized.  And the civil organizations were organizing--organized in the South that were not black.  But they were led by white people, and they became the leaders of efforts trying to, trying to do something about the racism in their communities.
Speaker 1: Certainly the Till picture was a significant experience as was events such as the March on Washington [D.C., 1963].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: What impact did that have on the nation and on your development as a young journalist?
Speaker 2: That, as a, as a young journalist it helped a great deal simply because it put--I was one of the people that was assigned the lead in the coverage for 'Jet' on that.  And that put me in closer contact than ever with the people, the leaders of that movement, some of whom I had never met before.  The, the key person--there were several key people, and I, I had, had no experience with Bayard Rustin, for instance.  He was sort of on the fringe all the while I was in Atlanta [Georgia] and most of the time I was in Chicago [Illinois].  And I'm sure you understand why because he was always accused of being a Communist.  And so he was never--until the March on Washington, allowed to emerge.  But I got to know him then, and, and his philosophy and the man is brilliant, you know, and a brilliant organizer.  I also got to know and admire A[sa]. Philip Randolph.  And I learned a lot of my history that I had really--even though I was covering the Movement, there were some things I'd missed.  For instance, I--everybody, and, and Lord knows [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] deserves a lot of credit for everything he did.  But he was not by himself.  In Montgomery [Alabama], Montgomery would have failed miserably if it were not for A. Philip Randolph.  And most people don't know what he was doing in the background.  It was labor money that kept that movement going.  It was labor money that kept the movement going in Birmingham, and labor money and Harry Belafonte and those people.  A. Philip Randolph was the, was the man, and, and, and that March on Washington also was labor money.  It was also labor momentum because it was A. Philip Randolph's idea to have the March on Washington in the first place.  So I was able to, to learn from him and also to cover him at the same time.  So as a, as a journalist, that, that was really a broadening of my whole perspective of what was going on.  It also--the impact on the, on the nation, I think it had a tremendous impact on black Americans simply because, well, it's not simple.  As you may recall that everybody was talking about violence, getting that many people together of color, it's bound to be violence.  There are, you, you just can't imagine the troops and the policemen on the streets in Washington at that particular time when we were coming in.  And no incidents happened that day.  And when that was broadcasts and the news got out of what was, what happened, and I, I think all of black America was so proud of themselves that it, it, and it made a, it made an impact where they thought--where we thought that we could do anything, you know.  And once you feel empowered, it's really difficult for other people to intrude in your brain and say what you can and cannot do.  And I think the March on Washington had a lot to do with changing a lot of black people's minds about what's possible.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other, some of your other young contemporaries who were growing up in their profession during times like the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: You mean reporters?
Speaker 1: Reporters, photographers and so forth.
Speaker 2: Okay, my recollection is that the people I saw on the streets during the Civil Rights Movement at that time included folks like Wallace Terry who is now deceased.  He went on to become--he was then with the 'Washington Post'.  And he went on to become, he went on to cover--he, he was their deputy bureau chief in Vietnam.  He covered the Vietnam War and wrote a book on black folks in Vietnam called, 'Bloods'.  So, Wally was on the streets, a guy named Larry Still was a hero really of mine because he worked with 'Jet' and he went to some of the most dangerous places.
Speaker 1: Was he a journalist or a photographer?
Speaker 2: He was a journalist with 'Jet'.  Photographers, Monetta Sleet, again, a heroic figure.  He won the--he was the black guy to win a Pulitzer Prize [in 1968] because the--well, I guess you know the story.  He was a pool photographer, and, and his stuff appeared with Associated Press, and therefore, he qualified for the Pulitzer.  There was a fellow down here in Atlanta [Georgia] named Harmon Perry.  He was a freelancer, and we used him quite a bit; a fellow named Ernest Withers over there in Memphis [Tennessee] who was also a freelancer.  And he--we used him quite a bit.  There was a--I said Larry Still, right.  A fellow named Alvin Adams who also is now deceased--Jesus, all these people are dead (laughter).  But he, Alvin did a lot of the coverage for 'Jet' in Selma [Alabama] and the, and the lead up to--the March on Selma.  He was, he was there on Edmund Pettis Bridge [Selma, Alabama] as I recall, and had to suffer seeing all of that.  Larry and I, well, Larry and I were alternating in Birmingham [Alabama], at first, and it just, it fell, it was--it just so happened Larry was there that Sunday that the church was bombed.  And I had been pulled back into Chicago that Friday.  And Larry was there for over the weekend, and then so Larry was a very important figure in the coverage.  Other newspapers, the--Chuck Stone was a name that has to be remembered for his coverage of the Civil Rights Movement.  I can't think of, I think Chuck may at that point have been the editor of the 'Chicago Defender', as I recall.  Believe it or not, well, I guess you can believe it, Gordon Parks was out there, particularly, particularly, during the era when there were riots, in the urban riots.  He was, he was, he was very much visible in taking the photos.  I can't think of this guy--Frank Dandridge is a name you may not have heard of.  But he was the husband of Gloria Dandridge, no, Gloria Richardson Dandridge out of Cambridge [Maryland].  He did a lot of photography for and with the civil rights people.
Story_ID: 16817
Speaker 1: While you and your colleagues were growing in your profession during the nonviolent civil, Civil Rights Movement, the Movement itself was being violently assaulted, and we witnessed the assassinations of Dr.[Martin Luther] King [Jr.], Robert Kennedy, President [John F.] Kennedy and so many others.  How did this personally--these assassinations and other acts of violence, personally and professionally affect you?
Speaker 2: President Kennedy's assassination affected me in a peculiar way.  Even though we were in the streets and knew what people were capable of, it never, ever occurred to me that somebody would pick up a gun and kill the President of the United States.  How did it affect me?  It let me know right then that there are domestic terrorists.  Everybody now--when I speak to people of a, of the other race about their reaction to Iraq [War], and they notice that I don't seem as agitated about it as they are, I just explain to them that I faced terrorism back in the '60's [1960s].  And so that, that assassination of President Kennedy, Kennedy taught me that it ain't safe in this country if folk don't like what you say.  So you really--or like what you do, so you really do have to watch your back all the time, and particularly when you're doing what we were doing, going into hostile territories and trying to get a story.  So, you know, we were still covering Birmingham [Alabama], you know, and I, you know, I knew when [Eugene] 'Bull' Connor was, you know, we, we knew that there was a possibility that every time we went there that we wouldn't come out.  And, you know, that assassination of President Kennedy is, is what put that on our, our brains, indelibly, you know.  King's, Dr. King's assassination was an extremely emotional affair for me.  I know that journalists are not supposed to be involved emotionally, but it was no way to avoid it.  The man--I, I, I can't say that I was his personal friend, but I, I knew him.  I've talked to him many times.  He was a man, he was a man of such brilliance, and I, I don't know his--he was brilliant.  It's no doubt about it, but, you know, he's a kind of man who had a memory.  If he met you--and, and this was the truth.  I, I first encountered him at the prison, you remember when the people in Georgia arranged for him to go to prison down, downstate?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Harmon Perry and I followed him down there, and, to get the story.  And that was the first time I met him.  When they brought him out of whatever vehicle they were taking him in, somehow or another I got close enough to him just to talk to him to find out how he felt, what he was thinking, what he was feeling.  And maybe it lasted for about three minutes.  Fast forward, that was when I was with 'Atlanta Daily World'.  The next time I really had a close encounter with King was probably, I was at 'Jet' by this time, and this was '62 [1962].  Now, this encounter I'm telling you about happened some time between '58 [1958] and '62 [1962].  I can't, I think it was around 1960 when they were trying to desegregate Richard's and all those places [stores] downtown, two years later, I encounter him one more time.  He calls me by my name, and he says, "John, how you doing?  How's your wife doing?"  So, you know, you got to have a feeling for a man who can, who can remember someone as insignificant as you are when he's met kings and princes and so his assassination was, was a, really--it took a hell of an emotion toll on me, and it also structured in me one more time, what's possible in, in, in this nation.  I was not in journalism at the time Bobby [Robert Kennedy] got killed because I was still at the Civil Rights Documentation Project, preparing to come back to 'Jet'.  And I remember where I was that, then, and this is important, I think.  Channel 5 in Washington [D.C.] is now a Fox news channel.  And I had gone there just because I had, had some crazy notion in my head that maybe I want to try TV, in TV news before coming back to the print side.  I wanted to see what it was like on the TV side.  So I had an appointment that day to see the, the news director at Channel five.  They put me under a situation like that and asked me to do some reading of the news so they could see if I knew how do the reading thing.  And I did that, and they had no problem with the way I read the news, but the guy told me he couldn't hire me.  And I said, well, why?  And he, actually, he told me that we don't have enough lighting to make you show up on TV.  And I said, ah, okay (laughs).  Well, they took me back to the office and no--and that's when I found out that, that Kennedy had been assassinated because for some reason I had an early appointment, and I had not read the newspaper, and I had not turned on the news.  I had no knowledge that he had been assassinated.  And they told me right there that he had been assassinated, and then they said, we need some reaction from some prominent black people.  Do you have the phone number for Coretta [Scott] King and Martin Luther King and those people?  I said, yeah, I got them.  Well, would you share them with us?  Wait a minute, you just turned me down for a job and you want to pick my brain?  You got to be crazy (laughter), you know.  But, so, anyway, I--that's why I remember that.  And, but I was not in journalism, and I, I did not, I did not react to Bobby's assassination quite the way I did his brother, although I was, I was a great admirer of his, and I think if he had survived, he probably would have been one hell of a president.  But that didn't impact on me as much as the other two that we just talked about.
Story_ID: 16818
Speaker 1: Would you share with us other encounters you may have had with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] or other significant civil, civil rights leaders of the era?
Speaker 2: One of the reasons we got to know King well was because when I worked at 'Jet,' there was a little soul food restaurant right down the street, where you had to go down the steps.  And I think it was, as I recall, it was called Ethel's or something.  And Dr. King, as everybody knew, loved soul food.  So, you know, we knew what time he was there, so we would go down there and just, just hang out and just bull, just shoot the jive with him, and got to know him on a very personal level, as opposed to this great leader, you know; got to know some of the warts and, you know, he was very open, honest guy.  So we knew, as reporter, I mean Larry [Still] and Alvin [Adams] and I, we knew him real well, as a, as a human being, as opposed to just a leader.  I remember when he, he was out at Cicero in Illinois, and he--and you've probably seen the film of him ducking.  Well he, when we encountered him after that at Ethel's one more time--I think that's the name of the place, he, he, he was human enough to acknowledge that he was scared.  You know, and he thought death was upon him at that very time.  And he just acknowledged that, you know.  And he said, I, I wish you guys wouldn't print that because it might have an effect that I don't intend.  But he was, he was scared.  Another thing he did that impressed me, when he first came to Chicago [Illinois] with the Movement.  A busload of kids came by from an elementary school to, to welcome Dr. King to the neighborhood.  You may remember he decided to stay in an apartment on, on the West Side of Chicago that was in a slum area.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, these kids came by, and he found out from talking to the kids that most of the kids in, on that side of town in that neighborhood had never been to the Loop, which is downtown, and the Loop is no more than ten minutes away.  They had never left their neighborhood to go to the Loop.  King and 'Andy' [Andrew] Young talked about that, and they decided to rent three buses and load those buses up with the kids and take them all over the city so they could see Chicago.  That's the kind of dude he was (laughs).  Now, the other people that I've, I had experience with, Jim Farmer, who used to head CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  I didn't know him all that well, but did get to interview him several times, the last time of which was when I was with the Civil Rights Documentation Project.  Interesting, on the--I think my interview with him may have been on the day that Dr. King got shot cause I recall having one interview in the morning, and then every interview I had in New York the rest of the day cancelled.  And I couldn't figure out what in the world was going.  I was getting all these cancellations, and the people knew I was coming.  And then I walked back to the New York Hilton [Hotel] where I was staying at the time, got in the elevator, and everybody in the elevator just froze.  And I'm saying, what's wrong with these people?  And I go up and turn on the TV and he's dead.  And that's how I found out about it.  But then I got to go--know, Floyd McKissick who was also with CORE, I, now, I got to know Roy Wilkins real well too because it ended, Roy had tried to hire me.  He tried to get me from the Joint Center for Political Studies.  He was trying his best to get me to New York.  He, he offered a, he offered a decent Atlanta, Georgia salary, but I, I've always been afraid to live in New York on less than six figures (laughs), even in those days, you know.  So I, I, I didn't work for him, but we talked a lot.  So I got to know him, and he was a very, very bright man, extremely sincere about what he was doing.  He did not in my opinion understand what was happening to him during that activist period.  He didn't quite pick up on that.  Whitney Young, I learned, I got to know here, and once he went to the National Urban League.  And so I can, I can almost say, except for, except for Roy Wilkins, I--I can almost say that I met everyone of those guys here in Atlanta, 'cause Atlanta was the crossroads for everything, you know.  John, yeah, well, of course, I know John Lewis cause they were right here, and, and Julian Bond.  When I, when I got to 'Jet', I used to hear from Julian almost every week.  So we got sort of a bond, you know.
Story_ID: 16819
Speaker 1: In 1968, you went back to work for 'Jet' magazine and remained there for three years?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Then on to Motown [Records] from '71 [1971] to '73 [1973].  I can imagine that experience was quite different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you share with us your experience at Motown?
Speaker 2: Motown, it was an experience.  It, it, if, if I had not been young then, I probably wouldn't have taken that, you know.  But it, it came a point, and, and I want to explain this thoroughly 'cause I don't want to cast any (unclear) on Mr. [John H.] Johnson, there came a point when I had a family and had to have my money.  Well, there's no way in the world that we could, I could--I was on Mr. Johnson's list.  He had, Mr. Johnson, has a funny way of managing.  He had a list of people that he did not want to lose.  And he kept, he kept it on his desk and looked at it every day.  And he, I was on that list, fortunately.  But he didn't--I, I went back in '68 [1968] as managing editor of 'Jet' magazine then.  And, and I wanted to do that because I wanted to have more impact on things that were gonna be covered.  That worked for a while, but then he started going into this entertainment business.  He'd have entertainers on the cover, and all that.  And that's really one of the reasons I left, but the main reason I left had to do with the fact that I was making only 18,000 [dollars] a year, as managing editor.  And he would not consider a raise.  I had no idea why, but I went to Motown and increased my salary by 50 percent.  But having done that and having worked at Motown, I now know that you should not do anything just for money, and I'll explain that one, in a minute.  But Johnson could not come up with the raises that all of us needed and wanted because he was saving money to buy that new building, to, to build that new building that he has on South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And you say, well, why does he need to save money?  He had to save money because no financial institution in America would have loaned him the money to build that building in downtown Chicago.  If he wanted to build it on the South Side.  They got all the money in the world for him.  Nobody would lend him money, so he had to pay cash for that building.  So he didn't have any money to go to waste.  I think if I had known that then, I may have hung in there a little while longer because after he got the building built, and after he furnished it, again, with a lot of his own cash, two or three years later, he, he took care of everybody, you know, but I couldn't wait (laughter), you know, cause, you know, things were catching up with me, you know.  But I went to Motown as the publicity manager.  I first started out in Detroit [Michigan].  I was lured there by a fellow named Junius Griffin.  I had known Junius when he worked at the 'New York Times,' and he also worked for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] as, as a director of public relations for SCLC.  And so he said that he needed help at--and he wanted an assistant.  So I went to Detroit.  Well, I should have known to turn around and go back the first day 'cause when I got to Detroit, I announced myself and the--and Junius wasn't there.  He was in the California office.  I announced myself, and the people said, who?  And they took me to the human resources--well, it was called personnel then.  They took me to the director of personnel, whose name was Al Brown.  And I told Al my story, that Junius had hired, hired me, and, and, you know, I had left my house back in Chicago and moved my family to Detroit, and I'm here.  And Al said, I don't any--he's the director of personnel.  He said, "I don't have any paperwork saying you coming."  So he gets on the phone and he calls, tries to run down Junius.  And he runs down Junius' boss, whose name was Al Roshkin (ph.), and Roshkin knew that Junius had talked to me, but had no idea Junius had hired me because Roshkin took the position that Junius can't hire nobody.  He had to do the hiring.  He was the vice president.  I should have gone that day, but I hung around.  And I did everything I could to be a good publicist after they finally got all that straight.  I got an office and went to work.  My job was to provide as much positive publicity I could for the acts that were still based in Detroit and to arrange opening day events.  In other words, when they got, get ready to open at the Ellenwood Casino over there in [Windsor, Ontario] Canada, for instance, I had to take care of all the logistics, invite all the trade press and, and all the people who ought to be there to see this great opening act for the Temptations or the Supremes or, no, I never worked with Stevie [Wonder], but the groups, you know.  So I, I was doing that in Detroit, and I did it fairly well.  I finally got [Berry] Gordy's attention because he was at--when I was there, he was making this movie, 'Lady Sings the Blues,' and he was out on the location somewhere and wanted something that--he wanted a book.  That's what he wanted.  And his people called at 9:00 p.m., and I just happened to be there at 9:00 p.m. at the office.  And Mr. Gordy had to have this book for, for the shooting that he was gonna do, it's starting at five o'clock the next morning.  You got to get the book.  I said, "Well, where am I supposed to get that book?"  And they said, "That's your problem, 9:00 p.m."  So I called some people I happen to know at the library.  They had the book, but the library is not open at 9:00 p.m.  So I had to prevail upon whoever it was that was a library director to please open up for me and give me the book.  She did.  Then the question is, how in the world I'm gonna get to California.  I called the airport--well, after I got the book, it was now around 11:00 or 12:00 at night.  No more planes flying to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] from Detroit.  Any going from Chicago?  No.  So I took it upon myself to use the company's credit card, and I chartered a flight, took the book out there.  I told the people I was coming, where it was gonna land.  I took the book out there on the charter flight, gave the people on the other end the book and took the charter flight back to Detroit, and even though that cost a fortune, Mr. Gordy thought that the, the best thing since sliced bread 'cause, you know, he knew he'd asked for something impossible.  And he was accustomed to people saying they can't do it.  And instead of me saying that, I just went on and did what could be done, even though it cost him a lot of money.  So that got his attention.  So in a few more weeks after that, I was being--I was called out to L.A. to work out there 'cause that's where Gordy was.  And he wanted me to be, not only Junius' assistant, but he wanted me to assist him in a, and, and when people ask the company for money, he wanted me to assist him in understanding whether or not he should give money to this group or that group or whatever.  So that was also part of my job in California.  But what, what caused me pause, is before I went to Motown out in California, somebody got killed on his estate.  And that was never reported in the newspaper.

Speaker 1: The Vietnam [War] affect, affected Motown [Records] in terms of the music, the hit, I might say, hit music that came out of Motown that was very much anti-war.  You may recall Marvin Gaye's famous album, "What's Going On".  That was all about, you know, questioning the, the wisdom of Vietnam.  There was another producer at Motown named Norman Whitfield, who was less well known, but a very rich man these days because of the music he wrote for the Temptations, you know.  And the Temptations had the song called--no, maybe it wasn't the Temps.  But one of the, one of the groups had a song called 'War', "What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing".
Speaker 2: Edwin Starr.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Edwin Starr, and I believe that either Edwin wrote it and, and Norman [Whitfield] produced it or, or vise versa.  I know Edwin sang it, yeah.  But that kind of music began to become extremely popular.  And it also--and Stevie Wonder started also writing some music that could be really interpreted as anti-war.  That had an impact on the population, particularly, the youth population.  And I think it made Mr. [Berry] Gordy nervous, but it was bringing in the money.  So, you know, I don't Gordy ever turned his back on the dollars.  So he had to put up with the creat--the creative aspect that was making that money.  So, and particularly, you know, they were dead set against Marvin doing what he did, but once that album, which was probably one of the first, what they called, concept albums.  And there's a strain that goes through every song on album.  And that album just went through the roof in terms of sales.  And then, of course, what the Temptations were doing with Norman Whitfield's music and also anti, anti-war, was also selling very well.  So, it had an impact on the company's bottom line, but it had a greater impact in my mind, on the people's feelings about the war.  Base--people hear from lyrics to music than they do on, on, from news, particularly, young people.  So it had an impact.

Speaker 1: In 1973, you returned to an academic assignment at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies [Washington, D.C.].  Would you comment on your experience there and the contribution you made to the, the movement?
Speaker 2: Okay, the--by that time, the general consensus was that the new Civil Rights Movement was in politics.  By that time, the Voting Rights Act [1965] had passed and there were people being elected to offices in the South who were inexperienced at doing what they are supposed to do in these offices.  The very first mission of the Joint Center was to provide technical assistance to assist these new black sheriffs and council people and mayors to understand what their job is.  And so the Joint Center had conferences, seminars, all over the country to--and brought in experts to help these people understand what to do on a day, on a daily basis, how to, how to deal with budgets, all that kind of thing.  So my particular job at the time had to do with publicizing the Joint Center.  I was also editor of a publication they had called 'Focus,' which was an additional, as I recall, it was a, it was an additional force that helped these elected officials understand what they needed to do, what the policies were, that coming down from the federal government that impacted upon the local level.  So, yeah, we had, we, we had--that, in our opinion, was the next phase of the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 16822
Speaker 1: It was back to the '[Washington] Post' in '76 [1976], the 'Washington Post'.  You're moving from the field to academics to Motown [Records], back to the field, diversified career.  What was your experience like at the 'Washington Post'?
Speaker 2: At the 'Post', it was frustrating because--well, two reasons.  One was I went there on the business side as opposed to the editorial news side.  But I thought if I could get my foot in the door, I could finally gravitate over to the news side.  It didn't quite work out that way.  And that was sort of disappointing, but the other, other disappointment that even on the, even if I had settled in as a, as a public--what was it?  Public relations manager, I think it was called there, the, the opposition to anything having to do with public relations was just massive.  Benjamin Bradlee who was the executive editor of the 'Washington Post' had the feeling that they had all the public relations they needed, they say every time a newspaper hits the porch in the morning, that's all the public relations we need.  So whatever kind of project that we came up with to, to help the name of the 'Washington Post', he would, he would say, we don't need it.  And so that became frustrating, and even though we had a vice president, the vice president we had was no match in power, in house, with Bradlee.  So the, really, the only thing we got to do that was really awesome, and everybody in the place said so, and we got credit, was when the 'Post' celebrated, I think it was its hundredth anniversary, and we really put on a show for everybody in-house and, and in town.  And they began to see a little bit what public relations can do in that regard, but then Bradley's end point was that we only do that every hundred years, so we don't need those guys.  Well, I saw the handwriting on the wall, so I just, I decided to get out and go somewhere else.  And I ended up at the University [of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 16823
Speaker 1: And you were there for a significant period of time.  How long were you at the University of--that's the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Of Columbia, right.  I was there, my recollection, now, let me see.  I went in '78 [1978] and stayed until '97 [1997], nineteen years.
Speaker 1: All right, what were some of your achievements and what are your recollections of the, your experience at the University of D.C.?
Speaker 2: The University of D.C. was an amalgamate--was a consolidation of three colleges into one university.  So everything had to be done, would, had to be done from the ground up, so that was an exciting--to me, period.  Everything needed to be done for the university now.  And you had to forget about these colleges.  Well, breaking through--.
Speaker 1: What were those three colleges?  Before--?
Speaker 2: The three colleges were Federal City College, Washington Technical Institute and D.C. Teachers College, okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And breaking through the loyalties that people had for those three institutions and making them loyal to one institution was a, was a challenge that we faced, and that we kind of overcame; building a brand for the university as opposed to those three college was challenge that we, that we took on.  And I think we succeeded.  I think everybody knows now, the UDC.  We came up with a slogan that even the mayor started picking and using all over the city, UDC, the smart choice.  Those were the kind of successes that we had.  We had some terrible publicity every once in a while.  Any time somebody went to the press and said something bad about the UDC, you'd--the papers would print it.  Then they would come to us and get a comment for a second-day story.  Well, that, that's not right (laughter).  So, but we finally overcame that simply through personal relationships.  And so I, I'm, I'm glad to say that my--the people on the staff I worked with and I were able to over come that, you know.  And it still does not have a, the stellar reputation that many people want it to have, but it's, it's gonna get there.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the administrators and faculty who were responsible for the success of UDC?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first persons that helped with the success is a person that people in Atlanta [Georgia] might know.  His name was Lyle Carter.  He was the, he was the president of Atlanta University Center [Atlanta, Georgia] for, for a while.  So Lyle C. Carter, put the university, the consolidated university on its feet.  And he chose to serve only one term.  I think he chose to serve four years, and then he went to a law firm and make a lot of money, and then retired.  The other person who was influential on UDC at a time when it needed help was Tilden LeMelle, who was out of New Orleans [Louisiana], but he comes from a family of educators.  And this is a man who knew higher education thoroughly.  He knew exactly what it needed.  He, he was very strong, perhaps too strong because he, he was not as political--and when I say, not political for Washington.  The Washington politics is different from politics anywhere else in this country, and--because there are so many levels that you got to deal with when you're in a position like him.  He had to deal not only with the city, but with the federal people and anybody in between.  But he pretty much, skillfully did that, except that he, some of his commentaries were kind of strong, and, and, and, and rubbed some people the wrong way.  But he was an extremely productive man, and he, he helped UDC along.  Those two, are the very first one that I worked for and the very last one that I worked for, probably were the most influential, in my opinion, on UDC.
Speaker 1: Having stayed there nineteen years, apparently there are some, some real good memories.  Would you care to highlight one of the more pleasant memories or one of your more significant accomplishments before we move to Bowie State [University, Bowie, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Ah, pleasant memories.  There are many actually, but I, I think that probably one of my most pleasant memories was, from my experience there, had to do with the fact when, that we finally got a real budget to do marketing for the institution, to establish a brand, I mean something that people will not forget.  That's where "UDC, the smart choice", came out of that campaign.  And we ran that campaign for two years, and I can tell you that after those two years, there was nobody in that area who was not familiar UDC and what it had to offer.  So I, I, you know, I'm, I'm proud of that, and I, and I think that, that is one of the greater accomplishments we got there.  I, I guess that's, that's the .
Speaker 1: From UDC, it was on to Bowie State for a short stint.  Any recollection of--?
Speaker 2: State had that, well, what happened at UDC is because of some very severe budget cuts that the city imposed on us.  There was a reduction in force at UDC on the administrative side that, that took out all--about forty percent of the adminis--of the administration.  And I, I was caught up in that.  So I had to find a home real quick real quick cause I had a family again.  So I had some contacts over at Bowie State, and I, I prevailed upon them to introduce me to the president over there.  And he hired me.  I'd never really had any intent of staying.  Bowie State is a, in my opinion, is an institution that can't really find an identity simply because of where it's located.
Speaker 1: And where is that?
Speaker 2: It's located in a, in a suburban town, a Washington suburban area called Bowie.  And it, it, you know, even just in terms of pure publicity, the ['Washington] Post' doesn't claim it in their circulation area.  The 'Baltimore Sun' doesn't claim it for their circulation area.  So trying to even get information out through the traditional media is just impossible.  So, you know, I knew that that it was, that was a, that was booked for failure.  So, you know, as soon as I got to Bowie State, I started sending my resume out to, to other people.

Speaker 1: It seems that hometown Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennesssee]--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --answered your call.  And you are where you started in life, back home in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah, I--.
Speaker 1: What are you, what are your--what's your title there, and what do you do and--?
Speaker 2: The job title is assistant to the president.  And as I tell people, I do whatever he says (laughter).  But more than, more than anything else, I do executive communications like speech writing, preparing him for testimony before official bodies.  Also, the main thing that I'm supposed to be doing and if he ever gives me a chance to work on it in a long, in a long period of time, is I'm compiling and doing the research to do a book on Meharry Medical College, that will, that--it's, there have been books written, but people have written those books out of sort of self interest, where they became the star.  What he wants me to do is do the story of Meharry, with all the anecdotes of all, and all the heroic things that happened in the past because Meharry would not have lasted if, if a whole bunch of people hadn't made a lot of sacrifices.  And so we're picking that up from historical documents, from collections that people have left to Meharry.  So it's my job to try to pull all that together into a book.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea when such a book may written and published?
Speaker 2: I ask him that all the time, and when he's gonna leave me alone on doing these day projects so that I can get to that full time.  If I have, if I have a good six months to complete the total research, and another six months to write, it'll be done, whenever that happens.
Story_ID: 16825
Speaker 1: You've been at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] since 1998, and you spent nineteen years at University of D.C. [District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and you've had various assignments in the media, throughout the country.  And throughout that time, we've been changing the way we write.  Technology has really taken giant steps in the last several years.  How has that impacted your career as a journalist, as an administrator at the college level and as an academician?
Speaker 2: In writing these days, it's, it's so convenient to have this thing called an Internet.  I can now write something that the president may need.  And some time it's a speech or sometimes it's an, doing a profile on him for, for a presentation to a magazine.  But all you have to do now is, is, is hit Google.  If you, if you need some research on, on one thing that, that you, a fact that you need in order to complete this profile you're doing.  You hit Google, and you put something in there that, that you need and it pops up (snaps finger), you know.  And it's, it's, it's just amazing.  Now, if you're not careful that kind of thing can make you lazy, but (laughter), but it's, if you take care with that and do it properly, it, it's a, it's a, it's a hell of a resource, a hell of a tool.  And it helps you, at least me, it has helped me be more productive.  I can remember in the old days, you know, when if you, if you wrote something today, and you went back tomorrow and looked at what you wrote today, and you said, gee, that's crap, you know, I mean, that, I don't know why I wrote that, you would have to start all over again.  But now with the technology that we have, you can just cut and paste and, and, and just make it better.  And that's, that's a useful tool.
Story_ID: 16826
Speaker 1: Contemporaneous with your other jobs, you have continued a career, at least until '95 [1995] as a speech writer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Additionally, you've done writing, editing and consultant work for the [U.S.] Department of Labor.  You served as a columnist.  You've written for various magazines.  You've reviewed books.  In addition to your own initiative and the advances of technology, what else do you attribute your ability to do of these things in, in one lifetime?
Speaker 2: I guess I have to attribute that to just curiosity.  I just want to--first of all, I've always wanted to know everything.  And once I get the knowledge, I want to do something with it.  So I guess that's a main motivator right there, just wanting to do something with this knowledge that I pick up along the way.  And one thing I'm doing right, I also like to have--I also would like to influence what the public sees.  I'll give an example of that, what's not on there is something I'm doing right now.  It's called the Neiman Watchdog Project.  It's a project by the Neiman [Foundation for Journalism] fellows people out of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They came up with the notion that reporters these days with daily newspapers are not asking all of the right questions.  They, they miss stories and all that.  Well, what they have asked me to help them do, particularly from a black perspective, is to put stuff up on their website that's--instructs reports of what they ought to be covering.  So I'm able to do that.  I, I submit probably one, one item per month on that.  And they, and, and everything I've sent them so far has made the cut.  So I like being able to do that because at least a couple of those things have generated some coverage.  And it's almost like being a, a managing editor of the whole press.  And, and I like that simply because there were so many in the press that wouldn't hire me in the old days because of what I look like.
Speaker 1: If you had a choice, would you choose a different career path?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't.  I, I tell you, and when people ask me, for instance, about 'Jet', and, and I got to tell you that I've had several jobs where if somebody would feed me, I would have worked for free.  I literally liked what I was doing at 'Jet' so much that I would have worked for free, if I could get some food for myself and for my family, you know.  But it, it's, you know, it's, it was that kind of passion that all of us really had and, at the time we were there.  It was, it was more than just a job.  It was, it was a passion.  I, what, what we were doing at the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.], at that particular time, was, was a passion.  What I did with the Civil Rights Documentation Project was a passion.  No, I wouldn't change it.  I, I don't think I'd change a thing.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: I want to direct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on Beethoven's 'Ninth [Symphony'].
Speaker 1: I think you can do it, sir.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That is, that is one of those dreams I have, you know, (laughter).
Story_ID: 16827
Speaker 1: As we enter our final questions, let me just ask, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community, sir?
Speaker 2: I hope that the African American community will come to understand the impact that politics has on every single thing in life.  It has everything to do with who get wealthy and who doesn't.  It has everything to do with everything.  And for people to continue saying that they don't vote because it doesn't make any difference, to me is crazy.  One of the few people that I know of who had, who's trying to make people, who are trying to make that argument, and I know a lot of people don't like them, is [Rev.] Jesse Jackson.  He is trying to show people that folks who have the surname of Rockefeller, who have the surname of, of, all the robber barons of, of, of the past, who have, people who still, Harrimans, they got wealthy because of contacts and contracts from government.  Now, politics decides all of that.  I mean they didn't, those things didn't come to them because they didn't know politicians, and they didn't vote.  So if it's true for them, what makes us think it ain't gonna be true for us?  So I would, if, if I had my way and had a magic wand, I would try and make black Americans think on those things.  And I, I'm not one to tell people what to do, but just think about that.  And if you come to a logical conclusion, and the conclusion I think is logical, then go do something about it.
Speaker 1: As you look back on your life, what really stands out the most?
Speaker 2: That's a open-ended question (chuckle).  To me the, I'll have to use the title of Cornel West's book, the thing in America that stands out most is that 'Race Matters'.
Speaker 1: Race matters.
Speaker 2: And it's a, it maybe shouldn't, but it does, and it's a constant--and one of the things I would have--if I had a magic wand, help the young generation of black Americans to think about is that some of the stuff that their parents went through may have disappeared, but that there are still challenges that have to do with race, race matters.  And they can turn their back on that fact if they want to.  They can succeed economically if they want to.  They can open their own--be entrepreneurs and, and, and if they want to, but at some point in their life, race matters, and they'd best get some intellectual muscle to figure out how to deal with it because it's coming at them, no matter what.

Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important and why?
Speaker 2: What advantage?
Speaker 1: What values do you consider to be most important and why?
Speaker 2: Honesty, honesty clearly because I have--I would have real difficulty dealing with anybody whose word doesn't mean anything.  So honesty is a value that I, I put a lot of stock in that.  Integrity, if, if you've made a mistake, say you have and say how you gonna fix it.  Don't deny that you made a mistake.  Loyalty, not the kind of loyalty that you see these days in Washington [D.C.] where people continue to employ folk who have screwed up.  But loyalty, the kind of loyalty that you expect from people who, who are your friends; the kind of loyalty that, that, that used to be, it used to be routine.  If someone did something for you that is positive, you would certainly never do nothing to hurt them negatively.  In deed, if there was nothing you can do for them personally, then you do something for their kids.  Loyalty.

Speaker 2: That he tried hard to be as decent a human being as he possibly could; that he was a good father and a good husband.
Speaker 1: What message or lesson do you have for your children, grandchildren and the world?
Speaker 2: Lessons?  If I could I would teach the lesson of, whatever you do, be it being a musician, being a janitor, whatever it is, do it to the best of your ability.  Don't be a slacker, ever.  That's the, that's one lesson.  I, I would like to be able to teach them the lessons that revolve around those values that I just you a minute ago.  For the world, if, if, if I could--I tell my wife all the time when I come out of movies that are showing the violence and war, and it makes no sense to me.  I mean I sit up and look at it at the movies.  Then I, then I read the newspapers and read about it.  And if I could, I would just take the world and shake it and say, "Don't you get it?  War doesn't do anything".  You can't make anybody do anything by fighting them and defeating them.  All they'll do is wait for a chance to get you back.  And that's counterproductive.  So if I, if I had the power, I would stop war.

She was born in Orangeburg.  She came in--out of an academic family.  Her father used to teach at the, South Carolina State.  And it's a very strong family out of, out of Orangeburg.

Speaker 1: We talked earlier about how you wanted to be remembered, but if I can ask a similar question and just ask what do you want your legacy to be?  Would you respond to that?
Speaker 2: On the, on the professional side, I would certainly hope that I have left behind a body of written material that might be looked upon and might help somebody down the line.  I, I chose to do everything I've done in writing as non-fiction because I think facts are extremely important, in shaping, not only the present, but the future.  So I would hope to, the short answer is that I'd hope to be able to leave a body of work behind that I've done that might have some influence on how somebody feels about themselves, about their culture.

Speaker 1: Do you have any suggested titles that you would commend to others entering your field that you have published or that you have read that significantly influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing, again, I would, I would point to the early editions of 'Focus' magazine that was published by the Joint Center for Political [and Economic] Studies [Washington, D.C.].  I would, it's not written, but the, the, that body of work at the Civil Rights Documentation Project, which is at the Spingarn Library [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center] at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I would recommend that people look at those things because even--it doesn't involve necessarily things that I've done, but it involves some very important people and what they did.  Basically, those, those two things right now.  I, I would recommend some of the stuff I did, even at 'Atlanta [Daily] World,' but I'm not sure anybody can find that.  I don't know to what extent the 'Atlanta World' has an archives.  But I worked hard down here in Atlanta [Georgia], and I'd, I'd--I did some stories in Atlanta that, that got some people freed from, from the whole criminal justice system and got some people who were guilty put in, you know.  But I think they were all fair and I would, I would, I would suggest that people look at that.
Speaker 1: In addition to the history of Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], can we look forward to any additional titles from you in the future?
Speaker 2: I hope, and, you know, I have, I have resisted people, people who have said that I needed to write down what I have done.  And I resisted that because it seemed to arrogant to me, but I came to do this because, you know, it's flattering, and, you know, I'm, I'm happy to do it.  But, you know, I'm now at the point of thinking that maybe, maybe some of the experiences I've had, at least those experiences, not in my life, not me, but experiences I've had, may be of some value, and I might just try and do a memoir kind of work that focuses on what I have seen and people I have met and what they did and, and, hopefully, that'll work.

Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: If you don't know where you've been, you can't possibly know where you going.  And so history gives perspective.  If one knows history, one can deal with the presence, with--with the present with a nuanced approach, as opposed to a absolutism.  But basically, it gets back to those, the thing I just said in the beginning, "if you don't know where you've been, you can't know where you're going."
