Speaker 1: My name is [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Today is November 9, 2016.  We are in Harlem, New York [New York].  And sir, would you please tell us your name, spell it for us, tell us your birth date, and what you do?
Speaker 2: My name is Michael Cummings [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], M-I-C-H-A-E-L.  My middle initial is Arthur, A-R-T-H-U-R, and the last name is Cummings, C-U-M-M-I-N-G-S.  And I was born November 28, 1945.  And--
Speaker 1: What do you do?
Speaker 2: I'm a quilter, among other things.  In the past, I was an arts administrator.  I worked in a variety of New York cultural organizations.  But my claim to fame has been a quilt maker.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 669138
Speaker 1: So we'll start with what we call People magazine type questions, easy ones.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, as an artist, I've been thinking about that, and I really don't have one particular color.  I grew up in California, and especially Southern California, where everything was multi colors, even Christmas trees, so I (laughter) didn't have one color.  Although I was thinking a few stand out: yellow, red, blue, maybe sort of shades of blue turquoise, so, but just bright colors.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, ooh, I don't really have a favorite food either.  I like a lot of fruits and vegetables.  I don't eat a lot of meat.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I've just kind of backed away from pork and beef, so.  I used to love desserts, cream pies and--but I've kind of backed away from those, so not one particular food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, again, growing up in California, there wasn't seasonal changes, so I really felt warm all year round, and it was green all year round.  It took three years for me to adjust to New York [New York] season changes (laughter), because I said, "What are all these dead trees around for, no green leaves?"  But now I do enjoy the seasons, and each one is very unique.  So I can't favor one over the other, because even though I'm not a snow person, I do appreciate how it covers the ground, and it looks so nice and light, and it sort of muffles the sound.  And looking out the window at it is beautiful, so I--
Speaker 1: Especially on the first day (laughter).
Speaker 2: On the first day (laughter).  I do have to shovel it as a homeowner, but I've gotten used to that also.
Speaker 1: Good.  How about vacation destinations?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I say I like to travel, and I've sporadically done that.  This past April I went to four countries starting with India to (tape interruption) (unclear) went there first, and then we went to Switzerland, to the Matterhorn.  And then in between that, we stopped off in Dubai [United Arab Emirates] and spent a few days there.  And we ended up in Milan, Italy, for a few days before we came back to New York.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 2: And so that was one trip.  And then in prior years, I've been to China, Japan, and Egypt, and Bahia in Brazil.
Speaker 1: Wow. Did you see the gold church in Bahia [Sao Francisco Church and Convent, Salvador, Brazil]? (Tape interruption) (Unclear) and inside, kind of unbelievable (laughter).
Speaker 2: I didn't see that. And we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have to go back (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well when I was there, the, the dollar was like, you got four of theirs for one of ours, and that was years ago.  I--
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  One of them is that, this too shall pass.  I, I love that phrase.  I put a lot of faith and hope in that.  And when I've been in troubled times, in terms of just emotionally or just physically around the house or some business something, I've leaned on that statement, and it's gotten me through.
Story_ID: 669139
Speaker 1: I'd like to look at your family history now, and let's start with your mother.  If you tell me your mother's name, when and where she was born; tell me about her.
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's maiden name was Dorothy Dent [Dorothy Dent Goodson].  And she was born in Los Angeles [California] in November 28th, 1922.  I'm--
Speaker 1: Same day as you.
Speaker 2: The same day as me.  I'm--she considers me her birthday present (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So, and she married my father, Arthur Cummings, I think in '42 [1942] or '43 [1943], and he was also born in L.A.  And I had two sisters, and Phyllis [Phyllis Cummings Forrest] and Monica [Monica Cummings] were their names.  Phyllis passed away about eight years ago, and Monica is still living.  And, and they're all in Los Angeles.  I'm the only one that ventured outside of California, and once I got here I didn't want to go back (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your mother's--so she was born in L.A.  Where is her family from?
Speaker 2: My--both sides of my family are from Georgia.
Speaker 1: What part?
Speaker 2: I think Columbia County, Georgia.  I've never been really exact about that, because since I was raised in L.A., my mother really never took us to the South.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So I didn't go to the South until I was in my twenties on my own.  I was living here, and I went to an art convention in I think it was, it was in Tennessee I went there, and that was the first time.  And I had seen the movie 'Easy Rider,' which (laughter), a very southern theme.  It was sort of radical and so.  So I was kind of nervous about going to the South, but it was okay.  But I never really went to the South that much.  So--
Speaker 1: And your mother didn't talk about her--
Speaker 2: No.  She grew up in L.A., so--
Speaker 1: And her--did you know her, her parents?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My grandparents [Albena Avery Dent and Hugh Dent] both were living in California.  They migrated in the '20s [1920s], 1920s, to the West.  I asked a matriarch of my father's side of the family why did everybody come west rather than going to Chicago [Illinois] or coming to New York [New York] or something like that.  And her quote was they had heard California was the land of milk and honey.  And so the men came first, and then they sent for the women and children.  And so both of them are from Georgia.  And on my mother's side of the family they kind of intermarried a little bit and got, got kind of crazy there, cousins and stuff like that.  But both sides of the family are from Georgia.
Speaker 1: And were there any stories of Georgia at all?
Speaker 2: No.  And I talked to other people that had grandparents.  And I've read books where writers have talked about how some parents and some families didn't relate at all to their pasts of the grandchildren, and I was in one of those families.  They never related to any of their childhood, told the stories about the past, or anything like that.  It was just like they landed in L.A., and we were the grandchildren, and they were right in that moment, but they didn't relate to the past.  And my aunts on both sides of the family, they didn't talk about it.  Whatever they might have heard from their parents, which would have been my grandparents, they didn't relate to us at all.  So it was strange when I got older I started to realize that there was a blank or a void there, and I didn't know anything about it.  But ultimately, the bottom line was they both came from farms.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so they had a very basic lifestyle of just survival and growing up in large families.  My father came from a family of about six or seven children.  And my grandmother on my mother's side, she had seven or eight brothers and sisters.  So, but when the second generation started having children, they only had two or three and that was it.
Speaker 1: And so you know that they were farmers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They would have been born, your grandparents--
Speaker 2: In the late 1800s (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the--right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you don't have any stories about slavery or just right after slavery, none of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None at all, just a blank, just a blank.
Story_ID: 669140
Speaker 1: Your parents [Dorothy Dent Goodson and Arthur Cummings] were both born in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. What part?
Speaker 2: I guess South Central [South Los Angeles].  I guess you could say South Central, L.A.  I think that's what they called it then.  That was the only area where blacks could live--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I was told.  I don't know what the borders were at the time.  But in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s]--it was only sort of late '50s [1950s], after I think the soldiers started coming back from the war [World War II, WWII] too and they had the veteran's ability to buy houses and stuff like that, that they were able to cross that line and move into certain neighborhoods.  It was very racially limited in L.A. for a long time.  And along Central Avenue, where that was the main strip in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --where they had jazz clubs and everything, Duke Ellington and Count Basie came in.  My parents were very much into jazz, and that's where I got my interest from.  They talked about--a little bit about clubs that were along the Central Avenue, Alabam [Club Alabam, Los Angeles, California], the Savoy [ph.] and other sort of clubs there.
Speaker 1: Well, and Los Angeles, and Central Avenue in particular during that time, was almost like the Harlem Renaissance on the West--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes it was, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --West Coast, right?
Speaker 2: And that was the only place a lot of the famous jazz musicians and singers could perform.  They couldn't go beyond that.  Las Vegas [Nevada] didn't take Sammy Davis, Jr. or Sarah Vaughan or somebody until I think the '60s [1960s].  So it was a big limitation and pressure--
Speaker 1: So Central Avenue was the furthest west.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  I don't think anybody went to Beverly Hills [California] to perform.  And Nat King Cole was the first to move into really a luxury area.  I forgot what the section is called now, but they have a lot of Tudor, English style houses.  It's not Beverly Hills.  But he was welcome in that era and the only black family that's really rose up to a really nice location.  And then in the--I think it was the late '60s [1960s], there started to be an area called View Park [View Park-Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that--the Jacksons, Ray Charles, a couple of jazz musicians, doctors, and lawyers, they all flocked to that location.  And that was the last step before they went to Beverly Hills.  And when Beverly Hills opened up, the Jacksons moved to Beverly Hills and I think a few other people.
Story_ID: 669141
Speaker 1: Well, there was View Park [View Park−Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California] and Baldwin Hills [Los Angeles, California], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Baldwin Hills.  Yeah, they're kind of really close together.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I feel like Ray Charles' house, I thought it was in Baldwin Hills, but I guess they're, they're next door neighbors.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, very similar.  I don't know what the dividing line is, but you could drive through both and not know you've changed.  The housing looks--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --the same.
Speaker 1: --the housing's the same.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and they're up on a hill--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's on a hill.
Speaker 1: --so that was where the--
Speaker 2: The view.
Speaker 1: --wealthier--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  And they had--
Speaker 1: --blacks were.  And then at the bottom is Crenshaw [Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, Crenshaw.  And they had, they had three and four car garages (laughter).
Speaker 1: Up on top--
Speaker 2: On the--yeah (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --on the, on the top (laughter).
Speaker 2: --yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, now the neighborhood you grew up in was South Central [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Correct, right.  It was that and then ultimately, before I moved out, my family had moved down to near Watts [Los Angeles, California].  It wasn't exactly Watts, but it was like really below Imperial Highway.  It was a hundred and--I, I want to say 116th Street, but I don't remember.  That wa- I was in my twenties then.  We lived around there, and that's, that point is where I went to high school.  Fremont High School [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California] was a little distance away.  And a lot of my friends lived in the area, and that's where I last lived with my family.  My mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] currently lives in Inglewood [California] and in a house there.  And I grew up always in a house.  It wasn't until I came to New York [New York] and start living in apartments (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Apartments.
Speaker 2: --a little bit (laughter).
Story_ID: 669142
Speaker 1: So let's go back to your early (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --to your childhood.  And what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been thinking about that, and it's, it's an incident that brought it back to me.  When I was living--the first--second year I was in New York City [New York, New York], I was living in a basement apartment with a friend.  And it was in the afternoon.  I had a part-time job.  I was working that day.  A fire broke out in the basement of this apartment building.  I was in the apartment.  I had never been in a fire before.  I smelled smoke.  I opened the door, and there was smoke coming down the hallway.  So I said, "Oh, what am I gonna do?"  And so there was an elevator right across the door--right, right across the hall from where I lived.  So I opened that elevator door, and all of a sudden my life flashed before my eyes.  And I said, "This is a sign not to get on the elevator."  And one of the images I saw was when I had a little duck when I was about four or five years old.  And I, I know I really liked the duck, and then eventually my parents [Dorothy Dent Goodson and Arthur Cummings] got rid of it 'cause it got too big and out of control.  But that's one of the earliest memories I remember, and it was because of that fire and that flashing--
Speaker 1: Then it came to you.
Speaker 2: --of the memories of taking me way back to when I was little and with that duck.
Speaker 1: So the incident was after--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you were in New York.
Speaker 2: Correct, right.
Speaker 1: But it, it--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --triggered your memory of being a--
Speaker 2: That memory back to when I was four or five years old with this little duck.
Speaker 1: And it was not a duck in a, in a bathtub.  It was a real duck (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh no, it was a real duck (laughter) 'cause we had a backyard and everything.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was a real duck wobbling around, and, and it kind of grew up.  It started as a little duckling, and it grew up.  But then it got out of control, and my parents said it was time to go.  And I remember--well, not remember, but I know I must have cried a lot, and I think I did.  There's still a little emotion in me about it, but--
Speaker 1: But did the duck have a name?
Speaker 2: It could have (laughter), I don't remember the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't remember.
Story_ID: 669143
Speaker 1: Where are you in the birth order of your family?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest sibling.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell--what--tell me what is your, your mother is Dorothy Dent [Dorothy Dent Goodson], what's, what is her work?  What was her work--
Speaker 2: She worked at Lockheed Aircraft [Lockheed Aircraft Company; Lockheed Martin Corporation].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was one--like Rosie the Riveter, that sort of concept and theme, because she was hired during the '40s [1940s] to create the planes for the war [World War II, WWII].  And men were going off to the [U.S.] Army, so women got an opportunity to really go into factory work where men normally go.  So she started there, and she rose up to a supervisor, and she started to specialize and doing interiors of passenger airlines--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --later on in the '50s [1950s], TWA [Trans World Airlines], and I don't know what other airline.  And then she moved from that to doing high tech work with planes that had radar on it.  And she had to get special sort of coverage to be even allowed to work in the area.  And she worked on those planes until she retired.  And when she retired, they gave her a special trip in one of the radar planes that they said normally civilians don't ride in.  But because she was so connected to it by building it, they would give her a ride in it.  So she said went up in the plane, and because they have all this technical equipment in it, it's very cold inside the plane, and they didn't tell her that.  So she said she almost (laughter) froze to death--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and got a little sick kind of bouncing up and down.  But eventually she came back to the ground, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did she ever have any engineering training or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, she didn't have to have engineering training, but it was construction, just how to place different parts of the plane.  I guess that's primarily that--
Speaker 1: Was it like assembly work?
Speaker 2: Assembly work, right, right.
Speaker 1: But that was--California had a lot of--
Speaker 2: Manufacturing--
Speaker 1: Manufacturing--
Speaker 2: --yeah, from--
Speaker 1: --and, and military--
Speaker 2: Right, and also--
Speaker 1: --equipment.
Speaker 2: --automobile.  A lot of her uncles were in the automobile factor areas for employment.  And it was a joke that annually they would get a new car.  They would trade in what they had, and they would get another one because I guess they got discounts and everything.
Speaker 1: And what did your father [Arthur Cummings] do?
Speaker 2: My father worked at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  He did that.
Speaker 1: Which was a good job.  It was a good, stable job.
Speaker 2: It was a good job.  And then eventually he left that.  And he was divorced, and my parents got divorced when I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about twelve.  And then ultimately he got a job at the airport as a--oh, I don't know what they call it--a skycap.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was doing that because there were some other relatives that were there, so they pulled him in on that.  So he did that until he died.
Story_ID: 669144
Speaker 1: What are the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember from your home, your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights were the palm trees, the beautiful sunsets, looking in the distance at the snowcapped mountains when there wasn't any smog, the beaches, you know, riding along the coastline.  That was really wonderful.  Going through Sunset Strip and Hollywood Boulevard in the '60s [1960s], when it was, I guess it was really jumping or popping at the time.
Speaker 1: I was about to say, so what was it like?  'Cause now it's a little--
Speaker 2: Very commercial--
Speaker 1: --seedy.
Speaker 2: --and junky, yeah.  It was, it was, I guess it was full of hope and inspiration because there were so many young creative people that coming in there.  And I, I kind of got into the folk music.  So Joni Mitchell was there at the time.  Joan Baez lived up in Big Sur, California.  And there were a lot of folk people coming through at the time.  Son House, I remember going to see him.
Story_ID: 669145
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At what age were you allowed to go see them?
Speaker 2: Well, you take driver's ed [driver education] (laughter) in junior high school, I think, and you could get--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --your license about at eighteen.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Or--yeah, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixteen, probably.
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I forgot, but I was driving up and down the driveway, practicing (laughter) before I even got my license.  So, I think I was out on the road I guess at eighteen or nineteen.  But prior to that, I bought myself a motorcycle, because when I left high school I wanted a, like a, a red Mustang convertible [Ford Mustang], which was the classic car at the time.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] or parents wouldn't get it for me.  So I had a little money, so I said, "Well, I'm gonna get me some wheels whatever they are."  So I went to a motorcycle dealer and bought a used Honda.  And I had never been on a motorcycle (laughter) before, so they pushed me up and down the, the alley of the back of the building and said, "Okay."  It was sort of like a, a, a, a child on a bicycle without learning wheels, and they kind of pushing (laughter).  They said, "Okay, just turn the, the handlebars and the engine will go."  And they said, "But don't squeeze the front brakes because you'll flip over, so don't squee- just squeeze the other ones for the back wheel."  And then, before I took off I said, "How do you put it in reverse?"  And they all laughed.  He said, "You don't put a motorcycle in reverse."  So anyway, I went home without any gloves, without any helmet, without any glasses.  My eyes were running with water, and the air was hitting me, and I said how am I gonna stop this thing?  'Cause I had to go up and down some hills, so I was going through red lights and all that.  So, I finally got home.  My mother said, "What," (laughter), "is that?"  And so I eventually--I had it for about a year, and, and then eventually my mother knew someone that knew someone that had a car that they hardly ever used, and I, I actually got that.  And then I sold my motorcycle to Charles Burnett, the filmmaker--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --because we went to school together through elementary all the way through high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California].  And I guess we went to junior high--junior college as well together [at Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California].  And so he was starting to go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] at the time, and he said he needed some sort of wheels 'cause he was taking the bus, and it took for hours.  So I kind of--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --gave him the bike.
Speaker 1: --because this is the thing about L.A. [Los Angeles, California], different from some--certainly different from New York [New York], but it can't get anywhere without--
Speaker 2: Oh, the transportation--
Speaker 1: --trans-
Speaker 2: --oh, you--a car is almost mandatory because buses are so slow--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you have to make transfers and stuff.  And then they actually stop at certain times of the night, so you can't even move around after a certain time of the night if you're depending on public transportation.
Speaker 1: Well, and what--was it true at that time as it is now that buses were primarily used by laborers?  I mean, that, that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  It still is now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then that was true when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  And then only in the, the, I guess the more higher income areas you might get little old ladies or something getting--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on the bus to go shopping, but they're not going long distances.  Whereas people had to go long distances to go to work, so they had to get on the buses early in the morning and come back late at night and make different transfers.  And it was, it was school children and laborers, and that's what it is today.
Speaker 1: And again, you know, in different parts of the country, buses are used differently, but in L.A. it's really very long distances--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --because it's so spread out.
Speaker 2: Right, because it is so spread out and then, then different areas have like, nucleuses of, of specialties.  So if you want like a special item, you might have to drive forty-five minutes to get there because there's nothing in your area that has it.  And then if you want to get something else, you might have to drive another forty-five minutes.  So you could just be driving all day long to get a few items because it's not all in one place.  Every area has a specialty.  So, thinking about even moving back there, the first thing you have to think about is the car responsibility, the cost of it, having it, driving it, and then the, and then the cars are multiplied so much out there on the roads and the freeways, and stuff like that, and the road rage (laughter) is there.  So it's a lot to think about, especially coming from New York, because walking distance, the subway, convenience--
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --you get spoiled.
Story_ID: 669146
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to school--names of school, I, I went to 99th Street School [99th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] and Hooper Avenue street school [Hooper Avenue Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].  Those were both elementary schools.  And Hooper Avenue, I went to that school for I guess maybe two or three years.  My mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] had divorced my father [Arthur Cummings], so she moved in with her mother [Albena Avery Dent], so we were living in that area.  And at that point, I, I made friends and everything.  And one of the people I went to school with up until junior high school was Barry White.  And he was a tall, slim guy at the time.  And every--
Speaker 1: You were in elementary school with him.
Speaker 2: Right, and, and partially in junior high.  But the, the second part of junior high, my parents moved to 116th Street, so I went to another high school.
Speaker 1: So your mother remarried.
Speaker 2: Right, she remarried.
Speaker 1: Who, who was her husband?
Speaker 2: Her second husband was Milton Sears [ph.].  And that lasted for just a year, because he had a girlfriend on the side (laughter).
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.
Speaker 2: And my mother found out, so she cut him loose.  And then about a, a couple of years later, she met her third husband, Alonzo Goodson.  And they stayed married until he died, and they were married for over twenty-five years.
Story_ID: 669147
Speaker 1: So when you were, you were in school, you said for a bit with--in elementary and junior high with Barry White.  Had he started singing yet?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  And I don't know at what point he started to sing, but I moved out of the area.  And at one time I, when in high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California], I went to visit where everyone from that other elementary school went to--eventually to high school, Jefferson High School [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].  And we had a game together, and I, I ran into my old buddies.  And they were all sort of high (laughter) on drugs and or alcohol, and I did neither one.  And I was just kind of starting to think about if I had stayed with them, would I have got into the same habits that they were.  Would the peer pressure have taken me down that road?  It was just shocking to see.
Speaker 1: So at what--this was a reunion you said?
Speaker 2: No.  This was a, a, a, a, a, a game, like, a--I think a football game between--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --high schools, and I went to, to the game.
Speaker 1: And you had moved.
Speaker 2: And anti- and I had moved.  And anticipating and seeing my old friends, I went back, and as the, the term was at the time, they were all wasted (laughter).  And it was just disappointing.
Speaker 1: And about how old were they at this--you guys at the time?
Speaker 2: I guess they were about maybe sixteen, seventeen.
Speaker 1: And that was a shock for you.
Speaker 2: It was a shock to me, yeah, because--
Speaker 1: The drug culture was pretty big at that point, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Not at that point.  It, it got stronger in the '70s [1970s] with angel dust [phencyclidine] hit the scene.  LSD had already kind of been around, but it wasn't in the black neighborhood necessarily.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But LSD started to hit the scene in the black area, and people got into that.
Speaker 1: So when did you--around what year is this when you saw your friends at the game?
Speaker 2: Ooh--
Speaker 1: When were you in high school?
Speaker 2: From '60 [1960] to '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --a little early.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But not early for them.  They were--
Speaker 2: Right, they were--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --already--
Speaker 1: --what were they--what were the drugs of choice (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Speaker 1: --that they--
Speaker 2: It could have been marijuana.  I don't know what it was.  I--looking back, I guess I was kind of considered a geek or something.
Story_ID: 669148
Speaker 1: One of the things with me and, and my whole sort of, like, view of the world when I was younger was I grew up as an asthmatic.  That's--
Speaker 2: Ah.
Speaker 1: --was in my family.  And my sisters [Phyllis Cummings Forrest and Monica Cummings] didn't have it at all, but they said sometimes the child could pass it on but not necessarily have it or any symptoms.  But I was a chronic asthmatic until I was about ten or twelve years old.  I was in and out of the hospital.  Sometimes I stayed over a week in the hospital.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: It was that chronic.  And I--they didn't have medicines for children, so I was taking adult medicines for the asthma.  And a lot of it was very drug related.  And so I went through that period.  I had lots of allergies.  I had eczema.  I would--my mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] said she didn't know what to do with me because (laughter) I was just a, a child that was very sickly.  So that took me out of sport.  It took me a lot of--out of a lot of activities and socializing with my own little group because I couldn't do certain things.  So I kind of was on my own, and I kind of went to drawing and kind of enjoying just nature around me.  And both my grandmothers [Albena Avery Dent and Belle Washington Cummings] were into gardening, so I kind of got into that with them.  So that was part of--a big part of my life.  And it, it came--it was such a big part of my life that--like I said, I went in and out of hospitals--that I enjoyed going to the hospitals (laughter).  People cringe or they, they, they kind of draw back and they're paranoid and all that.  I said take me, take me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Because it made you feel better.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it made me feel better.  I was relaxed.  You know, the food was served in the bed and all this sort of stuff (laughter).  I liked it.
Story_ID: 669149
Speaker 1: As--you described that as a child you were sickly.  How did that impact your social relationships?
Speaker 2: Severely, because I, I guess I was more introverted and shy because I didn't get out as much like regular kids did.  And so I did have a small circle of friends I guess that were kind of shy also, and we were kind of attracted to each other.  But in terms of really active with sports and stuff, that limited me a great deal, so I was by myself a lot.  And so I, I guess that allowed my imagination to kind of, like, get exercise, and I got more into, like, drawing.  Both my grandmothers--well, my mother's mother [Albena Avery Dent] a lot of wallpaper (laughter) around the house, so I start trying to copy the designs on the wallpaper.  And then bubble gum wrappers, I was doing that.  And I guess, like a lot of young guys, they copy cartoon comic books at the time; I was kind of doing that.  So that kind of started to pull me in to be curious about being creative in that area.  At one point I thought I wanted to be creative with words because I really got into Bob Dylan's music when I was a teenager.  And I, I loved the, the genre of a song and the stories that they tell, so I got into that.  But as a young child, I was very limited, and I was to myself a lot.
Speaker 1: Did you have--as a child, did you have any formal training in art?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I just kind of taught myself.  I went from the wallpaper, the bubble gum wrappers, and the comic books to outdoors.  I start drawing flowers and plants.  And then my relatives would say, "Oh, I don't know where you go this talent from."  They couldn't reflect on anybody in the family that had exhibited any kind of skills of wanting to draw or be an artist.  And that also I guess awakened the inner artist in me, because at a early age, I told myself that's what I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: When you say early age, like what?
Speaker 2: I guess under the age of ten.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I kind of felt that that's what I wanted to do.  I didn't know how to define it.  I hadn't really explored that in a conversation with my parents [Dorothy Dent Goodson and Arthur Cummings] or anything like that.  But it's just something that I felt I wanted to do.  And a few times we went to museums on school trips.  And at one point I saw the, the 'Sunflowers' by Van Gogh [Vincent Van Gogh] in a museum.  And because of the, the lush yellow and the thickness of the paint on the canvas and everything, I said that's what I want to do.  I just identified it very quickly.  And so that was sort of like a beam of light that kind of led me through a dark tunnel as to where I wanted to go.
Story_ID: 669150
Speaker 1: And did your family support that?
Speaker 2: Oh no (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, and you told them at--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  My mother's [Dorothy Dent Goodson] phrase was, "Keep it as a hobby, but get yourself a good job."  And of course, I could understand.  You know, they wanted stability.  They wanted to see, you know, the next generation of children do better than they did.  So, it was like, go into business administration, do all of that.  So I tried to follow what their wishes after I left college and went into business administration major, but my love was art.  And so ultimately what happened was that after I, I think the second--well, going into the second year of junior college and taking all the basic classes that you need to go on to get the four year degree, I decided after the second--going--I was going into accounting two.  And I looked around the class, and everybody looked like they were dead, and they were into these books, the accounting, these figures.  I said, "I do not want to do this."  And so I just put the brakes on it, and I talked to my parents about that.  And my stepfather, Alonzo Goodson, sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said, "You want to be an artist?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You wanna, like, live in a cold apartment with no money?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You don't want to have any food or anything like that?"  I said, "No."  He said, "You just want to be an artist?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Okay, you could be an artist."  But I--he said, "But we're not gonna support you at it."  I said, "Okay."  So I went out and got a part-time job, and I switched classes, and I started taking art classes.  And ultimately--
Speaker 1: And where were you taking these classes?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: This is where you were in the two year program?
Speaker 2: Correct.  And so I got a part-time job, and then ultimately, the city--it was very easy to get a city job.  I mean, the test was yes and no questions, and you get the majority and you get in.  So I got a city job.  And I kind of moved up kind of easily.  And I became a weekend artist (laughter), because, 'cause at that point it allowed me to move out, and I got my own apartment.  And I was in my nine to five [o'clock], and I was doing art on the weekend.  I was painting.  That was my main focus.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: All this was happening between, I guess maybe sixty--1966 to 1970, that, with that period of time, because in 1970 I moved to New York [New York].  But that three year period I had risen up in the city ranks as being a intake worker for food stamps.  So people would come in, and I was one of the intake workers that would have take their application and review, you know, the possibility of being eligible for that.
Speaker 1: So you really took your mother's wisdom to heart and got yourself a good government job.
Speaker 2: Right, because I did not want to live in a cold apartment and (laughter) have no food.  So, I, I, I and I, and it was a work ethic too about the whole thing that I wanted to prove to myself that I can do.  And over time that balanced out to it, well, it allowed me to have a nine to five and have a art career at the same time when I came to New York.  But that was after I matured a little bit more, and it was about I think in the late--well, when I was in my late twenties in New York, that something really adjusted and came to a view or a vision that I could accomplish both at the same time.  Because I already had acknowledged the fact to myself that, well, if you don't have money you can't buy art supplies, so, so you need a job to get the money to get the art supply.  So, you know, it's just a natural thing.  You gotta get all that together.  So I got a job.  I got a variety of jobs, but coming home, my second job was creating art or developing my skills (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --to be an artist.
Story_ID: 669151
Speaker 1: And so as you were developing your skills, what--you, you said you were painting in the beginning (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things were you painting?
Speaker 2: Just still lifes.  They weren't anything--any sort of narrative at all.  It was just basically still lifes and sometimes just abstract, things that I would make up, but mainly still lifes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was using oil paint in the beginning, but again, because of my asthma and the toxic things, I couldn't do that.  And then acrylic paint became popular, so I switched over to acrylic paint.
Speaker 1: Acrylic paint became popular like around '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or, it was really introduced--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --around '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of water--
Speaker 1: So you started working with it--
Speaker 2: I started--
Speaker 1: --around that time?
Speaker 2: --yeah, doing that, and--
Speaker 1: And that was a lot easier for you to be around.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and it dried quick and all that.  But I found living in a small apartment in New York [New York], it was a problem trying to accumulate canvases of finished--
Speaker 1: Well, well, let's, let's stay in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --just stay in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --be- before you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So were you--did you switch to acrylic when you were in L.A., or it was after you came to New York?
Speaker 2: After I came to New York.
Speaker 1: So in L.A., from '66 [1966] to '70 [1970] you were in L.A. still.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I had my own apartment at the time.  I had my county job as an intake worker.  I was, like, starting to accumulate furniture.  And I'm like a, a thrift store hound sort of.  I like to go to thrift stores.  And so I accumulated different things from thrift stores.  And so I guess I was living quite bohemian like--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or in, in this days the word was hippie, but I didn't look like a hippie, although I went out and bought bell bot- well, bell bottoms was the thing, you know (laughter).  And I bought me some glasses like Bob Dylan, the little granny glasses they called them.  And I bought myself a harmonica, but I could--never could play it.  But (laughter) anyway, so I had that going on.  And then I would work on the weekend a little bit at creating art.  And then some people even called me, "Oh, you're just a weekend artist."  And I didn't know exactly what that was, but then I started to come to see that, oh, yeah, that's, that's what I am, because I, I wanted to do it all.  You know, I was young, so I wanted to go out, and I wanted to socialize.  I wanted to do--so there was just a little time to be creative.
Story_ID: 669152
Speaker 1: And so what was your social life like at this time?  This is mid to late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I had met people on the job a little bit, so I was kind of seeing people there.  And then there--oh, I guess it was mainly people there, and oh, some people I went to school with that I kept in touch with.  Like, even to this day, there are a few people that I went to elementary school with that we're still friends.  And so that--
Speaker 1: What was this--what was your social scene like, though?  Like, what were--at this time in--
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see, I went to coffee houses to, to hear music.  And I went to concerts.  And I had my motorcycle and a car, so depending on how I felt, I would be zooming up (laughter) Sunset Boulevard or Hollywood Boulevard.  I had just a few accidents, minor, minor accidents.  A car hit the back of my wheel once when they were turning or something, and I fell over.  And one time I had a flat tire going down a busy street, and for some reason, my mind told me that I had to jump off the bike because if I fell over, I would break my leg because the bike would fall on my leg.  And later on I realized I could have just turned off the, the motor (laughter).  But I did jump off the bike.  I had glove and a helmet on, and I kind of slid across the lane.  No cars were coming, so I didn't get hit.  That was the major accident I had on the bike before--
Speaker 1: Bike you didn't get hurt.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, didn't get hurt.  I got--my leg got kind of bumped up or something like that.  And I was going to some dance clubs too out there.  I don't--name wise I don't know.  I think I did go to--what was that famous one where the twist was in it?  It was a very famous one.  A lot of Motown [Motown Records] people came to it.  It was a very famous one.  I saw Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell at that show there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna ask you who did you--especially when you went to concerts, who were you seeing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a mix, because I was Motown and folk music (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Three Dog Night, you know, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson.  It was, it was just going back and forth there.
Speaker 1: Because everybody came.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And then a friend of mine, he went to Los Angeles, L.A. High School [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], which at that time was basically all-white, and he was black.  And he--we met on a, a, a double date.  And he introduced me to a lot of music that he liked.  He liked The Beach Boys.  And that was sort of a strange thing for me, but I got into it.  And so I had a, a cross--and then I liked Ravel [Maurice Ravel], and I liked a lot of the classical sort of music too I was listening to.  So I was--I had all that going on in my mind at the time.
Story_ID: 669153
Speaker 1: And this is also a time in the United States when there's a lot of civil unrest.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How is that affecting you?
Speaker 2: Well, I--looking back at that, it--I was sort of oblivious to it, because my parents [Dorothy Dent Goodson and Arthur Cummings] didn't talk about it.  I--the friends--my peer group didn't talk about it.  We saw it on television.  We heard about it taking place in the South.  But there was nothing really pushing against us.  The Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] did exist there, and they were doing a lot of positive things with helping communities to organize for different things and I guess trying to teach--
Speaker 1: And were they in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there was a, a chapter in L.A., and they were doing a lot of positive things.  Even my mother talked about them in a positive sort of way.  So they were out there.  So, it wasn't like it was like in Chicago [Illinois] or other parts of the country.  So, it was something I just read.  I didn't--emotionally I didn't feel it like what was going on.  It was in the distance.
Speaker 1: And was--your parents kind of followed along the lines of their parents, not so much talking about what was going on.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And so when you went to school in Los Angeles, were they integrated schools or primarily black?
Speaker 2: Primarily black up until I went to City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California].  And once I got to City College, it was a whole new world.
Speaker 1: And were was City College?
Speaker 2: It's in--I know they call it North Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], but it's in the Hollywood area.
Speaker 1: And that was a community college?
Speaker 2: A community college, right.
Speaker 1: And you said it was a whole new world (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that it was like multi ethical--ethnical--ethnic groups there.  And so that was something I had to adjust to because I went to, like you mentioned, just a primarily all-black school.  So it was--
Speaker 1: And what was the adjustment like?  Were you treated differently?
Speaker 2: No.  It was just an internal sort of thing, that I had to just realize that there were other people in the world.  And they were sort of like me but different, different colors, and we were all young in school.  So it was just kind of getting used to communicating with different types of groups.
Speaker 1: Some people from the West Coast, from L.A., talk about feeling more of a--en- enjoying integration more than some folks in--on, on--in the South or on the East Coast, and not having some of the same restrictions.  And I'm wondering, especially--so as young people, by the time you're in college, this is time for dating.  Were people dating across cultures too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  But in terms of the feelings of not racial tension but just limitations on going to stores and feeling some sort of tension there, that existed.
Speaker 1: It did?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it did existed.  I mean, like I said, my parents and people couldn't move beyond Central Avenue until the late '50s [1950s], and then they couldn't go to Beverly Hills [California] or anything until like the late '60s [1960s] or early '70s [1970s].  So all of those invisible barriers existed, and even in stores and stuff.  I mean, you didn't go too far out to go shopping because the responses that you got were--they weren't welcoming sort of responses.
Speaker 1: And did you ever witness that?
Speaker 2: I didn't witness it.  I can't re- recall witnessing it, but I know I felt it.  You know, when you went so far out where areas that you aren't normally seen in, the reaction is like, you know, the same as here, "What are you doing here?"
Speaker 1: Well, and, and as soon as you had wheels, you were exploring--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and going to, to a number of these concerts and that not--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But at that time, you had the whole love in thing and the hippie thing, so you had a whole generation of people that didn't have barriers.  And so everyone was like one big family in that age group, if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Got it.
Speaker 2: --moved around in those venues.
Story_ID: 669154
Speaker 1: And you mentioned Barry White.  Are there any other people you grew up with who we might know?
Speaker 2: Well, besides Barry White, was Charles Burnett.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And those were the two main people.  There's a, a, a brother of a woman that I went to school with, John Meigs [John Meigs, Sr.].  He became a judge out in Los Angeles [California].  He recently retired.  And we're in contact because I went to school with his sister.  She became a principal and gradu- retired from being a principal at elementary school.  So there was a whole cluster of geek type, young black kids that didn't go into drugs and went on to become, you know, very high in their professional career areas.
Speaker 1: How comfortable was it to be in the geek community?  'Cause you know, a lot of kids felt awkward if they were so called geeks.
Speaker 2: Oh, it, it was still, it was awkward, because peer pressure, again, just to go along with the crowd.  And the crowd always didn't go in the right direction.  So you had to pull away, and sometimes you would, you know, be pointed out, isolated, and made fun of or something like that.  But you had to kind of hold your own, because otherwise, you know, you were given through your parents and, and the relatives what was right and wrong.  And so you had to start making those decisions what you felt was good for you and not go along.  So I started making those decisions and stay with the group that kind of had that same philosophy or outlook on life.  And so that's what sort of insulated me a little bit from the, the sort of the, the negative forces that were around, or the temptation.
Story_ID: 669155
Speaker 1: And in terms of art, as you start developing your, yourself as a weekend artist, that could easily be isolated, but were there other--did you meet other artists when--as you were, you know, shopping for your supplies and just being in that, in that creative space?
Speaker 2: It was--halfway it was sort like a solo adventure.  I took myself to museums to see shows or to galleries.  And in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], like I tell people and the reason I stayed in New York [New York], there wasn't a lot of outlets for black artists in terms of for assembling and to any sort of groups.  And there wasn't any sort of gallery access too much out there.  There might have been one gallery that featured Charles White [Charles Wilbert White].  But after that--I think after the Watts riots, there were some art centers that developed and took in young people that wanted to train as artists.
Speaker 1: And when were the Watts riots?
Speaker 2: Well, I could say Watts [Los Angeles, California], but I don't know the, the barriers.
Speaker 1: Right, sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know the, the, the, the streets.
Speaker 1: No, when?
Speaker 2: Oh, when.  I think it might have been--let's see, it was before I got out of high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California], but it was in that time period.  It might have been '62 [1962].  I don't know, '61 [1961], '62 [sic. 1965].
Speaker 1: And, and how, how did that affect you?  How close was it to your neighborhood, were you living in Watts then?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--when it happened, I was spending the weekend at a friend's house in View Park [View Park−Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California] with his family.  So, on their balcony, I could look in the basin of L.A. [Los Angeles Basin] and see the flames coming up like somebody was burning hay or something.  Different areas, they were like, shots of flames going up.  And this was like, way in the distance.  It could have been like, fifty miles away or something.  It was in the basin of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but because of the height that we were on and how the basin of L.A. is, you could see the flames.  So the streets were blocked off, so I couldn't go home for like two days.  But it wasn't that my house was in exactly the area, but they had closed off a whole larger area.  So after that, my--
Speaker 1: And why--just, just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for context--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --why did those riots happen?
Speaker 2: Well, the story is that it, it was a, a buildup of years of the police department [Los Angeles Police Department] out there harassing and beating up for no reason people in the black community.  And one of the bad chemistry things was that it was said that they recruited policemen from the South.  And so you had people coming from the South that didn't like blacks to begin with but had an authority image now, with a gun and a club, and so they took advantage of that.  And so one evening it was said that a car stopped, and don't if it was one or two on the street or something like that, they start a conversation.  The conversation escalated.  I think the police start striking, and the black man started fighting back.  And then other people said you know, well, this is--enough is enough.  So this escalated at that moment, and it just kind of fanned out.  And they started lighting cars on fire, attacking stores, and it just multiplied that night into--I, I, I don't know.  I think it was just--I don't know if it was one day or two days, but that's the way it started.  It was a buildup and just an explosion took place, that, that spark, that particular evening. And what happened in the aftermath of the Watts riots?
Speaker 1: Well, the people that took part in it destroyed a lot of the resources in their area.  My mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] always jokes about, "Why don't they go to the other," (laughter), "areas and do that?  Why do they gotta burn down their stores and their drugstore and stuff like that?"  But that's what they did, so they just made life harder for themselves.  There were a lot of programs that started up, but money went in, in the front door and went out the back (laughter) door.  And so a lot of na- and it was a slow process of things--turn things around.  What good came out of it?  I don't know.  You know, there a lot of talk, you know, a lot of pointing fingers.  But it just kind of simmered down, and life went on.
Story_ID: 669156
Speaker 1: One good thing that you had started telling me was that there became more opportunities for artists to show their work.
Speaker 2: Right, there were art centers that kind of sprang up in the black community, along with the community centers and other things to kind of I guess stimulate, introduce people to new ideas and new possibilities and what they could do with their life.  And so, it was through one of those programs that was in Watts [Los Angeles, California] that I went to.  It wasn't the Watts ty- tal- Watts Towers, but it was near there.  There was a center, and there were a couple of older black artists that I guess had achieved a certain--the certain level of success by way of maybe being teachers or instructors somewhere in the schools.  And they had these classes, so I went over there a few times and it was--and I was the youngest one.  At that time I must have been maybe nineteen or twenty, and most everybody else was older.  And then it was in that group that I met the Brockman brothers, I think it was called.  They had the Brockman Gallery.  And I think that Alonzo Davis was one of the brothers.  So they call it the Brockman Gallery, but they're--one of the brothers was Alonzo Davis.  And they were in the Leimert Park area [Los Angeles, California], and they had the--one of the first black galleries.  And what they tried to do is introduce young black artists to the community through exhibitions.  And they also I think started to have a summer festival outside in the park or something like that.  So, they--I, I start to kind of communicate with them.  I never had a show there or participated, but I just kind of went there to support and see what they had, and I met other artists there.  And so that was a beginning, but that was the limit there.  There was one gallery, like I said, Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] out in Beverly Hills [California] or Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And he was already--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was all--
Speaker 1: --established.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and he was also a teacher in one of the art schools, so, you know, he had a job, a nine to five.
Speaker 1: Was he married to [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett then?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  This was--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know that was a short lived--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was, this was in the late '60s [1960s], or mid-'60s [1960s] at least.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure when.
Speaker 2: And so it was just those two areas that offered any exposure.  When I was in high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California], there was no talk of black artists at all, you know.  And well, there was no black--talk of black people at all in the textbooks (laughter).  So, it was just blank.
Story_ID: 669157
Speaker 1: So you're having all these experiences.  When do you make the decision that you need to come to New York [New York] and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I made the decision because I had friends that I knew that ventured to New York.  One had finished UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  Like, I don't--the other one, the other is a friend of him that they went to high school, and they went to school together.  One wanted to be a songwriter, and he was Jewish.  And the other one was black, and he came here just to see what New York was about.  But he was also a conscientious objector, so he had to serve two years.  And so he worked at Bellevue Hospital [Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, New York] as a social worker, so they were here.  So, my friend that was the conscientious objector, he said, "Oh, you should come to New York and see what it is all about. Because you'll find out that L.A. [Los Angeles, California] is nothing but a country town," (laughter), "when you come to New York."  So I had been with the county as a, you know, a social worker intake person for about a year and a half or a little more.  So, I said, "Well, why not?"  You know, I was almost twenty-five, and I was getting kind of bored with myself.  And so I said, "Well--," and I had never been to New York, so I said, "Okay, I'll do it."  And so I put everything in storage, got a suitcase, and went to New York.  I was nervous about getting on the plane.
Speaker 1: Had you never been on a plane before?
Speaker 2: I'd never been on a plane before.  But I fell asleep (laughter).  That was the first and last time I fell asleep.  I don't fall asleep on a plane anymore, and I've been on many a plane.  So I came to New York.  Nobody was there to meet me because they were working or whatever, so I got in a taxi.  I would--it had been 95 [degrees] in New York [sic. Los Angeles, California].  I got off the plane with my little cute suede jacket, and it was snowing (laughter).  And the man asked me was I from Jamaica, and I didn't know what he talked about, "Jamaica.  What's Jamaica?"
Story_ID: 669158
Speaker 1: So it was 95 [degrees] in--
Speaker 2: L.A [Los Angeles, California] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) L.A. when you left.
Speaker 2: Left that day, and I arrived in New York [New York] and it was snowing.  And I got off the plane, got in a taxi.  He drove me, you know, through--they don't call it freeway--the parkway or whatever, to get to Manhattan [New York].  And then he dropped me off.  And, and, and they were living in the Village, the West Village [New York, New York], in a studio apartment.
Speaker 1: Who was this, your friend from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my friend, the two friends.
Speaker 1: The conscientious objector and the--
Speaker 2: Right, and the musician--
Speaker 1: --and the musician.
Speaker 2: --the guy that wanted to write songs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So you were going to stay with them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and d- and just back to--so you thought they were gonna come and pick you up from the airport?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I think they told me that.  They, they--
Speaker 1: Nobody goes to pick people up at the airport in New York (laughter). It's terrible--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They gave me instructions, so I followed their instructions.  And I got out and I went to the upper--it was a studio apartment down in the Village on Leroy Street.  There's a way down near Varick [Street] and stuff and so, then they gave me a number of another person that was a student that would be coming over to take me out to go, go somewhere to eat, 'cause I didn't know where to go.  So he was a little Italian guy, and the first thing he said, "Oh, you want to go--." Well, I don't know how he, he said it, but he thought I wanted soul food, so he said, "Well, I'll take you to the Pink Tea Cup [New York, New York]," which was a--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --famous restaurant at that time.  So we went there, and we had food to eat and stuff like that.  And then over time, I met up with the two friends.  And then the guy that wanted to write music, he had a boyfriend plus he--they had bought an Afghan dog, which look, you know, the long hair and everything.  So there's dog and four people sleeping on the floor in a studio apartment (laughter).  So we did that for about six months. And then my--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --friend and I moved out to this basement apartment where a fire broke out later on.  But we were in the basement apartment for about two years.  And then we moved to the Meatpacking District [New York, New York] into a loft that was like thirty-six hundred square feet and a big difference.
Story_ID: 669159
Speaker 1: And now the Meatpacking District [New York, New York] at this point really is the Meatpacking District (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It really is, the smells, the sounds--
Speaker 1: The blood--
Speaker 2: --the look--
Speaker 1: Right, right--
Speaker 2: --the blood, the carcasses and everything were visible every day--
Speaker 1: So people were--
Speaker 2: --starting at--
Speaker 1: --really living there.  This was still a--
Speaker 2: Raw--
Speaker 1: --factory--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: This must have been about '73 [1973] maybe, could have been '72 [1972] but maybe like '73 [1973], no later than '73 [1973].  And how it came to be was that the building was bought by a developer.  And my friend had found a sign or something about space for rent.  And the guy was gonna turn it into apartments, but he had just bought it and the factory had just moved out.  It was like, four or five floors, freight elevator in the front, freight elevator in the back.  And he wanted just somebody to be in it so it didn't look abandoned.  So he accepted the fact that the proposal of my friend that we could live in the building, but it was totally raw space.  So the floors were raw.  The bathroom had about maybe six or seven urinals in there, six or seven toilets with doors, and nothing else.  And it--
Speaker 1: It was industrial space.
Speaker 2: In--industrial space, right.  And so my friend's father is a architect.  So they--him and his mother actually did a lot of hands on with building their house in View Park [View Park−Windsor Hills, Los Angeles, California].  And I guess eventually they got other special tech--
Speaker 1: So this is your conscientious objector?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, got it.
Speaker 2: Right, he was the only child.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so the father came several times to build walls and stuff in this space.  And then we finally had like about five or six little rooms, where we rented out.  And he developed a kitchen.  The bathroom kind of remained the same, had a little laundry area, and it was kind of nice.  It was all young people, students and stuff like that.  But it was rough in the summer because of the heat.  And it was about--it was a corner building, so we had about maybe twelve windows, six on each side, and they were giant windows.  And so all you could do was just hope for a cool breeze.  So that took place.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: I was there about a couple of years.  My friend, named Allen [ph.], tried to start a printing business.  And eventually he wanted me to kind of invest my money in him being successful in this printing business.  And he had a long history with not being successful with anything he tried, and so I said, "No."  So he said, "Okay, you gotta go."
Speaker 1: And the apartment was in his name?
Speaker 2: Right, it was in his name.  So I moved across the street (laughter) above a fish store (laughter).  And so the first week or so moving into this building--it was on the corner of Gansevoort [Street] and 9th Avenue.  The building must have been built in 1860 or something.  This house I'm in now, 1886, but that was older.  So, the matriarch of the family that owned a lot of those buildings in the meatpacking area, she came with two men that kind of assisted her up the stairs to see who moved into her building.  She must have been ninety, and she came up.  She was very friendly.  I was surprised.  She was very personable.  She came up the stairs, and she walked around.  And she said, "Oh, I just wanted to see who was moving into my building."  And then I had a little antique child's chair, with turned wood legs and everything on it, in one corner of the room.  And I had painted it orange because I didn't want to refinish the natural wood.  She looked at it and she paused.  She--and she just stopped in her tracks, said, "Oh, I used to have a chair like that when I was a little girl."  And you could just kind of sense her memory was going and going back looking at that little chair.  I'll never forget that.  And so that was the last time I had--I, I saw her.
Story_ID: 669160
Speaker 1: At this point, it's still meatpacking, but you're all the way west.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, you're close to all the way west.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And along the West Side [New York, New York] in the '70s [1970s] becomes--this, this is the growing of the gay community--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and the clubs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it, it started around that that time, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did, in the '70s [1970s], yeah.
Speaker 1: So what's happening in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, people are starting to find little pockets to move into.  But primarily, it's just a night scene.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it be gets dangerous after a while because you get people that come in to mug people.  And there's a drug scene going on, so you got loud noises and people wobbling down the street.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, then and also since it's meatpacking, all those businesses are closed at night.  So there are big blocks that are just--
Speaker 2: They're, they're closed.  They open at like, four or five in the morning, but they are closed at night.  And, and a lot of those areas, the gay community, they kind of take advantage of the emptiness and use that for cruising areas.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So all that's going on too.  So it, it's like a, a--what would you call it?  Well, a very busy act- active area (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then also across the West Side Highway, it's nothing like it is now.  I mean, they--it was there--
Speaker 2: They had the old terminals where--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --ships came in, cargo ships, and even passenger ships came in.  They were like, as large as airplane hangars.  But they were made out of wood, and so a lot of them were just falling apart and falling down.  But--and they were like, like skeletons of, of an ancient animal or something like that.  And the city just allowed them to stay there and fall apart.  But they became sort of like a tourist attraction.  There was also an area where gays went also for that.  And then there were a few piers that existed, but they were nothing like they are now, which are quite updated with benches--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and all that sort of stuff.  So you had planks that were missing.  If you didn't know where you stepping (laughter), you could step and fall into the water or at least hurt yourself.  So, all that was going on.
Speaker 1: And they were what--well, later was when I saw it, but they were like parking areas.  So a lot of people would--you know, like the traditional parking--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Well, it was like--roadside parking, because the West Side Highway ran along there.  And at 14th Street there was that, what is now the jai alai.  But it was just, again, overhead tracks that were abandoned.  But big four wheelers or eight wheelers would park under there for the night, and they would park along the West Side Highway.  And then the ladies of the night would come out, and it was a whole little business going on around the trucks. And yeah, all that--
Speaker 1: So this is a totally different experience for you, coming from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, it, it's like a show (laughter).
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's, it's opposite of geek (laughter).
Speaker 2: Ra- right, right--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But so what is your experience moving into this environment?
Speaker 2: Well, it was quite bizarre, but I didn't have any fear, you know.  I, I knew there were--it was danger to be around, so I moved around and watched my back.  But--and I didn't go out a lot at night, you know, and put myself in harm's way.  But you, you're almost elbow to elbow when you walk down the street with the people in, in the, the evening in that area.  So, and it was kind of creepy a little bit because you didn't have proper light a lot of times, and then the buildings were aband- a lot of the factories are moving out, so they were just abandoned.  So, if you walked down a certain street at, at a certain time, it would be, you know, you could hear your footsteps.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that wasn't good.  But I, I got--I was kind of used to it.
Story_ID: 669161
Speaker 1: And then the spaces where you lived, the first one and then when you moved across the street, these are larger spaces.  So this must be conducive to making bigger art.
Speaker 2: You would think (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No?
Speaker 2: But, no, because I kind of got pulled into just enjoying New Year- York [New York, New York] the first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --year or two or three.  And I saw it as like a Disneyland [Anaheim, California] (laughter) that never slept.  And so I would--and I, I was--I didn't have like a, a, a steady job.  I would had a lot of temp jobs.  And I was able to do that with my business background.  Bless mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] for making me go to the arts--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --adminis- business administration classes.  So I had a lot of office skills that I could utilize.
Speaker 1: So you moved to New York without a job.
Speaker 2: Without a job, right, yeah.  And I was pointed in the way to go to certain popular temp agencies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I showed that I had skills and stuff like that, so they kept calling me for other part-time jobs.  And eventually, I heard about full-time jobs, so I started to apply to different places.  And I don't--I can't remember what the first job I had, but I know one of the early ones was at the Children's Art Carnival here in Harlem [New York, New York] and the department of cultural affairs [New York City Department of Cultural Affairs] in, in, at the Arsenal building in Central Park [New York, New York].  And that one was a political type thing in that I didn't have to take a test for it.  They just said, "Oh, okay, we like you; you could have the job."  But when the mayor goes out, you know, you go out.
Speaker 1: And who was the mayor then?
Speaker 2: Linsley, Lin- Lindsay [John Lindsay].
Speaker 1: Lindsay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lindsay.
Speaker 1: Lindsay.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: So (cough) even as you had your business background, you were seeking out jobs that were in the space of art--
Speaker 2: Well, I wish I--
Speaker 1: --or did it just happen?
Speaker 2: --could say--it, it just happened.  I mean, I was blessed.  A guardian angel pushed me through the doors because all the jobs that I had were, were, were art related, a cultural institution, arts organizations, something to do with art.  And it wasn't my plan.  It was a master plan, but it wasn't my plan.  And reflecting on that, it's just remarkable how that flowed one into the other and I got that experience.  In the last thirty one years I was with the New York council on the arts [New York State Council on the Arts].  And that exposed me to a, a landscape of arts organizations all over the state.
Speaker 1: And when did you start at the New York council of the arts?
Speaker 2: That was about 1980 I--
Speaker 1: So you weren't here that long before you got with them.
Speaker 2: Well, ten years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or did it seem--okay, so you moved--
Speaker 2: Here--I, I moved here April 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no, ten years would feel like a long time.  You were--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you were bouncing around.
Speaker 2: I was bouncing around, right.
Speaker 1: Primarily temping or just short term jobs.
Speaker 2: I guess the first two to three years I was bouncing around, but then I started to get more, more solid, stable jobs that would go for a year or two, and then I would move on to something else.
Story_ID: 669162
Speaker 1: And when did you start making art again?
Speaker 2: I got serious with art--well, in '95 [1995], I start to make a work with fabric.  And that started because I was with the department of cultural affairs [New York City Department of Cultural Affairs] in New York City [New York, New York].  And that department put on a lot of big festivals in the park.  And I worked with Karin Bacon, who designed the festivals, and I was her technical director.  I assembled the people that would work the lights, put up the stages and do all that stuff.  I had--I didn't have that experience, but--
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask that.
Speaker 2: --they put me in that, and they said, "Oh, you'll learn it."  So (laughter), I learned by fire.  So I, I did get into it, and I was easy to work with.  So all the professional union people that I worked with, they knew what they had to do, and I would just--
Speaker 1: And you had been there for--with the department of cultural affairs for a long time.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: But you said 1995?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, 1975.
Speaker 1: Oh, I misheard--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it could have been '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I'm glad--I, I didn't hear you correct.
Speaker 2: But yeah, no, I, I was there for about a year or two.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: But the first year, walking in, they said, "Oh, you'll be the tech director."  And so I learned, but I didn't have experience.  But I, I was really--take on the challenge, you know, I guess the youth and wanting to be in New York and the excitement of everything. I just, I didn't have any fear, although she was difficult to work with, because she was always anxious about everything and fearful that nothing was gonna go right.  And so, she was always turning red (laughter) and shaking.  And she is actually Kevin Bacon's sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was a little extra little fame that she carried with her.  But I worked with her--
Story_ID: 669163
Speaker 1: Was it there that you had to make--you, you said you began working with fabric at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was at that time we did a, a fest--well, it wasn't a festival--an event at the American Arts and Crafts Museum [sic. American Craft Museum].  Now it's called the Museum of Arts and Design [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were on 53rd Street across from MoMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York].  And we did a make a banner, fly a banner event, where people came into the museum, and there was fabric and they would make a banner.  And then at the end of the week, we were gonna march everyone around with their banner around the block with a little band, only on 5th Avenue, up downtown (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so that did take place, but in having that event, the staff was asked to put on a, a--make a banner to participate.  So--
Speaker 1: And were the staff artists?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was just to participate--
Speaker 1: But, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yeah, get involved, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We get--the public can do it, you can do it.  So we all took up the challenge.  And I got some scrap material.  And I said, well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to do it?  'Cause I didn't know how to sew.  I say, you know, my mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson], she taught me how to sew a button on a shirt and a, the hole in the sock sort of thing, but that was about it.  And my grandmothers [Albena Avery Dent and Belle Washington Cummings] didn't sew that I knew of.  And so, and it was no quilts in the family, so I had no exposure to anything like that.  So, I put together an image that was kind of interesting.  And it was based upon my development of working with collage, because prior to this event and prior to working with department of cultural affairs [New York City Department of Cultural Affairs], I had discovered Romare Bearden's work.  And so I transferred from painting, desire of painting, to the desire of kind of learning what collage was all about.
Speaker 1: And about when did that happen?
Speaker 2: That was about '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: And, but--
Speaker 2: --seventy-one [1971], '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: And even before that, you, so you moved to--
Speaker 2: New York [New York]--
Speaker 1: --New York--
Speaker 2: --in nineteen seven--
Speaker 1: --in 1970.  When--I, I think I've missed a step.  When did you go to Empire College [SUNY Empire State College, Saratoga Springs, New York]?  Was that in New York or was that--
Speaker 2: No.  That was here.  That was here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was--
Speaker 2: That might have been mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that was after.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 669164
Speaker 1: So we're still--in the beginning is when--you come to New York [New York] and you discover soon after Romare Bearden's work (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, I think about the, the second year, no later than the third, but maybe this--
Speaker 1: And did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Eventually I did meet him, and I--
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: --consider him a mentor, because--
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: --his wife [Nanette Rohan Bearden], she had a dance company [Chamber Dance Group] at one point, so she came to the department of cultural--not affairs.  Well, I think she might have but also the New York State Council on the Arts to get funding for her dance company.
Speaker 1: So you were able to interact with many people of the arts--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --through that job.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so I met her, and she was very friendly and personable.  And there was a woman at the department of cultural affairs [New York City Department of Cultural Affairs] that knew Romare Bearden.  Her name was Suzanne Randolph.  And she was--
Speaker 1: Oh, I know Suzanne.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).  So I worked with her.  She was like in the budding twenty-five or twenty-six at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so she knew Romi.  She called him Romi.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what everybody called him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I never called him Romi.  And so, I might have met him through her.  There was Benny Andrews.  He came into the office.  I, I kind of knew him.  And so Romare Bearden invited me over to his studio on Canal Street, so I started stopping by there, showing him what I'm doing.  I had to go up maybe four or five flights of stairs to get to his studio where him and his wife lived.  But he would kind of critique a little bit.  And eventually, he gave me a print that I have in another room here, and it's called 'Quilting Time' [Romare Bearden]. He showed--he said, "Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], you know, I want to give you something.  My wife and I really kind of like what you've been doing with her.  And you, you know, you're a nice person, so I want to give you something.  So look in that portfolio and pick out what you want," (laughter).  And it was about maybe thirty things in there.  And I said, "Oh, my goodness, what am I going to take out of here?  I want everything."
Speaker 1: And at this point, who is Romare Bearden on the scene?  Like, is he, is he known?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had already had a show at MoMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York], the black and white blowups--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of his collages.  And he was starting to have--Erkstrom [Cordier and Ekstrom Gallery, New York, New York], the gallery--Erkstrom and something was the name of the gallery on the East Side [New York, New York].  And I went to almost every show opening of that.  And so he would--and then June Kelly [June Kelly Gallery] in SoHo [New York, New York], she was starting to sell his prints like hotcakes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And people were buying those up.  So he was beginning to be known.
Speaker 1: And he's giving you a piece of his work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's giving me--he said take what you want.  So I, I kind of thumbed through the portfolio.  I said, "I don't know what I'm gonna select."  And then I came across this print called 'Quilting Time.'  And it was two figures in the print, one sitting down and the other one's holding fabric and there's a little sewing machine.  So I said, "You know, this is what I want."  I said, "This is me."  So he signed it and gave it to me.
Speaker 1: And at this point, had you started quilting?
Speaker 2: I was working with fabric, but I, I was self-taught on quilting.
Story_ID: 669165
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that banner that I made for the department of cultural affairs [New York City Department of Cultural Affairs] for that little event that we had, I walked around for a week or two trying to find out how I was going to sew it 'cause I didn't know how to sew.  I didn't know how to do a sewing machine.  So I--somebody said go to a tailor.  So I went to a tailor, and he wanted a hundred dollars.  And I said, "No way.  This is scrap material.  It's not worth a hundred dollars."  So then I knew a woman name Sara Penn.  She had a, a, a shop in SoHo [New York, New York].  She was the first black woman to have a shop in SoHo, called the Knobkerry.  And she made clothes, and she had fabric and jewelry from Tibet and China.  It was just really a collage of different things.  And so I knew her, so I went to her and I showed her.  And she said, "Oh, Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], this is really exciting."  She said, "I could show you how to operate the machine.  You use the bobbin, and you do the needle; you put the thread here and all that."  And that was overwhelming to me.  I said (laughter) it was like learning a com- computer in five minutes.  I, I, I said, "Oh, no, I can't do that."  So then everybody said, "Well, Michael--," and I didn't want to glue.  I was anti-glue.  So I said, "Okay, I'm just gonna do a up and down stitch," you know.  So I, I did it that way, and I finished it.  And then I wanted to learn more.  So I knew the museum, museum of arts and craft museum [American Craft Museum; Museum of Arts and Design, New York, New York], it had a, a research library, so I went there.  And I knew the director, because he had been associated with the event and all that, and he was a friendly guy.  Paul Smith [Paul J. Smith] was his name.  And he said, "Well, Michael, you know, we have the, the library here.  You could come and look at the books."  So I learned embroidery stitches.  I taught myself how to do that.  And then after so many months of working with fabric, and I, I made a piece that was like four feet by six feet, all hand sewn, with buttons and beads and stuff like that.  I said, "Well, if I'm gonna continue with this I have to get a sewing machine." 'Cause I said, "This is too slow a process."  So, in the meantime, before getting a sewing machine, I was going back to him with the little pieces, like little samplers I was making, and showing him and he was critiquing them (laughter).
Speaker 2: So he was really helping you to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --perfect your skills.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little bit.  And then I got the sewing machine at Macy's [R.H. Macy and Co.; Macy's, Inc.] in about '74 [1974], '75 [1975].  And it's in this room right now.  I never changed.  And--
Speaker 2: That same sewing machine?
Speaker 1: The sewing machine produced all my work.  And the woman that sold it to me, she said, "Well, come back if you have any problem."  I went back about twice because I didn't know how to work the bobbin and the, the tension in the bobbin and the stuff like that.  So after that got settled I never went back.
Speaker 2: And you never took a sewing class?
Speaker 1: No, no (laughter).
Story_ID: 669166
Speaker 1: You taught yourself through the reading of the books?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, trial and error, trial and error.  And then I started off, they were just kind of wall hangings, 'cause I was just kind of fascinated by the look and what I could do without having to pick up a paint brush.  And I could fold up the fabric and put it away and not have to worry about a stuffed canvas and puncturing it and all that sort of stuff.  So I did that, but people started to say they look like quilts, the, the wall hangings.  And I said, "Well, what's a quilt?"  And then I, I kind of learned about the construction of it.  And then so I started doing quilts because I saw how people's eyes got all big and excited, and a big smile went on their face when you said quilt.  And so what really cemented that whole sort of adventure in becoming a quilter was Roland Freeman from Baltimore, Maryland, heard about me and came to--
Speaker 1: Photographer.
Speaker 2: --visit me.  Right.  And he actually put a book together of quilters, and I'm in it with a lot of other people, and Camille Cosby's in it.  And he came to my apartment, studio apartment, and looked at my work and was really fascinated by it.  And I think he took some pictures.  But then there was--I was working on a series called 'Springtime in Memphis.'  And one of the quilts I did was "Springtime in Memphis at Night" [Michael A. Cummings].  And that particular quilt now is in the collection of the African American museum [California African American Museum] in L.A [Los Angeles, California].  And on that quilt--
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: That was about maybe '74 [1974], '74 [1974], '75 [1975].  I don't think it was '76 [1976] but within that range of '74 [1974] to '76 [sic. 1979].  And I did four in that series 'cause I normally work in a series.  And that particular one, "Springtime at Night," I had four blocks, one on each corner of the quilt.  But one block was brown; the other was for green.  And for some reason I had to do it that way.  It was just some--something that said, "You can't make them all the same.  You know, you got to put a different one there."  So he saw that particular quilt and kept saying, "Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?"  I said, "I don't know," (laughter).  "I did--something just said I couldn't do it any other way."  And so he said, "Well, the reason I keep asking that question is because," he said, "there is a tradition in certain parts of the South where you're supposed to do it that way because it's a superstition that if you do it any other way, you know, it's bad luck."  And he said, "But you did it, and you didn't even know about that."  And I said, "Whoa," (laughter), "okay."
Speaker 1: And did that start a different type of research for you?
Speaker 2: Well, eventually I did get into a lot of research about quilts and, and slavery in the South and all that because I started to work with children, and they wanted to know more about quilts.  And then I started working with some adults too, and then I got questioned about: "Well, why are you going into this?  Why are you doing this?  This is not a male thing."  And then after doing research, I saw universally around the world, it was basically all a male thing, you know, in terms of creating the textiles and, and, and making clothes and stuff like that in Africa and Asia and stuff.  The women may dye the stuff.  They may do some printing, but the men do the, really the work with the fabric.  So I said, and then I said, "How could they even say that when they have all the women designers for clothes are men?  You have chefs in the kitchen.  So," (laughter), "what's going on with you're not supposed to work with a quilt?"  So I, I never looked back on that one.
Story_ID: 669167
Speaker 1: So, I want to talk about the types of images that you're creating in the beginning as you start making quilts, because you just mentioned a series, the 'Springtime in Memphis' ['Springtime in Memphis at Night,' Michael A. Cummings] and that you often have series.  So the, the art that you described prior to now was still life.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So now we've--you've, you've taken a shift.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where, where--what are the--what's the subject matter of your art now?
Speaker 2: Well, the subject matter has become at this point, in the mid-'70s [1970s], more directly related to the African American story.  And that comes about because I've started to read and discover all this history that I knew nothing about, coming from California.  There was--it was not in the schools, and so I went to the Schomburg library [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  I started talking to people about the history of Harlem [New York, New York] and finding out about all the celebrities, all the culture that was here.  Like, Jacob Lawrence lived here.  Bearden [Romare Bearden] was here.
Speaker 1: And were you in Harlem at this point, or you're still living downtown?
Speaker 2: I was downtown, but I was coming uptown to the Children's Art Carnival [New York, New York].  Betty Blayton Taylor was the executive director at the time.  And so I was starting to feel and get into the rhythm of taking the A train, Duke Ellington's song ['Take the "A" Train'], up to Harlem and finding out what Harlem was all about.  And there's a book that was produced by a teacher from City College [City College of New York] here in New York [New York] called 'The Making of a Ghetto: Harlem from the 1800s to the 1960s' [sic. 'Harlem: The Making of a Ghetto, Negro New York, 1890-1930,' Gilbert Osofsky], and so that's a very fascinating book that kind of talks about the heyday of Harlem, the Harlem Renaissance and everything, and then the plight that took it over, because I could never understand, looking at 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] with all the abandoned buildings and supposedly those were all of the clubs and everything that existed like in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s].  But it was through learning about all the rich history, and the diaspora also, in terms of not only Harlem and the African American history in America but the Caribbean, the South America and Africa, and that's how I started to get into African art.  I just started to see the--I loved the aesthetic of the motifs and the design, the colors and stuff like that.  So I really started to immerse myself in all of that.  And then that's where a lot of stories kind of came out of as well.
Story_ID: 669168
Speaker 1: So you're, you're working with the Children's Art Carnival [New York, New York] was really the doorway to learning about--
Speaker 2: More about Harlem [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) black culture, Harlem, et cetera.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because the first ten years I was down in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].  And I got kind of priced out, so to speak, because even way back then, to get a good place you had to have some good money, and to be an artist you need space besides money.  So I was in a studio, and I had outgrown it, so I moved up to 135th Street.  A woman was adver- her name was [HistoryMaker] Gloria Toote, T-O-O-T-E, and she was a Republican and thought she had some influence with Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and thought she was gonna be in the cabinet or something.  And everybody said she wasn't going anywhere because she didn't have enough community support to push her in the door.  But she owned property in Harlem, and I rented one of her apartments.
Speaker 1: Black woman?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it was a floor through in an apartment building.  It was a great space.  And I rented--
Speaker 1: What year is this now?
Speaker 2: Okay, this was--it had to be maybe '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It could have been '80 [1980], but it's '79 [1979], '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: But right before you--
Speaker 2: I moved in this house--
Speaker 1: Job too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right before, yeah, 'cause I got the, the job with the state department--well with the New York State Council on the Arts about the same time I bought this house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669169
Speaker 1: So I was living--I lived in that building one year, rented that apartment for one year.  And within that time frame, I heard and saw the advertisements how you could buy a house and pay the same amount for your mortgage that you're paying for your rent.  So I went for--to a couple of conferences that were free that the city provided and gave you information on how you go about buying a house.  And then I read a book by two women, 'How to Buy a House with No Money Down' [ph.], and I read that twice (laughter).  And they had bought a house.  They had bought houses on the Upper West Side [New York, New York] about around the museum of natural history [American Museum of Natural History].  But this was in the '60s [1960s] they wrote the book, in the late '60s [1960s].  And I read that, and so, and then I got brownstone fever.  And I had brownstone fever for a whole year.  And all my friends and everybody said, "Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], if you can't talk about anything else besides brownstone, don't talk," (laughter) becau--
Speaker 2: And were you visiting--
Speaker 1: I would--
Speaker 2: --as many as you--
Speaker 1: --I would, yeah, I would--I had my new job.  I was going to appointments before I got to work at nine o'clock.  I was going to appointments after work, and I was going to appointments on the weekend (laughter).  So I was doing that for a whole year.  And as I was doing that the prices were going up, and so I said, "Uh-oh."  So I came across this house.  This was sort of like the last stand.  There was an owner, he had three or four pieces of property.  They were considered like junk property.  And he had this house for sale.  And he said he was giving it up because his wife didn't want to live in it.  He was going to fix it up and provide it for her, but she wanted to go down south to take care of her family, older parents.  And I couldn't figure that one out, because he was Dominican.  So I don't know who was down south.  I don't whether it was Florida down south or Georgia down south.  I don't know who was down south.  So I said, "Oh, okay."  So, but the house came with a business in the basement.  It was a numbers business, and I didn't know anything about numbers (laughter).  So, so I asked people--
Speaker 2: So there was an active numbers business when you purchased the house.
Speaker 1: There was an active--yeah.  They had knocked down the walls, put up plastic sort of shield and had like little calendars where you could put your money through and play he numbers.  And they had a Doberman Pinscher back there, and I assume they might have had some guns.  It was three or four black men back there.  And he said, "Oh, you should keep them 'cause they'll play--pay your mortgage, you know, the rent that they give you."  And I said "Hm."  I said, isn't that illegal to myself.  So I asked friends, and I got like a 50/50 sort of opinion.  Some said, "Oh yeah, Michael, do it, it's good."  And then ma- I got a vision that one night the police would come to the door, pull me out of bed, and arrest me with the guys downstairs.  And I would try to play innocent.  And they said, "Well, isn't this your house?"  I said, "Yeah."  "And you didn't know what was going on down there?"  I couldn't say yes or not to that one, so I said, "I don't think so."  So I told the owner that he had to tell them they had to move, and I would get the house.  And so he--
Speaker 2: There were no tenants in--
Speaker 1: There were no ten- the, the, the rest of floors--
Speaker 2: You were lucky--
Speaker 1: --were empty.
Speaker 2: --'cause a lot of times people have to wait out the--
Speaker 1: I know, I know, because--
Speaker 2: --tenants.
Speaker 1: --in that book of 'How to Buy a House with No Money Down'--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --they warned you about if you get a house with people in it and you want the people out before you buy it, make sure the owner gets them to sign a verification form that they are legally moving out on their own; otherwise, they could move back in.  So I was looking for no people in a house.
Speaker 2: An empty house.
Speaker 1: But this one did have a hole in the roof, you know (laughter).  I could see the sky.  And it had water--
Speaker 2: A big hole.
Speaker 1: --damage, had a big hole.  Water damage was in a lot of places because of the rain coming in and all that sort of stuff.  But downstairs they had it fixed up for the business.  And then they had on the first level outside painted yellow.  The brick was painted yellow.  So they had it, they had it working for them, so--
Speaker 2: And how easy or difficult was it to get the numbers business out?
Speaker 1: Well, he did that.  And they were, they were very gracious about it.  They didn't put up any problem, because I guess at that time it was easy to find another vacant space, because they made good money so I guess they were able to pay good money for rent, so people would be taking them in.  So--
Speaker 2: And did you--when you bought the house did you have people knocking for a while for the business?
Speaker 1: No, no, because soon as I signed the paper, the next day I think I painted over that yellow (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --to let them know no more yellow (laughter), so no, no more attraction to come in.
Speaker 2: Well, that was visionary of you to buy a brownstone.
Speaker 1: Well, my mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] thought I was crazy when I told her on the phone.  She actually flew here from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to see what I had done and said--and then she still, with her hands on her hip, "Are you crazy?"  (Laughter) But I had lived in enough raw spaces--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the areas through the years that I was like, I could see a vision, you know, through the rubble and the rawness of having to fix things up.  But I was willing to take on that challenge.  But doing that, that eliminated energy to do art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I had to make sort of an agreement with myself.  I said, "Well, if I'm moving into this type of space, I know it's gonna take time and money.  So I'm gonna have to sacrifice not doing art at that time."  So I did that for, I guess, I don't know, four or five, six years.
Story_ID: 669170
Speaker 1: You weren't making art.  You were just renovating.
Speaker 2: I, I was just renovating.
Speaker 1: And where--did you have tenants?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did have tenants.  There was a woman, Sana Musasama.
Speaker 1: I know Sana.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She--
Speaker 1: Artist, uh-hm.
Speaker 2: --she was with me on 135th Street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause we had met at the Children's Art Carnival [New York, New York], and so we became friends.  And so she moved in at the apartment, which and we split the apartment on 135th.  And then I told her she could come over here, and she was willing to come over here.  She didn't lift a finger to do anything, but she came over, and she took the top floor.  And I think I might have a picture of her in that when they renewed Alice Walker's book--I think it was 'Color Purple' ['The Color Purple']--they took a new photograph, and Sana is on that cover, taken in her apartment on the top floor.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so she moved in, and then eventually I think I had three or four other people.  They were all young aspiring people and career oriented, and most of them were in the arts, arts administration.  And at one point, I had two or three that worked at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  And Kinshasha Conwill [HistoryMaker Kinshasha Holman Conwill] was the director.  And they all laughed because they all thought that when they come home, she thought that they were conspiring (laughter) because they knew a lot.  And they would go back to work and all this sort of stuff.  It was kind of a just a--
Speaker 1: And, and so what did you--
Speaker 2: --joke.
Speaker 1: --during--well, actually, your show was earlier than that at the Studio Museum, earlier than when you bought the house.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: It was in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: That was seventy-something.  Yeah, that was at the old Studio Museum on 5th Avenue in 120--above--I don't know what it was above, but it was on the second floor on 125th Street and 5th Avenue.  And so yeah, that's her early show, because that show, they gave three artists segments of the gallery, and I had one segment.  I think David Hammons had another part, and then there was a third artist.  I don't remember who that was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 669171
Speaker 1: You were in New York [New York] not that long before you--I mean a few years, but then you start showing.  You did your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--yeah, earlier on, I was, I was starting to show.  I was kind, what they say, hustling, 'cause I was even--I was still painting a little.  That transition working with fabric hadn't taken hold yet.  So I was going to street fairs around Washington Square Park [New York, New York].  I did that a couple of years, until I said, "Well, you know, how do you go to the bathroom?  You got to work and you got to watch your art."
Speaker 1: And, and this is with?
Speaker 2: Canvas--
Speaker 1: This is with?
Speaker 2: --paintings.
Speaker 1: Paintings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, paintings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not collage even.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and so you're do--and what are, what are you painting?  Is this still, still life?
Speaker 2: It's more still lifes, more still lifes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and at one point, I went to the art--what is it, the Art Students League of New York [New York, New York] on 57th Street.  I went--I got a scholarship there at one point for a year, and I went there.  I didn't really get a lot out of it, but I met a really good teacher who sponsored me, who kind of was my reference to get me in there.  And I took his class, and then I took a few other classes.
Speaker 1: And about when was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It could have been about '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: And so how did the show come about in the, at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll, I'll, I'll emphasize it to whoever listens to this.  There's a lot of hard work.  You--I was learning how to promote myself.  So I always had a lot of slides and sending out slide sheets.  I guess that's an antiquated word right now, but slide sheets.  I kind of tried to keep up my resume.  I had a business card.  I was always sending out information to different people of what activities I was going with.  And so I think they had a slide file there, and they might have picked me out to show there.  And I--
Speaker 1: And had you been frequenting the museum?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --yeah, I had been--
Speaker 1: --'cause I know you said you came to the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the Studio Museum was the only museum--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --uptown.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was, that was the old one too on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --5th Avenue.
Speaker 1: And was Kinshasha Conwell [HistoryMaker Kinshasha Holman Conwill]--
Speaker 2: No, no, she--
Speaker 1: Who was, who was running it then?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Mary Schmidt Campbell.
Speaker 1: Ah right, of course--
Speaker 2: She had just started.  She had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just started. And after I had the show, they offered artist in residence there.  But I also had gotten an offer from the New York Foundation for the Arts for two years to do a pilot program of art in the schools.  And so they offered much more money than the Studio Museum did, so I told her thank you but no thank you.  And then she got a little sensitive about it.  She said, "Oh, why, why, why are you not gonna do it?"  And I said, "Well, I got this other offer, and it's more money.  And I, I'm, I would like to take that."  So she accepted that fact.  But then I went over to this school, P.S. 129 [P.S. 129, John H. Finley School, New York, New York], right behind City College in Harlem [City College of New York, New York, New York].  And the program was sponsored by Agnes Gund, who was the executive or the chairperson at the MoMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York].  And she comes from money, and so she knew in the '70s [1970s] that they had taken artists out of the school system, primarily the elementary school system, so she wanted to contribute something to help enhance in the experience of the young kids.  So, I think it was three of us in three different locations of the city, and we had a budget or art supplies, visiting artists.  And we got benefits and everything.  And we had three classes a day for four days a week.  And we had a student assis- a parent assistant with us.  So I did that for two years.  And that taught me a lot of just how to freely kind of let my imagination go.  Because the children had so many great ideas without, you know, an art background, that I said, wow, this is a great education for me.
Story_ID: 669172
Speaker 1: And when you were doing that, was that your full-time work during that period?
Speaker 2: That was a full-time--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --two years.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so this is all before you took your job.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, in '78 [1978]--so the, the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] show was in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978], you exhibited at the Cinque Gallery [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which is Bearden was, was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Bearden--
Speaker 2: Bearden, Ernie Crichlow [Ernest Crichlow], and Lewis.
Speaker 1: Right, Norman Lewis.
Speaker 2: Ed Lewis [sic.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Norman Lewis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Norman Lewis.  Yeah, I, again, knew Romare Bearden a little bit and not that that got me in the door, but I was giving him slides as well.  And they--and this was a group show.  And I was doing something different, so I got in the door there.  And that was--
Speaker 1: And is this still painting at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, it--I think there's some collage in the show, because I think that show I introduced my collages for the 'For Colored Girls Who Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Wasn't Enuf' [sic. 'For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf']; I had seen that.  I was so impressed with it that I made a collage for every choreopoem.  And I think I had some of those in there because I heard that [HistoryMaker] Ntozake Shange came into the gallery and liked my work, but she never came back to buy it (laughter).  But I heard there were--
Speaker 1: So this was (cough) was this for the Broadway performance?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't made for the Broadway performance.  It was just something that I felt I wanted to do--
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: --that represented the words I wanted to make into images and tell that narrative in that way.  And then later on through the years, I showed that to Cinque when it moved over to Broadway, across the street from the June Kelly Gallery [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And so at the time that you were there, where did the Cinque Gallery fit into the art scene in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or how?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have to kind of hesitate and kind of almost laugh.  It, it, it was like a little piece of hope (laughter) in a big city (laughter), because the story is that Joseph Papp gave that space to those artists--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --to have a gallery in.  And that's--
Speaker 1: And he already, at this point, has The Public Theater [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: He had--Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and is doing pretty well.
Speaker 2: And I think 'Chorus Line' ['A Chorus Line'] had--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --been successful and all that sort of stuff.  So he gave them that space.  Now, I don't know if it was, like, any money involved, eventually, maybe, or whatever, but that's how they got that space originally.  And, and that was before June Kelly.  So again, that was like a beacon that was way downtown, that allowed black artists to have the possibility of being shown in that area. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And were people buying the work?  Like, when you were in the show, did you get sales?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't get any sales.  But I think the people were buying a little bit, but I'm not certain.  I showed there I think only once, and then years later I started showing in the bigger space, and didn't sell anything there either, came close one time.  [HistoryMaker] David Driskell wanted to buy something, but he wanted to buy it a lower price, and I said no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, that didn't sell.  But, but it was a, a very hopeful scene, but it was a tight little space.  And so you, you had to have small work to go into that Cinque Gallery space.  And--but it--it--the name and the concept was bigger than the reality.
Story_ID: 669173
Speaker 1: But again, it, it provided a lot of hope for artists that wanted to show downtown (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, because at this time in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], people are paying attention to art in New York-- well, I mean, they were always tak- paying attention to art in New York City [New York, New York].  But for there to be black artists to have a place to show, it was very limited.
Speaker 1: Oh, it definitely was.  There was a, a living space, and it still exists, Westbeth [Westbeth Artists Housing], that's on the West Side Highway, faces the West Side Highway, down in the West Village [New York, New York].  That was a telephone company.  And they moved out--a factory building--and it was turned into artists' space.  And at one point the City of New York had a program called A.I.R. [artists in residence], Artists--I forgot what the IR meant.  But--
Speaker 2: Not, in residence?
Speaker 1: It could have been.  But it allowed them to move into factory buildings and create a residence and a studio space.  And that's--
Speaker 2: I think that might still happen.
Speaker 1: None in New York.
Speaker 2: No? Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's how mostly all the artists got into SoHo [New York, New York] in the '60s [1960s] and the early '70s [1970s], through that program.  And then this how they got into Westbeth, and so they have a gallery space there.  Benny Andrews is the only artist that I know that live there, there over--but the whole place was full of artists.  And so that was another outlet that people could go see art at that time, of new and younger artists.  But for black artists it was very limited, this--yeah.
Speaker 2: And of course, when June Kelly came along a bit later--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she still has her gallery [June Kelly Gallery, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: She still has it, yeah, yeah.  And, and she started really selling--she started off with top names to bring in the people and the buyers, yeah.
Speaker 2: Have you shown with her?
Speaker 1: No, I haven't.  I've--over the years we've talked and stuff like that, but I haven't known her to really show textile work.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: She's done ceramic.  She's done Sana's [Sana Musasama] work, but I haven't known her to do fabric work.
Story_ID: 669174
Speaker 1: So in '82 [1982]--so you buy your house in '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You participate in what was considered a landmark exhibit, 'Black Folk Art in America' ['Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980'] at the--through the Corcoran Gallery [Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.] in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: You remember that?
Speaker 2: No hardly (laughter).  Okay, but that must have been--okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, let me see.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know what?  No.  What it is, is the people who you--who inspired you.  Sister Gertrude Morgan and Nellie Mae Rowe--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were in that show.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, be--we, we haven't talked about them yet.
Speaker 2: No, we haven't.
Speaker 1: So, in, in terms of your influences, these quilters were very important to you, correct?
Speaker 2: Quilters, folk artists, artists in general, Romare Bearden, like we mentioned; Jacob Lawrence; Willie Banks Johnson [ph.]; Frida Kahlo, I liked her textile art and her paintings; and Sister Gertrude Morgan.  That--
Speaker 1: Tell me about her.  I don't know (unclear)--tell me--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so I know who she was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She was born the same time my grandmothers [Albena Avery Dent and Belle Washington Cummings] were born, in the late 1800s.  I think she was born in Alabama.  She had a family, a husband and a couple of kids.  But one day she got a calling, that God told her she had to go out and do His work and spread the word of the Bible.  And her specialty was revel- the Book of Revelations.  And so she migrated across and ended up in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Let's see, she died in eight--1980-something.  So she was in New Orleans for at least twenty, thirty years.  And she started off--they, they, they tried to track her history.  She was doing domestic work at one time.  I think she took care of children at some time.  But most of the time she was on the corner preaching about the Book of Revelations.  And she was all in white, and she did that.
Speaker 1: Did she stay with her family or--
Speaker 2: No.  She was on her own.  She was on her own.  That was a wild thing.  And so, at one point, she started to have--bring in people into her home to teach them the Book of Revelation. Because a lot of people couldn't read, what she started to do was paint pictures that represented passages in the Book of Revelations.  And these were from the animals to people and all this other stuff.  And the, the guy [George Wein] that started the New Orleans Jazz Festival [New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival] heard of her and brought her into the festival, giving her a booth, because he liked the folk art she was painting.  And then he brought a lot of famous people over to see her work, and they started to buy it.  I have a--there is a book that the Folk Art Museum [American Folk Art Museum, New York, New York] put on her, and they show photographs of different people that bought her work.  And so after she did that for four or five years, she went into his office and said, "I can't do this anymore."  And, and he was making money, and she was making money.  And she said, "God told me I was going down the wrong road," (laughter).  "He said I have to get back on track and do the right thing."  So she gave up that, but prior to giving it up, him and his family had bought up a lot of her work, and so they're an investment.  So, she had bought her a shotgun house.  She painted it up, and it was called the Everlasting Baptist Church [sic. Everlasting Gospel Mission], something like that.  And she got another vision that she was gonna marry God.  She was gonna be the bride of God.  So she did paintings of her in a single engine plane with God, and they were waving to the people below, and she had her wedding dress on.  And there's angels in the sky.  God is white, sitting next to her.  The angels are black and white.  And she became the--Dada was God and became--and so she was serving God and Jesus.  And so, there's a recording of her also, were singing, because she did a lot of old gospel.  She played the guitar, tambourine, and I think the piano.  And so she was quite a individual, and Sister Gertrude Morgan.  So when she married God, she painted everything in her house white, kitchen stuff, everything, and she wore all white.  And she did that up until she died.  And so at this exhibit that I saw of her where I was introduced to her, they had taken the interior of her house and set it up as an installation.  And so they had it at the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn, New York], and then they had it in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 669175
Speaker 1: And to, to hear her story and everything--she [Sister Gertrude Morgan] reminded me so much of my father's mother, because my father's mother was a missionary also.  She would--my mother [Dorothy Dent Goodson] talks about how she was very motivated to be a very active individual.  And so she, she brought people in off the street to feed them, my mother tells me.  She always kept a big pot of beans, my mother said.  And I remember her all in, in white and stuff like that.  And my mother tells me she went to this school in Los Angeles [California] in the early maybe '40s [1940s].  This--there was a woman named Eddie [ph.] something that had a, a school, a Christian school, where she taught people how to teach the Bible, and my grandmother went to that even.  So every time we went over to my grandmother's house, we dropped on our knees to pray.  Going or coming, we dropped on our knees to pray.
Speaker 2: What's her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Belle Cummings [Belle Washington Cummings].  Her, her maiden name was Belle Washington.  But she was a very religious, faithful person.  And I feel that's where I got a lot of my hope and faith, from her, because even though I rebelled about going to Sunday school and staying all day at church, she would (laughter) take us every Sunday to church and did that for some time.
Story_ID: 669176
Speaker 1: So when was that show in--at the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The show at the Brooklyn Museum was in the early '80s [1980s].  It had to be '80 [1980], '81 [1981], because it was the first national major show introducing black folk art to the country.  And from that venue at Brooklyn Museum, it went on to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]
Speaker 1: Okay, to the Corcoran Gallery [Corcoran Gallery of Art].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So it's the same exhibition ['Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980'].  It was moving--
Speaker 2: It's the same exhibition.
Speaker 1: --it was moving around.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, what--did you--were you introduced to Nellie Mae Rowe's work at that same exhibition?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about her?
Speaker 2: Ooh--
Speaker 1: Or what her work was like?
Speaker 2: I ca- I'm, I--
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: --I'm not getting a vision of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, but the, these black folk artists affected your, your work.
Speaker 2: Definitely, they did.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just they're so free in terms of expressing their emotions through either a narrative or a forum or the motif of whatever.  And the color combinations of, of the compositions they did, it just really pulled me in.  And at that time, I had already worked with--I was--I had worked with children I think too.  And the freedom that the children have of creating their artwork, all that just kind of piled up on me and said, "Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], throw out the textbook and just go for it."  And so I was just amazed at what the folk artists had achieved.  And yet reading their stories, they were ostracized.  Because of what they did, people laughed at them.  Nobody wanted to have it in their environment.  They had it mainly in their front yard, backyard, in their house.  And it was only galleries from the East that solved the, the potential and the monetary value of it, so they collected it by the truckloads.
Speaker 1: Well, because it--some called it black folk art or folk art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And some called it outsider art--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --which, you know, outsider art, while some like that, many people thought it was just odd pieces that were from, you know, the, the recesses of our country.  So what, what was your understanding of outsider art?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just a name to me, 'cause I, I just saw it as art and then just the, the name classification, putting it in a category.  But over time, I started to see all of that was just political, you know, the classified things, so people had control of certain things.  And so, and then I start to embrace that idea that, you know, there's--politics really govern the movement of art and how it's presented and how it's talked about.  And so I try to put that in the back of my mind.  But when I realize when I'm creating my art, to tell a African American story, I know that I'm stepping out, making a political statement (laughter).  It's--that's the way this society works.
Speaker 1: Well, and so when you go to figurative work and stories of the American American experience, this is a big shift in terms of the content that you're--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --covering.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and I've done that with a very deliberate sort of focus, because another voice in me, when I was little, growing up, I didn't see my story or my images.  So I told myself, as an artist, that was gonna be one of my goals, is to produce images and art that another generation could look at and see their story and see themselves in it.
Story_ID: 669177
Speaker 1: And so when you combine this storytelling on quilts, how, how is your consciousness evolving at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, that--to get to the fabric and the quilt imagery and storytelling, I have to back up a little bit and talk about that transition, because I was working with--I was really deep into creating collages--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --for several years.  And I tell people collage and applique are both French words, and they both relate to putting pieces together.  But the collage primarily is paper, and applique is primarily fabric.  So it, it wasn't a, a, a big leap for me.  It was just working with a different type of material; rather than paper, it was fabric.  But I was already making--I, I considered like, my work like putting together a puzzle because it's applique, so its pieces come together to form a shape of some kind.  And so that's how that transition took place, and it was kind of easy for me, ex- except I did have to learn how to operate a sewing machine.
Speaker 1: And so when you were doing the collage on paper, what years was the--were you doing that?
Speaker 2: Okay, up until--well, I guess between '70 [1970]--maybe I was into it late--well, '73 [1973] or '4 [1974], '5 [1975], somewhere in there, because I was thinking about the fabric, but I was still holding onto the collage.  But there's a few pieces where I combine collage and paper together, a few pieces that I had.
Speaker 1: Collage and paper or--
Speaker 2: Together--yeah, collage and paper.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean collage and--
Speaker 1: And fabric.
Speaker 2: --fabric, yeah--
Speaker 1: Fabric, right.
Speaker 2: --right.
Story_ID: 669178
Speaker 1: So Bearden [Romare Bearden] is a big influence on you during this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, definitely. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because he's doing collages--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in very different ways.
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah, he's taking--
Speaker 1: Sort of abstra--
Speaker 2: --photographs--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and blowing them up and doing different things.  And eventually he gets into Color-aid paper.  He's putting bright color, intense color with black images, and not fabric.  But later on in his life, he does move over to using fabric and has made some quilts.  I've seen some in some of the gallery shows that he's done.  But yeah, he was a great influence.  And then Jacob Lawrence was another influence--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but also Picasso [Pablo Picasso] and the cubism.  I love that.  I love abstract.  So that was also another influence, along with at--when I broke out with my 'African Jazz' series--there were twelve quilts in that series--I was studying Yoruba mythology and, and masks at the time, at the, the Caribbean Cultural Center [Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute] here in New York City [New York, New York].  I took a class on that.  So when I was working on the 'African Jazz' series, I incorporated a lot imagery, symbolism into those quilts.  And each one of those quilts were nine feet high and six feet wide.  And I did twelve in one year, so, and this was 1990.  And I tell people I was possessed 'cause I clocked myself.  Every thirty days I would start a new quilt top.  I didn't finish it.  I would just do the top, what you visually see hanging on the wall.  And I went through twelve of those.  And at one time, I felt I had OD'd [overdosed] on color after about the ninth or tenth one.
Story_ID: 669179
Speaker 1: So I made one--I challenged myself to do one, with just black, white, and gray.  And I accomplished that, and that became very successful in that it's easy to photograph and reproduce.  So it got reproduced even on a Hallmark card, it was so successful in terms of the look of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And now where were you making these pieces? That's a huge piece.
Speaker 1: In this room that we're sitting in.  It's twelve by--it was fifteen by fifteen.  I didn't have as many books in it in the early years or other clutter.  But I work on the floor.  I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --cut everything up.  I, I don't sketch.  I visualize everything.  I practiced that.  Someone introduced that to me I, I guess about '89 [1989] or something.  They said, "Visualize, Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings].  Just think about what you want to do."  So I started to practice that, and so I don't sketch.  The only time I sketch is when I get a commission, and they want to see something in advance of what--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the final product's gonna look like.  But for my own purposes, I just think about it.  I see it in my mind.  I lay out the fabric on the floor.  I get a piece of chalk and start outlining the shapes and start to cut.  And then I use straight pins to pin it down on the foundation fabric.  And after that piece is down, I take it to my dance partner.  I call my sewing machine my dance partner (laughter), because the--you could see the size of my quilts.  I have to swirl and move around--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --the fabric--
Speaker 2: --'cause that's a--
Speaker 1: --through a, a--
Speaker 2: --small machine.
Speaker 1: --little domestic sewing machine.  So I call her my dance partner.  And I have also a, a sixty minute timer that I call it my personal trainer.  And that timer keeps me alert to the--in the reality of real time, what I've accomplished in sixty minutes, and then I reflect on what I've done.  I turn another sixty minutes on, and I go faster or keep up the same pace.  But that clock keeps me alert, because otherwise I'll put on my music.  I got the ideas going.  I'm working with the fabric.  I can get lost in time.  And when I was doing all of this, I was still doing my nine to five [o'clock], so I had to budget time.  So when I was doing those twelve quilts, I would come home, change quickly, make a sandwich, do something really to eat, jump on the sewing machine until ten or eleven, go to bed.  And if there were some problems with where I placed a color or fabric like that, visualize it in my subconscious sleep, wake up I got the answer, go to work.  Or, I can go to work and things were so routine at work, I could have one part of my brain do the work at the desk and another part of my brain do the visualizing of what I had to do at home.
Story_ID: 669180
Speaker 1: And those pieces, the 'African Jazz' series--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where did you show them?
Speaker 2: Let's see, there was a couple that I knew that lived in Brooklyn [New York]; they showed them first.  But it was in a large loft space that they had.  It wasn't really--they tried to have a gallery, but it didn't last very long.  So, I don't even remember what it was, but that was the first time.  But then some of them got shown at the Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then one was recently shown at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution], the African museum [National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C.], the Bill Cosby collection.  And then, like I said, one was put on a, a card, a note card, for Hallmark [Hallmark Cards, Inc.].  And--
Speaker 1: And that was in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: That was in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: 'Cause that, that series you did in 1990, right?
Speaker 2: Right, 1990.  Yeah, they've been around.  And they haven't all been shown together.  They've shown some of them individually.  One--[HistoryMaker] Susan Rice, who used to be our UN [United Nations]--
Speaker 1: Ambassador--yeah representative
Speaker 2: --representative, she had one of the quilts in her apartment at the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York] for two years, because I'm in the Embassy for Art Program [sic. Art in Embassies Program], and they called me up and said she wanted art in her apartment.  And so they had me on slide files there, so we picked out one of the 'Jazz' quilts.  So, she had that for two years in her apartment.  So individual quilts have been in different places.
Speaker 1: And so at--when--as you've made this, was, was that series the 'Jazz' series?  Did that position you differently in the art world?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.  It did.  It kind of brought me on people's radar.  Here was this black man making these wild, edgy quilts that combined folk art and the elements of just a studio art.  And on a--
Speaker 1: It looks like, looking like African masks--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, that was the time period when I was studying Yoruba art--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the mythology, so African masks came.  And then I always had a collection of masks in my home.  So, there was there musicians in this composition on the 'African Jazz'--actually, it was a poster that I had found in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] in the late 18--'89 [1989], 1989.  And I saw this poster, three jazz musicians, in a South African club.  And it as smoke filled, and it was a black and white photograph.  It was kind of abstract.  I walked by it, because I said, oh, this is kind of disturbing.  I, I couldn't understand it, but something drew me back.  I went back and looked at it again.  I said oh, this is something that I could use as maybe a composition for a quilt, so I bought the poster.  And then looking at it more and more, in 1990 I said, "I'm gonna dive into this composition and make some quilts."  I didn't have in mind that they were gonna be nine feet tall. However, I like a large scale, because when I was at the Children's Museum--Children's Carnival--
Speaker 1: Art Carnival.
Speaker 2: --Art Carnival [Children's Art Carnival, New York, New York]--I was in charge of doing murals on park buildings.  And so I would do the big outlines, and then the kids would--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --fill in.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I got--I think that's where I got my sense of scale and liking large sizes.  And so I just laid things out on the floor here and went for it.  And so after I did one, two, and three, friends of mine kept edging me on.  "Oh, Michael [HistoryMaker Michael A. Cummings], do three more; you could do three more."  So I, I went up to six.  Oh, do two more; you could do eight; do ten; do twelve.  So, they were kind of pushing me into it, 'cause I had no idea that I was gonna do twelve.  But once I got started, I say I was possessed, and I couldn't stop.  I couldn't stop.
Story_ID: 669181
Speaker 1: So then you start showing frequently.
Speaker 2: Right.  I started making more quilts, but then I also started--I joined the quilting network.  What is, what's it called again?
Speaker 1: The Women of Color Quilting Network [sic. Women of Color Quilters Network] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So the Women of Color Quilting Network.
Speaker 2: Quilting Network.  Yeah, and, and--
Speaker 1: So let's talk about that 'cause you're--
Speaker 2: Carolyn--
Speaker 1: --a man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Carolyn Mazloomi is the founder of that.  And she called me I think in the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s].  She had heard of me and wanted me to consider joining.  But I was sort of like the first male that she was kind of bringing, and she said she had to talk it over with the other members or some of the members.  And so she did that.  And then she was thinking at one point that maybe the name had to be changed to kind of include men or show that it was open to more than women.  But then she came back finally and said, "Well we're not gonna change the name, but you know, you're welcome to join."  So I did, and eventually I think they had maybe two or three other men that also joined from around the country.  It could have been more than just a few, but I was the first, and yeah.
Story_ID: 669182
Speaker 1: So you, you began telling this story earlier, but you know, in the United States, at least in recent history, the notion was that quilting was a women's activity.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And certainly, I mean, looking backwards during the war, women quilted before going into some of those other jobs like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like you described it--
Speaker 2: Factory workers.
Speaker 1: --in your family, factory workers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But before that women often were quilting.  And, and in the South there's a tradition of--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --quilting with women.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you were describing that there's also a tradition of men quilting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are document- documented stories of people remembering relatives, in the South primarily, of men quilters, not a large number, but enough for people to remember that they did that.  And, and, and so it wasn't totally uncommon, but it was sort of rare for that to take place.  And then currently now there's more men across the country, black and white, that have picked up that tradition.  But the tradition--let's see, the tradition has been strong, I could say, and it, and it's become very commercialized with quilt magazines, fabric, threads, conventions, big exhibitions and stuff like that, so it gets a lot of promotion.  But in the smaller town areas, like the Gee's Bend women from Alabama--
Speaker 1: Gee's Bend?
Speaker 2: Gee's Bend, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me who they are.
Speaker 2: Okay, you, you haven't heard of them before?
Speaker 1: No, I want you, I want you to--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --share who they are.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  They're a group of women that lived in an isolated area called Gee's Bend.  You had to cross a bridge to get to where they lived, and I think it was in Alabama.  And they were quilting since like the '20s [1920s], 1920s.  And they developed a style that art historians relate to like modern art, and they had no exposure to modern art at all.  But the way they were placing their colors and blocks of colors in their quilt compositions, it's, it's just, it's art, and it's, it's modern art, before painters.  And so they have said in interviews that they find it very difficult to pass on the tradition because the younger people want to go to the big cities, if not, look at television rather than just the radio, because these women had maybe a radio when they were young, but as time went on, technology got better.  And they were discovered by a collector.  And he bought up all their quilts and created an exhibition and put it into the Whitney Museum [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York].  And everybody said, "Well, okay, he's just upping the value instantly of these quilts by putting them in the museum." Because that was like a--it wasn't a first.  The, the Whitney had had another quilt exhibit of the Amish quilts, and they compared that to Mark Rothko's paintings because they were somewhat similar in terms of blocks of color.  But the Gee's Bend quilts came into the show, and then it was an instant marketable sort of items, all of from stamps to reproduction of the quilts themselves.  And they did a, a video ['The Quilts of Gee's Bend'].  I think Jane Fonda's daughter [Vanessa Vadim] did the video, and, and they did a--
Speaker 1: And when was this?
Speaker 2: --a book.  This was--it had to be either the mid to late '80s [1980s], because they got on the stamps the book and the reproduction, stuff like that.  And so tradition in some places has been carried on and other places has faded out, only because the younger people didn't pick up the tradition.  But in terms of quilting nationally in the United States, it's big business.  They have conventions primarily in the summer.  They have big conventions in Texas, in California.  They have shows that go all around.  And Carolyn Mazloomi, and this organization [Women of Color Quilters Network], she has really elevated the exposure of the African American quilter in the United States.
Story_ID: 669183
Speaker 1: And as a result of all of that, have the, has the value gone up for quilting in general, like the prices that you're able to sell your art for?
Speaker 2: I would say yes.  The value does go by your reputation as a quilter and what you've achieved.  And Faith Ringgold, of course, is like, on top of the mountain.  And there's an artist, a, a, a white quilter, named Michael James, that also is the top sort of quilter.
Speaker 1: What's the name, Michael--
Speaker 2: Michael James.
Speaker 1: Michael James.
Speaker 2: He's in Nebraska.  He's the head of the textile department there at Nebraska University [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska].  And so those two people--and then Carolyn's [Carolyn Mazloomi] quilts, I believe they sell at a good price.  I--and my quilts sell pretty good.  And, and it's just, it's a slow prog- progress- progressional sort of like, movement of the pricing going up depending on who you sell, how much you sell.  And I kind of compare myself to an, an artist, as opposed to a quilter.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So, I feel I'm making art, so my art should be just as valuable as artwork that someone does in their studio.  So--
Speaker 1: And so you're--so, just to, to get a sense from--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when you started, in the very beginning what were you selling your work for?
Speaker 2: Oh, just hundreds of dollars.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Few hundred dollars, yeah.
Speaker 1: For something that you might have worked on for how long?
Speaker 2: Oh, easy a month or two months, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then as you--I mean, you've shown everywhere.  And you've, you've had--
Speaker 2: Many places.
Speaker 1: --many shows, many exhibitions.  Now what is the range that your art sells at?
Speaker 2: Well, the range is I guess we're anywhere from several thousand dollars up to oh, one quilt sold for thirty thousand dollars.  It's a range there.  But that range and what prices and a professional quilter artist can get also is helped a lot by having an agent and a gallery that represents you.
Story_ID: 669184
Speaker 1: And I have only had that type of representation one time, and that was with the Jacob Lawrence Gallery out in Seattle [Washington].  And at that time, I had really tried to cultivate a relationship with the director at the time.  And for a whole year I wrote to her.  I said, "Oh, my art is colorful.  It's like Jacob Lawrence.  It could make a good sort of pairing, please, please, please."  So finally she accepted me into her gallery.  And that is a place where I showed the 'African Jazz' series.  And she flew me out to Seattle, because she said, "Well, what's part of the agreement: I give you a show, and then I promote your work with the other clients that I have."  So for a whole year I was with her I had to sign about twelve pages of a contract about what I could do and not do with my artwork.  And I had to let her know and give her a percentage and all this other stuff.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Well, it had to be after--it had to be maybe '93 [1993], '94 [1994].  It was just one year.  And so when I flew out there, she said, "Well, you're coming to Seattle.  What would you like to do?"  And I said, "I'd like to meet Jacob Lawrence," so she said, "Okay."  So she had him and his wife [Gwendolyn Knight] come to the opening.  And I shook hands and said hello.  They walked around and saw what I did, and he gave me a few compliments, and they were out the door.  But still, I had the honor and the, and that historical moment of meeting him.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: But after a year nothing happened, so I told her, I said, "Well, you know, it's not working out.  You're way over here.  I'm way over in New York [New York].  And I'm doing more to promote and try to get sales than you are, so I don't think it's worth it." 'Cause she wanted 50 percent.

Speaker 1: Well, yeah, let's talk about that for a second, because that's part of the challenge.  You know, there's the creative challenge of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just your creative inspiration--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like you described, you know, putting on one head at work and then the other and then taking the time to gather the materials and, and literally create the work.  And then there's the whole other side, which is the marketing and selling--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And, and some fine artists have representation, and many do not.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so you said you had representation--
Speaker 2: That one time.
Speaker 1: --that one time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So other than that, you're, you are doing the selling yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm doing the promotion--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --myself.  And through a lot of the exhibits that Carolyn [Carolyn Mazloomi] put on with the women's organization [Women of Color Quilters Network], I got exposure, and I got in a lot of catalogs and books.  And--but it is definitely a, a business side of being the artist and a creative side.  And I tell a lot of young people that all the time, because without those skills you could get lost and very frustrated.  But you have to have a resume, and you have to be ready to have your--a card or something to show people and let people know what you're doing.  But at the same time, you have to be making your art.  So it's very important to have both those things going.  And I have been successful in a lot of word of mouth at this point in my career.  People know of my work.  They know me.  And so two years ago I sold a work to the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn, New York], and it was by someone that knew me that was part of a, a, a, a conference, so to speak.  They were developing a quilt show idea at the Brooklyn Museum, but they wanted to embrace a lot of quilters that were in the city, not only in Brooklyn [New York].  So this woman that was there represented Harlem [New York, New York].  And she was saying, "Well, you know, I know a male quilter, you know, you haven't even mentioned that could be in the show."  They didn't know me at all.  And so she gave them my name and everything.  So, the person, the curator, and the director of some department, they came.  I showed them what I had.  And eventually they said, "Well, we want to get one of something that we've seen, so send us images."  So they picked out one of my Obama quilts ['President Obama,' Michael A. Cummings]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to, to purchase two years ago.
Speaker 1: And when a museum purchases your work, obviously it's very prestigious for them to do that.  Is it a harder negotiation?
Speaker 2: I didn't find it to be harder, in that they all want to buy for less (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you know going in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know going in that they're gonna ask for less.  And so it's depending on what you want to do in terms of--have that prestige to be able to say.  And so my thing is that I al- I, I decided long ago, since I had a nine to five [o'clock] job, that it wasn't about the money.  It was about the inspiration and something that had to come out, that I had to be creative.  And so that wasn't the driving force to--success to me was just the gratification to see that I had created this body of work, and each piece I call my child.  So once the child is finished, it goes out into the world, and it has a conversation with the public on its own.  And what they see in it sometimes surprises me, because I don't see the same that they see.  But it's a story that people interpret.
