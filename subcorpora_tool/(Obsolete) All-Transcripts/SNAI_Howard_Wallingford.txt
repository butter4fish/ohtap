Chambreau:

We're talking with Millie Dye Howard, from the class of
â€¢48, and Janice Lee Wallingford.

[BREAK IN TAPE]

Chambreau:

We were talking about your first days in nursing school
and what you remember, and you were talking about what was
going on when you started nursing school. Millie?

Howard:

Well, we started nursing school in the cadet program.

Wallingford:

On the last one, right?

Howard:

That's right. We were the very last cadet nurse program.

Chambreau:

When was that?

Howard:

It was 1945. The government was recruiting nurses, and

.

they recruited from various, all campuses, all over, to became
nurses, to serve in the war. It was a very good setup because
they paid your way.
Wallingford:

That's right. Our class would have only been able to put
in thirty-four students, but if we didn't request uniforms and
all that paraphernalia, then two more could go in the cadet
nurse corps. We said, "Oh, sure." So we borrowed our big
sisters' uniforms when we wanted to travel and get reduced
rates or hitchhike. You didn't say that word. So we were the
very last class of cadet nurses. And Millie, didn't we make a
commitment?

2

Howard:

Well, we were supposed to serve.

Wallingford:

Yes, for two years.

Howard:

When we graduated we were supposed to serve two years to
pay back the government. Bat, the strange thing is that when
we graduated, they let us loose, they didn't require us to
serve. They said we didn't have to.

Wallingford:

No, because the war was over.

Howard:

Actually, I would have loved to have traveled in the
service. The war ended before we got out.

Wallingford:

But we could have enlisted, like Ruth Lewis did. And I
wish now that I had, I really do, because I think that . . .

Howard:

I think it would have been fun, too.

Wallingford:

It would have been fun. I've known some nurses who, after
they graduated, went on and and I just think they're great and
they had some neat experiences that were very rewarding.

Chambreau:

You started in '45 and the war was over in '45, so . . .

Howard:

It was over in one of the theaters, the European.

Wallingford:

In August.

Howard:

But then the other one wasn't over until, V-J Day later.

Wallingford:

That's right. There were two wars.

Howard:

I'm not really sure of the day, anyway, V-J Day.

Wallingford:

One was August 15, 1945.

Howard:

We were recruited from various campuses. I had planned to
be a doctor, and I was in pre-med down at Redlands University.
I had always wanted to be a doctor, ever since I was a little
kid. This one woman had offered to put me through med school.
But, of course I would have had to pay her back, I knew that.

I saw several other people, when I was there, who were doctors
and married, and they had a difficult time with their family
life and their careers. I decided if I ever became a doctor, I
wouldn't do the career justice. If I got married I would want
a family and then that would be it. So, that's when they came
through, the people recruiting, and I thought, gee, rather than
be a doctor, I think I just want to be a nurse. That's how it
happens.
Wallingford:

Isn't that strange? Well, all I ever wanted to do was
sing in my life. Music was my whole life, but my mother was
the first woman accepted at the University of California
medical school in Berkeley, 1923. In those days, a woman
couldn't sign for her own permission for surgery until she was
twenty-five and emancipated. Your father and/or your husband
or your brother had to sign. Her father wouldn't sign, and so,
they didn't do surgery and her appendix ruptured. So she had
to drop out of medical school, but she was living vicariously
through me. So at the age of seventeen, here I wind up with a
scholarship to Stanford for pre-med. I didn't want to be a
doctor. I wanted to be a singer. But, as an only child, the
influence from my parents was tremendous, and Mother was a
dominant. It was a very matriarchal society where I came
from. I wasn't aware that women weren't equal or better than
men. But after three years in pre-med, nobody liked me. You
know, they didn't want women. You could feel that in pre-med.
And I hated the sight of blood. So I went to Dean Mary Yost,
the dean of women students at that time here on campus, and I

said, "I've got a problem, Dean Mary. I've been gone from my
mother for three years, and I don't want to be a doctor. I
want to be a singer." I was a Stanford soloist at that time.
I was taking lessons in San Francisco. Unbeknownst to my
mother, I was baby-sitting to pay for the singing lessons.
Dean Mary says, "I have just the thing for you. You're going
to transfer into nurses' training with all this pre-med you've
had. Then when you graduate from nurses' training, you're
going to work any hour, any place in the world, and go right on
with your singing." And that's hew I became a Stanford nurse,
and proud to be one.
Chambreau:

Isn't that something.

Wallingford:

Isn't that a riot? Different motivations.

Chambreau:

Yes, really. It's fun to compare them. So, then, once
you got up into nursing school, were you still singing?

Wallingford:

Uh-huh.

Howard:

That's right, you did sing.

Wallingford:

I sang at Verna Lee[?] 's wedding.

Howard:

That's right, you did.

Wallingford:

And I'm still singing. But I've never been able to earn
my bread and butter singing, which I'd love to do. But I'm
very, very thankful for my nursing experience, because as an
only child and with a mother who was never well, I didn't know
how to cook, I didn't know how to sew, I didn't know how to
care for children, I didn't know anything. I have four
children that went just about the extremes of illnesses, so I
really learned a great deal and was very thankful. The forty

5

years that I look back on in nursing, I had many, many, many
satisfying years, of knowing what professional, really good
training in nursing really means. There's such a difference,
because I've been ill. I've gone through eighteen surgeries so
far, with all this garbage, and my father's been in and out of
hospitals. I am appalled at the lack of the skill of the
nursing care that's provided. They're technicians. So many
times they're technicians, and they're so rushed. I would just
love to get back here in academia and work through and struggle
with doing something about it. I am, as a task force member of
California Health Decision, which is a nonprofit research
organization aimed at doing something about our health care
delivery system here in California and in other states. Who
has access to care? Do we have the right to say "Forget it, I
don't want your care, I'll take care of myself." I'm on the
task force for education and health prevention, prevention of
illnesses, and we're working with a curricula right now aimed
at the small schoolchildren for AIDS, and it's really exciting.
Chambreau:

Now you went into school nursing, is that right?

Wallingford:

Well, I was here at Stanford from the age of seventeen,
and then three years later I went into the School of Nursing in
San Francisco and graduated then. I was here five years, in
nursing. I got my bachelors. We were the last class to get
B.A.s, too. From then on they got Bachelors of Science. Lots
of changes came just about the time we came through.

Chambreau:

But, did you tell me that you were doing school nursing.
What have you been working at?

Wallingford:

No, every phase of nursing that you can think of. My last
was being an EN phlebotomist for the American Red Cross, since
1980. But I've been medically retired for almost four years
now.

Chairibreau:

Thank you. Good, Janice. Let's just get back to nursing
school for a minute, and see. Can you tell me a little bit
what your first impressions were, Millie, of nursing school.

Howard:

It was a lot of fun. It was different. Not the same as
college. Different atmosphere, I guess, in a big city, because
it was in San Francisco. I weighed 129 when I went up there
and I gained up to 140 in the first six months.

Wallingford:

That's what we did, typically, we gained weight. We
studied hard, we ate a lot.

Howard:

They had a very high carbohydrate diet.

Wallingford:

And we had a kitchen off of the . . .

Howard:

Down in the basement.

Wallingford:

. . . where we could make peanut butter sandwiches, peanut
butter and jelly. I think I was a little awed. Our nursing
arts instructor, Mrs. Eriksen, was a very good instructor, very
meticulous and overpowering, and I think a lot of us at first
were just a little scared. We were apprehensive, and, you
know, it was a new situation. But, I really enjoyed it very
much.

Chambreau:

How strict were they?

Wallingford:

You mean for hours?

Chambreau:

Well, for everything.

Wallingford:

When you went downtown in San Francisco, you had to wear

7
gloves and high heeled shoes.
Howard:

And a hat.

Wallingford:

And a hat. Now that's how it's changed.

Howard:

And you never wore white shoes in San Francisco. And you
never were caught dead in pants on campus, or in San Francisco,
on the streets. Never any slacks or pants, you dressed well.

Chambreau:

What about in the classroom or on the floors?

Wallingford:

Oh, they were strict. You had to have your hair up,
remember?

Howard:

Super strict.

Wallingford:

You had to have a hair net or wear your hair up.

Howard:

Very little makeup. No eye makeup.

Wallingford:

No rings.

Howard:

No rings, no jewelry, no perfume.

Wallingford:

And no perfume, that's right.

Howard:

No gum, white shoes, white everything.

Wallingford:

Our uniforms were always very immaculate.

Howard:

They had to be starched every morning. Everything.

Wallingford:

I think in the first six months, before we got capped, we
were inspected.

Howard:

Oh, yes, we had had inspection.

Wallingford:

We were definitely checked before we went on to the wards.

Chambreau:

What did they check? You mean, your fingernails?

Wallingford:

Everything. Oh, and no fingernail polish.

Howard:

No fingernail polish.

Wallingford:

Short nails.

Howard:

The classrooms were very orderly.

Wallingford:

Oh, yes. You stood up when a professor came in or when a
head nurse, supervisor, doctor, intern came on the floor, you
immediately stood up.

Howard:

We were allowed to attend some of the doctors1, the
medical school lectures, which were kind of fun.

Wallingford:

Yes.

Howard:

I don't know how it would compare to some other nursing
schools because that was the only one I went to.

Chambreau:

What about on the floor? Was there a certain amount of
supervision and strictness . . . ?

Howard:

Oh, yes, there was supervision.

Chambreau:

. . . and certain rules about about how you behaved.

Howard:

We were talking about that today at the luncheon, and one
of the other gals was saying that was the only thing that she
regretted. I feel that our nursing experience and teaching was
excellent, just like Janice Lee said. We have a baccalaureate
program where I live in Klamath Falls, and the gals that come
out of that that I have seen don't compare to us as far as
detail and really in-depth nursing. I mean, we got the whole
thing. But we did not in those days have the capacity to deal
with patients in the sense they do today with illness, terminal
illnesses, and discussing it with them. Because in those days,
the idea was you didn't tell them everything. Don't you
remember, cancer patients?

Wallingford:

We only spoke when we were spoken to, either to the
patient or to the doctor. We were sort of silent.

Howard:

But if the patient was terminally ill, you didn't mention

9

it to them.
Wallingford:

Never.

Howard:

You see, you pretended like everything was just fine,
which is completely opposite to what nowadays, with the hospice
and all the rest; you are encouraged to talk with them.

Wallingford:

You never sat on the bed. You never discussed anything
personal. You did not relate to them. You were very
circumspect in talking. You'd never discuss the patient with
the patient's family.

Howard:

You were always very professional in your attitude. You
introduced yourself to the patient every morning, and went
about your ways. Nowadays, people are so casual. When I have
worked in the hospital, I have always worn my cap. I am very
proud to wear my Stanford cap.

Wallingford:

We all are.

Howard:

That, I think, has changed. Or the caps have changed.
Our cap was the old fly cap with . . . .

Wallingford:

If you wore a cap now and you worked in a hospital, they'd
look at you as if you were an oddball. A few of the old guard
still wear their caps, but that old guard wears them outside
the hospital, through their car and into the parking lot.

Howard:

Oh, really? Well, if I worked in the hospital, I've
always worn my hat. Not in the office.

Chambreau:

What was your reaction when you saw your first surgery?
Do you remember that? Or your first delivery?

Howard:

I liked surgery. Made some boo-boos, but. . . OB, I
fainted. That's the only time I ever fainted.

10

Wallingford:

I remember.

Howard:

Waiting for the delivery, I fainted.

Wallingford:

But she's a tall, slender girl.

Howard:

My cousin was in San Francisco at the same time with her
husband and she was having her first baby. She wanted me to be
there in the delivery room. This was before I'd had OB. So
actually, that was probably the first baby I saw being born, my
cousin's baby, and I felt very responsible, because I kept
thinking, "If anything happens to that kid, I'm standing here
as a nurse." Well, not a nurse, a student nurse. But I felt
very responsible. I didn't know a thing about it. Fortunately
it was lucky.

Chambreau:

And that's when you fainted?

Howard:

No. I fainted when I was on OB service, standing,
scrubbed, waiting to assist in the delivery. This was a long
delivery. It was exciting. I learned an awful lot. I was
very naive when I went into nurses training. It's just amazing
to look back. It's such a wonderful preparation for your whole
life.

Wallingford:

Oh, yes.

Chambreau:

What kinds of things do you remember that made you think
you were naive?

Howard:

Well, for instance, with the baby. I really did not know
that much about birth, and delivery. I really didn't. I had
little bits of things that I had in my head.

Chambreau:

No sex education.

Wallingford:

Are you kidding?!? In our generation?

11

Howard:

It wasn't the thing to discuss.

Wallingford:

My parents never even discussed it with me. I didn't know
. . . Naive, yes. I was a virgin when I was married at
twenty-five. So was my husband. But that's just not heard of
these days. So we were naive, even though we were in school
and the sophisticated city like San Francisco, and that was
exciting. That was very exciting.

Chambreau:

Did you work nights?

Wallingford:

We had to work all of the shifts. When we lived in the
dorm and we had our schoolwork plus our hours on duty, we
really learned and it became a cohesive unit that you don't
have today, where you go in the classroom and you go into a
made-up lab or something. They don't have that. We took turns
learning to be in charge of units when we'd been there long
enough, when we were on our specialties. We had to work days,
P.M.s, and nights. We had to work the whole twenty-four hours
and work with people that were coming off and going on, so you
saw the whole mechanism of a hospital and what makes that
pulsebeat go, and where we as nursing created the milieu in
which a patient healed themselves. Today, nurses wouldn't know
what the hell you were talking about if you said that.

Howard:

I think you're right.

Wallingford:

It was a wonderful experience. I learned all about life
and living in the Stanford School of Nursing. It had the most
wonderful professors and instructors.

Howard:

I think all the ones. Of course Grace Ringressy, you
know, was our director of nursing, for years. I guess she was

12

until the end. It was kind of nice to see her there today.
Wallingford:

Yes, it was.

Howard:

She was, I think, a very good director of nurses.
Intimidating, but I think you have to be.

Wallingford:

Inflexible.

Howard:

I think you have to be, in that position, to maintain a
certain amount of discipline.

Wallingford:

It was one-sided brain teaching education, really. The
creative, artistic person that was uniquely us was very
stifled.

Howard:

Well, that's true, but . . .

Wallingford:

That's what's missing in nursing today.

Howard:

We learned discipline and we learned goals that we had to
follow.

Wallingford:

Absolutely.

Howard:

And that was good.

Wallingford:

We saw the need for it, and it was very rewarding. With
the most discipline you have the most freedom.

Howard:

When we achieved, we felt achievement when we accomplished
something well.

Wallingford:

Absolutely.

Chambreau:

You learn to be proud of what you do.

Howard:

That's right. When you did a good job, you really felt
good about it. And you were given reason to feel good.

Wallingford:

Absolutely, and when we graduated, . . .

Howard:

They don't graduate like that any more. They don't have
that sense of achievement.

13

Wallingford:

They're scared to death.

Chambreau:

You see that in nurses, you mean?

Howard:

In the current day, I see it. They make errors and
mistakes and they're sort of glossed over. It's not a big
deal. When we went, if we made a little error, you were called
up in front of the director, and I mean, it was a big to-do.
You know, you didn't make those errors. You just did not make
them. Nowadays, they just gloss over them. There are lots of
things like that. And they just don't pay attention to
detail. It's a big difference.

Wallingford:

Nursing was a profession with us, and I feel like I was an
RN just like a man is a doctor, his whole life, as Millie was
saying when she saw the dedication, and the conflict between
family life and professional life. You made the decision to
enter the profession of nursing. But to us as nurses, it was
our life, just like it's a doctor's life. My whole life was
wrapped up in nurturing and providing and expediting what I was
trained to do here at Stanford. We could work anyplace and we
had the full confidence. We could work at any kind of
nursing. When I was getting my masters at UCIA in '65, and I
was having to take a psych class for something or other, this
girl was graduating that June from nurses' training, getting
her bachelors, she would be working in Florida because her
husband was doing his residency in Florida. And she said,
"I've never even given an enema." She didn't know how to take
a blood pressure.

Chambreau:

So she hadn't had the practical experience.

Wallingford:

She'd had academia. And it's sad, because those people
are going to be caring for us soon.

Howard:

But you see, those are the people nowadays, because the
people that do the other things are the aides, and the LVNs,
not the nurses.

Chambreau:

That's true.

Wallingford:

So many times, they shuffle papers.

Howard:

But we did everything. We also were in charge of the
wards, so we also had the management, too, the administrative
work as well as the other.

Wallingford:

We learned it all, I think.

Howard:

And those days, when you graduated with a degree, the
bachelors degree was everything. I mean, now, you have to have
a masters. I wish I had a masters. I wish I'd gone back and
gotten my masters at the time, but at the time we thought that
a bachelors was terrific.

Wallingford:

Of course, so few nurses had them.

Howard:

That's right. And wherever I worked, I ended up usually
in an administrative position. Most of my work as a nurse was
in administration, out of the nursing office.

Wallingford:

That's right.

Howard:

Or supervisor. Three to eleven supervisor, OPD
supervisor, and in the nursing office for the last few years.

Chambreau:

Of a hospital?

Howard:

Of a hospital.

Chambreau:

And you've retired now?

Howard:

Well, no, I'm back into it again.

15

Wallingford:

Are you really, Millie?

Howard:

Oh, yes.

Wallingford:

What are you doing?

Howard:

I put my husband through medical school, and then I helped
him open his office, and then our kids came along and so then I
quit. Then I did work for the Red Cross; I was a Red Cross
nurse for years. But then I just quit entirely for a while.
Then I decided I'd go into it again, and the kids got older. I
did re-entry training and got back into it. My husband is a
physician; everywhere I worked, I would be working with his
patients, which was, after a while, a little bit
uncomfortable. They got to know who I was. He didn't like
it. I didn't like it. So then I quit again, and I was a
travel agent.

Wallingford:

How fun!

Howard:

Yes, it was fun. Then, the last few years, my husband
wanted me to get back into nursing so I could help him in the
office. All the kids were gone. So I went back and updated my
licence again. This time I thought, well, I'm going to keep it
up. Because in Oregon, you have to have so many hours, it's
not courses, it's hours. So I did it again, and now I'm
working in the office. I worked full-time for a while, and now
I'm doing share-jobbing. I'm sharing the job with another RN.
So we do our own things, as long as we do it. And it's a lot
of fun, I love it. The kids are all gone, it's not too hard.
Yet I have to keep up certain skills. He's an internist; I
hated internal medicine in training. I was always interested

in surgical, post-op, and OPD, surgical OPD. But in an office,
it's more exciting in a medical office than in a surgical
office, because in surgery, the fun is in the hospital. When
you get back into the office, it's just a matter of taking out
sutures and dressings. In the medical office, it's heart
attacks, you know, diabetics, and all kinds of things. Every
day is different. So I'm really enjoying it. The only thing
is, he's very hard on me. He tries to make me much more
efficient than the other nurse. He expects more of me, because
I'm his wife. And the medicators, of course, are fantastic.
All the meds that are out, and the new ones, trying to keep up
with them. I've enjoyed it. So that's what I'm doing now.
Wallingford:

That's neat. That's wonderful.

Chambreau:

So you're still using nursing.

Howard:

That's right.

Wallingford:

Oh, yes.

Chambreau:

Forty years after you graduated.

Howard:

Yes. Well, you feel like that you need to put that to
use, you know. I loved being at the travel agency, but I
really wasn't using what I was taught, at all. This has sort
of evolved. My husband needed me, and it's worked out very
nicely.

Wallingford:

That's great.

Chambreau:

Yes, it is. And then you have done different kinds of
things. What was your masters in?

Wallingford:

Psychology, clinical psychology. I started out to get my
masters in nursing, but after I looked at what I saw at UCLA, I

decided that I would be much happier in another field, and I
came from a very dysfunctional family. I felt that I could
gain a lot of insight into what was making this family tick and
what was not. So I did it more or less as a personal goal. I
love to learn; I like to be in the atmosphere of academia. So
I finished up my masters in clinical psychology at Fepperdine
University at Newport Beach. Then, I worked as a
nurse/oncologist for a number of years.
Chambreau:

When you finished with your clinical psychology, did you
then use that or were you doing that . . .

Wallingford:

As a nurse/oncologist.

Chambreau:

Oncologist. Oh, I see. So you were doing counseling-type
things then. That's great.

Wallingford:

It was, really great.

Chambreau:

And you were doing probably a lot of teaching, too.

Wallingford:

Yes. But I became so disenchanted with nursing and our
lack of ability to use our brains and I dropped over to the
American Red Cross and became and RN/phlebotomist. So every
day had short-term goals, short-term jobs. You go home at
night, you don't have to worry about somebody not doing what
they should have done when you go back in the next day. Every
day was a new job site, and working with a lot of nurses who
like myself had became very frustrated, and felt we are
somewhat responsible for creating a monster in nursing today.

Chambreau:

Where was the frustration, would you say? Is it in one
simple thing or is it a complicated frustration?

Wallingford:

Oh, I'm sure it's very complicated. I would like very

much to have a seminar. I would like very much to come back
and see what they're coming up with in academia as to what some
of the causes are. I think one of them is a lack of the
nursing schools like Stanford University.
Wallingford:

I was frustrated that I was not able to create a milieu in
which the patients could heal themselves.

Chambreau:

What was the difference? Is it something you could
describe? Like, for example, take your experience when you
were doing the psychology and the counseling in the oncology;
What was it that was the frustration? It wasn't working with
the patients, it wasn't a burnout sort of thing, was it?

Wallingford:

No, it wasn't a burnout. It was the political and
bureaucratic milieu of the hospital system, in which when you
had your masters degree and the young girl that was the
director of nurses didn't even have a degree, and you could see
so many things that were making life miserable for you and
preventing you from practicing nursing. We would work so many
hours overtime because they would cut the budget and then
because of personality conflicts, we had no say-so in providing
a safe area in which to practice our nursing with our patients.

Chambreau:

Do you think that's part of the problem now, why we're so
short of nurses in the hospital? It is just not a satisfying
experience? You didn't feel like you could do your thing.

Wallingford:

Constantly being taken off the floor and being taken
someplace else. Told that you have to give an enema in three
seconds, something like this.

Chambreau:

Well, thank you very much.
