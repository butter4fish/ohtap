Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five light-weight 'People' magazine-ish-type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.
Speaker 2: Okedokee.
Speaker 1: And they require a short answer.

Speaker 2: Nobody gets it all.
Story_ID: 116065
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then I'm gonna ask you about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, first of all, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Olean, O-L-E-A-N.  And her maiden name is Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N, Lathen.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in some place in Mississippi.  I don't know where, in 1930, 1930 I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about--
Speaker 2: November, November--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: November, 19--
Speaker 2: November 14.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  What do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side.  Can they, can you trace 'em back to slavery or Reconstruction or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any, any stories in that era, or?
Speaker 2: No, I mean the best I can do and fortunately is that my grandmother is still alive.  She's ninety-eight now, and her name is Maimie Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.  And she grew up in, as she, she called it, Yalobush [Yalobusha] County, Mississippi.  So my mother's family comes from that part of--it's the Delta--
Speaker 1: Well, wouldn't they call it--
Speaker 2: Yalobush County.
Speaker 1: Yalo?
Speaker 2: Yalobush.  I don't know how to spell Yalobush, but it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Yalobush County.  People from Mississippi know it.  It's, it's in the Delta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've heard of Yahoo City in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now it's Yalobush County.
Speaker 1: --Yalobush County, okay.
Speaker 2: --Yalobush County, Mississippi, and I, I don't remember the name of the town.
Speaker 1: Okay..
Speaker 2: It's either Coffeeville or Senatobia, because they lived in both.  But my family on my mother's side both lived in Coffeeville on Mississippi as well as Senatobia, Mississippi and Grenada, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Grenada is, you know, in the Delta.
Speaker 1: Did she have, did you, did, did you, the, did you grandmother talk about growing up and what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, she talked--yes, she does and she didn't, in the sense.  And I say that in a contradictory way because I think she's very indicative of her generation, in that they don't share a lot of the really sad stories of their time.  They tell you more of the uplifting ones.  And I think that that was just part of the way one survives and moves forward.  And she did talk about Yalobush County and her father being a, a farmer, mostly a sharecropper.  But she talks about how they always ate well, and they always had fresh beans and how there was a smokehouse at the back of the house where they used to cure their ham.  And they'd cure their meat to store it for the winter and how she drank out of like a calabash, you know--
Speaker 1: A gourd--
Speaker 2: A gourd, yeah, she drank out of a gourd as a kid.  And they had really, really fresh water, well water, 'cause they had a deep, deep well where they lived.  And she just remembers that--she still will tell you about how she remembers the taste of well water versus city water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she still does farming, as far as I'm concerned.  She lives in Wisconsin now.  Every year she, she's, she's planting.  At ninety-eight she'll plant; she'll have a, have a garden this year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They don't have any stories on that side that are passed down about the, you know, the end of slavery, or what, or Reconstruction, or any--
Speaker 2: They may have 'em--
Speaker 1: --anything like that--
Speaker 2: --but they don't tell 'em.
Speaker 1: They don't, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure they have them, but they don't tell 'em.
Story_ID: 116066
Speaker 1: Or even I guess, well, you were growing up during the Civil Rights Movement I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So was, was she, did she [mother Olean Lathen] express like any satisfaction with the changes after the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Well, what she would say is I mean--
Speaker 1: --or talk about how things have changed.
Speaker 2: The things that she tell us and I've learned in, you know, in, in passing growing up is that--[clearing throat]--excuse me--my grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side--it's actually my mother's stepfather, and then we'll talk a little later about my, my real grandfather, her first husband.  But they left Mississippi because there's no opportunity there.  And they did it, and they were part of that Great Migration.  And they did it, you know, sort of--the railroad, my grandfather--my step-grandfather--got a job on the railroad.  And that was really getting a good job in those days if you got to work on the railroad.  And my, my grandmother's older brother, Uncle Frank, he had also, he was working in a packing house in Omaha, Nebraska.  And so my grandmother, when my mother was a baby, moved, they move Iowa, believe it or not.  They moved to Iowa because my dad--my grandfather worked for the railroad, and my uncle worked at the packinghouse, and so they felt that Iowa, you could, they felt freer.  I mean to them, Iowa was freedom.  They could live where they wanted to.  They had a small, we called it a farm when I was a kid.  It wasn't a farm, but they had a house and the garden and you know, all that kind of stuff.  And, and by and large, people left you alone.  And so they left, they, they, they, they, they left Mississippi and moved to Iowa.  And the family on my mother's side started to migrate to Iowa and to Omaha, Nebraska, and to work in the plants at Armour Star, the, the meat packing place, and also for the Ford Motor Company.  So my, my step-grandfather stopped working for the railroad and began, as many African Americans did, working for Ford Motor Company.  And he worked for them out of Omaha.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't even realize a Ford was in Omaha, but that's--
Speaker 2: Maybe--he was working with somebody up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I think it was Ford.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it may not have been a big manufacturing plant, but--
Speaker 1: So your grandfather worked for Ford?
Speaker 2: Step-grandfather, actually--
Speaker 1: Step-grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: --when he left, after he left the railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he probably spent some time in the packing house too.  'Cause it all started with my grandmother's brother, Uncle Frank, going to Omaha working in the packing house, and hey, you could make a whole lot more money up here.  And you can have your own house and you know, all that kind of stuff, so that side really--I still have lots of relatives in, in Iowa.
Speaker 1: So was your mother, was your mother raised in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: --Iowa, basically?
Speaker 2: My mother doesn't have any memory of Mississippi.  She was raised in Iowa.  They left when she was very young, eighteen months old or so.  And so she went to school in, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, elementary and high school.  And they were integrated because there just weren't that many African Americans to support having a segregated school.  So my mother, you'll find that my mother's experience was very different than my father's experience when we, when we talk about my father.
Speaker 1: Council Bluffs is right across the river from Omaha.
Speaker 2: From Omaha.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and I spent--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --many summers up there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, we were just up there in the fall, North--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Omaha in an old black neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Council Bluffs, Iowa.  All right, so, so did your mother have any stories of growing up there and what it was like and--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, she says that she remembers, you know, they had, they lived in an apartment at first.  And there were black people, white people in the apartment building, and it was really no big deal.  And when she went to grade school in Council Bluffs that the only other black people around was, were her, were her two sisters.  It was like, they were the only (laugher), they were the only ones in the grade school.  And then by the time she hit high school, there were a few more African Americans.  But still, she was pretty much related to her.  They, my aunt, Uncle Frank's kids or some other relatives.  And there were a lot of immigrant white as well, mainly like Scandinavians and Germans in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: But she will, she would say that she didn't feel like she really encountered just in-your-face racism until when she was sixteen she moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to live with her real father.  But, where she was living in Council Bluffs, they didn't have, you know, the colored only and all that kind of stuff.  Her first encounter, real encounter with that was in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 116067
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1946 or so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she [mother Olean Lathen] is sixteen.  She goes to St. Louis [Missouri], so, it's St., St. Louis in the mid-'40s.  So she did encounter racism?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I, I remember it from '50s [1950s] going into the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she finish high school in St. Louis--
Speaker 2: Yes, no, in, in--
Speaker 1: --or in, or Iowa?
Speaker 2: St. Louis.
Speaker 1: St. Louis, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: That's where she met my dad [Levi Lathen] in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she go to Vashon [High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: No, it was--
Speaker 1: There's two of 'em I remember, and Vashon was one and--
Speaker 2: Not that one--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's another school which is now a grade school.  It's not even a high school anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--(unclear)--I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Sumter I think.
Speaker 2: Un-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, my dad was in school with Bill Clay, Congressman Bill Clay [D-Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So, well, did she like St., St. Louis better--I mean, socially, it had to be very different having other black people around, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't, you know, I don't think she would say that she liked St. Louis better, because, I, I mean she met my dad there, and then, you know, they fell in love and got married and all that.  But I don't think she liked, I don't--(unclear)--socially, yeah, there were more black people, but life was so restricted in terms of where you could go and what you could do and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, what, what, what did she do when she finished high school?
Speaker 2: Married my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, they got married young. I, I don't even know if they were done with high school.  They got married at--he was seventeen and she was eighteen, but he went to college early, so he was at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri]--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --in Jefferson City.
Story_ID: 116068
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's go him, and then we'll get 'em together, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter), all right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's deceased, but his name is Levi, L-E-V-I, Lathen.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Three, three thirty-two--the reason why I hesitate on these dates is that I, that there's, they don't have birth certificates, okay.  And so my father, I believe, was born in May 1933, May 31, 1933, but it could have been 1933, and the same thing with my mother.  She thinks 1930, but it could have been 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's not unusual, is it, for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--for people in that--
Speaker 2: Not, not in that age bracket and not if you're born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, no birth certificates, okay.  So, all right, so, and where was your father born?
Speaker 2: Grenada, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Grenada, okay.  Now, well, what, what do you know about his ancestors?
Speaker 2: I know a lot of my extended family on my father's side.  I knew my grandparents and great-grandparents on that side of the family.  And my great-grandfather said that he was a descendant of a slave, and he said that, he told us stories about when he was a child, he was--his father was a sharecropper, probably just one generation removed from slavery.  And he did talk about the brutality of just a sharecropper's life as a little boy.  And oddly enough, my, my great-grandfather's name was Sullivan Knox.  They called him Sal.  And odd, it was odd that he, he never had any formal education because he had to work in the fields in Mississippi, and yet, he's probably one of the smartest people I ever met, self-educated.  I mean, he could do math in his head and get the right answer.  And you never knew how he got there, but it was always the right answer.  He could read; he could write, but he was a self-taught person, my, my great-grandfather.  And my grandmother was, my father's mother, her name was Willie, Willie Olee, O-L-E-E, Lathen.  And her mother was named Florence Knox.  And I remember we called the, her mother--I have to give you the nicknames, 'cause we called them by nicknames.  Florence Knox, which was my great-grandmother, we called her Little Granny.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And her father, as I understand it, had been an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] minister or bishop, and I'm not clear which.  But he was clearly a minister, if not bishop, in the AME church.  And her maiden name was Brown.  She was also from Grenada, Mississippi.  And her daughter, you know, Willie, we called her Big Granny, 'cause she was a very, she was short but a very, very heavy lady.  So we just nicknamed her Big Granny.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And then I knew my great-uncles as well.
Speaker 1: That's a clue for somebody who wants to find out who this bishop is or--
Speaker 2: Exactly--
Speaker 1: --or yeah, Brown.  His last name was Brown?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So they were in Grenada, Mississippi, with my father, Levi.  And the story that gets told, and I don't--you know, there are so many iterations of stories, but the story that gets told is that--and I know this about my great grandfather because I definitely remember him--he had a very, very strong personality.  He was an extremely proud man.  And apparently, there's--he had gotten in an argument with the owner of the property about how much money he was due from his sharecropping proceeds.  And he had written it down, figured it all out, and the man was cheating him.  And so, basically, you know, he called him a derogatory name and told him you either take this or you take nothing.  And my great-grandfather, the story says, "Then I'll take nothing because, you know, you're a liar, cheat," all those kind of things.  My, my great-grandmother was like, and how am I gonna feed these kids if you take nothing?  Now that's one story I heard as to how then they decided that they would move North, because of the fact that there was not gonna be any income from that.  The other story I heard, and I don't--it can be some combination of the two.  And the other story I heard was that my great-grandfather was a very proud man and a very strong-willed man.  And my grandmother, my great-grandmother did not work.  He was very--he was the guy: I, I take care of my family.  My wife is gonna stay home just like white women do.  So the second story I heard was that he actually--there was an altercation between him and the Ku Klux Klan.  And the, and the Ku Klux Klan had supposedly come out to the house, and they were looking for him.  And he and my great-uncles had shotguns and were, and basically fought with the Ku Klux Klan, and so the family had to, to flee.  So those are the two stories I heard, and I am not certain which, if either of them, is correct.
Speaker 1: Well, both of them--
Speaker 2: Or both, it could be both, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like a--I mean it's a, there's a lot of stories like this--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --of them.  People--
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: --had to get out.
Speaker 2: Apparently the way it happened, though, is that my, the first part of the family to go were my grandparents, Willie and her husband DeWitt.  She married a guy, DeWitt Lathen, my, my grandfather.  And they had at that time two sons.  My father was the oldest and then my uncle, LeVert [ph.], the second child.  So they took the baby, LeVert, and they went to St. Louis [Missouri], my grand, grandmother and grandfather, with my uncle.  And my great-grandparents, and I don't know if it was either one or both, stayed in Mississippi till my grandfather could find work at a place in St. Louis.  And so then my father and my great-grandparents moved up to St. Louis to join them.
Story_ID: 116069
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your father [Levi Lathen] talk about growing up and what it was like for him in--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: You know what?  My father, he talked a little bit about St. Louis.  He would not talk about Mississippi.  And--
Speaker 1: How old was he when they moved up?
Speaker 2: He was--but they went, they would go back and see family and stuff.  He was young, probably he was grade school.  He was in grade school.  He was probably eight or nine when they moved to St. Louis.  And it's, it's--my father would not talk about Mississippi.  And he refused to go south.  He would, he didn't want to cross the Mason-Dixon Line.  It was a big deal when we came to Washington, D.C., in high school.  And so he just said he was never going south.  He wasn't gonna go any further south than St. Louis, which is where family was.  He would not go any further south than that.  And I'm sort of fast-forwarding a bit, but he never, during my, the whole time that I was growing up, we never went, we never went to the South; we never went to Mississippi, Tennessee and those places 'cause my father just refused.  And it is interesting that the summer of the last year of his life, when he knew he was dying, he got in the car, by himself, and he drove down to Mississippi.  And he went and he met with old people in Mississippi, and then he drove back to Wisconsin.  And that is the only time in my life that I know of my father being in Mississippi.  So, but I say that to say that, it was something that deeply affected him.  And it was not until he, near the end of his life that he felt forced to go back down there to deal with whatever the demons were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did he grow up in what they called the Ville area of, of St. Louis?
Speaker 2: He grew up in the projects in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: In the projects, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he grew up in the projects in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: All right, which ones, do you know--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, the ones that--they weren't the project projects like the ones built in the '60s [1960s].  These were the homes that were built around a square on--11th Street was one addr--address I know they lived on and then something called Brooklyn, and it was the inner city of St. Louis at that time.  But that's pre-high-rise, you know, type of--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's before Pruitt-Igoe and all that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But he grew up in the pro--in, you know, in a--I shouldn't call it projects, 'cause I don't know if they were legally, you know--
Speaker 1: I think they were called that--
Speaker 2: --government funded.
Speaker 1: --but they were better than what people now think are projects.
Speaker 2: I mean they were homes.
Speaker 1: I think they're saying they're, they were like--
Speaker 2: They were houses--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but they were like row kind of houses.  'Cause I remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my great-grandparents still lived in them when I was a kid.  And so I used to go down there, and, and, and, and by then, they had built project projects, the high-rises.  But these were still, you know, individual houses around like a square.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are similar ones in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the first ones they built were the low-rise.
Speaker 2: The low-rises, exactly.
Speaker 1: And they were considered a step up towards home ownership once you moved in.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't even an individual house.  they were almost like row houses--
Speaker 1: Row houses, yeah. yeah.
Speaker 2: --that were joined, yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--(unclear)--yes, they're, yeah, they're all over like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: But they're all, always considered a step up.  Not like--now when you say projects, young people and probably--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: Unless things change by the time somebody watches this video, they're gonna say, "Projects?", you know.  And they'll think of what--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, this was a community.  This was a, a community of Southerners who--it clearly was a step up from the sharecropping life, but it was inner-city segregated St. Louis.  And Saint--as I said, when I was a kid St. Louis was still very segregated.
Story_ID: 116070
Speaker 1: So we--he [father Levi Lathen] went to, he finished high school in St. Louis [Missouri] then?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, then went to Lincoln--
Speaker 1: And then went on to Lincoln.
Speaker 2: --Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Did, did, did he go to--is it--I, I think it's Sumter [High School, St. Louis, Missouri] and Vashon [High School, St. Louis, Missouri] are the two high schools that black people were going to in those days, but I'm not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, that was not the name of his high school.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And if you said it--
Speaker 1: --that's not it.
Speaker 2: --I'd know it, but that wasn't it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, but he went on to Lincoln University.
Speaker 2: At seventeen years old--
Speaker 1: What was his--
Speaker 2: --at sixteen.
Speaker 1: --field?  What was his field?
Speaker 2: His undergraduate field was music.  He loved music, and he played the trumpet.  And he wanted to be a music teacher.  And he, when he graduated in music, in, in those days, Lincoln University had a fantastic gospel choir.  It was just an amazing--and they traveled the country.  And so, but my father, he was a music major.  He played trumpet and he sang.  He was I believe a tenor.  But, you know, a black person couldn't find a job as just a music teacher.  You had to do more than be a music teacher, and so he ended up teaching in--I don't know if you've ever heard of Momence, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's down in southern Illinois.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember that, 'cause I was little then.  I was a preschooler.
Speaker 1: Momence is near [the University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] sort of, like going towards that way.  It's--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm, no, it's not far from Kankakee [Illinois].  It's outside of Kankakee.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that--okay, is that that area?
Speaker 1: That's, yeah, it's up toward--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, I don't know Notre Dame.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a, there's a big book distributor called Baker and Taylor Books that's up there.  But anyway, that's where I'm from (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, but--
Speaker 1: But Momence, I know where Momence is.
Speaker 2: Momence is un--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --unincorporated area outside of Kankakee, small black community.  And my father--in fact, the house that we moved in, it had been built for the teacher.  They--when we moved in it, it didn't have electricity or running water when, when we moved in.  We had a, we had a well in the front, which my mother was just petrified we were gonna fall in the well and drown.  Those were the stories you always heard.  Oh, my God, my kid's gonna fall in the well and drown.  And we had a kerosene lamp, which we thought were really cool, you know.  She didn't think it was so cool, but we thought all that was very, very cool.  And it was a small schoolhouse, and it was a, you know--and he taught--you just had to teach every subject.  He taught every subject; he taught every, everyone.  And it's said to see, 'cause read in the paper a couple of years ago that Momence hasn't changed all that much.  Yeah, they have a real school and all that.  But in terms of, you know, living, people living below the poverty line, it hasn't changed much at all.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now is there a story about how your parents met?  Did they tell a story about that?
Speaker 2: My mom [Olean Lathen] says that yeah, dad [Levi Lathen]--okay, even my father said the same thing, 'cause my mother's very, very, she's a very attractive woman, and, and plus she's a, she was a new kid in school, and he's a very pretty woman.  And so, my mom said that her cousin, she, my, my cousin, Hosie [ph.], my mother's cousin, they all went to the same high school.  And so, my dad kept--my dad was friends, friends with Hosie, and he kept saying, "Hosie, Hosie, you've gotta introduce me, introduce me, introduce me to, to your cousin."  And Hosie didn't wanna do that.  He said, "Nah, nah, she don't wanna be bothered with you, she don't wanna be bothered with you."  And he kept begging my cousin to introduce him, and so finally my cousin introduced mom.  And she said that, and she says, you know, people would say that she was a snob, but she wasn't.  She said that when she met him, she really, really liked him because he was smart.  And he was--my father was driven, you know.  He was very smart, he was very, very driven.  He was the top of his class.  You know, he played music.  He was involved in everything.  And she said she told her mother that she was, she was gonna marry somebody that was going someplace.  And she was not gonna marry someone who carried a lunch pale to work and, and had his name written on his shirt.  And that's why she got accused of being, you know, a snob.  And my mother is not a snob.  But my cousin introduced them, and that's how it, that's how they met (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's how it started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, all right.  Okay, now, how, how many--
Speaker 2: They also lived next door to each other too.  And she wouldn't talk to him either (laughter).  I'm sorry.  She--he lived, at that time, he was living with Little Granny, my great-grand, great-grandparents' house.  And she said he used to come over, used to come over all the time to her house, 'cause she was with, with her real father then, Arthur Jackson and, and his sister, Aunt Sophie.  And he used to always just kind of drop by to see Miss Sophie, Miss Sophie, but it was really about seeing mom.  So they were right, neighbors and high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, well, when you think about your parents' personalities, their talents, their dispositions, and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 1: I think people in my family would say that I am more like my father.  Certainly when I was younger, I was more like my father in the sense that absolutely goal-driven, absolutely goal-driven.  You know, if I gotta go bursting through a wall to get what I want and to achieve what I need to, to achieve, I would do that.  But, as I've gotten older, I understand actually that my parents were more alike than I thought they were.  My father was very much an extrovert and just loves being around people, and I'm very much like that as well.  My mother is one of those still-waters-run-deep people, but she was every bit as strong as my father was, less verbal about it and less in the limelight than my father was about it.  But I think in terms of being, you know, extroverted and being, you know, aggressive, I probably get that more from my father.  But they were both, they are or were both very, very hardworking, you know, could take the, the lumps that life threw at 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, do you have siblings?
Speaker 1: Oh, lots (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, how, how many of 'em--
Speaker 1: There are a total of six children.  I'm number two.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And I have four sisters and one brother, and that's why there are four sisters, 'cause there's only one brother (laughter).
Story_ID: 116072
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Couple, when I got in trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, is that the earliest childhood memory or--
Speaker 2: My parents [Levi and Olean Lathen] would say I was in trouble at an early (laughter) age.  Some of the earliest ones, the best ones are with my great-grandmother, Little Granny, in St. Louis [Missouri].  I would live, we lived in Kankakee [Illinois]-Momence area at that time, and we'd drive down to see them.  And I'd--it was like the car just couldn't get there, couldn't get there fast enough.  And I remember being in the kitchen with her and making biscuits, you know, those southern puffy biscuits, making biscuits, homemade cornbread.  And she had those iron skillets I couldn't lift.  They were so heavy, you couldn't lift 'em.  And I remember, the one I remember the most I think is the mornings, 'cause my great-uncles all worked in factories in, in St. Louis, Ford, mainly Ford.  They pretty much worked in the Ford Motor Company.  And that was a big extended family, and they all lived in my great-grandparents' house or in that same little complex, my great-uncles, great-aunts, I don't know how many, just tons of family members.  And I was preschool then, but I remember getting up early in the morning, 'cause my great-uncles were getting up to go to work.  And my great-grandmother would be doing their, those tin, they had the tin lunchboxes and their coffee canteen.  She'd feel up their coffee and their, their lunch buckets to take with them.  And then they'd sit down, and they had that breakfast of biscuits and the eggs.  And the bacon would be cured bacon.  It would be the bacon that my, my grandfather had cured, who lived out in the country, you know, that, that kept in the deep freeze during the winter.  And I would get up so I could have, so I could have breakfast with them.  And they would always have breakfast in their long johns, and I had short johns, my little short johns.  They sat there in their long johns, and she'd make me a lunchbox.  And I had my little canteen, and I'd sit there and eat breakfast with them.  And then I would put on my-quote-unquote--work clothes when they'd put theirs on, which of course was a dress and all that.  And I had my little lunch pale, even though I would be home with her in the daytime, and my little canister.  I could open it up, you know, just, just like them.  And, and it wasn't real coffee, but I thought it was.  She probably gave me 90 percent milk with a drop of coffee.  But that--
Speaker 1: That's a cute story.  I mean that's, it's--she, she really cared about you.  She--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have to tell you another little Granny story, because, you know, much of I think who anyone is as a child, you know, depends upon what you're told who you are, okay, 'cause you, then you see the world differently.  If they tell you you can conquer the world, you have no reason to believe that you can't.  And Little Granny used to--my--everybody used to always say, "Oh, she's really smart, she's really smart," okay.  I, I mean, and it they also would say, "Oh my God, you can't shut her up, she just"--there were two sides of me, depending upon whether you were the old-school, you know, like my great-grand, grandmother from my, my granddaddy, DeWitt, DeWitt Lathen, she just thought I had no manners, and that was because I didn't fall within the traditional mode of "yes ma'm," "no ma'm."
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: So that she was children are--
Speaker 1: --yeah, seen and--
Speaker 2: --to be seen and--
Speaker 1: --not--
Speaker 2: --spoken to, seen and not heard--
Speaker 1: --and not heard.
Speaker 2: That was not Little Granny.  And Little Granny would, we would sit in the summertime, and she would plat my hair, and in those days, 'cause they were always trying to grow your hair.  Now, I just cut it all off but.  And she'd sit and hold you between her thighs; you're just nestled, locked as she's pulling on this hair.  And you hated it as a little girl getting your hair combed.  And, but she would say to me: "You are really smart, and one day you are gonna be president of the United States," okay.  And she'd rub my head and she'd go: "You got smart bumps.  You got smart bumps.  You're gonna be president of the United States 'cause you are really smart."  And I believed her.  (Unclear)--little--(unclear)--I got smart bumps, I got smart bumps.  And we know that she was probably braiding my hair too tight; that's probably what those bumps were from (laughter).  But she told me I was smart, and she never lied to me about anything, and she treated me like that.  And she, oh, she used to protect me so.  Oh, my God, I remember I was a bed wetter, okay, and I'd get in trouble.  In those days they'd spank you if you wet the bed, which of course you'd go to bed scared to death so you wet the bed.  And Little Granny would get up in the morning early to change the sheets before my parents would come.  Or if she didn't get there in time, she'd grab me and say, "Teddy wet that bed again last night, didn't he?  Teddy.  We gotta give Teddy a bath," you know.  She was, she was an amazing woman, she was.  Because if you think about it, here, we're talking about in the, in the 1950s.  You've got a great-grandmother from Mississippi sitting in inner city St. Louis, you know, with signs all around 'em, "Colored need not apply," and all that kind of stuff, and she's saying to her great-granddaughter, "You're gonna be president of the United States."  I mean, you have to have a vision to, to see that.  And she imparted that, and that was part of our family fabric.  You know, my father was the first to go to college, but and then it was the whole extended family that made that possible.
Speaker 1: So Little Granny was his, his, his mother, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: His grandmother
Speaker 1: His grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: Big Granny was his mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: And she was a beautician.
Story_ID: 116073
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's, that's a great story.  Now, what were some of--well, since we're on the subject, what were some of the other sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We spent a lot of time in St. Louis [Missouri], and I remember the sights, and the sounds, and the smells.  My Little Granny and my great-grandfather, Knox, Granddaddy Knox, they lived in the city, in the inner city.  But Big Granny and her husband, Granny DeWitt, they lived in rural Missouri.  So we had that contrast between the urban life, where you heard everything, and then going out to where my grandparents lived, and they had pigs and chickens and you know.  You had to go get the eggs from under the chicken, which I didn't like doing.  And so it was a contrast.  But they brought the South with them.  They very much brought the South with them.  And church was very key.  We spent so much time in church, you know.  All the free time was pretty much in, spent in, in a small Baptist church.  And I remember all the picnics and all the food.  Every summer I would come home and my mother would go oh, my gosh, you can't wear any of the school clothes I bought you.  You know, two weeks into school you were back into your clothes.  But you know, so much of love was food, and so they fed you all the time.  I remember that much, and I remember going to Big Granny's garden and canning vegetables, you know, and making peach preserves, doing the stuff that I couldn't do it now.  No one even knows it, but the mason jars and pouring the wax, you know, and all that kind of stuff I remember and listening to the women sitting there, ah, their snapping their beans, telling stories, talking, talking and telling you to leave the room when they had to really talk (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: So did they make sure you were gone, or did you get a chance to hear some of the stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, we used to--I know you're back there.  Go on out of here (laughter), you know.  You try to hide and hear some of them, but you wouldn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --many of 'em 'cause they, they were pretty smart women.
Story_ID: 116074
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, where did you go to school?  Where, where, where, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Hmm, okay, I--
Speaker 1: Was that in Momence [Illinois] or?
Speaker 2: I, I went yeah, vague recollection of being a preschooler in Momence, and then spending kindergarten in Kankakee [Illinois], 'cause by then my dad was teaching in the Kankakee school system.  And so I think I spent kindergarten and first grade there.  And then my--
Speaker 1: You, you remember the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nope, I know we lived Burt Street in Kankakee.  I remember that.  And think, I think I did kindergarten, first grade, and possibly second there.  And then my father got a scholarship to Eastern Michigan University Teachers School [Eastern Michigan University College of Education, Ypsilanti, Michigan] to do a master's degree, so we moved to Michigan.  We moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan.  And I spent third and, I spent third grade, maybe part of second, but I know I spent third grade in Ypsilanti, Michigan, 'cause he was there for like eighteen months.  So I probably spent part of second and, second grade and all of third grade in Ypsilanti, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, you remember the name of the school in Ypsilanti?
Speaker 2: [Nodding no.]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, it's--
Speaker 1: Was it a mixed school?  I mean were there black--
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I was gonna--
Speaker 1: --black and white--
Speaker 2: No, until, up, up, up until this point in my life, I had been in pretty much totally all-black environments because of the way--you know, St. Louis [Missouri] was segregated; Momence was black; Kankakee, I had black teachers in Kankakee.  And all I remember is Kankakee being black, and Ypsilanti was still pretty much where we lived, a black area, the school was predominantly black.  And so my first encounter with being a non-majority, actually, was when we moved to Elgin [Illinois] when I was in fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your, your father was hired by the Elgin school system?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, after he got his master's, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was in fourth grade then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, Elgin.
Speaker 2: Prior to that time, I remember having only one white teacher.  That was in Kankakee in second grade, but the school was still predominantly black.  And let's just say, that teacher had issues.  That's all I can remember as a second--I mean, nowadays, she would definitely have been fired.  I mean she--
Speaker 1: What did she do?
Speaker 2: Okay, if, and you know, and when you, when you're a kid you don't tell your parents these things 'cause you think you'll get in trouble or something's wrong  'cause teachers are supposed to be right.  But I remember being petrified of her in second grade, because if you would color outside of the lines, she'd hit you.  If you slurped your straw, she'd hit you.  And she used to always give it to the boys, but she'd hit 'em in the nose and give 'em bloody noses.  And then she'd be all caring like, you know, fixing them up.  She was bizarre.  That's, that's all, and that was actually my first encounter with anyone white in my life was that woman, was her.  So then that sort of--so then when I moved to Elgin in the fourth grade, I was like, ut-oh, not another one of them.  (Laughter) Is she gonna give me a bloody nose.  I mean that--'cause that's how kids think.
Story_ID: 116075
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was the name of your school in Elgin [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: McKinley Grade School [McKinley Elementary School, Elgin, Illinois], that's the first one I can remember--
Speaker 1: McKinley.
Speaker 2: --is McKinley.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have a favorite subject at school?
Speaker 2: I always liked history, and I liked English.  I was good at reading.  I was good at reading and writing and history; those kind of things I really loved, and I loved biographies, 'cause I loved history.  So I would read like anything that was biographical or autobiographical.  And, and reading and those kinds of things came very, very easy for me.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite story--I mean a favorite biography that, in those days?
Speaker 2: I just--
Speaker 1: Favorite person?
Speaker 2: Well, later on, it was Eleanor Roosevelt I know, but I just read, 'cause I probably didn't start reading biographies till probably like junior high school.  I just loved to read.  My mother would say I'd sit and read the cereal box.  I just wanted to read.  I just loved to read, because I loved stories, and that's how you got stories.
Speaker 1: Was, was TV or radio important--
Speaker 2: Oh, we had, our house was very strict.  During the school week, TV--you, if you--TV didn't, in grade school TV didn't come on.  You might get, get one hour before you went to bed, but that was it.  It was homework and you read.  And we had reading hour at home, which I really liked.  We would, each child got to pick a book that the family would read, and my parents would read aloud to us.  And so we had this reading hour, and we'd wait for it. We'd sit there, and either mom or dad were reading out loud to us, just a part of the book, and until we had finished the books.  So we spent much more time as a family during our reading hour.  But TV, you could watch on the weekends, not during the week.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Unless somebody black was on TV.  That was an exception now.  When Nat King Cole had his show, that thirty-minute show, we got to watch that.  We were barred from ever watching 'Amos and Andy,' 'cause that was too humiliating, and my parents said no, that we won't let you watch that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so they actually were ahead of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on that, I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they were like no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you're not watching 'Amos and Andy' and any of that kind of stuff that is, that portrays us in a bad light.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and what, what about the movies.  Did you go to move, to movies?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, our parents would take us to the movies.  We, we, and we saw all the movies that every American saw, you know, 'Sound of Music' and you know, the, the typical family kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now did you have any ideas of becoming a lawyer when you were in grade--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --in grade school [McKinley Elementary School, Elgin, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I did indeed.
Speaker 1: How did they manifest themselves?  How did--
Speaker 2: Well, let me start--I'll tell you how it started.  It started actually watching the Civil Rights Movement and, and more--I shouldn't say watching the Civil Rights Movement.  It's more watching my parents' reaction to the Civil Rights Movement.  And so it started--I remember we, we were running around the house, and my father said, "Stop, there's something very important going on here."  And I just, I was thinking--I was probably, I don't' know, maybe ten at the time, may, maybe a little older.  I don't, not certain.  But I said, "Oh, gosh, it's another minister on TV I gotta stop and listen to."  And it was Martin Luther King, and he was doing the, his, his 'I Have A Dream' speech.
Speaker 1: Okay, from the [1963] March on Washington?
Speaker 2: From the March on Washington.  I didn't realize, but whatever it was, it mesmerized me.  He wasn't just another minister.  I was mesmerized by him.  And I stood there and my siblings, and we stood and watched, and I watched our parents.  And I could only think of really--besides that time, three times--twice in my life that I ever saw my father cry.  One was when he watched that speech.  I said whoo, something's happening here, daddy's crying.  And my, both my parents had tears in their eyes.  And the only two times was when Little Granny died and his mother died, okay.  So I knew something pretty awesome was going on, and so I started to follow that more.  And you couldn't help, growing up during that time period, you know, the kids are getting blown up in churches in Birmingham [Alabama].  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that summer was a--
Speaker 2: It was '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Some, some, something was going on every--
Speaker 2: Something was going on.
Story_ID: 116076
Speaker 1: And so I was very, very much impacted by that, but I was impacted more by the way the movement used law to bring about social change.  And so I became interested in law because it was this mechanism to bring about social change.  And I couldn't have articulated it to you at that point in time, but that's what, you know, I now realize what was going on.  Because I also saw a change in my, in my life and my par--because my parents now beginning upward mobility.  You know, my father [Levi Lathen] had gotten the scholarship.  He'd finished his master's.  He was making more money.  We moved into a bigger house, and yet, he would still look at a newspaper, and it would say, "Colored need not apply."  You know, so, and, and my grandfather, my mother's [Olean Lathen's] father, worked on a boat in, which was a, like a--(unclear)--a boat that went up and down the Mississippi [River], one of those entertaining boats.  And it was segregated.  They, you know, colored could only go on Wednesday nights.  It was odd nights that we could go. And so I had a bitterness but a hopefulness at the same time.  And because the bitterness was I remember we went to pick up my real grandfather, you know, Arthur Jackson.  We went to my, my, my step-grandmother took us to pick him up from the boat.  And I remember reading a sign saying, I don't know what night it was, but, you know, "Monday is ladies' night."  And I said to my grandfather--we called him Pops-"Oh, Pops, you should take," you know, "Aunt Rose," which is what we called his wife, "to ladies' night."  He says, "Oh no, colored women, that's not for colored women.  That's for white women only."  And I said, "But it says ladies' night, and she's a lady."  And the car just went quiet, and it was a quiet that you knew you'd better not say anything else.  You could not ask any more questions.  So I had that sort of bitterness still, that I remembered being so upset about that.  But at the same time I saw Martin Luther King, and I saw these people marching and doing stuff to make things different, and I saw different things happening.  And so that's really what got--that's a long answer to what got me interested in law, but that's what got me interested.  And then I started following Thurgood Marshall.  By junior high school I was following Thurgood Marshall and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was gonna ask you well, what legal aspect of this could you observe, you know, as a kid on T--I mean, did you, I mean--
Speaker 1: What I could--when the Civil Rights Act was passed, when Lyndon Johnson got the Civil Rights Act passed in '64 [1964], that's how, you know--then they took--they started--the newspaper didn't say, "Colored need not apply."  It was just listed jobs.  You know, I naively believed that that meant that you could, that everything was fine now.  But it was a first step.  And it was--I started looking and tried--by the time I was fifteen or so, I was really reading those, looking at the Supreme Court decisions that were coming out and saying how things were changing and hearing it on the news.
Speaker 2: And did you get a lot of news, and did, did your family get 'Jet' or--
Speaker 1: Oh, of course.
Speaker 2: --any, any of the black papers?
Speaker 1: Abso--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: We were a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  We got 'Jet'; we got 'Ebony,' yep; 'Chicago Defender.'
Speaker 2: And maybe the 'Crisis' too.  I don't know if, if you remember.  Did you get that?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I wouldn't have--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --been--yeah, but--
Speaker 2: But you got the 'Defender' too?
Speaker 1: [Nodding yes.]
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Even though we lived in, you know, in Elgin [Illinois] we did.  But, and my father was very much into, I mean he was one of the first people who started researching, doing research on black history and telling us stop about Crispus Attucks and all the stuff, 'cause it wasn't in the history books.  And he would, he was researching and, and taught us children about it.
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting.  That's--and, and unique too, 'cause a lot of--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and we read.  And by the time I was in junior high school, it was not part of the, the junior high school program, but I was reading Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen and all of those people because my parents were into us knowing who we were.
Speaker 2: But nobody was talking about it in school--
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Speaker 2: --or, yeah.  I remember when I guess when we were both young, CBS did a couple of Langston Hughes short stories on one of those Sunday morning shows.  I, I know--
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: --I saw one, and I was asking--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my parents who was Langston Hughes.  I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, didn't, didn't know.
Story_ID: 116077
Speaker 1: So, but that started, so.  But I was also, there's another part of me that my friends will tell you--probably still remains, though I think into some--I was outrageously competitive.  I just wanted to win.  I wanted to win anything.  I would just compete to compete to compete.  I mean, now I, I pick and choose what (laughter) I will compete in.  But when we were--I guess I was eight or nine, and we took a family vacation to the East Coast.  It was a camping trip.  We were campers.  And we were in Boston [Massachusetts] and with--can you imagine this family of six, probably had the dog with us too, with a camper trailer attached to it, drive around Harvard Square with these Illinois plates, you know, hick, hick, hick (laughter), right.  And my father [Levi Lathen] pointed out Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He said, "That's Harvard University.  It's the number one school in the world."  That's what he said.  I sat up, stopped fighting with my, you know, brothers and sister, brother and sister in the backseat, said "Number one? Hmm."  He said--and I said to him, I said, "Do they let colored people go to school there?"  He goes, "Yeah, look, look, see them walking around campus now."  And then, that's when I set the goal.  I said, "I'm going to Harvard."  But it had nothing to do with Harvard, 'cause I thought Harvard, actually from the perspective of buildings and stuff, I thought it was ugly.  It was just because it was number one, and I was just extraordinarily competitive.  But at eight I said, eight or nine I said, "I'm going to that school 'cause it's number one."
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, and you actually saw it and you know, and for yourself on some level.
Speaker 1: But, you know, if my dad hadn't said it was number one, I was just eh, bunch of ugly buildings with, with weeds growing out of 'em.  But (laughter), you know, he said it's number one.  Number one?  I, I felt like I had something to prove.  I was, because I was in a school environment.  Elgin [Illinois] was at that time an outrageously racist school [system], okay.  And it was always this uphill fight, I mean, and they were just very blatant and open about it.  You know, I, I remember when I went to, to take a foreign language [at Larsen Middle School, Elgin, Illinois].  The teacher told me, "Colored people don't speak foreign languages.  You don't need a foreign language."  And so we were fighting for--my parents lived at that school.  And it got to the point where they're just like okay, just give them what they want 'cause they're gon' give you a hard time, okay.  So I was out to prove, you know, I had to prove myself.  I'm gonna get As; I'm gonna be number one; I'll show you, I'll show you, I'll show you.  And for many, many, many years I was driven by that I'll show you.  You know, now I'm like, I don't have to prove anything to anybody.  But, and so, that's what, that was part of what the Harvard was about.  It's like all these people trying to tell me what I couldn't be, and I was gonna show them what I could be.
Story_ID: 116078
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Elgin High School [Elgin, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Elgin High School.  Was that, what did you have--so you were, at that time were you determined to be a lawyer--
Speaker 2: Still.
Speaker 1: --and to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  You knew you (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't go to Harvard undergraduate.  I went to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] undergraduate.
Speaker 1: I know.  Let's get through--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Elgin High School now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in clubs and--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: --running for class office.
Speaker 2: Everything.  Name it, name it, I was in it.  I, but I was always curious.  You know, it was more out of curiosity than anything.  And you know, I was, I took German, and Spanish, and I was in whatever the government, student government body was, and I did sports.  I loved soccer.  I played soccer.  I played basketball.  I did drama, I mean, just about everything.
Speaker 1: Did you become a national merit scholar?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, 'cause I didn't know what that was at that time or how to apply for it or anything.  But I was, when I graduated, I'm--there were like 550 people in the class, and I was like number 10 out of that 550.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know if that--
Speaker 1: About how many black students were in--I mean, per, proportion-wise, I guess.
Speaker 2: Proportion-wise, at that point in time--(unclear)--has changed since then, but we were probably less than five percent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you--so you served in student council, but you--yeah, okay.  You didn't get to be the president?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I had never thought--I just assumed that I wouldn't be.  In fact, one year--in fact, so I never ran for president.  I, I ran--I take it back.  I remember running for, for student council and I won.  And then I do remember I think I did run for president.  And I just assumed, I said ah, there's no way that they're gon' elect little black me president of the student council, and I came in second.  I was shocked, I was shocked, I really was shocked.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was in the band.  I played in the band.  I was the only black member of the band.  I played clarinet at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact, I have to tell you, before that I was an activist before I knew I was an activist.  When I was in junior high school, I was very much into drama.  And I went to--(unclear)--Larsen Junior High School in Elgin [Larsen Middle School, Elgin, Illinois]. And they were doing this play, you know, Anne [sic] Keller?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the miracle worker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the miracle worker.  And so I, I, I, I auditioned for Anne Keller.  Am I--(unclear)--her name right?
Speaker 1: Helen Keller.
Speaker 2: Helen Keller, thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Helen Keller.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sorry--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, so I went and auditioned for, for--I didn't think twice about it.  I went and auditioned for Helen Keller.  They said, "Well, you can't be Helen Keller."  I said, "Well, why not?"  They said, "But you're colored."  I said, "Well, it's a play," you know.  I said, "It's a play."  And so, they said well, but you know, "You can be a nurse, but you can't be her."  I led a protest at school.  I said that's not right.  I led a protest.  Remember, I had led two protests at, at Larsen Junior High School and got other kids to walk out and protest with signs with me about how unfair that was.  And so they kicked me out of school.  And my parents [Levi and Olean Lathen] came up to, to school and said oh, "She's right."  So--
Speaker 1: So you were kicked out of junior high school for that, for that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for that, for the leading that--I led two protests, that one, because I said, "That's not right."  And my parents said, "That's not right."  So, they had their behind-the-scenes discussions, and they let me back in.  And they put me in the play as a nurse.  They said okay, we gotta quiet her up or something, but they didn't make me Helen Keller, okay.  So then the second protest I led (laughter)--my mother can tell you the story, and they stood right there behind me--was they instituted rule, they had these rules that girls couldn't wear pants to school.  You know how cold it is in the Midwest.  We couldn't wear pants, and they had a rule, no afro; you, you couldn't have afros.  This is Elgin, Illinois.  I'm like, well, who are you to tell me that I have to straighten my hair.  And by the way, you, you couldn't have afros, and you couldn't have picks.  Girls couldn't have afros, and you couldn't have picks, and girls couldn't wear pants to school.  So, so I had, I had three big issues.  I got black, white, and everybody out there on that one.  So all of us were, they got out there protesting about all of those issues, so they kicked me out of school again for being a radical.  My parents appeared at school again (laughter), you know, and got me back in and said, "She's right, she's absolutely right."  And you know, you know, you always, you walk around with these yardsticks measuring how short girls' skirts are, and then they want to put on pants.  And you tell them they can't wear pants, you know.  And of course, you can't tell somebody that they have to straighten their hair, that they cannot wear an afro.
Speaker 1: Their own natural hair (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, this would be my hair (laughter), okay.  So, those were--so, the Lathens had a reputation of, you know, big action-oriented.  And then, so by the time I hit high school [Elgin High School, Elgin, Illinois], you know, they had said I was a "radical," but I was smart.  And my father also was very well--my parents were very well respected in the community.  My father actually got so upset with the Elgin school system that he ran for the school board, and he won, and he joined the school board.  So when he became, after he became a board member, my life got a lot easier, because they were like okay, let's not--her dad's on the school board.  Let's not really make him crazy.  But they had also moved us into what I call the, the "good negro" category, if you know, if you know what I mean, which I didn't like too well either.
Speaker 1: Gotta be responsible.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 116493
Speaker 1: So, did they have like a student court in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I know some schools have that, where, you know, they have a student--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Not then, we didn't, we didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, they may now but certainly not then.
Speaker 1: Were you a debater?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, no, I must not have.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: I did speech class, which, you know, you had to write and give speeches and that kind of thing, but I didn't do a debate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I wish I had of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were a senior, you, you knew you were gonna get to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] one day, but you ended up going to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], which is, that's pretty good.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --but, but, but what--how did that happen?
Speaker 2: What happen was I had a Girl Scott teacher, leader--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: I had a Girl Scout leader, who, Mrs. Brunton (ph.), she had gone to Cornell.  And every time she talked about Cornell, her eyes just lit up.  I mean, she just talked about Cornell, how fantastic it was.  And so I went to the 'Encyclopedia Britannica,' which we had at home, and I looked up Cornell University in upstate New York.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ithaca, yeah.
Speaker 2: And it talks about what a beautiful campus it was and the waterfalls and the--(unclear)--gorge.  And so, and we had been camping in upstate New York, and I remember how beautiful it was.  And then I read that it was an Ivy League School, and it, and it'd always been co-ed.  It'd always been co-ed, and I didn't know at the time, but they had, had always admitted African Americans as well from the inception of the school.  And I wanted to go to Cornell.  I mean, I was inspired by her.  I looked at her, and I read the encyclopedia.  And they had always taken women, and so I really wanted to go to Cornell.  I, I had written to Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for an application, 'cause at that time they were separated, Harvard and Radcliffe.  And I remember getting the Radcliffe application, and they had all this thing about, basically, your pedigree on it at this time.  They asked you, "Did your father go to Harvard?" "Did your mother go to Radcliffe?" "Can you have someone from the Senate or the House of Representatives or your local congressman write you a recommendation?"  And I was intimidated by it.  I'm like, well, they don't want me, 'cause I don't know anybody.  Charlotte T. Reid [R-Illinois] is not gon' write me a recommendation, 'cause that was our, you know, congresswoman at the time.  And Cornell's application was nothing like that.  I mean, it was a very open, you know, write your essay, and it'll ask you if you have family members.  But I felt by, I was intimidated by the Radcliffe application.  I didn't even apply.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds as if it was intended to intimate those who were not in the, in the--
Speaker 2: In the family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that group.
Speaker 2: And so I said well, it's the law school I wanted to go to anyway.  And I really in my heart wanted to go to Cornell.  And there are some times in our life where you intuitively know something.  It may not be rational, but you intuitively knew it, and I intuitively knew that I would be happy at Cornell.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I got in.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ithaca, New York, was described by the 'Utne Reader' as the best town in America, best place to live (laughter).  So, I don't know.  Is there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know about.  It was a great place to be a student.  I can't imagine, you know, wanting to be there as a single woman in Ithaca, but it was a great--it's a--Cornell dominates the place.  And, and Cornell is an undergraduate-oriented campus, and it was a great place to be a student.  I mean, I just loved Cornell, absolutely loved it.
Story_ID: 116494
Speaker 1: Okay, so, we were saying off camera that 1969, the black students took over I think an administration building or dormitory or something, and they named it, and--
Speaker 2: It was Willard Straight Hall [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], student union.
Speaker 1: They called it Ugima Hall I think or something.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, Ujamaa is different.
Speaker 1: That wasn't--
Speaker 2: Ujamaa is housing that was, that came during my time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was a dorm.  But it was Willard Straight Hall.  They took, they, they took over the Straight.  That was the Straight Takeover, and that's a couple of years before I got there, which is interesting 'cause I was--when I applied to Cornell, and my father [Levi Lathen] said, "That's that school where those radicals are.  You're not going to school there.  They had guns.  You know, that's that school."  I said, "Now daddy," they--and, and they were going, and they were going co-ed as well.  And that was like two whammies for him, like, what?
Speaker 1: Oh, the, the dormitories--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The dorm, the dorms were--
Speaker 1: --co-ed dorms, okay.
Speaker 2: --going co-ed, and he remembered the Straight takeover, which had happened in '69 [1969], and I was applying in '70 [1970].  So he's like, "Oh no. No daughter of mine is gonna go to that radical place, and I don't believe in these co-ed dorms."  And so that was a family fight for quite a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, it'll nothing like Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] I guess when he was there.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely not.  Lincoln had women's dorm and men's dorms and, and all of that.
Speaker 1: And people watching out to make sure that nobody--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that you got in at curfew.  There were no curfews.  And in fact, when I got accepted at Cornell, I remember they used--they sent out a letter, 'cause they were doing this, this, you know, this transition to, to co-ed dorms, or maybe they had done it.  It was maybe the first or second year.  And they sent this letter saying, to the parents, saying, you know, "We don't believe in the loco parentis."  You know, a university is a place for children--for, for students, young adults to experiment and to get, you know, the world view.  And my father's like, "What do you mean you don't believe in loco parentis?  I'm sending you my child.  I'm sending you my most precious thing.  You'd better believe in"-- (laughter) so.  And my father actually did not want me to go to Cornell.  He really wanted me to be closer to home.
Speaker 1: What about your mother [Olean Lathen]?  How did she feel about it?
Speaker 2: My mother wanted me to go where I would be happy.  And, and it was, it was, it was a pretty big fight.  I mean, my father was like, "I'm not gonna pay for you to go to Cornell."  And luckily, I got a scholarship and financial aid to go there.  And in the end, he would have admitted that it was the right decision, but at that time, he wasn't ad, admitting it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did you, did, did you visit the campus before you enrolled or did you--
Speaker 2: No, no, I told you--
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: --in my heart I knew it's where I wanted to go.  Now, what I got as a graduation present from my parents was a trip to Ithaca [New York].  I went up with a high school friend of mine to see it after I had been accepted and after I had, had decided I was gonna go.  But there were six of us.  There was--my parents couldn't drive around.  It's not like today where people will take their kids on college tours. We didn't do that.  You looked at the catalog, I mean, but we didn't go on a college tour and all that.  You know, there are three of us going to college at one time in different--we were staggered, but, no.  I just knew in my heart it's where I wanted to be when I got there.
Speaker 1: So you were the second child right?  So, so--
Speaker 2: Un-huh, my oldest sister went to Lincoln.
Speaker 1: --the oldest sister went to Lincoln, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 116495
Speaker 1: So Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] was a lot different from Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and it was in upstate New York, and it was from home.  And I will tell you two stories here.  One is, relates to Elgin High School [Elgin, Illinois], because when I got, when I, when I was--I had a guidance counselor there whom I will never forget her.  I forgot, I forgot her name, but I remember her.
Speaker 1: What did she say?
Speaker 2: She told me: "Well, now, you're a pretty girl.  You could be a flight attendant.  And colored people aren't intellectuals.  They're good at sport and music."  And I said to her, I said, "I am in the top one percent of my class, okay.  I have like a 3.8 overall average" or whatever.  You know, I got like high honors and all this kind of stuff.  And she says well, "Now the colored people on the East Coast, they're different than you.  You come from a good family, but they're radicals out there.  And--oh, yeah, they're radicals out there.  And the white kids that will be going to that school, they will be coming from prep schools.  And you know, you'll be very lucky if you could, if you could just maintain a C it will be very hard.  You'll struggle there.  But if you went to a small girls' college, if you don't wanna be a flight attendant you could get, get better grades, okay."  So, I said psst, went on.  That's why I got that I'll show you in me.  So when I got to Cornell I was petrified, because she told me all this negative stuff about the radicals and the white people coming from the prep schools, and I'd be lucky to get C's.
Speaker 1: We hear these stories every day.  I mean every--
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: --time I do an interview I hear the, the counselor--
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: --story.  That's--
Speaker 2: The counselors.  So, I'm sitting there.  I remember my very first class at Cornell was a biology class.  And I'm sitting there hearing these strange accents, 'cause everybody's from New York and New Jersey and you know, you know.  And the New Yorkers are saying, "I'm from the city."  They're all slick in their letter jackets, you know.  This is the '60s [1960s]--I mean '70s [1970s]; this is the '70s [1970s].  And I'm from this small town, Elgin, Illinois, and everybody's from these big cities.  Sitting in biology class, and the professor was a visiting professor who was British.  And I had been very good in biology, and he's going over stuff that I think I should know, and he's talking.  And I, I could hear that counselor's voice in the back of my head, saying oh, "You'll be lucky to get a C.  You'll be lucky.  They're all," you know, "They went to prep schools."  And he kept talking about "aahminnow acids," "aahminnow acids," "aahminnow acids."  I'm like, what the hell is an aahminnow acid?  It's got to be something basic.  Oh, my gosh, I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble, till finally he wrote it on the board.  And he was saying amino acids (laughter), okay.  I said [exhale breath] and I breath sigh of relief.  The counselor was wrong (laughter), you know, like I know what an amino acid is, and then my first semester I made the dean's list.  And I took my grades back to her, and I said, "Look, I've got," you know, "a sister behind me.  Don't talk to her.  If you can't say anything positive or encouraging to her, don't talk to her, and here are my grades, you know."
Speaker 1: These, we have about a, we have hundreds of these counselor stories like this.  I mean, anybody listening to this is listening to more than one of these interviews has heard this and you know, a few times now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I had that I'll show you, I'll show you.  But what Cornell did for me was, I was able to move a lit, little bit beyond the I'll show you and started to do things that were really of interest to me.  It really was a universal opening--
Speaker 1: Let me--
Speaker 2: --experience--
Story_ID: 116496
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I didn't ask you this when you, we were in high school, but now I'm jumping back a little bit, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you have any, were there any special teachers or mentors--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in, in high school before you got to--
Speaker 2: High school and grade school.  I think, you know, we all get our blessings in life, and I--and thank you for coming back because there, in grade school [McKinley Elementary School, Elgin, Illinois] was a lady named Mrs. Hart.  And Mrs. Hart was my fifth-grade teacher.  In my fourth grade, I had moved to Elgin [Illinois] in fourth grade, and it was a disastrous experience.  I mean it was just awful, and I was really shaken in terms of my confidence because I had a teacher who was just straight out racist.  And I don't use that world--I do not use that word frequently at all because I don't believe in, you know, blaming racism on all the bad things that happen.  I use that sparingly, let me put it that way.  And as a kid I didn't know that was what was going on.  I was internalizing it, thinking that it was me.  But it was things like, you know, if I missed one thing on a spelling test I would get a D.  Okay, if I missed two she'd give me an F.  She had a different grading scale for the black kids than she did for the white kids, but we didn't know that.  And so my grades came in.  My parents said, "What's going on here?"  And I said well, I just started crying.  I said, "If I get one wrong she gives me a D, and if I get two--but the other kids, they miss one, they get Bs and As.  I don't know how to get an A."  And then that's--and so, I mean, then my parents were up at school again.  I was blessed to have parents who had the time to go up there and call them on it.  A lot of the other kids didn't get that.  So, I say all this to say that, by the time I hit fifth grade, I was really, my confidence was really, really bruised.  And Mrs. Hart, who was white, she built it back up again.  She was my Little Granny.  At that point, Little Granny had died.  She died when I was in fourth grade, so fourth grade was awful.  Little Granny died.  I got this woman who, who's a teacher who's giving me, who can't wait to give me an F, you know, and was not at all supportive.  And fifth grade, Mrs. Hart steps in, and she was, "You're really smart; you're gonna go places," and she, she helped me to recover my confidence and to have the courage to really go out there and, and, and, and, and, and be an intellectual, I mean to, not to be an intellectual--who's an intellectual in fifth grade--but to be smart.  Mrs. Hart, I will always remember.  And, and she, she gave me back my confidence, and she also changed my opinion on race.  Because the first teacher I, he first white teacher I had gave people bloody noses.  The second one kept trying to flunk me.  But she came back and saw me, and she nurtured me, and cared for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that would be in, in grade school.  In high school [Elgin High School, Elgin, Illinois] there was a guy who was a political science teacher, our history teacher, who was progressive for living in a town like Elgin, Illinois.  And we talked about world issues, and we, we moved beyond just U.S. issues.  And I can't for the life of me--now I'm sitting here having a senior moment.  His first name was Jim.  I can't remember his last name.  But he was, he helped me to see beyond Elgin.  And our family traveled and every--and we, we traveled as a family, but he helped me to think beyond Elgin.  And they thought he was a radical, and he wasn't.  He was just a thinking man, and I would definitely--those two people.
Story_ID: 116497
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], now, who were some of the, the key personalities on campus: students, teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, well, some of the people who are now famous from Cornell was a guy named Mario Baeza.  He was a couple of years ahead of me.  And then we have Zach Carter [Zachary W. Carter], who's a federal judge in New York now [subsequently Corporation Counsel of the City of New York].  He was a year ahead of me--just, you know, probably just a host of people.
Speaker 1: Now, what did Mario Baeza do?
Speaker 2: Mario Baeza is Cuban-Ameri--Cuban, he's Cuban-American but not, well, I think he was born in Cuba.  He's a black Cuban born in Cuba who grew up in I think in Florida.  And he's been, he's an extremely successful businessman.  And I don't know all of his business but an extraordinarily--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --successful businessman.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, Zack Carter, now you said he's a judge?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, of New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was pra--he was the, the D.A., district attorney, for New York, and that now he's a federal judge I believe in New York.  And I just, I mean, there's just so, so many people.
Speaker 1: Now, did you major in history or, or--
Speaker 2: Government.
Speaker 1: --political science--
Speaker 2: I was a government major.
Speaker 1: Government, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called it government at Cornell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was, was James Turner there?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was head of the Africana Study Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right, James Turner.  You must have been kind of Dr. Ben [HM Yosef Ben-Jochannan] I guess.  Was, was he--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --teaching there or--
Speaker 2: --he was teaching there as well.
Speaker 1: John Henrik Clarke, I think part time too--
Speaker 2: He was still there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Umbata (ph.), Professor Umbata has died since then, but Professor Umbata was there, but a whole host of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any particular teachers that were, you know, mentors at Cornell or took a special interest or you had a special relationship--
Speaker 2: I did a senior honor's thesis with--there was a Professor Donowsky (ph.), who was in the government department.  Then there was a Woody Kelly, who had come from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And I was in the honor's program in the government department.  But I'll tell you the person that I think had the longest impact on me was an English teacher, a young, he was a just a close to a student teacher my senior year at Cornell.  He was only there for a year.  His first name was Tom.  I can't think of his last name.  But he taught me how to be a good writer.  And I thought I knew it.  He caught me in my senior year, and I got a paper.  The only C I ever got at Cornell on a paper I got from him, was on a paper that I'd written.  And he said, "Why are you trying to use all these big words and using Latin and all these long sentences?"  'Cause you know, you're trying to, you know, show everybody your vocabulary (laughter).  You know, I want you to see everything I've learned over these past four years.  And he said, "If you can look at a sentence and can interpret it in more than one way, you haven't written it very well."  And he taught me how to write, how to make sentences clear, and sharp, and precise, and that's the best tool that he gave me.  And it prepared me for going at the law school and doing all kinds of things--Tom Jeffries (ph.), that's his name, Tom Jeffries.
Speaker 1: Jeffries, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking about Tom Jeffries.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so writing, that, yeah, yeah, how to write is really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he really--
Speaker 1: --a tool to have.
Speaker 2: --helped me perfect my writing.  And, but the thing is, you know, you learn so much from other students too.  Some of my best, my best friends in life are still the ones that I made at Cornell.  It's a group of women that we don't see each other, but it's like that telephone commercial.  You pick up the phone, and it's like you're picking up, you know, from, from thirty years ago.
Story_ID: 116498
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now were you in any special clubs or groups or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, we were--this is a time period when you were anti-sorority and anti-fraternity.  What we did do is, it was during the, the time that I was there that Ujamaa, the black dorm, was founded.  Frank Scruggs and the class ahead of me led that effort.  And it's always been a controversial thing at, at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], but I, it's been there since, gosh--let's see, if I graduated in '75 [1975], I think it's been there since like '73 [1973] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's still there?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I lived in it my sophomore year, soph--yeah, my sophomore year I lived in Ujamaa.  And you know, the beauty of Ujamaa was that we came together and really supported and helped each other.  We would have study groups before the exams.  And the graduate students would help the undergraduates.  Like, science was a tough class for me, biology.  We, we had a guy who was doing his PhD in biology, and he came and gave tutorials to us.  We were very, very supportive.  And we would put on that bulletin board the, you know, here are the tutorials for the various subjects.  And I don't know if they still do that kind of thing, but we, we did that kind of thing.  And the year that I graduated, which was 1975, from Cornell, we put on fundraisers our last semester to raise money to give a benefit--not to give a ben, benefit but to give a dinner to honor our parents, who had gotten us through college.  And we raised enough money to rent out the Holiday Inn and to pay for the dinner.  And our parents had to subsidize the dinner by like twenty dollars, something very small.  But it was to honor our parents for, you know, getting us through Cornell.   And I don't if--
Speaker 1: That's a--
Speaker 2: I don't know if anyone's done that since then.  But I still have the pictures, and it was a wonderful time. The parents loved it, and we got to know our friends' parents.  It was, it was really great.
Speaker 1: I was part of something similar to that a couple of years ago.  But that, that's, that is a, that's a wonderful thing.  I hope they're still doing it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, so the architect or the, the person who envisioned this idea of the, the black dorm was, was who?
Speaker 2: His name was Frank Scruggs, and he's a lawyer--
Speaker 1: Frank, Frank Scruggs.
Speaker 2: --in Miami [Florida].
Story_ID: 116499
Speaker 1: Now, anything, anything else, I mean about--
Speaker 2: Well, Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], you know, Cornell was very good to me.  When I was at Cornell I received two scholarships, 'cause they had scholarships to do various things.  And I applied for one, and I went to school in England for a semester.  I spent a semester at Oxford University [Oxford, England].  And Cornell, you know, paid for me to, to fly to, to fly to England, the tuition, and even gave him, gave me a stipend while I was a student there.  And that was, Oxford was a, was a really awakening experience.  You know, they have the tutorial system where they teach, by the way, one on one with the professor.  So it was a different way of learning.  And being in England at that time was--
Speaker 1: So you, you get a chance to--I mean the, the professor taught one on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you have lectures, but then you actually have a one-on-one where he's, where he's asking you questions, and you're thinking.  You have conversations.  It's a one on one kind of thing, and it was really pretty amazing, and I had a great time.  And I also had a wonderful time.  I was young.  I was twenty.  I was cute.  You know, I was going into London [England] and meeting all kinds.  I met West Indians and just Indians and all kinds of people in England at that time.  But it really continued to pique my curiosity about the world and to also to study history in England from the British perspective, taking a look at American history from the British perspective.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, what was their course of study?  Was it American history?
Speaker 2: I was still, I was still doing my, my major, which was government.
Speaker 1: Government, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was still doing government classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was looking at U.S. history from their, you know, the rebellion versus the revolution (laughter), that, that kind of approach.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: But I, then I also spent a summer in East Africa, as part of a, as part of a Cornell scholarship, in Tanzania and Kenya.  So it, it opened my world is what I'm trying to say.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Tanzania and Kenya?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were--it was a, a field study program.  We were supposed to be doing archeology and studying the different ethnic groups and politics in East Africa at that time.  And at that time, this was shortly af--I mean Idi Amin was ruling Uganda.  Let's see, was Idi Amin still there?  Maybe not.  Maybe--
Speaker 1: I think he was, yeah, then.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: You're talking about 1973, '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: I went to Kenya in--I've gone twice, so I'm mixing up my trips.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think Idi Amin was, yeah, he was still ruling--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, he was--
Speaker 2: Uganda.
Speaker 1: --there through the--
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: --about eighty, I think in the early eighties [1980s] [sic, until 1979].
Speaker 2: Yep, he was still ruling Uganda, and Tanzania had Julius Nyerere.  And they were doing their experimentation with their own form of socialism.  And Ken--
Speaker 1: Did you meet some of the black ex, expatriates in Tanzania.
Speaker 2: Not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause we were dealing with professors, more, more the professors.  We did interact with some of the professors at University of Nairobi in Kenya at that time.  And we also were doing--we studied some of the African writers at that time, the, and their whole Negritude movement and--
Speaker 1: [Aime] Cesaire and--
Speaker 2: Yeah--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: [Leon] Damas.
Speaker 2: But we did a lot of travel.  We spent a lot of time on the bus bouncing up and down, and those roads weren't paved at that time going to various parts of East Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was it, was--I don't know if--was [Kenyan writer] Ngũgĩ, James Ngũgĩ or Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in East Africa, in--
Speaker 2: They could have been, but I--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah, he's--
Speaker 2: But this was a Cornell--I mean this was--Cornell sponsors it, but it was a Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] mainstream kind--it wasn't an African-American kind of trip.  It was a mainstream Syracuse University study program.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  So you were there like over a summer?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what was Africa, what was it like being in African for the first time?
Speaker 2: It was intriguing because you saw Africa.  But, you know, in Kenya you definitely saw the British influence.  It was still quite British at that time.  And it was--you know, the, the first sensation was looking at people who looked like you, but you couldn't talk to 'em (laughter), if once you moved into the countryside, 'cause of the different languages there.  I liked the art.  The countryside was beautiful, just--you know, we went to the, to the game parks and camped at, at Safari at the game parks and stuff.  It was eye-opening as well, though heartbreaking when you saw the poverty that you saw.  But, at that those, at that time, you know, there was still a lot of hope about Africa.  And I knew a lot of African students at Cornell who were planning on going back to Africa.  And they were majoring in agronomy, and they were gonna do all these great things, and so it was a time of hopefulness.  These were almost newly independent companies--countries not--they were on the verge of morphing into something.  And that, you could feel that, that hope with Nyerere's experimentations going on and the whole, you know, Pan-Africanism movement that was going on at that time.  And then the land is just, you know, when you go to the Olduvai Gorge, you know, and Lake Angora--I think it's Angora--
Speaker 1: Ngorongoro Crater.
Speaker 2: And Ngoro--all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's just breathtakingly beautiful.
Story_ID: 116500
Speaker 1: What else before--well, now you, we know you went to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Now, how, how, how did you finally arrange to--
Speaker 2: I just--
Speaker 1: --go to Harvard Law School?
Speaker 2: Well, I had to cur, I found my courage.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had done very well at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  And so I applied, and I was accepted, and, but--and I was accepted and which was great.  I mean I was, I was making everybody crazy because I was just so nervous about it.  There were five, five of us that lived together, five of us.  We had a house, and we lived off campus.  And that poor mailman, he, we would all be hovering, waiting for him to come with the mail.  And he knew where everybody had applied in the house.  He says, "Nothing from Harvard today," or he'd say to my girlfriend, Myra, "Nothing from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] today, but I got something from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] for you" (laughter), 'cause he knew where we wanted to go.  And so when the Harvard letter came he handed it to me, and I went it's thin, it's thin.  He goes, "Now, now, that doesn't, it doesn't necessarily mean"--'cause you know, in the old days if it was thin it meant you didn't get in, 'cause if it was thick they would give you all the information you thought, you know, with it.  I'm like, oh, my God, it's thin.  I didn't get in.  And I'd been waitlisted at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And the day I got wait, waitlisted at Yale, my girlfriend, my roommate got into Yale.  So I was all, you know.  So, I opened the Harvard letter, and it said, "You've been accepted."  And I was like, wow.  And it was like, like, but the paper is supposed to be different.  I mean it was like just, it was almost like they had just xeroxed the paper and just written your name in it, 'cause it's the same acceptance letter.  But you're expecting something like, you know, really special 'cause you got in.  And it was April.  I think it was April, whenever that stuff comes out.  And I called Big Granny, my grandmother in Missouri.  And my great-grandfather, Knox, Sullivan Knox, was living was her then and my grandfather, Granddaddy DeWitt.  They were all at home.  And I said, "Big Granny, Big Granny, Big Granny, I got into Harvard, I got into Harvard." 'Cause for me, Harvard was this--I was still this competitive--it's number one and the whole ego, all that stuff was wrapped up in it.  "I got into Harvard, I got into Harvard, I got into Harvard.  I'm so excited, I'm so excited."  And I--she, she said, "Baby, that's really great, that's really great."  I hear her scream.  She screamed in the background to my grandfathers: "Debbie got into Howard [University, Washington, D.C.; Debbie got into Howard Law School."  And I said, "No, grandma, it's Harvard not Howard."  And then she paused, and then she said, "Well, that's okay, baby, we're still mighty proud of you, okay."  And you know what?  I, I tell that story because it tells me what's important in life.  Because I know why she was proud about Howard, 'cause Howard was our school.  She knew Howard.  We used to have a collection in church that you'd put money in for the different Historically Black Colleges and stuff.  But it also reminded me of, you know, of where I came from and what was important.  And yes, it was great that I had gotten into Harvard.  And she would go to church and tell everybody Debbie's at Howard, Debbie's at Howard (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a great story.  So, well, did, did, did you work the summer before you went to Harvard?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I worked every summer (laughter).  I had to work every--there are six kids in my family, remember?  And plus I had to work 'cause we--if I didn't work, my mother was gonna have me cleaning that house, 'cause boy, she didn't--idle minds, you didn't get to lay around Olean Lathen's house.  She would have you--we, we did spring cleaning four seasons out of the year, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 116087
Speaker 1: Okay, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], okay, now, those of us who have never been there imagine [Alan] Dershowitz--
Speaker 2: He was there.  I had him for Criminal Law (laughter).
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I had him for criminal law.  [HM] Charles Ogletree was in my class.  Professor--
Speaker 1: Who?  Who?
Speaker 2: --Charles Ogletree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he--
Speaker 1: So he was in school--
Speaker 2: In my class.
Speaker 1: --in school here.
Speaker 2: He was in school when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're in the same year.
Speaker 1: All right, now, our director, Julieanna Richardson, was there, right?
Speaker 2: She was a year or two behind me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to give Julia, Julie that, so she can--yeah, she was a year or two behind me.  That's where we me though, was at Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, was [HM] Derrick [A.] Bell [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Derrick Bell was teaching there then.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah, sweet Derrick Bell.  He was teaching there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, well, I'm, I'm asking about all these names, but like what, what was it like?  Was, was it what you expected it to be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--well, you know, Harvard--law school is hard period, okay.  It's hard because they're really trying to teach you a whole new way of thinking.  They're sort of reprogramming you, I think is the best way to put it.  And then you--there was some of the brightest people, you know, in the country.  And you find out that you're smart, but you're not brilliant.  You meet some people who are absolutely brilliant, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now did they give the John Houseman speech, "Look to the person next to you" ['The Paper Chase']--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that one.  "Now look to your left, look to your right.  One of you won't be here."  No, I don't remember anything like that.  But, you know, I met some of the most brilliant people there, and then, and it's very competitive.  People are all, you know, got something to prove, and they were all the A types.  And so, it was very, it was hard, but when you went through it, you're like oh, I can do anything now.  I did that.  The first year is the hardest.  The first year--after your first year you're like okay, now I can do this; I've got this.  And again, I made some great friends there.  And you know, some of the people you've heard of.  Ken Frazier [HM Kenneth C. Frazier] is at Merck.  You know, he's a high-ranking--he, he did, he actually, he did, he saved Merck with his Vioxx defense.  He's the one who came up with the Vioxx defense.  You know, we've already missed--mentioned Charles Ogletree, who's, you know, an esteemed professor there.  [HM] David [B.] Wilkins, who's from Chicago [Illinois] is a professor there.  [Nigerian businessman] Bayo Ogunlesi [Adebayo Ogunlesi] was in my class.  He's at Credit Suisse.  So you had a lot of, you know--Lydia Kennard running, ran LAX for the longest, you know, time.  You know, when you're, when you're there though, these are just your friends, you know.  They're just your friends running around in jeans and bunny clothes just like you were.  And you had no idea what the future would, would hold for any of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dershowitz was a good teacher.  I remember that.  I thought he, he, he kept you awake.  He was interesting.  You know, I would say, let me just put it this way, you would never use the word, word "self-effacing" with Alan Dershowitz, but he was definitely an entertaining professor.
Story_ID: 116088
Speaker 1: What was so tough about the first year?
Speaker 2: Well, it is like 1L.  I mean, you know, you're just, you know, you've got books that are this thick that you have to read.  You've got more material, and you've got more material and more reading in one week than you probably did in a month when you were in undergraduate school.  And it's Harvard, so you're sort of intimidated by that.  And they had the Socratic process, where you're sitting there, and they got your picture.  And they point, and they call on you, and you know, you have to--and you're in this--we had I think five sections then.  They broach you--broke it down into sections that were a hundred-plus students.  But you're in these big classes, and, and you stay with the same people your first year in this section.  And the other hard part of it is, is that for some classes you only have one exam.  It's the end of the year.  And so you're like you don't really know what you're doing until you take, you know, that, it's an all, it's for everything that went on that year, one exam that sort of wraps it all up for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it, do you think that, that--I've heard people say that different law schools are designed to weed out the, you know, to just kind of push people out, you know, on a level.  I mean everybody's not gonna make it.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: It's--(unclear)--I mean somebody's gotta fall to wayside--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think, you know--
Speaker 1: --systematically.
Speaker 2: I think Harvard would tell you that when the people that they, that they accept into law school all have the ability to graduate from Harvard Law School.  And there are many factors why people don't do it.  A lot of--it is psychological, a lot of it is psychological.  I think they would say that everybody they bring in has the intellectual capacity to do it.  But, you know, it is, it's hard.  You're working all the time your first year.  So, I don't think they, they bring it in, look to your left to left.  One of you will be gone because we don't think you're smart enough.  We don't think you're tough enough might be it, but not that we don't think you're smart enough.  And I can't, you know, talk about other law schools, but I, everybody that I met at Harvard certainly was smart enough to be there.  And the few people that, that I know that left, they not because of academics but because of other reasons.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a tough contest more than a--
Speaker 2: It, it was then.  And I think the law school has changed its flavor since then, 'cause I've gone back to a couple of reunions, and it, they seem much more student-friendly and you know, less aloof.  And you know, it just, the students that, there today--I went, I went, last reunion I went to was probably five or six years ago.  It just seemed like a different place than, than when I was there.  It was still the 'Paper Chase' kind of place when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, did you have a favorite course of study in law school or a favorite area to--
Speaker 1: I liked labor law.  Harry [T.] Edwards, who is now a judge here in D.C.--not D.C., excuse me.  But he is D.C., but he's in the federal--he's been on the bench a long time, the federal, federal court judge.  He made labor law interesting.  And during that time, labor law was a big deal because you had a lot of union unfair labor practice cases.  The NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] was much more active back in the '80s [1980s] than it is now.  I mean, NLRB, you heard about it as much as you did the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], FCC [Federal Communications Commission], FDA [Food and Drug Administration]; you really heard about them.  You hear a lot less about the N, NLRB these days.  But I liked labor law.  I really liked constitutional law quite a bit as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, now I read somewhere or heard somewhere that you kind of idolized [Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall at one time and--
Speaker 1: I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I very much idolized Thurgood Marshall.  I just thought he was phenomenal, and I wanted to be--I, I had actually thought I wanted to be a trial lawyer, and that kind of changed.  But I did think I wanted to be a trial--because of Thurgood Marshall.
Story_ID: 116089
Speaker 1: Right, you were saying in high school you envisioned yourself handling civil rights cases and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened to, to steer you toward corporate law?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting.  What happened was, that's probably one of the first lessons I learned about life, is that you don't always necessarily get what you plan but--and sometimes you get a whole lot more than you plan for.  But what happened was when I was in law school [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I started really, you know, since I liked constitutional law, I labor law and litigation, those kind of things I liked.  And the law firms would come and interview with the school, and I got a summer job clerking at one of the law firms.  And I took a job initially just 'cause it paid a lot of money, and I needed money to come back to school after my second year of law school.  And they, they and another firm, a couple of firms made me offers to come on permanently as an associate.  And I said well, I really debated it, and I went and talked to Harry Edwards about it.  I said well, you know--there's another professor.  Let me, before I forget, professor that really influenced me was a guy named C. Clyde Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.], who was African-American, and he'd gone to Harvard Law School, Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] undergrad.  But he had been, he had been a Rhodes Scholar.  He'd gone to, he'd been at Oxford [University, Oxford, England], knew [singer and activist] Paul Robeson, been part of the [John F.] Kennedy administration and then the [Richard] Nixon administration, and he was teaching Civil Procedure when I was at Harvard.  And I went to talk to him, to C. Clyde Ferguson, about whether or not I should go to this corporate, you know, law firm, 'cause I'd always wanted to do civil rights.  And I talked to he and Harry Edwards.  And they both said, "Look, the Civil Rights Movement was about letting people be able to do what they wanted to do.  And so if you want to go do corporate, go do it.  Nothing has to be forever; you know, nothing needs to be forever.  Go try it out.  You seem to be interested in that, and you can always, you know, switch."  But that's what they both said to me, is that we need people in the corporate world.  You know, we need people doing those kind of jobs.  And so I started down that road, went to Foley and Lardner in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] right after law school.  My parents had moved there when I was in law school.  Did not like Milwaukee.  The firm was very conservative.  I was the first black woman they'd ever hired.  They had one other black lawyer, so I was second black lawyer.  And in terms of women, they had just started to hire women a couple of years before me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this was a--
Speaker 1: Now, now you graduated from law school in what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], 1978.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, they were begrudgingly opening the doors to women and begrudgingly opening it, it to a few of us.  Didn't like Foley and Lardner and didn't like Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But you did meet--we were talking about--
Speaker 1: [HM] John [W.] Daniels [Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Daniels.
Speaker 1: And Richard Porter.  I met them--
Speaker 2: Richard Porter--
Speaker 1: --great people.
Speaker 2: --and then, and you, and Dale Phillips too--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, absolute--no, no, I, I mean I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I was a twenty-something-year-old, twenty-six-, twenty-seven-year-old single woman, you know, living in a very married-Milwaukee [Wisconsin] is a very married town.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's an interesting way to put it, a very married town.
Speaker 1: Married, I mean it is.  It's married, you know, family kind of oriented.  And at that time, it had a lot of industrial plants and stuff, so it was very, you know, more of a blue-collar town before it became the Rust Belt.  And I, and, and I didn't like Foley and Lardner at all, but I learned a lot there.  I did learn how to be a good lawyer there, but that was the old boy's club.  And they were begrudgingly lettin' anybody in that wasn't a, a, an old boy.
Speaker 2: Were you the first black--
Speaker 1: Black female.
Speaker 2: --black woman?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Richard Porter was the first black male.  And I suspect they probably haven't had that many since then in Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I mean these were, those were still hard times.  We were on the edge of things changing.  We weren't there.  I mean, when I got there the firm use to hold their firm meetings in a club that didn't allow blacks, Jews, or women to be members, okay.  And they had a separate entrance for women to come through that took you straight into the powder room, you know.  And the old radical in me had to complain and complain.  The firm didn't like it, but they moved their meeting a couple of times, and the guys were mad at me.  You know, it was like me being back in high school again saying, "This isn't right!" (laughter).  But I learned how to be a good lawyer.  They were good lawyers, and they did good legal work.  But I, I--it was not a place for me to be and nor was Milwaukee, so I moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 116090
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there two years, right?
Speaker 2: About two and half, two and half years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, by 1980, '81 [1981] that you were there?
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980], eighty-one [1981] I would have moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, '80 [1980], '81 [1981], all right.  And what did you do in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I first worked, just a year, for a law firm named Keck, Mahin and Cate, and then they went under.  They basically folded and morphed into all kinds of--it was a turbulent time.  They got, they were charged with violating, gosh, RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] I think was the statute.
Speaker 1: Ut-oh, that's the--yeah, that's a--
Speaker 2: Anti-racketeering or something with, with, with South Korea.  It was a big case, and they lost a ton of clients, and so the firm was basically not doing well.  And so I moved, then went to the Quaker Oats Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed at Quaker for like an in-house counsel for about eight, nine years, eight years I believe at Quaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, Quaker Oats, now it--
Speaker 2: The Quaker Oats Company.
Speaker 1: Now that's, it's interesting.  I was, we were, I was saying earlier that Barbara [Gardner] Proctor, of the black ad agency [Proctor and Gardner Advertising, Inc.], had a big contract with Quaker at one time.  And I was thinking of--that was about, I think it was starting to wane when you showed up, I guess by, by the time that you--
Speaker 2: Could've, could've--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --could've been, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.  Then Quaker Oats got--so, what, what did you do at Quaker Oats?  What, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was in-house counsel--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the law department there.  And I basically did legal work representing, I did gai--I did some of Gatorade's work, did--at that time, they owned Fisher-Price, and so I did, I was counsel for Fisher-Price.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, we're talking about Gatorade.  Now this is, these are the glamour days of Gatorade, when they get the big contract with Michael Jordan--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I was there then in those days when Mike--
Speaker 2: So, do you have a story about that?
Speaker 1: No, I mean it was just that I, I used to have a, I had a picture of Michael Jordan in my office in an--a couple of them.  Actually I still have one when he was doing this, the dunk at the, the Grand Slam event that they used to have.  But I used to go to the [Chicago] Bulls games because Quaker always had, you know, tickets 'cause we had the, the contract with them.  Those were the glory days for Quaker and also for Michael Jordan.
Speaker 2: And for the Bulls, right, right.
Speaker 1: And for the Bulls.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: They were in the old stadium [Chicago Stadium] then.
Speaker 2: --the whole nation is sitting around singing "Sometimes I Dream That He Is Me" (laughter), you know, the Gatorade thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And that's, you know, that, that was a big deal, the Chevy Blazer [Chevrolet Blazer] contract and this Gatorade--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --and Nike made him a super--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --millionaire beyond what basketball could pay him even.  So that was, the Gatorade was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Plus we all loved, you know, saying we were associated with, with something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you said Fisher-Price was--
Speaker 1: It was owned--
Speaker 2: --part of--
Speaker 1: --by Quaker at that time, and so I did a lot of the, the legal work for Fisher-Price.
Speaker 2: Were there any lea--
Speaker 1: That was before they spun, and they, and they had Brookstone.  They owned--that was in the age when the companies were gonna become conglomerates, so they were buying all kinds of stuff.  They had Joseph Banks, and all these companies that were not even part of their core business.  But they were gonna be a conglomerate.  And then of course we faded away from that, and let's get back to our core business.
Speaker 2: Were there any issues with Fisher-Price?  I know they're supposed to be the safest little toys for little kids and--
Speaker 1: Fisher-Price in those days, because remember, Fisher-Price--Quaker bought Fisher-Price and owned them.  And then they spun them off, and Fisher-Price was subsequently purchased by Mattel, so it's just a brand.  But when Fisher-Price was a company they had some of the best toys, and they were well-made.  I met some of the toy makers.  They made them with pride and love.  I mean it, they were, it was a great company.  They had some issues in the eighties [1980s] with Little People, a couple of children choked on the Little People, the head of one of 'em.  But that was unusual.  They were known for quality, and they had great products.  I, I, I can't speak to them since they morphed into being Mattel and just a brand of Mattel.  But when it was Fisher-Price-owned it was a great company, and I enjoyed doing work for them.  It's a good company to do work for as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now, how many lawyers did Quaker have?
Speaker 1: At that time, we probably had twelve, fifteen, not a large number.  We used outside counsel as well, so we worked very closely with outside counsel.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you, you were there for, for how long?
Speaker 1: Eight or nine years--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --long time.
Speaker 2: The seemed to have--I remembered going to some sort of Kwanzaa celebration that the black staff had at Quaker Oats (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, that's pre--that's, they were doing that--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --when I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.
Speaker 2: All right.  Yeah, I was invited.  I made a presentation.  It was a long time ago, a long time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, that, no.
Story_ID: 116091
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, where did you live in Chicago [Illinois] at the time?
Speaker 2: I lived in a couple of places.  My first move to Chicago I had an apartment on Walton Street, 70 East Walton Street.  Now, I guess they're turning it into luxury corporate apartments, but it was an apartment building and a small wal--it's not walk but a small building, which I really loved the old building.  And then I moved over to where [THM founder] Julieanna [Richardson] was living, which was in Lincoln Park area.  And I lived in Lincoln Park until I left Chicago.  I had an apartment, then I, I had, I rented an apartment.  I can't remember that street, but I bought a condo on [North] Commonwealth [Avenue], which is just up from [West] Fullerton [Parkway], between like [West] Belden [Avenue] and [West] Diversey [Parkway] on Fullerton.
Speaker 1: So you were there during the [Mayor] Harold Washington days too.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a beautiful time.  I was there when Harold Washington was elected and had friends who were in the administration.  It was a wonderful time to be in Chicago, yep.
Speaker 1: And the Bulls, Harold Washington, and I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yep, I was there in the glory days.  And Chicago is still a great city, wonderful city.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what, what pulled you out of Chicago?
Speaker 2: I was recruited by--the executive recruiter from TRW [Inc.] called me.  And I had, you know, sort of reached as far as I thought I was gonna go at, at, at, at, at, at Quaker [Oats Company] in terms of getting promotions, and I was still young and ambitious, and you know.  I wasn't gonna be general counsel or anything like that.  And a executive recruiter called me from Cleveland [Ohio] and asked me would I interdu--interview with TRW in Cleveland.  And I initially told him no.  I said I don't wanna live in Cleveland.  I like Chicago, you know.  I don't wanna live in Cleveland--said please, please just go talk to him.  Actually, oddly enough--there's always a funny story--the recruiter at that time was Larry Elder.  I don't know if you remember him.
Speaker 1: [Libertarian commentator] Larry Elder--
Speaker 2: Who's become, he's a right-wing--
Speaker 1: He's a right-wing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's got a TV show.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right-wing.  Well, Larry was not the--he was a headhunter at that time.  And TRW [Inc.] said that they were looking.  They wanted to hire minorities, and you know, they had some legal positions open.  And Larry Elder, I'm sure he wouldn't want that to be told today, but his job was to find some minorities for, you know, TRW.  And now, of course, his whole thesis is the antithesis of that.  But Larry Elder of Elder and Associates was his company, and he said, "Well, just go talk to him."  So I went to Cleveland.  I said, I said I will talk to them if you tell them that I'm pretty certain that I won't, won't move to Cleveland.  And he said well, let her come in.  So I talked to him.  I thought it was a great company at that time, liked him, but I wasn't moving to Cleveland.  I had lived in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and so I knew I didn't wanna live in Cleveland, not being single.  I was, I was still in my twenties at that time, at best early thirtiess, and I said no.  Chicago is where you wanna be when you're in that age group.  So, some time passed.  Fast forward six, eight months or something like that, and I said no to TRW.  And they laid out the carpet.  They had a limo pick me up with the sign.  You know, you're impressed when you're something.  They had the sign and a limo, and they put me in their guesthouse.  They had a butler at the guesthouse, you know, and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: This is in Cleveland or--
Speaker 2: This is in outside Cleveland in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the suburbs is--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --where they were.  And so, about eight months  later I get a phone call from TRW saying well, we know you won't come to Cleveland, but would you think about coming, how about California?  And they were, of course, smart enough to call in the middle winter in Chicago (laughter).  And I interviewed there with a man named Ned Manashil, M-A-N-A-S-H-I-L, who's great.  He came to Chicago, and then I went out to California, interviewed with him, really liked him, and said yes.  And I, that's when I started switch, I switched over from doing more of the corporate litigation management to doing deals.
Story_ID: 116092
Speaker 1: And that--
Speaker 2: Okay, now this is 1988, right?  Eighty-eight [1988]?
Speaker 1: Around that time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988], eighty-nine [1989], around that time--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --moved, moved to Chica--moved from Chicago [Illinois] to--
Speaker 2: To--
Speaker 1: --Southern California.
Speaker 2: Okay, now you went to Long Beach [California]--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's where, that's where TRW [Inc.]'s offices--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --were, were in Long Beach.
Speaker 2: All right, what is TRW anyway?  I, you know, everybody is familiar with the name I think.
Speaker 1: Those--
Speaker 2: But they don't know what--
Speaker 1: --were actually the names--
Speaker 2: --they do.
Speaker 1: --of people.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I can't remember them, but they were named for the people who founded the company, and I don't remember exactly who they were.  At that time, though, TRW, the part that I worked for, they did, they were information, they were information management, and the, the credit.  They did the credit reports at that time, and they did information and defense of course.  Defense was in Redondo Beach [California].
Speaker 2: Defense, okay, Defense Department [U.S. Department of Defense]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --type stuff, exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay--(unclear)--okay.  What, what--
Speaker 1: And they also did auto parts and stuff like that.  But I worked for the part that did the credit reports, and they had several other small, small businesses that they did.
Speaker 2: The financial.
Speaker 1: Financial, exactly, TRW Financial and things like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right, so, well, well, how'd you like TRW?
Speaker 1: I liked it fine, and I liked Ned [Manashil].  I very, very much liked Ned, and I liked the work that I did.  He--'cause I had never done corporate mergers and acquisitions.  And so he taught me how to do that.  He was a great teacher and a really nice guy to work for, really, really good.  And we were a small group.  We only had like four or five lawyers in that group.  So I liked it just fine, but then I guess maybe two years after I got there, first they moved us from Long Beach further down into Orange County [California], which I wasn't thrilled about.  I didn't wanna be in Cleveland [Ohio], but this was like being in the middle of nowhere.  We moved to Orange, Orange, California, which is, wasn't that far, but still, it's like, you know--anyway.  And then they decided to move the whole operation to guess where, Cleveland (laughter).  Guess what?  I'm not going to Cleveland (laughter).  That's one of my characteristics, is I'm, I can be pretty stubborn and, and adamant about things.  And they invited me to move to Cleveland.  I'm like, hmm, told you two years ago I wasn't coming to Cleveland, hmm, you know, no.  I mean, not in that way, but, and, and, and I'm not anti-Cleveland.  Anyone listening to this, I am not anti-Cleveland.  I just didn't want to live there, and so I stayed in California.  And after someone who had been at TRW recruited me to Nissan, is how I ended up at Nissan, by someone from TRW--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who was in human resources called me and said hey, we need lawyers over here.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Nissan, what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990] I think, like--
Speaker 2: Nine--
Speaker 1: --1990.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Nissan.  Now, what, what was the, what was Nissan like?
Speaker 1: That's, well, that's interesting, 'cause you know, you had at that time Nissan was the, ostensibly the management was Americans with Japanese in the shadow, okay.  But you soon learn that the power was obviously in the company who name--the people who owned the people, the Japanese.  And so it was tricky working there because you had two bosses.  And the American actually thought he was your boss.  The Japanese person who might not have had a title was really your boss, okay.  So you could get conflicting instructions from, from your boss versus the Japan- his Japanese shadow.  You're trying to go, okay, now, which one am I supposed to, to deal with?  That was, that, that made it difficult.
Speaker 2: So, so was it a struggle then to get in a position where you could deal directly with the Japanese yourself or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was har--well, first of all, the Japanese would just come directly to you.  That was, that wasn't the problem, because sometimes they would just come, go right around your boss and come straight to you and tell you to do something.  And your boss come and tell you to do something else.  You're like this [looking side to side].  Okay, which one am I supposed to be listening to here?  But, I guess I go and really talk more about what I really learned at Nissan was working with the Japanese, and for a Japanese company and a car company, 'cause I, and, and I learned, you know, I, I learned that it--that what our parents taught us can truly be true, in the sense that if you're competent and if you're good, someone who's got good sense is gonna want you.  Okay, someone is gonna, gonna let you do your thing.  You may have to fight.  I felt like a lot of my career I spent knocking down doors and you know, begging people to let me show them how good I was and what I could do.  I spent a lot of my career doing that.  I think a lot of my contemporaries would say the same thing as look, as James Brown would say, "I don't want nobody giving me nothing."  Open the door.  I'll get it myself.  I felt like that I felt, I spent a lot of time knocking on doors--
Story_ID: 116093
Speaker 1: And I'm sort of getting off track here, but let me, let me sort of move back.  At Nissan I was assigned by default a very large project, and it required me to work with Japanese businessmen directly from Tokyo [Japan].  It was a project that nobody wanted 'cause it was just in shambles.  And it was a joint venture between the Ford Motor Company and Nissan.  And things had just gone awry in terms of negotiations between Nissan and the Ford Motor Company, in terms of cost-sharing for the product.  All kinds of things were--
Speaker 2: It was the van project.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Nissan Quest and the--
Speaker 1: It was the Nissan Quest--
Speaker 2: --Ford--
Speaker 1: Villager.
Speaker 2: Villager, okay--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the Mercury Villager.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.  And this was I think the first joint venture between Nissan and Ford in this country.  And it was a joint product development.  It wasn't a legal joint venture.  And so we got called in because the contracts were, there either were no contracts, or the contracts were in disarray.  And so the called us in to help us--to help out the Japanese negotiation team from Tokyo.  And so I was a lawyer assigned to the case 'cause, I mean, pretty much a lot of the contracts that had been entered into hadn't been reviewed by Nissan.  And we were kind of stuck, so how are we gonna fix this mess?  And I always like challenges.  So, I was brought in to work on that.  And it took a very long time for me, you know, to build a relationship with the Japanese businessmen who aren't used to working with women period, let alone a black American woman.  They don't work with women in, in those days.  But, you know, I tell the story about we'd go to these negotiations with Ford, and Ford would have their cadre of lawyers sitting right next to the, the negotiator.  And I'd be sitting somewhere way off to the side, because in Japanese culture it is, you know, it's bad form; you're seen as being weak if you had to show up with your lawyer.  I mean, it's like, you can't negotiate.  You got to have your lawyer.  So I'd be off, and so it was very frustrating for me to try to figure out, well, how am I going to help out my client when I'm over here and he's over there.  And over time I inched my way over to the point where I was actually sitting, yeah, next to the negotiator, and they were asking my thoughts and opinions and developed a very strong bond with the men that I worked with, you know, Mr. Yurabe (ph.) and just the guys from, from, from Tokyo, from--we developed a very strong bond.  And they, they had a nickname for me, which I didn't learn till much later.  They, they used to call me the tornado.  I said, "Well, why they call me the tornado?"  They said, "'Cause when you come in the room, there's nothing left on the table when you negotiate.  You just wipe it all off" (laughter).  And so, I guess what I'm saying what I was learning is, and what I would say to people is don't believe in stereotypes.  People will say oh, "Japanese don't like black people"; Japanese this, "They don't deal with women."  They dealt with me, and I learned a lot about them, their culture, and I think they learned a lot from me.  And it was probably one of, one of the most rewarding experiences of, of my career, was working for almost a year and a half on that project with working very closely with members from Tokyo.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so, so you, you were with Nissan for--
Speaker 1: About eight years, eight--
Speaker 2: About eight years--
Speaker 1: --seems to be my number (laughter).
Speaker 2: Any other stories from that relationship with the--
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember we were, before we go into, into negotiations, there was Mr. Yurabe, who was head of the project, and we were in Michigan--that's where the project was based--and I had said something.  This is after we, he'd finally gotten to know me.  And, and I said--he was talking about a negotiating strategy, and I said, "That's not gonna work.  I'mma tell you, this is what Ford's gonna say.  You're gonna say this, and they're gonna say that."  And he says, "No, no, no, they would never do that.  That is not honorable."  I'm like, "Mr. Yurabe, this is not about honor.  This is about money.  And so, trust me, you don't wanna follow that strategy because this is how Ford's gonna react."  We're in the meeting, and he followed his strategy, and they said exactly what I said they were gonna say.  So afterwards, we go back and he says: "You are very smart."  (Laughter), I'm like, "We've only been doing this for a year."  Finally I have some credibility, finally I have some credibility.  And you know, you know, never wish for something.  You just might get it, because after that, they only wanted to deal with me as their lawyer, you know, it was a lot of work.  And I, you know, because with the time difference between Tokyo and here, I'd be getting faxes and phone calls at all kinds of strange hours and stuff.  But it was, it was a feeling of accomplishment.  But when the "you are very smart" (laughter).
Story_ID: 116094
Speaker 1: All right, now this is--when you were out on the West Coast, you were out there during the Rodney King--
Speaker 2: I was there for, for--
Speaker 1: --thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: --for Rodney King; I was there for the fires in Laguna [Beach, California]; I was--I think I missed--I think I hit just about--the earthquake (laughter).  I got 'em all.
Speaker 1: Right, the earthquake was--
Speaker 2: The [1989 Loma Prieta] earthquake in San Francisco [California], the [1994] earthquake in Northridge [California], yep, got 'em all.  And I was there.  I remembered the whole Rodney King thing.  That was, that was--and O. J., let's not forget O. J. Simpson.  I was there for that too.
Speaker 1: Right, O. J. Jep--yeah, the Simpson trial, right.
Speaker 2: The Simpson trial as well.
Speaker 1: Right, so that was an interesting time to be out there I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember being at Nissan when the riot started after the, the Rodney King--
Speaker 1: The verdict.
Speaker 2: --verdict came out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I could look out my window and just see the cars coming up the 405 from San Diego [California], driving up to LA [Los Angeles, California], just rows and rows and rows of police cars coming up to, to try to help out with the, what was going on in North Central Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: As a lawyer, was it easier for you to understand the Rodney King verdict?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely not.  As a lawyer, I could not understand how that first jury came out with the verdict that it came out with.  I just couldn't--
Speaker 1: That that those, those cops had beat Rodney King.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Somebody might be watching this don't know what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Right, when the policemen had--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --beat Rodney Keem--King, and it was all on tape.  I just could not understand it at all.
Speaker 1: It's on videotape.  They showed it over, over, and over again--
Speaker 2: Right, the excessive--
Speaker 1: --three, three white cops beating him with batons.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I remember, I definitely remember thinking this is outrageous.  I didn't think that there was going to be the civil disruption that we saw, but I understood it.  And after that, in fact, I met with [HM] Reverend Cecil [L. "Chip"] Murray at First AME Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME)], because the church was very involved in trying to get, you know, food and all that kind of--and, and shelter.
Speaker 1: To recap it, the people burnt businesses--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --homes--
Speaker 2: They burned businesses--
Speaker 1: --there's a big riot.
Speaker 2: --in inner city.
Speaker 1: And Watts was in flame--
Speaker 2: Exactly--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in inner city Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: South Central Los Angeles was in flames.
Speaker 2: Exactly, South Central.  And so my church was in South Central LA  And so I did meet with Reverend Murray, and--
Speaker 1: Was that your church or the--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was my church--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --First AME.
Speaker 1: FAME, they call it first--
Speaker 2: They came it FAME.
Speaker 1: First AME.
Speaker 2: I never called it FAME.  That was too LA for me.  I just called it First AME, but I just couldn't do the FAME thing.  But I, I was able, which was--I called up the Quaker Oats Company.  I said hey, you know, there are people who don't have food and water.  And they said no problem.  And Quaker, from their food warehouses in California, sent food into South Central LA.
Speaker 1: This is through relationships that you made when you were working at Quaker--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --that, you know.  And now you're working, you were working for I guess--
Speaker 2: Nissan then.
Speaker 1: --Nissan by then.
Speaker 2: Yep.  But they were great.  They, they and they took truckloads of food into South Central.  And Reverend Murray was, was very, very gracious about it and very, very happy about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were recognized by the mayor for your--
Speaker 2: Oh, of Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: --yes, Tom Bradley, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: For that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did that come--
Speaker 2: Reverend Murray, 'cause I, I mean I didn't do that 'cause I was looking for recognition from the mayor.  I was just was watching TV, and my heart was breaking seeing South Central go up in flames and then hearing people not having any food, and the grocery stores being gone.  I really--so that was Reverend Murray mentioned it basically.
Speaker 1: That whole incident caused a nationwide dialogue.  I remember Ted Koppel "Nightline" spent many a night discussing the situation in South Central and talking to the Crips and the Bloods and the--yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and they went to, and the also went to Reverend Murray's church, and they had a town hall meeting in Reverend Murray's church then I recall.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay, so you weren't actually, your home wasn't affected by the earthquakes, were they?
Speaker 2: No, no, well, no, but it's odd.  To tell you how powerful that earthquake was, 'cause that was up in Northridge, which was probably fifty miles away from me probably, if, if, if not more.  But I felt the jolt, and it rocked me out of bed that far away from it, from the epicenter, you know.  It was pretty amazing.  But no, I was very blessed I didn't, nothing happened to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the earthquake was what year was it?  Cause it rocked the--
Speaker 2: Wasn't that '90 [1990], ninety--
Speaker 1: Rodney King was like '91 [1991] [sic, 1992], right?
Speaker 2: It was after that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was after that.  I don't--'cause there were two.  San Francisco had its first, and then Northridge came after that.
Story_ID: 116095
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, so, well, now how did you come to leave Nissan?
Speaker 2: I came to leave Nissan, again, I found myself at the end of the road, and still full of ambition, and no place to go.  But I wasn't really rushing.  I had moved from law to the consumer affairs department, to head that up.  After, after I did that, that joint venture, I received a promotion, basically, upon the recommendation of the Japanese businessmen that I worked with.  I was promoted to director at Nissan.
Speaker 1: So, so you were a director of consumer affairs for Nissan?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was only gonna do that for a year, 'cause the department needed to be rebuilt.  We'd lost a lot of people, and the call numbers and things were done.  We had a lot of disgruntled consumers, and for a Japanese company customer service is very important.  We were very embarrassed by the poor quality of customer service that Nissan had at that time in the U.S.  And I really was, was charged with going in and fixing it.  And I really only planned on doing it for like a year or two, which I did.  And I, and I say--I shouldn't say I.  I said we did it because I was able to build a really good team, and I was able to get the necessary resources from the company.  And we were able to raise our call rates, and give much provide--much better customer service and analysis of customer service issues.  But after those two years, I was like okay, I'm not the kind of person that just can kind of administrate thing.  What's the next thing I can do?  And I couldn't see any opportunities, any more opportunities for me at, at Nissan.  And it was serendipitous, but I came to Washington [D.C.] for Bill [William] Kennard's swearing-in ceremony.  He was being made chairman of the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] at that time.  He had been the general counsel.  And I knew his family.  I'd known his family for many, many years.  His sister [Lydia Kennard] and I were roommates in law school, and I was very close to his family in California, which is where he's from.  And I just said to Bill, you know, "If you hear of anything in the Justice Department [U.S. Department of Justice], I really have always said I wanted to do civil rights.  And I'd like to go into the Justice Department, civil rights division, so let me send you resume."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is-[Bill] Clinton was president then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is '97 [1997]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'97 [1997], '98 [1998], around that time.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --you knew--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Bill Kennard's sister from Harvard, right?
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: From Harvard Law School, and--
Speaker 2: --from Harvard Law School.  We were roommates.
Speaker 1: --did--I think on the other interview you, you mentioned [HM] Deval [L.] Patrick was with the Justice Department--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was with--
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: And Bill told me he was sent--
Speaker 1: --that's somebody you--okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Bill, Bill Kennard said, "Deval Patrick is over at Justice, and I'll, you know, I'll send your resume over to, to Deval Patrick."  But he called me up and he says, "Well, I have something for you."  And he says, "I'm looking for someone to head my cable services bureau.  I really need someone with your managerial skills, 'cause I've gotta rebuild it because a lot of people have left.  We got rid of rate regulation, and there's been rumors about, you know, the, the bureau going away.  But I wanna make that my internet bureau, and I really need somebody who is good with people, who can manage people, who can run a department, because that's where the future is gonna be, in the Internet."  And I said, "Well, Bill, you know, I still started off my career saying I wanna do civil rights, and I would still want--thinking about civil rights."  And he goes, "Look, this is the next--the information highway is the next civil rights movement.  If people are not on it, they will be left behind, and this is cutting edge," 'cause I had said I don't know anything about TV.  I don't wanna do TV.  He says, "It's not TV.  Think about it."  And I started--I thought about it.  And I did some research and I said what really convinced me was his statement that, you know, the information super highway is the future.  And at those in the--at that time, we were talking about the digital divide, you know, whether or not there was gonna be a digital divide.  And, and so I came out.  I accepted his offer, and it was probably one of the best decisions I ever made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was head of the cable bureau at the FCC from 1998 I think until 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so it was about the Internet more than about cable television.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  But cable was leading in terms of the technology for the Internet.  It was the cable modem.  The telephone companies were still, they were, they were still doing dial-up, and everybody was sick of that slow dial-up.  And the cable companies were beginning to launch their high-speed Internet access.  They hadn't done it everywhere, but it was just starting.  It, it seems like ancient history, but it really wasn't that long ago that people were, you know, having to dial in to do the Internet.  And cable was at the forefront of high-speed Internet access and also video on demand and a lot of the technologies that have brought us all of the, the, the type of interactive services that we now have.
Story_ID: 116096
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any good stories about, about the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, the FCC at that time was a fun place to work, 'cause it was exciting.  It was the Internet age, and you still had the huge medum--medium mogels who would come in to see you.  Ted Turner would come in to see you.  Rupert Murdoch would come in to see you.  I mean, they all had to come to see this tiny little humble agency because we regulated them, and we were in new territory.  The Internet was new, and the question was--the big issue that we faced at the FCC at that time was, what, if any, regulation should there be?  And there were those who were pushing us to just, you know, regulate against anything that you could possibly imagine that might happen.  And I think Bill Kennard took the, the most reasoned approach was look, this a baby.  It's just growing.  Let us, let's just wait and see, and we'll, regulatory light.  We, we, we'll come in when we need to, but let's not stifle it right away.  He called it vigilant restraint, and I think he was right in that regard.  I mean, 'cause it's very difficult for a regulator to restrain themselves from regulating, but there are times that you need to do that.  And I still believe that, the fact that we didn't burden the Internet with all kinds of regulations.  It's one reason why it's so ubiquitous now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, vigilant restraint, okay.  Now, did, you know, did Mr. Kennard get in some kind of trouble at the FCC?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Seemed like I heard something, but okay.
Speaker 2: Nope, not at all.  Let's not start that rumor (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, on the cable board of the FCC, I guess there were, how many--
Speaker 2: Commission.
Speaker 1: --commissioners, yeah, they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are five commissioners.
Speaker 1: --there was Bill, Bill Kennard, Kennard was the head.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: You have--
Speaker 1: --Michael Powell--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was on when you were there.  And, and who else?
Speaker 2: Well, the way it works is the party that's in, in power gets the majority seats.  So there were three Democrats and two Republicans.  And so on the democratic side you would have the chairman, which was Bill Kennard, Susan Ness, and there was a woman from New Mexico, Gloria--I can't--her name will come to me.  I can't think of it right now, but, and then Michael Powell and Furchtgott, Furchtgott-Roth, Harold Furchtgott-Roth was the, were the two Republicans--Tristani, Gloria Tristani, from New Mexico.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tristani, right, okay.  Okay, all right, it, this is--so you, you were there like through the end of the Clinton Administration to the beginning of the Bush--
Speaker 2: One year with Michael Powell--
Speaker 1: Okay, Michael Powell.
Speaker 2: --a little, maybe a little under a year with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --working with Michael Powell for the transition.
Speaker 1: Now, the other people I've talked to, we have discussed like the--I think Mike, Michael Powell basically oversee the, oversaw the deregulation of a lot of the cable--I mean the--of television in a lot--I mean the--(unclear)--the community licensing requirements and that sort of thing, right?  Did, is that, that basically true?  You know, the, the, they used to have to have public service on broadcast television stations and--
Speaker 2: You still have to have public, public service.  There is still public service requirements, both for cable and for broadcasters.  So, I mean, Michael Powell, Michael Powell is Republican and subscribe to and adhere to Republican, you know, doctrines of less regulation.  You know, it, it is best, but the person who's been the most deregulatory I think is the current chairman, Kevin Martin, who basically led us back to a duopoly with the just, you know, basically two premier telephone companies, Verizon and AT and T.  And he pretty much, as far as my personal opinion, is he's been the one who's sort of in keeping with the current Bush Administration, my opinion of course, and has pretty much let the private enterprise pretty much do what they want, ex, with the exception, of course, the--for some reason, he has not been inclined to be deregulatory towards the cable companies.  And I--he--the cable companies would argue that he has favored the telephone companies over them, and he has been punitive towards them.  Whether or not that's true or not is another story.  But I think by far Kevin Martin, I would put him as being far, far more deregulatory than Michael Powell was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay,
Story_ID: 116097
Speaker 1: And in terms of what you were doing, would, would you, did you basically follow Bill [William] Kennard's--
Speaker 2: Oh, Bill Kennard was chairman
Speaker 1: --policy of vigilant restraint and--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bill Kennard--but, but we stepped in when we needed to.  I mean, when we felt that there were things that were that the market wasn't working or amiss, I, I think we were very good at in knowing when to step in.
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us an example of that?
Speaker 2: There was a situation I remember where--let me see if I can backtrack a little.  There is a requirement that when, like for example, you know, when a cable companies carries the broadcaster signals, okay, and pro, or programmers' signals, that doing what they called sweeps.  You can't drop a station, because that's when they're grading viewership and all that.  That's a rule.  So Time Warner was in a dispute with Disney over-they're negotiating their contract, okay.  And they, they, so they came--they could not come to, they came to a stalemate.  And Time Warner dropped Disney right in the middle of the February sweeps, okay.  That's, that's against a rule.  And so I had to fine Time Warner.  I remember Jerry Levine being absolute--and I wrote it.  It was under my--'cause the bureau chief had the authority to do it.  And issued an order fining Time Warner for dropping Disney during the sweeps.  And I remember it was Jerry Levine at the time, he was furious, 'cause it hit international news: "Time Warner fined for violating FCC [Federal Communications Commission] rule."  And of course, Disney was (laugher) singing it everywhere as well.  But that was a rule, and you know, that was the rule, and it was, and I had to enforce it.  And then there were, there were other times, you know, everyone would always come and tell you they wanted a level playing field.  Well, they only wanted a level playing field when they were at a disadvantage, you know.  It was--and their idea of a level playing field always varied.  I'd--but--
Speaker 1: A level (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, you know, so you had to kind of balance, you know, out-level the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the whole point was, you know, my job was to serve the public interest.  I wasn't there representing cable or broadcasters or anybody.  I was trying to figure out what was best for the American people.  And the telephone companies had been very slow to roll out any kind of high-speed Internet access.  They were still doing slow DSL dial-up, and they were claiming that, oh, we're just too regulated; we can't do it 'cause we're so regulated, and cable is unregulated.  And cable was pushing forward with their high-speed Internet access.  And so at that time there was this battle called "open access."  And that battle was, they were saying that the cable company should be treated like a utility.  And they should be required to open up their networks to anybody and let anyone and ISPs use their-ride their networks.  And that was a big open access fight.  The telephone companies were, if we have to do it, then they should have to do it 'cause we have to do it on telephone lines.  Well, that was true in telephone lines, 'cause telephones were built, those lines were built with monopoly rents; okay, the people pay for those lines.  And I'm not pro-cable.  I'm just looking at the facts.  The facts were the cable high-speed, they went to Wall Street and borrowed money and built these lines.  They were not a public utility.  And so we felt that there would be no incentive for anyone to go and borrow tons of money if you gotta turn your fat--if you gotta turn your network into a fat, dumb pipe and let everybody just free ride on it.  And so we said--and the Internet was in its infancy at that point in time.  So we said look, let's get this stuff to point.  Let's get the fiber in the ground.  Let's get people connected.  And the only way we can do that is if people think that they can make a good investment, and they can go to Wall Street and get money and make it happen.  If we feel that they've become gatekeepers, then it's time to regulate.  And what we're talking about now, what, what you're looking at now is now people are talking about regulation because they're talking about these companies blocking and stopping traffic.  That's when you, when you, that's when you have to start talking about what, if any, regulation is needed.  But if you don't have the fiber in the ground, why would you talk about regulation?  And so now I think we're at the point where we should be talking policy-wise about what we should be doing in terms of making certain the Internet is open and free and, and it's accessible to everyone.
Story_ID: 116098
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, so you, so you're at, with the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] until 19--2001, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, I was there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until--I would have been there if the Supreme Court had not made George [W.] Bush president.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that ended it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a political appointee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So, do you have any thoughts about how it's working now, or do, do you, you paying attention to--
Speaker 2: How what is working?
Speaker 1: The FCC.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's not working very well at all, and I don't, I'm not just saying that because I, to be saying it.  I just recently read that Congress is thinking about having hearings in June to investigate the mismanagement of the FCC, about how people have not been, career people haven't been treated well, how work doesn't get done.  It's probably not an understatement to say that this is probably, in terms of management, when the F--one of the worst FCCs that there has been in a very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, what did you do after 2001?  I think you founded your own company--(unclear)--but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what I did after 2001--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --when I got over my shock of, of--this is the first time in my life I lost a job because the presidential party changed, you know.  And I was also exhausted.  When I was at the FCC I had, we had worked on some large, major--excuse me--some major mergers, AOL, Time Warner, AT and T, TCI.  Back to back merger review we had to do, which is difficult, painstaking, tiring, politically exhausting 'cause you get beat up by everybody.  And so I just decided I was just gonna take a little time off and look for a job after I took a little time off.  And I took some time off, and I started what I call freelancing, 'cause a couple of companies approached me and asked me to do FCC work for 'em.  And then one thing led to another, and I just decided well, I think I'll stay out here and found, and I founded my own company.  And I've been doing communications consulting since I left the FCC.  I've done work for a variety of companies, Verizon, AT and T, you know, ba, a bunch of companies.  And then a little over a year ago, I was fortunate enough to have been appointed to the board of directors of British Telecom.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, what is British Telecom?
Speaker 2: British Telecom, think of it as the AT and T of the U.K.  It's the largest telephone company and the oldest in the United Kingdom.
Story_ID: 116099
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're talk, you were asking about British Telecom?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, British Telecom is the oldest telephone company in the U.K. and the largest, but it's also a network provider too.  They're like most of the telephone companies that have had to morph into things other than plain old tele, telephones.  So we, we do provide network services as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay so that, that's a board position, right?
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: And so, does it take a lot of time?
Speaker 1: It does.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I go to England one--I got to England nine to ten times a year, more like ten times a year.  About one week out of every month I spend in England, and I enjoy it.  I--the board is an international board, and it's, it's, it's intellectually stimulating, and it's a great, it's a great group.  I mean, and London's not a bad town (laughter), so, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you visited in college you were there--
Speaker 1: Yes, in--
Speaker 2: --in the early--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I was in Oxford [University, Oxford, England], but yeah.
Speaker 2: --so, yeah, not Oxford but okay.
Speaker 1: But then I go to other places in Europe from there when I have time.  I don't--most times I kind of just go in and out, but sometimes I spread it out and go to other places in Europe.
Speaker 2: So that's, that means about once every month you're in--
Speaker 1: Once every month I'm pretty much in, in, in the U.K.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Although last month we had our meeting in India, which was very cool.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now have a note here that you are also a board member of Video Access Alliance.
Speaker 1: Not anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Actually I'm resigning from that board.  That was something I did a little while ago.  But I'm a member of the Rails to Trails.
Speaker 2: Okay, what's that?
Speaker 1: It's a conservancy, conservancy.  I'm, I like to ride my bike.  That's one of my big hobbies.  I'm a cyclist.  And in fact last year--I'm proud of myself--I did a century bike ride.  And so, Rails to Trails takes basically railroad tracks and gets right away--gets the rights to the right of way and converts them into trails for walking and biking.  And we've done it throughout the country.  I'm sure--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know we have them in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there's one their doing in Detroit [Michigan] I know now.
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: There's a big one in Detroit.
Speaker 1: And we do 'em all over the country, and it's, it's, it's a great organization to be involved with, particularly now in terms of, you know, getting Americans to be healthier, to get people outside, to exercise, to do more.  And then with gas being four dollars a gallon it's even, even better.  But yeah, I, I'm on that board as well.
Speaker 2: Now what else now?  We've--a member of the board of directors of quite a few organizations I can see here.
Speaker 1: Not really, in the past but not, not--
Speaker 2: Okay, these are--
Speaker 1: --for profits, yeah, so.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, yeah.  You have a favorite not-for-profit that you're doing?
Speaker 1: Well, like anything related to children.  I donate money to organizations that help children, and I like anything related to children.  And I did some work with the school here in [Washington] D.C., J. L. Wilson Elementary School, worked on giving them a decent life, very, along with other people who really took the lead on it.  But I definitely like anything that's related to, to helping children.
Story_ID: 116100
Speaker 1: Okay, there's a note in here about [HM] Barack Obama.  I'm not sure exactly what they're trying to say about it.  But, but what, what's he--
Speaker 2: Oh, I've done, well, I, well, I, I met Barack through friends in Chicago many years ago, long before he was a rock star, at a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] reunion.  But I mean I, I don't have any deep relationship with him.  I did, in fact, work in South Carolina on his campaign.  Some girlfriends and I went down and did canvassing.  And I am a strong Barack Obama supporter, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you think his chances are?
Speaker 2: I do not know.  I wish I had that crystal ball.  I mean, in my gut I still think that he's gonna get it.  I think he's gonna do it, I really do, and I think that all this, the stuff that he's going through now is just gonna make him in a sort of bizarre way a tougher candidate to go up against John McCain.  If he can take what the Clintons have thrown at him (laughter), I think he, I think it, I,I think he's gonna get it.  I, I, I wanna have that faith that we've come here, that we've moved this far, you know, because, you know, I, I wanna have the faith that what Thurgood Marshall worked for and Martin Luther King and what so many people of all colors, genders, worked for.  I think we're really on the cusp of achieving something.  This is the next big step that we need to take.  And I don't believe that Barack can change our world.  He is the beginning of a process.  He's the beginning of a movement, and I think now is that time and that it has to happen now. It's that step that needs to be taken.  And so it's sort of like when I felt in my gut that Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] was the right place for me to go to school, and though I've never seen it, that's the way I feel, that Barack is the right person because this is a movement.  It's the right movement, and I think it's, I think it's gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That leads right to a question we always ask.  And that is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My biggest concern is I call the disintegration of the black family.  That just breaks my heart because I am who I am because of the, because of the, 'cause of the family I grew up in.  And I had a huge extended family.  I mean you heard me talk about Little Granny and Big Granny.  I didn't even talk about my great-uncles and my other grandfather.  I, I was surrounded in, in this wonderful, protective world of people, you know.  And children need to have mothers and fathers, both, and that--I mean, my father [Levi Lathen] was integral to my life.  My mother [Olean Lathen] is integral to my life.  They both serve different purposes, you know.  The stuff that my mother would be soft on, my father would discipline me and vice versa.  And that's what, what concerns me the most, is the disintegration of the black family, fathers not being there and, and, and children having children when they need to, when they're still children.  And I think the, the statistics are frightening on the disintegration of the black family.  I think that's a huge issue.  And then the second thing I would see is a disconnect between middle and upper African Americans and lower African Americans, different--you know, the thing that, that integration or brought was upward mobility.  We don't live in the same communities anymore.  And so, therefore, we don't take care of those children like we used to when we lived there.  And we may not even know what's going on.  I, I, I am really disconnected I think from certain economic level of African Americans.
Story_ID: 116101
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community.  I don't know if we exhausted that topic, but--
Speaker 2: No, that's, I mean those are--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the key ones.  It's, is one, you know, the disintegration of the family, and you know, what, what kind of--what will we leave our, what will we leave for the generations behind us, in the sense that we have a rich African American culture, but so much of it is based upon the family and the strength that you get from family.  And if it's disintegrating, what happens to our, to our culture?  What happens to us as black people?
Speaker 1: That is the culture, really, the family life.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What, what happens to us?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing you would do differently now if you could.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I believe in living life without regret.  I believe in learning, you know, from--as much as one can from one's life experiences.  But, what would I do differently?  I probably--maybe when I was in college I took a lot of classes, 'cause I was so gung-ho about going into law, and I was so concerned about my GPA that I took things.  They were difficult, but I know, I, I knew the things that I could do.  Maybe I would have experimented some more.  I would have taken some religion classes and some other things that weren't just so gotta get me into law school kinds of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, once again, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, and what today, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.  You know, we don't get to write those chapters, and I, I, I think it's sort of presumptuous of people when they talk about I want my legacy to be this and that.  We don't get to write 'em.  I guess the best thing I can say is that one thing that was always important to me is I wanted to be a good daughter; you know, I want to be a good aunt; and I want them to say she was a good friend and a good person.  I mean that she really was a good friend, a good person, and that she was a helluva lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about your family.  Now, you, you got some nieces and nephews.  Now you never got married, I take it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, 'cause none of it popped up in the discussion so far.  But, but you got some, you got some nieces and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I have--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --nephews and two nieces.  My nephew, my, my oldest nephew is twenty- he'll be twenty-eight this month I think, Jagen (ph.), and then after his is Ty (ph.), who's twenty-five.  He graduated from Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] recently.  Jagen's a B, Boston College [Boston, Massachusetts] graduate.  And then I have a nephew, Kyle who, he's our entertainer.  He's in New York [New York], and he's, he wants to be on Broadway, so keep your sights on Kyle Taylor Parker.  He's our, he's our, he's our, he's our entertainment.  And then I have a nephew, Zack, who's four- he's fifteen; Zack is fifteen.  He's in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and he is just a brilliant kid, very, very bright, loves basketball.  And then we got very lucky 'cause we thought it was gonna end with those boys, and I have two nieces, Ania (ph.), who's six, who's in Milwaukee, and Livia (ph.), who is three, who lives in Milwaukee.  So we've got this huge age gap between the boys and the girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Hmm, not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, and I think you've probably already an, answered it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good friend and as a good person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much for--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --doing this again (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
