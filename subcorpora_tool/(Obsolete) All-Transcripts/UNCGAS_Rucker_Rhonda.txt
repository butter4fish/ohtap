MJ: You hadWould you say you had an advantage of being close to Highlander?  SR: Oh, yeah. Well, when-  MJ: When did you start going there?  SR: When Highlander, you know, Highlander got burned out down at Monteagle. And, in fact, I never knew thatto the extent of what happened with that. But also the State seized the property and sold it at an auction, seized their libraries, including all of Miles Horton's books. Sold them at an auction. And some of the papers ended up in the archives up in Wisconsinkind of surprised me. Anyway, so when they relocated they moved to Knoxville. Just so happened they moved just a few blocks from where I was living. And I was aware of Highlander. I had goneand I don't know how this happened, but I had gone with my cousin, Bonnieand her family were also involved in the movementand they had taken me to some sort of children's workshop that was being held at Highlander when it was still down at Monteagle, Tennessee. And that's where I met Guy Carawan. And I neverI was justyou know, never thinking I would become a  SPARKY AND RHONDA RUCKER                                                                          3  she was on that tour. So anyway, everybody was just dead tired. But Pete Seeger, bless his heart. He knew all these people were sittin' around waiting. And I don't think they were doing a concert in Knoxville. They were just stopping at Highlander for a place to stay. Because being an integrated traveling group there was no motel that they could stay at.  MJ: Really? So they wereso that's your knowledge, that they were turned away from places, or~  SR: Well, I'm just saying-what I know is, I know that they would try to stay at places like Highlander because, you know, in a lot of places they couldn't get motel rooms.  RR: Well maybe you ought to back up and maybe tell aboutlike when you were growing up and how your family, when they would go on a trip  SR: Right.  RR: and, you know, you wouldn't even try because there's no way they would let you. There were only certain places you could stay  SR: Only certain, yeah, certain large cities  RR: They had to drive, like long distances and you know, to where they would knew there's a place that would have blacks  SR: To get to a large city, like uhbecause I know that we wouldand this is before interstateswe would drive to Chicago, because I had an aunt that lived up there and they would go up to do church things up there, and occasionally I would go along. And we would have to drive from Knoxville to Indianapolis. And that may not seemI mean now, that's what?  SPARKY AND RHONDA RUCKER                                                                          5  trouble when he traveled with them it made a lot of, you know, just trying to figure out, "where can we stay, where can we eat"  SR: "Where can we eat?"  RR: "Where can we go to the bathroom? Where can we" You know, all that kind of stuff. It was just, I mean, you can get into that stuff but it was just un-doable.  SR: And most of the time they would seek out black businesses, even when they were traveling as an integrated group. Because the black businesses would allow us to go to restrooms and what not, like that. As opposed to'cause even through my college years, going I'll never forgetgoing to New Orleans in the sixties. And I think I may have been the only black person in the car, you know, we were young beatniks as they called us back in those days, before the hippies (laughs). That we would not stopwe would make sure we filled up in Tennessee and not stop to go to the bathroom 'til we hit just near New Orleans. And that's a long drive. TOWARDS END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A  RR: So anyway, you were there with Pete Seeger  SR: Right. So when Pete Seeger-  RR: -was dead tired, that he  SR: Yeah, so like I said, because they'd been driving so long, that's what took him so long to get there.  MJ: Without stopping.  SR: You know, so heAnd he pulled out his banjo. That long neck banjo and plays "Barbary Allen." I had never heard "Barbary Allen" before. And boy, what a  SPARKY AND RHONDA RUCKER                                                                          7  MJ: On the tour?  SR: Yeah. And so he drove his Cadillac with his wife. And so he wouldn't ride with us. And uh, he would just basically show up at the places. And, so I guess he was ()and he was rich. But heAnne had talked him into being on that tour. I think Steve Young was on that tour. He's the one who wrote the song "Seven Bridges Road." That was his most famous song. He was on that tourhe's country. 'Cause by this time Anne was trying to include some of the roots country people into the thing, as well as the mountain people and the black culture, and what not. Trying to find the widest way to appeal to the widest audience that we could. Alice and Hazel were on there. Reverend Pearly Brown, Babe S to vail. And myself, and Anne, were on that tour.  So, in the van, there were three white women and three black men (laughing). And we're in Texas and it's still pretty racially segregated. And uh, we couldn'tmy memory of it is we couldn't find a restaurant to eat in but we found a Mexican taco street vendor. Tacos andwhat do you call those thingsuh  MJ: Tamales?  SR: Thank you! Thank you. Tamales. And so we stopped and everybody got out of the van and it was a really hot day. Andbut we were in this city park. And we're eating ateating food. And Reverend Brown, was justhe'd been cooped up in the back of the van for a long time. And he'spoor blind man. He got out and he's sitting on the grass and he says, "Ooh this feels so good!" And he starts rolling around in the grass like a puppy, you know? (All laughing). This is a real dignified man, you know. But he's just enjoying himself so much he's like a little kid, just "oh, this feels so good." He's rolling. And obviously, we hadsomebody saw us.

I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and so I heard him play at Kentucky Music Weekend. So I was familiar with what kind of, you know, the music he played. And I was inI guess, during high school and college I was teaching myself guitar. And during college I was trying to learnor I guess by then I was in graduate school, I guess. But I was trying to learn bottleneck style and I had no clue how that was done or anything about it. And I saw that he was coming in to play in Lexington KentuckyI was going to school at University of Kentucky there. And um, so I went and that's how we met. I asked him about, you know, how to play bottleneck and he would show me, 'cause he was there for the whole weekend. And he would show me some things. And we've known each other and been together ever since.  SR: Fact, she's still got the piece of paper where I wrote out some tunings and what not (both laugh). And isn't that sweet, that she actually saved that stuff. But yeah, wethis was in '86, June twelfth. Thursday, June the twelfth.  MJ: Alright. So it has been a whileyou've been together a while. And what are your experiences likeor, when did you start playing, performing together as musicians?  RR: '89.  SR: Rhonda traveled with me in-after she graduated in '87. And she was functioning as my business manager slash agent. She would be theyou know, it occurred to me that if you've got somebody else making phone calls for you, that people take you more seriously.

And it's I've never considered myself a protest singer. I guess I'm kind of like Bob Dylan in that respecthe says, "What do you mean, folk singer? It's just a song." But folk music has always grown out of the peoples' experiences. And whatever we're experiencing comes out in the music and stories andsince II've never been rich, don't plan to be. But my message comes from the people who have been the 'have not.' And I think they need a voice.  RR: I think for thewhat he said about that protest singer thing. I mean there was ato me, a disturbing trend over the last several years over the last several years about performers being afraid to say anything against the government on the stage.  SR: Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks, and how they tried to ruin their career.  RR: Yeah. And people have become very apolitical. All these-the folk societies, the coffee houses, that were having us, you know. And in fact, we even got some people come up to us after performances saying, "Aren't you afraid of saying those kinds of things on stage?" You know. And I thinkif you think back to what the climate was like just a year ago, or two years ago, before November. When we'd found out what the countrythat the country finally had enough. That a year ago, two years ago, people were still, you know, afraid to say anything against what was going on.

I wasn't a musician professionally earlywell, I guess I played for weddings and things like that, so I was to some extent. But I started off in engineering, actually. And I think there were, you know, Imaybe there were two other girls in my class when I first started out. Very few women went into engineering when I first went into it. And I spent couple years-five semesters, so a little bit longer than two yearsin that, and that's when I had decided to switch over to medicine. And there were a littlemore women in medicine, about a third I think of the class, that -there's still  SR: But that was really new then  RR: That was new, and there were not many women doctors out there practicing. You know, we didn't have that many attendings, the doctors in charge at the medical school. There was one female surgeonsurgery is not something that women go into back then. And, you know, she had problems with it. I know she did. And I heard people say things and I (tape cuts here) BEGINNING OF TAPE 3, SIDE A  MJ: Alright. Rhonda was talking about her friend the surgeon.  RR: So then after-I guess residency and everything, when I went into practice, you know. It was back to the old, you knowmost of the menmost of the doctors were men. Kind of thing. At least, you know, here-  SR: In the practice here.  RR: In the practice here. Yeah, soBut that's not the case everywhere. And so that's-it's different in different places. So gender, I  SPARKY AND RHONDA RUCKER                                                                        15  SR: Especially in folk music.  RR: Folk music. There's role models. There's people that, you knowWillie May Ledford, you know, and Ola Belle Reed. I mean there's lots of womenand lots of women now that areout there, performing, or  SR: I would say in folk music it's probably about equal. In bluegrass it's still male  RR: Yeah, in bluegrass it's different. That is true.  SR: -and other things. In jazz, it's still predominantly male. In everything. But in folk music it's aboutI would say about equal. And so that is one stride that I think Singer songwriters are predominantly male, though (both laugh).
