Story_ID: 76065
Speaker 1: Now what stories or what information do you have about your ancestors, your mother and father's parents, and (unclear) going, and how far back can you take us?
Speaker 2: On My mother's side, my mother's -- my grandmother, my mother's mother's father was from Ireland.  Came over with the potato famine and my grandmother did not live with her father, but she talked about him when she was a girl she used to go and see him all the time.  My grandmother, my mother's mother, my maternal grandmother married a man by the name of Jim Stuart, S-T-U-A-R-T when she was about fifteen, and my grandmother had two children, my mother, Josie and my uncle Jim McCullough.  My grandmother had three sisters that I knew.  Two of whom lived in Houston [Texas] and one in Detroit [Michigan].  My grandmother had some cousins in Houston [Texas] that we knew very well.  My -- on my father's side I knew my grandfather and my great grandfather who was -- his name -- my father's -- my paternal grandfather was Willie Robinson, William Robinson who was a preacher, and they called my paternal grandfather a "teaching preacher" because he went as far as he could go to school at Huston Tillotson [University] in Austin, Texas, and I think it was eighth grade and he learned to read and write and read the Bible and was just a person who knew grammar very well and used to correct all of us including my father when he went to college; and my grandfather would travel to -- for -- different places in Texas to teach preachers how to preach and teach them about the Bible.
Speaker 1: What denomination was he?
Speaker 2: He was Baptist.  He was Baptist cause my father grew up Methodist for some reason, but my grandfather was Baptist.
Speaker 1: His father was a Baptist, but he grew up Methodist?
Speaker 2: He grew up Meth -- he became a Methodist.
Speaker 1: He became a Methodist.
Speaker 2: He became a Methodist.  He grew up Baptist but became a Methodist, and my grandmother -- my paternal grandmother was American Indian.  So that was part of the history of Indians and African Americans, you know, during -- following slavery.  My great grandfather was a slave.  He died at the age of 112 we were told.  He --.
Speaker 1: Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. He was sixteen when the slaves were freed, and my great grandfather used to be -- he was a little man and so he was the one that would take the foot stool for the people in the coaches to get down from the coach to the ground.  So that was his job.  I remember that, and I remember my -- his daughter who was my great aunt, my grandfather's sister, and I remember -- I guess what I remember most about her was that she couldn't cook (laugher), but my grandfather was such a sweet -- great grandfather was such a sweet man and he'd -- we'd go visit him -- go sit on the front porch and he'd tell us about his experiences.
Story_ID: 76066
Speaker 1: Can you remember any specific stories or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, the piece he shared as to what his job was during his slave years and then when he was freed -- but he was twelve.  I think that's what he told us, and so he had to find things to do after that and to try to educate himself, but he too was soft-spoken and just a wonderful spirit.  Just a -- my father was six two.  My great grandfather might have been five eight or nine and my grandfather was tall like my dad, but I -- you know I remember sitting there visiting.  We called him "gramps", and I just remember that he was so wonderful, but I can't remember in any great detail the stories.  I wish I could cause he use to talk to us all the time.
Speaker 1: Maybe that will come back you know.
Speaker 2: I'm hoping they will.  Yeah, I can visualize it.  I can remember sitting on the porch with him there and us as little children talking with him, but I can't --  other than what he did during slavery, and during that time, you know, our ancestors didn't talk much about things that were not pleasant; at least my grandmother didn't -  my maternal grandmother didn't.  She didn't talk about things hardly ever.
Speaker 1: I think you are right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so--?
Speaker 1: But did he talk about how it felt to be free finally (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He was very happy.  I remember him saying that because -- but he didn't talk as if -- he said it was such a relief to be a young man and free.  He was just -- what I -- the -- the feeling I have is that he was trying to figure out what he would do, cause I don't know where his parents were or what happened to them.  So that's -- that's the piece, that part of the history that I don't have.
Speaker 1: I suppose that's pretty much universally recognized that Reconstruction was awful rough, and --?
Speaker 2: Very hard, very hard.
Speaker 1: We're still going towards a struggle that has not yet really ended --
Speaker 2: Well, you know--.
Speaker 1: So -- (unclear) maybe he doesn't, you know, I mean to -- but you know when you think back that slavery ended, how would somebody really feel?
Speaker 2: I know and it was a period that I think was a great test of the strength of black people and the determination that our ancestors had to be free and to be emancipated people.  So, I think about that sometimes and think about our people today and say that if our ancestors could do it, surely we can do it today and -- yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are there any other -- any of your other grandparents have stories about, you know, about what life was like and after slavery and all - anybody else?
Speaker 2: No, he was the only one that we knew that was a -- that could talk to us about slavery.  The others did not have that direct experience.  I just remember my paternal grandfather traveling from place-to-place teaching preachers, and they never really talked much about what their experiences were in those travels, cause it was principally black community going from black community to black community, and not having the kind of exchanges with other people--yeah.
Story_ID: 76067
Speaker 1: I want you to think back and try to reflect on some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, you know, in Houston [Texas], and what it was like?  What was your neighborhood like, you know, what were people doing?
Speaker 2: The first memory that I have of growing up in Houston [Texas] -- my family we -- I was born in San Antonio [Texas] and my father worked on the railroad and my grandmother had a drug store in San Antonio.  My grandmother -- to try to pull this together -- my grand -- my mother's mother her husband died when my mother was twelve, and my grandmother remarried and the man she married was a pharmacist, and he had a drug store.  My grandmother and my grand -- the only grandfather I knew on my mother's side had a drug store in San Antonio.  So, my mother and father lived in San Antonio for a while until I was -- I think maybe two, and the Depression came and they had -- they had a house in San Antonio -- my parents did and one in Houston, and they had to give up the property in San Antonio and my grandmother took over that property in San Antonio and they moved to Houston, and that's where I grew up.
Speaker 1: You said your father worked for the railroad?
Speaker 2: He worked for the railroad.  He graduated from college in 1926, and my father wanted to be a lawyer, but he couldn't.  First of all, we didn't have law schools unless you went away from Texas, and daddy didn't have the money for that, and he said (laughter) -- he said if he hadn't joined the ROTC he wouldn't have had clothes to wear while he was in college cause he said he had one pair of pants when he went and so the ROTC provided him with uniforms and he could -- he could dress while he was in college.  So the memory I have is in Houston in a neighborhood that was -- people we knew.  My parents seemed to have had the "big house" in the neighborhood cause daddy was on the railroad, and if -- during those days that was a responsible and reasonable and sort of a steady job.  So we had a house that was -- I remember the big house with open space underneath and they're sort of sitting on stilts, and the people in the neighborhood -- the houses were smaller, but everybody took care of all of us.  There was a grocery store on the corner and so all the people -- plus there was a railroad depot on the next block over, and the houses on the -- facing the railroad were very -- we use to call them "shotgun" houses, you know they were built so you could look straight through and one of the families there -- their house caught fire and my mother brought the girls in the family to our home, so I grew up with one of the young women in that family as a sister in our family.
Speaker 1: So they never really recouped -- they -- the family just split?
Speaker 2: The family just -- my mother brought two of them to help, so they were with us for most of their formative years, and I -- I just remember people.  I remember the grocery store.  I remember, you know, so it was people there who cared and looked out after us and the old stories about things getting home before you, that was very true cause neighbors saw you, they knew what you were doing.  If you weren't doing the right thing, they let your parents know.
Story_ID: 76068
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a little girl were you?  Did you have a lot of things to occupy your time?  Did you play games and read?  Were you involved in neighborhood activities?
Speaker 2: There were -- my brothers -- (laughter), I was classified as kind of a "tomboy" as a girl growing up.  In this place where we lived, there wasn't a whole lot to do, but I remember sitting under the house and reading, you know, the house it was kind of built on stilts.  We moved from that house to another place in the same Ward, third Ward, and there were more children in the neighborhood then, and so I played games with the boys in the street, you know, climb trees and raced, you know, with them.
Speaker 1: So you played with the boys more than you did the girls?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had -- because there were more boys in my neighborhood than girls.  So, I did whatever they did.  My brothers were always trying to get away from me it seems (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did the boys in the neighborhood mind that you were playing with them (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, but your brothers did (unclear)?
Speaker 1: My brothers just thought that, you know, it was -- it was -- they didn't like having their little sister around.  I was the oldest, but I was smaller so (laughter).
Speaker 2: I can imagine they...
Speaker 1: (Laughter) yeah
Story_ID: 76069
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about school now.  What school did you go to and how did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved school.  I went to Catholic School.  We were -- my mother was a convert and so my brothers and I were Catholics, and my mother's brother.  So we walked from our home to the school.  There was St. Nicholas Catholic School that was K - through 12, and my best friend, a girl and I used to walk together.  In fact she was my daughter Patrice's Godmother, but we grew up together, so we walked to school, it was -- we -- I mean it was -- you didn't think about -- I mean that was an accepted thing that you were going to school and you were gonna be -- do the right thing so you never -- in my day there wasn't the question of "are you gonna go to school or not", or "go on to college or not", those weren't questions that we ever considered cause that's what you are gonna do so you enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me what your favorite subjects were in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I -- we had a very poor chemistry lab in my school, but I used to like working in the chemistry lab, and we had -- we -- they taught us French and I wanted very much to learn it.  I didn't learn it well and surely wasn't a very good student in it.
Speaker 1: Was this grade school and high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In elementary school, I don't remember any particular subject that I liked more than any other, and we had Mass almost every day; so you'd go to Mass in the morning and walk over to the school and it was about a block away.  So my -- my memory is the building, the walk, the people and then on through from kindergarten through high school, so I was there throughout my primary years.
Story_ID: 76070
Speaker 1: Ok, well who were the mentors or role models that you admired in grade school and high school?  Were there certain teachers that seemed to stand out as people that you either admired or who reached and tried to help you?
Speaker 2: Well, the people that I think I admired the most were my parents.  My father and mother, they seemed to me when I look back on it, had this kind of balance.  Mother wanted you to be good people and considerate and my father wanted you to be well informed.  I can remember -- and to save.  My father used to say that if you make a nickel, save two and a half cents.  I can remember going to my dad for help, you know, to spell a word.  My dad would immediately send you to the dictionary.  So he -- and he would quiz you.  What you'd learned and how to apply what you had learned.  So they were -- my mother's attitude about people and children and community and those kinds of things meant a lot to me and my father, and so they were my role models.  I remember the principal of our school, Sister Anselm.  I'm not sure I can -- think was A-N-S-E-L-M, who was the principal (simultaneous) and she was very stern.  I remember that and she didn't allow us to not succeed (laughter).  She just assumed that that's what we were going to do and we all did, yeah, but my parents and the people -- what they did were really role models for us.  My brothers and I often talked about how blessed we felt we were because they were people who used to say as so many of us say, "But for the sake of God, go I".  So they were constantly serving people and their community and we grew up with that same spirit, and my dad was very political cause he was active in politics and as -- and in the community.  Daddy was always at a meeting.  We use to tease and say, you know "What day is it, which meeting is daddy attending"?  And when I was a young girl I went with my father, we went door-to-door getting signatures to abolish the poll tax in Texas.  So, he was active and we grew up activists as well, and the social work component and education component that my mother brought into our lives.
Speaker 1: Did your father -- was he active with the Pullman Porters?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Daddy helped not with the Pullman Porters, but with the dining car waiters, cause he was a dining car waiter.  So what he did was to help A. Philip Randolph -- my father helped organize the unit in Texas and in Houston [Texas] that dealt with the dining car waiters, and we used to go with him to his office downtown.
Speaker 1: Now, did any -- did your mother have any special interests or activities that stand out now that--?
Speaker 2: My mother was very involved in helping people, and she was an educator.  She -- her undergraduate was in education.  So mother --- one of the things I remember as a young girl, mother would -- some white women who could not read hired my mother to teach them to read and I remember going with my mother.  We had to go through the back and up the, you know into the kitchen, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Couldn't come in the front?
Speaker 2: Couldn't come in the front, no, no.
Speaker 1: She was there to teach them? (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right -- (laughter) had to -- had to honor the - the -- they had to honor their code of Texas, but mother did that.  She was very committed to children.  She developed a nursery school when I went off to college, and helped people and she managed a housing project, and mother would pay people's rent and buy food for children and clothing and, so that was her sense of doing what she could do.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 76071
Speaker 1: Now, in high school, let's move on to high school, and what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: St. Nicholas, yeah, it went from K thru 12.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright so it was Catholic school.  Now is this an integrated school by chance?
Speaker 2: No, this is a black school, all black, black nuns.
Speaker 1: Not even (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Black nuns, no.
Speaker 1: No, (unclear) black nuns (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Black nuns, but white priests.  So we had all of our nuns and teachers were Black in my school.
Speaker 1: And the neighborhood you lived in, was it all black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, remember this is pre -- I graduated from high school in 1947.  Yeah, so even in my community in Houston -- I -- gosh, I can't figure out where white people could have been in my Ward.  We were politically distributed according to Wards.  So I was in the third Ward and I don't remember where White people were -- and if there were (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well, in high school what was -- what did you do in high school?  What were your activities in high school and how did you like it and who were your favorite teachers and --?
Speaker 2: I mean they were the same people, you know, the teachers were the same teachers--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, so you had one set of teachers in the elementary and then -- and we didn't have -- we had K to seven, and then seven to 12, so it wasn't the way you -- we have -- we're organized in schools now.  I liked (laughter), I liked the sports activities, but I wasn't good.  I wanted to be, but I wasn't, you know the, we had basketball and we had baseball, and I always --.
Speaker 1: Those were activities for girls too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I wanted to be on the team, but no one would ever select me because I wasn't good (laughter), I wasn't good at any of that--.
Speaker 1: You'd get a lot of experience playing with the boys.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), yeah, I know, you would think, but I just -- it didn't rub off I guess, but we had plays and I used to love that, and my best friends were all there so we all, you know, did things together.  We walked from school home and all of those things so; it was the whole high school experience that all of it meant something.
Story_ID: 76378
Speaker 1: You made some interesting comments that kind of took us away from high school for a second, but you talked about the solidarity of your family and how that sort of insulated you against any feelings of inferiority, even growing up in a segregated Houston [Texas] and do -- one thing, can you start with talking about how your whole family going with your father at the train station when he'd get off of work.  I think -- I thought that was a beautiful story.
Speaker 2: My dad worked on the Southern Pacific Railroad as a Dining Car Waiter, and when daddy came home my mother and my brothers and I would go to the train depot to greet him and to meet him and to take him home, and every time my father came in to town, we would -- my brothers and I, asked daddy to drive us to Galveston [Texas], which was fifty miles south of Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Now, what was the attraction in Galveston?
Speaker 2: I think we -- we used to go down there as kids.  We would -- that was kind of a family outing cause it was the beach, and you know, and the Gulf and -- so we were there.  We would have -- we would take picnic food and tables and there was a section of the beach that was for black people, and so we would go down to the beach in Galveston and just -- it was a wonderful experience and we'd go as a family and go with other family members.  So we always wanted to go and my dad getting off from work would be dead tired I realize now.  At the time we didn't think of his state of being, we were--.
Speaker 1: He worked long hours too (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Long hours absolutely, because as kids we would go from Houston [Texas] to San Antonio [Texas] to see my grandmother at the drug store and the dining car waiters would always come through and so we saw them.  We knew what they did and they always brought us food in honor of my dad.  So daddy would say, "Okay".  So every time he came in that was our plea, "Let's go to Galveston."  Daddy would say okay and before we were out of town city limits, my brothers and I would be asleep.  So as far as we knew, we had gone to Galveston, you know -- come home and they'd put you to bed and you'd get up the next morning and you think you've done what you asked your dad to do.  And he knew full well that we -- but he would never say "no", or he'd never say to us "you're gonna go to sleep", or you know the reality of it.  He never did that.  He would say "Okay", and so he would start out to take us to Galveston.  My mother was -- she worked at home most of the time except when she did some teaching and some other work, but she -- she went to my brother's games, you know, and she was there for us, and I think it's that sense of protection -- we never -- I never felt that-- you know -- oppressed or discriminated against even though I knew it was there.  I didn't feel it because my parents gave us a sense of being very important.  My mother use to say, "Don't allow those people to reduce you to their level".  So that was kind of our standard, you know.  It was their problem not ours.
Speaker 1: Did you experience discrimination about the public accommodations like the movies and the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, we had black theatre, you see, in our neighborhood.  So when we went to the movies we went to the movies in our neighborhood, cause we were as I said, in my ward I don't know where the white people lived cause I didn't see them.  We had a park there, and so we could go swimming in our park in our pool.  We had the movie.  We had shops.  We had drug stores, so I never felt that I couldn't go any of those places cause they were all Black.  So that's where we were.  And I never rode the bus because my parents drove us where we needed to go and then we walked to school, and we played in our neighborhood and our friends were there and so -- I never felt -- so I didn't ride the bus.  I knew nothing about the bus.  So I didn't have that personal experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 76379
Speaker 1: So in high school what were your activities?  Were you a popular student and where you more serious or what -- why was that?  (Unclear) laughter.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well I think, you know we were a small school and we were all, I think popular and we were all busy.  There was always something.  I don't know if you know about Catholic schools and churches, but there was always something.  There was a bazaar, or there was a festival of some kind so you were always involved with the preparation of those things, and we had a sense of service to the church and the school.  So there were things you had to do.  You had to help clean up.  You had to do things in the community and so I never felt bored or unwanted or anything like that.  It sounds kind of -- as I report this out to you, it sounds almost Pollyannaish, but (simultaneous) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Well -- did you sing or did you play an instrument or did you --?
Speaker 2: I played the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not well -- took lessons forever.  I don't know if you know the name Phillippa Schuyler, the young, Black (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Yes.  The daughter of George Schuyler, George S. Schuyler.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  Well she was kind of the model for many of us and my teacher--.
Speaker 1: She's a child prodigy on the piano.
Speaker 2: Child prodigy, that's exactly right, and my father was tone deaf but he would sit with me while I practiced.  He couldn't tell if I was hitting the right keys or not, but I didn't know that.  All I knew was that he seemed to care about my playing and practicing, and my father was also quite strict about -- you couldn't, if you didn't practice -- whatever you were supposed to do you had to do, clean up, practice your music, do your homework, whatever those things were you had to do them.  You could not go and play even if your friends came to the house and said, you know, "Can Josie go out?"  If I hadn't done my work I couldn't.  That is just the way my dad was and if my mother called us to dinner, we had to get up and go when my dad was there.  This was when he was still on the railroad.  We were ship shape when daddy was around (laughter), on the road, yeah.  So I played the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not well.
Speaker 1: Were there any specific high school activities that you (simultaneous - unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well except the things that -- say there plays that we -- I participated in.
Speaker 1: Can you think of any of them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Not a one.
Speaker 1: Did you have the lead in of them or were you just (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I doubt it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I doubt that.  Maybe I would have remembered if I had.  I've never - I haven't thought about it.  I haven't thought about --.
Speaker 1: Were they musical plays or just straight up drama?
Speaker 2: They were drama, um hmm.  Dramas, I remember that much, but I don't remember any names.
Speaker 1: Were they classics or were they locally written.
Speaker 2: Do you know, I don't know -
Speaker 1: I mean or produced by the students--?
Speaker 2: No, they were -- they were plays that were bought.  You know you bought plays and the school had a group of them that they maintain that you had every year.  I'm trying to think.  Something almost came to my mind then and I'll think about it and see if it will come.  Yeah, but parents were proud, you know, come and -- yeah, plays.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you make pretty good grades in school?
Speaker 2: I think so. I don't ever remember having, you know, to worry about it so cause our parents made us perform so I don't -- I don't remember it being a burden.  I don't remember a problem with it.  It was just something you had -- we were expected to live up to -- to the standards of the school.
Story_ID: 76380
Speaker 1: Now, well, when you reached graduation, did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to pursue as a career when you went to college?  Cause you knew you were going to college (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had no doubt about that (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you -- well, yeah I guess you knew where you were going?
Speaker 2: Well, you know my parents had said no to Prairie View [University, Prairie View, Texas] and at one time there were a number of people in my community who were from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and my mother was not eager for me to go to Howard [University].  She thought that was the big city and it was too far away, so our family doctor and some of the family -- very close friends were "Fiskites".  So, that's where I applied and that's where I was accepted and that's where I went.  When I went to Fisk, I was going -- I had planned to be a doctor.  What I wanted to do was to be a pediatrician.  We -- in my day you had a family doctor who came and serviced the family in the home, and his name was Dr. Lee, and I can remember thinking that -- and Dr. Lee encouraged me to -- to study medicine, and he said I want you to do that and then you can come back and take over my practice.  So when I went to Fisk I wanted either to be a nurse or a doctor, but the "doctor" was the driving discipline that I was interested in.  So I went to Fisk as a person interested in medicine, and I was in that program for almost three years, had -- I was President of the Newman Club, which is a Catholic Student Organization at Fisk, and there were people who were students at Meharry [Medical College].  Meharry was the Black Medical School across the street from Fisk University, and they used to talk about the gruesome kinds of things they had to do as doctors.  Now, when I stopped to think about it -- because I changed my major -- decided that I didn't want to do that.  My roommate was a sociology major and the work she was doing seemed so much more interesting than what I was learning.  So I was a chemistry major and decided in my junior year that I wanted to go into sociology and Dr. Johnson, the person who was the Dean of Academic Affairs at Fisk, allowed me to maintain my chemistry as a major with sociology as a minor.  So I graduated with (laughter) -- which is a very unusual combination of major minor and minor from an undergraduate program, but they let me do so I could finish on time.  Otherwise, changing your major in your junior year -- you've got the junior and the senior year is not the best time to choose a major.
Speaker 1: No, that's unusual (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  So then I decided that, yes, I wanted to be -- I was -- got my degree in sociology, and then did some advance work in sociology at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] and then changed that to education.  So, I ended up in education administration.  So that's what my advanced degrees are in.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what did you think of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennesee], I mean, when you --?
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Did you love it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennesee], was, in my day, and my husband was a "Fiskite", my brothers went to Fisk, my daughter Patrice went to Fisk, my nephew went to Fisk, so we were a Fisk family.  My middle daughter decided she didn't want to be Patrice's sister at Fisk, so she went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and my youngest daughter went to Harvard [University, Boston, Massachusetts] in her undergraduate years.  So, we loved Fisk.  I was very involved and active at Fisk.  So, I loved it -- small, there were 350 freshmen -- and you know they had freshman orientation so we were -- we'd sit around on the oval and get to know each other and sing and -- it was just a wonderful experience.  Yeah, loved it, you knew everybody and we had, as I said, Aaron --.
Speaker 1: Douglas (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Douglas and we had Arna Bontemps and we had people who came through Fisk for convocations and lectures and it was just a great place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loved it.  Dr. Charles Johnson was the first Black President and he was inaugurated my freshman year and he was a great sociologist and I remember that was one of the things that I just thought, oh my, to be in a program with a scholar like Dr. Johnson who had so much in rural sociology learning about our people and how we lived.  It was wonderful, yeah, Jubilee singers, yeah.
Story_ID: 76382
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas]?  You know that was the -- that's a State, you know, it's a black State school-.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was a Negro University of Southern Texas (unclear) at one time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, see what happened was we didn't have a law school for black people so they organized Texas Southern University so that black people could go to law school.  When I left Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] I did some graduate work at Texas Southern in sociology.  My brother was on -- my father was a Trustee there and then my brother was a Trustee and so we knew Texas Southern [University] very well too.  It was just up the street from where my father lived, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went from Texas Southern to --?
Speaker 2: Well, what I -- I went to Texas Southern while my husband was in the Service.  I went back to Houston while Charles was in the Service.  We were in Massachusetts.  He was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts].  After college we got married the summer following our graduation.  We graduated in the same year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you met your -- met your husband at Fisk [University]?
Speaker 2: At Fisk, right and he got a scholarship to MIT and we moved to MIT.  I was supposed to go to graduate school in social work, and instead I got married.  So we went to Massachusetts, and while he was at MIT I worked at Harvard [University, Boston, Massachusetts] with my chemistry background -- I worked as a lab technician there, and then Patrice was born.  We moved there in '51 [1951].  Patrice was born in '54 [1954].  That's our eldest daughter, who was Mickey Leland's Chief of Staff, and then Charles was called to the Service so Patrice and I went to Houston [Texas] while Charles was in the Service in El Paso [Texas], and I stayed with my family and then I went and did some graduate work at Texas Southern [University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we moved here when Charles was discharged from the Service.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you end up moving to Minneapolis [Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: He got a job with Honeywell, one of the first black professionals at Honeywell.  He came as an engineer-mathematician.  He was -- Charles' major was mathematics, and that's what he was studying at MIT, and he had planned to -- had accepted a job at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and between the time he left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and Michigan he was called to the Service, so he spent two years in the Military and Patrice and I went to Houston and stayed with my family while he was in the Service, and then when he got out of the Service -- and -- so we had another daughter, a middle daughter was born while we were in Houston, and then Charles accepted a job at Honeywell upon completion of his stay in the service and we came here, it was '56 [1956].  So Patrice was two years old and Norrene, our middle daughter was six weeks old and then Josie, our youngest was born here.
Story_ID: 76383
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was Minneapolis [Minnesota] like? Was it -- it had to be a lot different from Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: It was very different, not only climate but there were -- Minneapolis [Minnesota] was segregated too residentially and we lived in South Minneapolis.  So we had South Minneapolis that was black and North Minneapolis that was black and we lived in South Minneapolis, and there were -- you almost knew every Black person in Minneapolis, and you could go downtown and be downtown all day and maybe see one other, if you were lucky black person downtown.  So it was very few -- we may have been point six [0.06] percent of the population.  Yeah, very small.
Speaker 1: I've heard that from people who were here as late as the early 1970s who said they came here and spent weeks before they saw (laughter) another Black (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's possible, I left in -- we left in '71 [1971].  I was elected to the Board in -- we left in '73 [1973].  I was elected to the Board in '70 [1970] and then Charles was transferred the first -- he'd lived -- had worked for Honeywell for eighteen years here in Minneapolis [Minnesota] without any transfer and then he was transferred to Denver [Colorado].  So we were gone ten years.  When I came back it was a very different community, very different community.  Yeah, so many more Black people here then and many more now.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did life take you here in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and in Denver [Colorado] too, I suppose there's some continuity here but--?
Speaker 2: Here, when we moved here I became very active with the League of Women Voters because I wanted to know about my state.  My new home, my new City, so I was very active with the League of Women Voters, with the NAACP, Urban League -- the other community with my church, and so the community afforded you an opportunity because it was so few of us to do a lot of things.  So, in addition to being on the Board of the -- with -- in time of the League of Women Voters in Minneapolis and being involved in program and as Treasurer of the NAACP, being involved with Jack and Jill Black Parent Organization for black children here, and I was a lobbyist.  I lobbied for fair housing in Minneapolis, so we were able to get -- I was the Chief Lobbyist for our Fair Housing bill.  Fair housing and equal education opportunity and job opportunities here, and worked with, you know, orientation of police officers and teaching people about human relations.
Story_ID: 76384
Speaker 1: And we, the University of Minnesota, you know we had the student movement there in 1968 and so created the Department of African American Studies.
Speaker 2: Now were you working at the University then?
Speaker 1: No, not until -- not until we created the department.  I'd been a part of it as a community person, but not as an employee.
Speaker 2: So you created -- you helped create the Afro African American Studies Department as a private citizen.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, there were several of us, a man here by the name of Mahmoud El-Kati -- who was a part of that.  Lillian Anthony, I don't know if you've heard of her name--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) of her, but Mahmoud El-Kati, that's the name of a scholar from Timbuktu who from the 12th Century --
Speaker 1: That's right, well that's--
Speaker 2: He took that name -- (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: He took that name--
Speaker 2: He is the author of Tarikh al-fattash (laughter).
Speaker 1: Listen at you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's really I -- you know, you hear that kind of thing, you know, when you know where it comes from (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Well Mahmoud El-Kati is one of those people who he's brilliant.  He is an educator and knows our history and he stays on point all the time.  He's always focused the issues dealing with us as a people and trying to get young people informed and knowledgeable about our history and so he teaches history Macalester College in St. Paul and we were very much involved in early movement here in Minneapolis -- community center activities and--.
Speaker 2: Were you involved at all with the Phyllis Wheatley Center?
Speaker 1: Not so much Phyllis Wheatley.  What we had was we very -- we knew -- we were involved in the Phyllis Wheatley; we met there, we had all of our strategic community meetings at Phyllis Wheatley -- in the old Phyllis Wheatley.  It's a -- that building was torn down and they're in a new Phyllis Wheatley Center, but the old building was residential.  That's where visitors as you perhaps know, lived because we couldn't live Downtown.  They weren't permitted to move -- to rent hotel space.  So, people who came to Minneapolis [Minnesota], railroad people and others stayed because at residential accommodations at Phyllis Wheatley, but we -- it was an organized and sort of a youth group of troubled youth in North Minneapolis that we had called "the Way" and Mahmoud was very much involved in that and helping create education programs.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what year was this?
Speaker 1: That's in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: The '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Cause the "Way" that's another trigger for something down South.  It's -- it seems to be an allusion to a book called "Two Thousand Seasons" by Ayi Kwei Armah, but I don't -- I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: It might be -- it sounded like it might be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But --.
Speaker 1: Had education programs there, programs for youth, it was a Center of getting kids off the street, and I was community organizer for the Urban League at that time, but worked very closely with The Way, and they had an education program, and a lot of things and people didn't know because they didn't think that there were any Black people here, so they were quite surprised to see that we were a very active community.
Story_ID: 76079
Speaker 1: Then the question -- do you think it's because of the deprivation I guess that people -- black people felt in Minneapolis [Minnesota] with the lack of black people, and you know, then the general lack of black history and culture being taught nationwide, you know that -- did that make the pain more acute to know that you -- you know, that you were in a place where you were, you know, you could be considered insignificant in some way, you (unclear) know?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I think there is a -- here in Minnesota, it's kind of an interesting dichotomy.  First of all, black people here felt very -- had a strong sense of relating to the same conditions that our people were experiencing other places -- felt that we needed to express our concern for those issues of justice and equality, and Minneapolis [Minnesota] had been a very strong anti-Semitic community and the whole attitude about the Jews and Blacks in Minnesota, I mean we couldn't -- our people couldn't stay in hotels or go to restaurants downtown or any of those things unless it was clearly -- you had your place.  So I think that our people here related very strongly to what was going on in the South and saying, you know, those conditions are there but we're experiencing them also.  Our students were conscious of other Black students across the country who were demanding black studies programs, black study courses, and so they -- a group of students -- a couple of them, we're still in very close contact.  One is in Birmingham [Alabama], his name is Horace Huntley, who is very much involved in the Civil Rights Museum in Birmingham and teaches at the University there, and Rosemary Massey who is in Wisconsin.  Those young people took the leadership and called a strike against the school and took over the administration with the other black students who were on campus, and demanded that the University [of Minnesota] do something about this.  The President of the University who was Malcolm Moos at that time I think behaved in a very responsible way.  He was a political ghostwriter for one of the early Presidents like [Lyndon B.] Johnson or somebody, but Moos did not allow police to come on campus and didn't do things that some other institutions did in quelling the uprising of students.  So it ended with some equity and some of us in the community were, you know, sympathetic to the students and participated in ways of supporting them.  So after that, this is 1968 - '67 [1967] and we then petitioned to create an African American Studies program.
Speaker 1: Okay, which is different from a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Department.  It became a department later but it started as a program.
Speaker 1: And that's also different from a cultural center or something (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, and then after that the Centers -- we now have at the University of Minnesota because all three -- all of them reported to my office.  We had an African American Culture Center, American - - Native American, Chicano, Latino and Asian Pacific Islander.  So those Centers emerged and after Dr. [Martin Luther] King was assassinated the Martin Luther King Center was created at the University of Minnesota.  So for a state that had very few black people, it responded in that way at that time, but there was still the vestiges of discrimination and they had to fight for, you know, the things that were achieved.
Story_ID: 76080
Speaker 1: Now, I think I've gone past something and that's something very, very important, but I think that you -- didn't you go to Mississippi in 1964?
Speaker 2: Went to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about that also?
Speaker 2: In 1964, Dorothy Height with the National Council of Negro Women and three other organizations, Church women, Y and Jewish Women.  The four groups organized a trip every week; it was called "Wednesdays in Mississippi."  They would send groups of women to Jackson, Mississippi and that immediate environment to report on the conditions of women and girls who were involved in the Civil Rights struggle and there were four of us from Minnesota.  A woman by the name of Mary Kyle, K-Y-L-E, who was a publisher of a weekly Black newspaper, a Jewish woman by the name of Maxine Nathanson who was active in the Jewish community, and another woman with the Church Group, Barbara Cunningham, I think Cumming -- Cunningham and I.  So the four of us were asked to go down invited to be a part of this "Wednesdays in Mississippi" delegation and when we went, we were -- just us on that particular Wednesday in Mississippi.  They had them every week for all '64 [1964] and '65 [1965] but it was not all of the summer of '64 [1964] and then the summer of '65 [1965] and it was before the Democratic Convention and all of the -- our young men were murdered down there, the three young men.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the summer of '64 [1964] was pivotal -- that's -- they called "Freedom Summer" and--.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: The summer that SNCC organized Black people to vote -- registered them to vote (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And that's, exactly.
Speaker 1: Atlanta [unclear] City.
Speaker 2: That's right and that's what we were looking to see what was going on down there, so we went.  We were instructed to -- that we could be an integrated team as far as Chicago [Illinois], and then once we were in Chicago [Illinois] we were to break into our ethnic group.  So Mary and I and the other -- the White lady, so it was two Blacks and two Whites and then the families met us at the airport, and I'd never, I'd grew up in Texas but I'd never been to Mississippi and the kinds of things you know about and read about, Mississippi was really kind of -- we had a sense of threat.  I guess I had envisioned the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] being at the airport to probably do harm to us for being down there. Our family -- so our family was a little late.  The people who came to meet Mary and I and the other people were met and taken off and then our family came and we went to a community meeting.  They took us immediately to a community meeting in a big black Baptist Church and there were Black men with shotguns walking around protecting the perimeter of that Church building.  So the meeting took place and it was voter registration in the SNCC group there and giving people instructions and information and listening to the concerns that the citizens in Jackson [Mississippi] and their environment had, and then we went to a restaurant and had dinner at a wonderful black restaurant and the man there, the proprietor told us to be careful, gave us advice and instructions on, you know, what to do while we were there and not to do and the next day we went to a hearing and, I mean the whole time was spent.  We had to look in on the jail situation to see what was going on there, went to a Freedom School in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the day after we left Vicksburg it was bombed.  It was one of those free -- open air Freedom Schools with books and things and then driving -- so that was a very powerful experience, and we -- you know, one that you forgot about it because it was supposed to be very secret.  We weren't to tell anybody that we were going except our immediate family and the Attorney General.
Story_ID: 76081
Speaker 1: So we were to -- it was like doing something and then swallowing the whole thing.  When we came back we could talk to small groups about the experience, but no one was to know we were going and they weren't supposed to know we were there and I remember my husband and I talking about, you know, the wisdom of my going with our children young and all, but knew that it - that I had to go.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting strategy I guess to spread the word, you know, in the North.
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly right.
Speaker 2: About what is really going on?
Speaker 1: So you bring it back and this was, you know, the -- as you say, it was the --.
Speaker 2: I think like public education (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Yes, that was the purpose of it.  So you come back and you talk to groups about it, you wrote your report to Dorothy Height and others.  You talked to your Congress people so that you could -- and get your own community people exercised about the denial of rights in Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the thing about the television and the media we know had a tremendous impact on--.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: People watched demonstrations, but what you're talking about is something even more powerful on the level - people that know influential people who have been able to come back and tell their first-hand experience to--.
Speaker 1: First-hand experience, it's nothing like it.  You can't -- you can read about it and you can viscerally feel it, but to -- you know, to wonder, I remember when we were driving from Jackson [Mississippi] to Vicksburg [Mississippi] and -- when you are black and grow up in the South, you really don't see any part of the South as being beautiful, and I remember how impressed I was with the green of Mississippi and I thought "God this is beautiful country, why are people so mean!"  (Laughter), you know, it's lovely and the Gulf is right there off the shores in Vicksburg and our people lived so poor.  It was just incredible to see that -- that sharp contrast between how black people were treated, mistreated, abused and our young men who were "lost" you know and we were -- I remember driving from Jackson to Vicksburg and there is swamp on both sides, and you know, you say, "I wonder if they're over there", and having people drive behind you and you know that they -- by then we had -- we had joined our team, so there was an integrated team driving from Jackson to Vicksburg, and so you had State Patrol and you had other people kind of following and monitoring where we were going and you knew that.  So, you just didn't know if you were going to make it back or not (laughter). It was kind of -- I mean, I don't mean it to sound dramatic, but I mean you --.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is really true.  Some people did lose their lives (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: I know of Viola Liuzzo from Detroit [Michigan], a white woman who was down there--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Volunteering who was actually, you know, chased down (unclear) and shot and killed.
Speaker 1: That's right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't -- and there are a lot of incidents where people were threatened that never made the news.
Speaker 1: Well, and as I said we went to this Freedom School right there in Vicksburg [Mississippi] in a beautiful, green pasture, and the young white girls and black girls working in these -- in this school trying to -- because people were sending truckloads of books if you will remember, and setting up libraries.  So they were working very hard, black students and white students setting up these -- the library and the school and we had it -- they took us on a tour of this limited space and showed us the shelves where they were putting up the books and organizing them.  The next day it was bombed.
Speaker 2: So, you know and you feel--.
Speaker 1: Were any of them hurt?
Speaker 2: They weren't, and then you feel "God maybe we are responsible.  If we hadn't gone maybe they wouldn't have bombed this effort, you know, and you drive around and you see how our people were living and it's just -- it was mean and awful and terrible and -- to know that people could treat other people that way.  That was pretty bad.
Story_ID: 76082
Speaker 1: Well back to the African American Studies Department you founded.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, when this was founded, I mean what was your role as a community person that wanted to see this done.  I mean, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, my -- because my background was sociology and I'd been working with black families and doing some research in that area, when the Department was organized a woman by the name of Lillian Anthony, who now lives in Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky was the Chair of the Program, and Mahmoud El-Kati was part of the teaching staff and he taught history and we had another political person who is dead now, Earl Craig who was a teacher and then there were Black musicians who taught and I taught Black Families in White America, and Dr. Billingsley, I don't know if you know that name who is--.
Speaker 1: Andrew Billingsley?
Speaker 2: Andrew Billingsley had just published a book.  He -- I had gone to a conference in New Orleans of the Urban League and met Dr. Billingsley there and he had just published a book about Black Families in White America and that was a class I was going to teach at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] and he came to Minnesota and assisted me in developing the curriculum for that.  I mean it was a time when Black people across the country shared whatever they had, knowledge they had, information they had to help things happen.  So I taught that class and I taught one on Blacks and the Welfare System, and then we had Swahili and we had music and we had history and then we had a course on the community and Black people and -- so we had quite an array of courses and we called ourselves a "Program of Town and Gown".  We were very serious about bringing the community to the University and the University to the community.  So we did a lot of things like the first graduation of Black students.  We held that in a church after the Department was organized in the community so that the students came there.  We took courses, we took -- we made an arrangement between the Still Water Prison in Minnesota and the University of Minnesota to teach classes there.  We went every week and taught the brothers in the prison and those credits were applied through the University of Minnesota so that that they could have credit for the courses that we taught.  So we were very much a community of people who wanted the University to be more involved in the community and the community involved in helping to shape policy and program at the University.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is really the start of your career at the University of Minnesota--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you just keep moving out there--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At the University of Minnesota doing bigger things.
Story_ID: 76083
Speaker 1: How has the African American Studies Department fared since (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know it's a very interesting thing.  I was involved in a review of the department just last year to see where it is and how it's doing and what its needs are.  There is under this current Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, that's where our Department is located and it is a Department of African American and African Studies.  He's very interested in the department doing well, so he created this study of -- two black women -- other black women and myself and they -- they were the real scholars in looking at the evaluation of it and I was a part of that team, and they're -- they have a plan for becoming a more involved department and more students, cause you see it's no longer the big thing.  At one time there were hundreds of students whose major was African American Studies, black and white students.  So it's not the big -- it's not as popular in any institution as it once was, but it has the solid scholars there teaching African American everything, sociology, history, music.  Just a whole array; and they have planned as a result of this assessment, a plan for meeting its own mission and objective and that is to help the University in its situation, and also, you know, the whole -- getting back to the "Town Gown" concept.  So, I think it's gonna do well.  We've got wonderful scholars over there.  It's just a matter of trying to help everybody appreciate what needs to be done in really getting that department doing what it can do; cause it can help the whole system become a more aware, more informed institution and especially in liberal arts.
Story_ID: 76084
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask you a question; it's probably one of the fundamental questions that was asked when this project was raised in the first place.  It's not that I don't know the answer, but people, viewing this later on didn't even know, you know, what would be the difference between African American Sociology and Sociology or African American History and History, you know I'd probably say you are probably talking about the same thing (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There are -- when you deal -- when we're -- a society that has been developed based on a set of principles that are discriminatory, what we know is that most of what you learn in sociology has to do more with us as a -- as less than the norm, the whole -- all the theories are based on something other than what we know as a people.  So the sociology of blackness is something that needs to be integrated in the whole system so that you understand why people think the way they do, process the way they do, problem solve the way they do, feel the way we do in the total society, and you need to have an understanding of people who understand that history and those theories; and the history as far as American history is concerned, it's never been until, you know, more recent times, a history that included the black people as a contribution to the history.  It's always been treated more from the -- from us as slaves in a society and from a negative perspective of what slavery is and does and how it affects.  So you need to have, I think, the history of a people in order to have a complete understanding and knowledge of any curriculum that deals with people and understanding how we operate in a larger system.  So the African American Studies Department was organized in order to fill that void in information about how Black people, in my course for example, Black Families in White America.  What did we look like?  What was our form?  You know, until as recent as 1979, Black people were -- the nuclear family forms -- it was until as far as recently as 1979, most of our families were nuclear, husband, wife, children under one roof, and most people don't know that.  They have no idea of the contributions that black people have made in any field.  So you need to have that.  It needs to be legitimized and you need to have scholars dealing with that kind of information on a very broad scale so everyone can learn it.  So the difference is like any difference.  We opened as a result of our African American Studies Department, we now have American Indian, we have Chicano, we have Women's Studies, we have you know, so you -- people know what they need because we have not as a nation been very integrative as far as our information is concerned that you need to have all of this and African American information is necessary for a well-rounded society so that children can feel that they belong and that people can know who they are and what they are about.  As you were sharing earlier, somebody actually coming -- one of the lectures telling you who you we are -- Whitney Young, giving you information about yourself.
Speaker 1: That we didn't know--?
Speaker 2: Didn't know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) says, hey you are forty percent of Dayton.  We didn't know.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And see people don't know, and if in the early days of sociology when I was a student, you looked in the index under "Black" or "Negro" or "Colored" and you saw all of the deficits, not, not the positives of who we are.  So that means people talked about (laughter), so you need to have it in order to be a more broadly-educated people.
Story_ID: 76085
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's -- well, what did you do next?  Now you're now, we have you chronologically at a point where you are teaching in the African American Studies Department--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're teaching sociology basically?
Speaker 2: I'm teaching, yes, sociology basically it's Black Families in White America and Social Work.  I then was elected to the Board of Regents at the University of Minnesota, and I was the first person of color to be elected there.  So I was on the Board for three years and then my husband was transferred to Denver, Colorado for the Honeywell Plant there and I went to -- we all went to Denver, and while I was there I became involved with the issues of children and the education of young black children and we were looking at issues of nursery school and early childhood education, and I was told that Lieutenant Governor -- the Senator George Brown was a person who had this kind of information.  So I met, Senator Brown and he decided that he was going to run for Lieutenant Governor and I volunteered to work on his campaign, and then I became his Campaign Manager.  When he was elected Lieutenant Governor, I became his Chief of Staff, his Assistant to the Lieutenant Governor.  So I was there, did that; we created a "Arts in the Capital Campaign" which was Black Artists.  The young man who did this work, [Bob] Ragland, we appointed him as the Director of the "Arts in the Capital".  So we had "Art of the People of Color".  So every month we rotated their Works in the State Capital and I served on several Boards there.  I co-taught a class on Black Families at the state college there in Denver.

Speaker 1: So you're in Denver [Colorado] right now (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm in Denver.
Speaker 1: yeah, and you're working for --
Speaker 2: George Brown.
Speaker 1: Lieutenant Governor George Brown.
Speaker 2: Lieutenant Governor George Brown.
Speaker 1: You were talking about some of your accomplishments (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, we were very pleased with the -- with the "Arts in the Capital" of people of color -- their artwork and [Bob] Ragland was our Director of that Program, and we were -- in the Lieutenant Governor's Office we were able to look at the issues of unions and the way people of color are denied admission -- membership in the unions and the cost of insurance and getting the coverage that you need in order to do the things.  So we -- we had several conferences of bringing black -- all of the people of color together to talk about these, and to have them presented to the state insurance organization and the labor union so that they could have an understanding of what was going on there, and the Lieutenant Governor had been a journalist so he was able to -- and had been an activist in that community for a very long time.  So the people who were around us were able to be involved in getting information out to the community about how laws are made, how policy is made and the kinds of things you need to do and Colorado is a pretty conservative state.  It was then, and so George (laughter) -- we had the feeling that George Brown was having to really fight his way all the time into a position of being heard.  As you know the Lieutenant Governor is such a secondary position so it was trying to elevate that to make it a position where people had to listen, where the Governor would listen.  [Richard "Dick"] Lamm was the governor at that time.  So it was just -- but we felt that the Lieutenant Governor's tenure was very public and significant.  We had an integrated work force and, yeah, so it was important.
Story_ID: 76386
Speaker 1: Okay, now you -- when did you come back to Minnesota (unclear).
Speaker 2: Came back to Minnesota in 1985, went to Houston [Texas] after I left Colorado.  My husband and I separated when I left Denver [Colorado], and then I went to Houston [Texas] and did some work on my brother's campaign, and then stayed there and then my father died in 1985 and I moved back to Minnesota after his death, and when I came back I went back to the "U" [University of Minnesota] but as a staff person, as a faculty in the College of Education.  So at the College of Education I was a Senior Fellow there doing a special project with Black Families in White America, because I had been to [University of Massachusetts] Amherst, gotten my advanced degree and my dissertation was looking at the role Black families and Black communities had played in educating us as a people and I wanted to apply some of that and test out some of that information here.  So I organized some Black Parent Advocacy Groups and did some work in that area.
Story_ID: 76387
Speaker 1: Now there's some -- I know there has been some controversy here in Minneapolis [Minnesota] about -- and the NAACP has been a contender in this, they contend that the black students should be bused I guess to other schools or there should be busing all around to achieve certain racial balance in each school, and then some have contended, I think the former Mayor's position was that we ought to build strong neighborhood schools and not worry that, and in light of your research on the value of Black education in the Black community -- I mean the I guess the education that we've originated I guess in our own community, and that we use to sustain us, well what do you think of this?
Speaker 2: What we have to do is understand the rationale in the first place.  As I was doing my research, part of what I did was to look at the cases that had been brought before the Supreme Court in 1952 and 1954 and try to get a clearer understanding of what had happened in those cases and why black people were willing to suffer and die and to try and integrate the schools and to get their children educated in an integrated environment and they needed to do that.  They were -- all the laws and policies of the South had been so discriminatory from slavery on and the amount of money spent for black children's education versus white children's education was such a -- such a vast difference in those amounts and the children and the quality of the buildings and the type of facilities they had and the materials they had -- I mean it was truly designed not to educate us and Black people were working very hard to try and educate their children.  So when we passed the law with the Supreme Court's ruling, the idea was that if you have Black children in a school with White children, the people aren't going -- the teachers and the monies and the resources are not going to discriminate.  The Kids are there in the building.  They've got the same teachers, the same materials and so forth and so on.  What we did not know was that the anti-Black attitude is so deep and so it permeates everything that even though our children may have been sitting in the same classroom, they weren't getting the same quality of education.  I interviewed young people who were first in their class and the treatment that they received of not being acknowledged by teachers, or being mistreated by other students, and I mean it's more than sitting in a classroom.  People misunderstood what the law -- what our people suffered and fought for.  They weren't talking about social integration; they were talking about quality education for Black children because Black people have always been interested in education for us as a people.  Truly a sense of emancipation, so what happened is, I' think we've -- the NAACP in working for integrated education and believing that if you can disperse children as we did -- the original intent was to have them in places where other children are that are not being discriminated against and therefore by osmosis, I guess, our children would not be discriminated against.  So they still believed that.  They still believed that if you bus children from this building to that, or this community, that people will treat them fairly.  That's the intent.  They want children to be well educated and they wanted them to be treated fairly and they want them to have a sense of self and purpose.
Story_ID: 76388
Speaker 1: What we're learning and what the Mayor is talking about is that that is not happening.  What's happening is that our schools are becoming more and more discriminated -- reflecting the discrimination in this society.  The numbers of young children in our schools -- I mean if you could imagine a school in Minneapolis [Minnesota] being seventy percent children and color in a community that at one time had less than one percent of its population.  So what the Mayor is saying is, until you can do housing and employment integration and fairness, you then have to deal with the community where children are, and you strengthen those.  You strengthen your community schools.  So it's almost going back to what I knew as a girl, (laughter) and that is a strong neighborhood school with support and quality teachers and your building.  Not that our materials were that quality when I was growing up, but at least we were, we thought they were and we did not know that they were not and no one treated you in a way that made you feel you were inferior or that your education was less than quality. So what the Mayor and what many others, and we're looking, that's why you've got all of the charter schools and the Afrocentric schools and the American Indian schools.  People are trying to figure out why our children are still at the bottom of the information curve.  They're still the least able to perform, they still do least well than other children and the question is, it's almost like living as long as I have, it's like a repeat of history.  You just keep trying to figure out how to overcome a system that is -- that is based on prejudice and discrimination.  So the NAACP still believes and they one of things you said was that Thurgood Marshall truly believed that if people followed the law, they would -- if the law said that there shall be no discrimination that people wouldn't discriminate, but what we know is that that's just not true.  The law may say it, but the system and its attitude towards us is so strong that it will discriminate any way.  So that -- that debate will continue and the NAACP won a suit that is now being tested to see, you know, trying to get children -- but you can't -- you can't disperse them, cause children -- these -- the schools can decide whether they will admit our children or not and they have to pay transportation and, you know from school line to some other place and our schools are all so -- in such a deficit position as far as salaries and transportation monies and extra-curricular, so it's a real serious set of issues right now and we don't -- I don't know how it's going to come out.  The big -- the thing that needs to be evaluated is "are our children learning?"  If not, why not and that's the big issue that both positions are trying to get an answer to.
Speaker 2: I think part of the NAACP's argument is that if there are separate Black schools or schools that are predominately Black, they won't get their resources because of the --
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Because of the depth of discrimination (simultaneous.)--
Speaker 1: Discrimination, yes.  Exactly, because that's what the history has taught us.
Story_ID: 76389
Speaker 1: But at the same time though, can -- do we have now are -- are we in more politically more powerful that we were, you know, say thirty to forty years --?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think we are, and the reason I don't think we are and this may sound really strange and I'm not sure how it's gonna sound, I believe that our ancestors had such high hopes for -- for the power that education could provide and they worked very hard at providing us with education, building their own schools, the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] come along tear them down, they'd start building them again.  Children having to travel from one community to another to stay with relatives at a school that might be better than the school where they were, communities pooling their resources to have teachers stay with them because they couldn't afford -- I mean parents have worked throughout our history to give our children education, and I think the generations that came from that immediate -- generations that developed following that experience felt also that if you worked hard, if you did the right thing, if you spoke correctly, if you dressed properly, if you worked hard, you could do it.  And I think the system is so entrenched in its sense of oppression and discrimination that there aren't enough examples for our children to feel that the work -- cause it's hard work to study and to become educated.  That's a job that is not as rewarding as many of us thought it might be.  So what do you have?  You have our people still being rewarded for the things that people have always felt were our strengths, that's music and big muscle activity.  They give very little respect to the intellect, to the hard work of study and reflection and research and development.  They'll let a few in, as it's always happened, but I don't think enough of our children feel that that's rewarded.  So that there is a subliminal attitude among many of our young people that keeps -- that prevents that zeal that existed with your parents, with me, with my grandparents, etc., because the hope was still there.  I think we're losing the hope and that's the part that I think creates for me more stress than anything I know, is that our children aren't as hopeful as they once were, because the system continues in my judgment to deny them their potential.  You look at what's ahead of our children now.  What do you need?  You need to be computer literate don't you?  You need to be able to understand all -- and how many children of our children have the access to that kind of material to do what they can do best, or to have people who believe in them and give them the kind of faith and high expectations and then with the quality of instruction.  You put the poorest quality teachers in our schools, they -- so I think that, no, it's not as -- I don't think that zeal among some of our people, cause I maintain that -- at one time I said eighty-five percent of our people are still in the shadows of the plantation.  Now that percent might be higher.
Story_ID: 76390
Speaker 1: You walk around and you see the lack of hope that's there and the lack of real opportunity that's there and people having to come from such a sense of deprivation in a society that doesn't respect and we go from one thing to another.  What I find very interesting, hey you know, now the "drive while black", or profiling or I mean all the kinds of things that the system -- it's so etched in the fabric of American life that it continues to find ways to discriminate against our people.  It just does and they're in ways that are insidious and they're ways that are so depleting of one's sense of justice.  So, you know we get people who don't have -- don't have the faith, cause they get, you know, I mean they get rewarded for stuff or they get, you know, that's not life fulfilling. It's life destroying.
Speaker 2: I couldn't help but think of the movie "Bamboozled" when we were discussing these cyclical activities, you know, that they were comparing maybe some of the current popularity of songs and (unclear) that denigrate the black community by black people.
Speaker 1: Exactly, by black people and it's because --.
Speaker 2: You don't know how popular that is.
Speaker 1: And because they don't recognize that as denigration. That's what is hurting, I think, you know, if you don't -- if you don't -- if you haven't thought about the fact that the words you use are destructive to a people.  If you just think they're words and that they don't mean anything and they're just songs, and you keep -- and people reward you, I mean the big white record companies love that, and our kids make lots of money and we're based, this society is a society that rewards money and position.  Not quality, not character, and our kids are a product of this.  I mean they see what goes on and now we see what even happens at other levels of -- I mean it's just the destruction of a quality, of a character of a people, it's -- I am very sad about it, you know I wish --sometimes I wish that I just could go away and not -- not read the paper or listen.  Everything and at this moment in history, this 2002, 2001, 2002, I just feel it's so anti-me and my values and my sense of right and wrong and the fact that people are so willing to give up their own civil liberties or they're so consumed by -- by slogans and you know, the old cliche of sixty second sound bites.  We are just -- and we're such a pop society, that you know it makes you wonder what's happening to us for people to abuse their children and to you know, you just read in the paper all of -- and people curse, they have no sense of respect.  Your parents probably -- I know we did believe there's certain things you don't do in front of children and elders and women.  You just don't do them.  It's not acceptable, it's not -- you don't do it.  Nobody is teaching anybody ethical behavior - what's right, what's wrong.  I just think the whole thing is going to pot (laughter), and I do believe it's because I'm old.  I think when you are -- when you've seen so much repeat of history and you know what you've fought for and thought you were fighting for and the doing it the right way was going to, I -- we even in the 1960s use to say, "Well, what we need to do is to help white America understand that it's coming out their pocket."  If you can relate what you're doing to something that they can relate to through their system, they will surely behave differently, and you go and you drag people before communities of people to tell their story.  I mean they're back to that.  Get before a church group, get before this group to tell your sad story,
Story_ID: 76391
Speaker 1: Or just allowing children to get through school and not be educated.  We don't care.  America doesn't care, and to know that that still happens.  Kids are not healthy, we're obese.  Every statistic that is destructive, we have the highest number.  Things that you never even knew existed when they do the statistics black people have the highest number of obesity, highest number of cancer, highest number of HIV--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Highest number of people in prison, the greatest number of children uneducated.  The poorest people as far as health and human services and homes and -- how can that be, this is 2002, and we were emancipated in 1865.  How could that be?  It's because it's so deeply etched in the fabric of American life that it doesn't matter.  Whatever you do, we're gonna end up on the lowest rung of the ladder, whatever you do, cause people will figure out.  They've gotta have us down there in order to, I guess maintain a standard.
Story_ID: 76392
Speaker 1: We have a very large population of Somalians here.  Minnesota hired Somalians before they -- I don't know where African American people are.  Taxi drivers, people out at the airport, those were the people -- I mean it's that constant denial of black people and then it pits one group against the other.  So there we were, you know, being angry with our brothers and sisters from Somalia.  The system does it.  It gives you a quarter and says everybody take a piece of it, you know.
Speaker 2: It does seem to make you wonder if that's, you know, how there could be a particular special hate for African Americans in this country that--
Speaker 1: I think there is.
Speaker 2: That doesn't exist for other Africans (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  There -- its right.  When I was in college and we had African students at Fisk [University], they could sit on the front of the bus.  That's when I had bus experience was in Nashville [Tennessee] in college, and they could sit at the front of the bus.  Some of our people began to be very clever.  They'd put a turban on and talk pig Latin (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've heard of this before.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) yes.
Speaker 2: Someone told me about this last week.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, so you know we said white people are pretty slow.  So it's really -- it's being African American because everything has trained the larger system to not like us.  I think most people don't like us and they will accept any other group before us.  Maybe the American Indians are also in that category, but American Indians in my judgment are much -- they are people who don't -- they are not really striving, well that may be a generalization, but I think that they're not quite as concerned perhaps.  They want their rights and their justice and they want everything that everybody else, but they don't care if White America doesn't like them.  We've been trained to -- for the -- to make the system like us, you know, the less different we are, the better.  That's the way we've been trained as a people.  So black people and I think that's why you find so many of our young blacks today are trying to be just anything but white, you know, and what -- the whole the idea of things that I grew up believing from my culture and experience and the world around me that being smart and working hard and looking right and behaving properly was not white.  Kids believe now that those characteristics are white, so they avoid them.  And see I think that's all a part of -- my kids say mother and her conspiracy theories (laughter), but I think there is conspiracy.  If I can teach you to do things that are self-destructive, you'll do it.  It's like Carter G. Woodson said, you know, "You can teach a man to go around to the back door and if one isn't there he'll make one."
Speaker 2: You don't have to teach them if you've --.
Speaker 1: You don't have to teach (simultaneous) oriented to do that.
Speaker 2: You don't have to tell him (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: That's right, Pavlov's dog.  I mean you train people to behave a particular way then you just put them on that path.  And see, part of my research -- the Governor of Mississippi in 1906, and the name escapes me but his statement doesn't; was that he was convinced that the last group of Black people were being born, that they would soon be rid of all Black people in Mississippi; and what I've said is that it looks like it has taken 100 years plus for them to try to do that, and if you do it systematically, you don't educate people, you don't -- they're not healthy, they're not affirmed, they're not rewarded.  After a while, you know, people do what they have to do.
Story_ID: 76094
Speaker 1: Alright, now can you tell us then - kind of like, you know, I guess walk us through the rest of your career and some of the highlights of that?
Speaker 2: Let's see when I came back to Minnesota and I went to the College of Education as a Senior Fellow there and doing the work and then I taught some courses.  We -- so I did -- I was also on the faculty and then the - [Louis]Farrakhan had been on our campus, I think the year before I came or several months before I came back, and there was a -- as you know the Jewish community and the African American community or parts of the African American community regarding [Louis] Farrakhan.  So the Jewish community was very upset with the University of Minnesota for having had Farrakhan on its campus.  The President of the University asked me if I would meet with the University and the community people to talk about this issue, and what they were talking about was the traditional thing of having somebody come in and speak like Jesse [Jackson, Jr.] or somebody come in and talk about all of this and try to pull the two communities together.  My position was that we do that all the time.  We have an issue and then we bring somebody in to speak to it; that person is gone and the community is still left in my judgment with the issues that are there, that were there before the speaker came and that what we needed to do was to try and create an understanding between these two communities that had been really allies forever and have an understanding of why one community could see a person like Minister [Louis] Farrakhan and get one opinion of him and another group of people can see this same person and have a different opinion.  So it created another kind of dialogue and developed what we call the - sort of the diversity.  Where is the University of Minnesota on all this?  So we listened to -- created some forums and had different voices -- students to share some of their experiences that they were having and faculty and teachers and community.  What we did was to go to the community, we organized focus groups with the press; what's your image of the University, so we had about a two-year plan that brought people on our campus.  For the first time African American faculty and students and Jewish faculty and students came together and talked about things.  We didn't videotape it because it was felt it would -- it would not--.
Speaker 1: Intrude.
Speaker 2: It would intrude in the conversation.  So we -- but it was the first time that had ever happened and it allowed Black people to talk about how they felt about Jewish people who can be White or Jewish or whatever and Jewish people could talk about how they felt about being left out of the struggle in the 1960s and you know, saying go home and work on your own people.  So it was a very interesting -- then what we tried to do was to create a course, sort of a - a course of raising that question about how one community can see an issue and another community -- and so we had two outstanding scholars.  An African American woman, Rose Brewer, you may have heard her name at the University and another woman by the name of Professor Pearl, for them to create a course together to talk about these very basic things.  So we did that during this period.  It was called -- so we worked on that for a while and they demonstrated a course.
Story_ID: 76095
Speaker 1: Then I was asked to -- I was telling you [HM] Delores Cross was our first Associate V.P. for Diversity.  It was called "Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs" with emphasis and responsibility on faculty and students of color to work out issues of retention and recruitment and promotion and those kinds of things and when Delores left, she was here -- I was on her search committee when we hired her and she stayed for maybe two years and then she left, and we started searching for a replacement and we could never really find what we were looking for.  So they asked me if I would come and take this position and I agreed to do it for three years, so I came on as the Associate V.P. and what we did -- and I really feel very proud of the period that I was in that position because I understand the system, University of Minnesota, having been a Regent, having been a faculty, having been involved in it deeply -- I understood how it worked, how it functioned and so I felt what was important was to apply that knowledge to the issues that are of importance to our people, to our people of color, and began then to look.  We had a budget in my office that allowed Departments to hire quality faculty of color and we would support that department's hiring cause maybe they wouldn't have it in their budget then, but we arranged it so we would assist them until -- and they would then systematically work that position into their budget.  So we worked on that.  I was telling you about John Powell, and sort of the cluster hiring and the -- and the whole process of getting faculty of color hired.  So it wasn't the traditional process, and I don't know if we have time to go into that, but then the other was to create a system for faculty to get tenure and promotion so that we didn't have faculty coming and faculty going and a way of assisting students in performing better than they had been.  We also created a process of having deans.  What we did -- we the University was going through a process as all institutions do periodically and that's strategic planning.  So we were in the process of re-examining our mission and goals and how to accomplish the things that we needed and in a strategic plan and so what I was able to do -- successful in doing was getting the issue of diversity as a centerpiece in the -- a center piece in the diversity, having diversity as a part of a center in the strategic plan, and then that meant that deans had to then develop budgets that reflected that and I had the man who is now at the University in a Vice President position.  He was in my office.  I hired -- what I wanted to do was to hire faculty to have the experience of working in an administrative office, so I hired, got permission from Dr. Robert Jones' department to have him spend forty-nine percent of his time in my office and he is a real scholar, Dr. Robert Jones, who is there now as a Vice President to be the point person to check budgets and to see that departments were on line in doing the things they needed to do, and I think that that kind of work has to happen.  Now, we still don't have the number of faculty that we want to have cause this is not an easy place for faculty of color to come and make this a life, you know, they're -- we're losing John and we've lost others.  They will come but it's very hard to stay, or for students to be very successful.  That's increasing, that number of success is increasing.
Story_ID: 76096
Speaker 1: So I think that as far as the University [of Minnesota]and the -- that -- that part of my career that has been I think for me an important -- what -- infusion in the system.  The thing is people have to stay on it.  You know what I mean?  You can't introduce something and then walk away from it, because the system is so elastic it will snap right back to doing things the way it has always done them and--.
Speaker 2: Such a good description.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what it -- it just -- you have to stay on it and one of the things that I wrote a chapter in a book that a Black woman wrote about women in the Academy, about the experience.  What does it mean to be a black woman, and in my position there weren't -- I was the only black person in the cabinet of our department for quite a while and then another person was hired, a man and he became a member of the cabinet, but they, you know, people don't pay much attention.  You have to really be pretty tenacious and persistent and then the person who follows you has to get on your shoulders as I tried to do to Delores' shoulders.  Get on those and you keep climbing, but if somebody doesn't get on that -- if they don't take that as their goal and mission and they go in a very different direction, all that you think you've done is lost.  They almost have to start all over again.  That's why I think sometimes we don't make the progress that we need to make cause we can't stay on task, hold on and stay in there and keep at it, cause the system, you know, it's not going to move easily.  It's like a tugboat, it's just not gonna do it, and when you're fortunate or blessed and have an opportunity to do anything that's going to make a difference for your people, you just -- you just have to keep doing it.  We never, there's never a time out for us oldsters.  You never get, you know, you just, you'd like to say, "time out".  I'd like to go somewhere and not worry about it but as I shared with you earlier, you just -- you don't have that privilege.
Story_ID: 76097
Speaker 1: Okay. What do you -- what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been -- I think my legacy is the tenacity, the constant effort of staying on the case and really having an opportunity to be able because of the way I was raised of feeling comfortable and okay about myself.  I think that it allows me then to feel comfortable and okay about other people and as a result of that I think the legacy of being able to get a fair housing law passed and to do the kinds of things that we've been able to do in the Civil Rights and Human Rights area that it's allowed -- I think the legacy will be that I was able to talk with, understand other people, but stay on the task of black people and where we are trying to go. As I -- you know we were talking earlier about parents and what they mean.  The fact that you can be blessed with people who teach you that you're okay and they are about serious business -- my dad was always out there working on issues that were important to us as a people.  My mother was always out there demonstrating her caring about other people.  So that becomes a part of who you are and you don't have to -- the legacy of not having to hate white people -- to love black people.  I don't have to do that.  I don't feel that that's necessary.  You can love human beings and stay on task of freedom and justice and equality for your people, and I think that's a legacy.  I believe that that's how most people would speak of me.
Story_ID: 76098
Speaker 1: How did -- did your parents get a chance to see you become successful and --?
Speaker 2: My mother died at age fifty-three of a heart attack.  So she didn't see this other work, and my father saw the things -- but they were always proud of you, no matter what you did so I've never even thought about that question until you just raised it, cause they were always there, you know, just whatever you were doing--.
Speaker 1: Always supportive?
Speaker 2: Always supportive.
Speaker 1: Your father sitting next to you playing the piano--.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: He's tone deaf.
