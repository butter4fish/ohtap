Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't re--I don't have that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, well, do you remember where she was born?  I'm thinking, you know--.
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Richmond, Virginia.  My father was born in, in North Carolina, but really as a very, youngest child, was brought to Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your father's full name?
Speaker 2: James Edward Height.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you know his date of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, we've got that somewhere.  But tell us about your mother's side of the family.  What do you know about them?  Where did they come from and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, they come from Richmond and several other counties in Virginia.  And my, my mother had three sisters.  They, they had different experiences.  My mother was trained as a nurse.  The other two sisters--two of her sisters were teachers, and the, the fourth one, my Aunt Sally, was one who, at a very early age began to work for people.  And she really never got an education.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories that have passed down through the family about life during slavery or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, I've not heard of any.
Speaker 1: Okay, and no stories about Africa or any ancestors coming--?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I have to say, I came very late in the life, lives of both parents.  Plus, my mother and father had each been widowed twice.  So that I am the older of the third set of children of both of them.  I'm--so there are two of us.  I have one sister--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --four years younger than I.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Antoinette Eldridge now.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about your father's side of the family?  What do you know about his side? How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: My father's family was related to an Indian tribe in North Carolina.  And all--that's all I know about them.  I don't know what the, what the tribe was really, and I think I never did hear it.  My father was a painting and building contractor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And as you said, you were a child late in life--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that came to them late in life.  So they were--your mother was over forty, I think when you were born?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  All right.  What are the--how did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, I just know that they met in, in Richmond.
Story_ID: 18140
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about growing up.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: When I, when I was four years old, my parents moved from Richmond, Virginia to, to Pennsylvania to a little town called Rankin.  Rankin is a borough of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], very small town, population was then about 7,800.  And, and it was at a time when there were what they called transportations from the South where many people moved from the South to the North.  And my father [James Edward Height] heard about this and thought there would be much more opportunity in Pennsylvania, and so he moved there.  Rankin was really overwhelmingly made up of a population of the foreign-born, most of whom were from Eastern Europe.  My neighbors were Lithuanian, Croatian, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, and so on, Italian.  But those, those were the--that was the kind of community I grew up in.  It was a very, very small African American pop--very small.  And it was a, Rankin was also a steel mill town at the time when steel mills were flourishing.  So that I lived in a town where you had to really watch out for white clothes because the soot and all of the things in the air were so bad.  The environment was really controlled almost by the steel mills.  I lived where, on one side we had a Croatian family, and the other one, Italian family.  So we, in my early childhood, you had all the different kinds of things that people cooked, and kinds of different music.  You heard lots of music.  But the black population was, was not only small, but it was kind of scattered.  So it was no one area for the, where, where we lived.
Speaker 1: So there's no black community?
Speaker 2: There was no black community, as such.  People lived throughout the whole community.  And it was also--and we were conscious of the mines, the coal mines which were not far away.  And I lost one of my nephews--my, my cousins in the, in the coal, in the coal mine.  So you were very, I was very conscious growing up as a child of two things.  When things flourished, how the steel mills were popping and iron ore and all were blazing.  And I was conscious that even in school, I learned more about bituminous and anthracite coal than I did about botany.  And then you had the mines where there were constant loss of people.  And the, the image that I had was that the, you realized the changes in the economy when they were fewer and fewer people, men going into the mills.  And when there was less iron ore and blazes of fire coming out of the steel mills.
Story_ID: 18141
Speaker 1: I've read that people considered you an old folks child.  Can you explain that to us?
Speaker 2: I think of it, my sisters, my older sisters, my parents--my mother's [Fannie Burroughs Height] daughters and all of my fam--all of them always said I was an old folks child because I came late in my mother's life and that I always seemed to have been a little more serious.  And, for example, one time my, when my aunts came up from Virginia to visit--her son who was in the, in one of the--worked in one of the mines.  And he had looked forward to her coming.  He was trying to urge her to move up with him because she was there at home alone.  And she had prepared a tremendous meal for him.  It was for his--it was really gonna be his birthday.  And when I came home from school, the, a telegram had arrived.  And it was addressed to her.  And it said that her son had been lost in the mine that day.  And I was then nine years old.  And she handed it to me because she could neither read nor write.  And I think she thought--she didn't realize that I could read.  She viewed me as a child.  So when I read it, I told her, I said, well, when my mother comes home, she'll read it to you.  Well, she, she accepted that because she said, it didn't even occur to her that I could read.  Then my mother came home and she read the telegram to her and explained it to her, my aunt always asked that--always said--called me the little old lady, she said because she couldn't, she was puzzled that I would have, what she thought, be that mature in looking at it and, and deciding that it would be better for her to have some, an older person read it to her.  So that I--and then I was asthmatic as a child.  So therefore, I was often less active than other children, doing more reading and things like that.  And they always teased me and said it was because I was an old folks child.
Story_ID: 18142
Speaker 1: What activity did, activities did you enjoy when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Reading.  I loved to read and also I studied piano and that sort of thing.  I loved music.  And I loved to do things with my hands.  I had, I made crepe-paper flowers, root beer, (laughter) every--all, all sorts of, of--I was always making something.  I liked--we used to, to just us, do a lot with crepe paper, make dresses for dolls, made dresses for activities we had at our church, things of that sort.  And I liked to make things, and I loved to read.  When we, when they played school, I always asked to be the principal so I could sit in the office and read (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is something.  So you'd rather be the principal than the teacher (laughter).
Speaker 2: Than the teacher.  So I could--as the principal, I could sit and read.
Story_ID: 18143
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  What grade school did you attend in Rankin [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Rankin Schools, Rankin Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: You mean the public school.  It was just called Rankin Public School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and how did you--?
Speaker 2: And though I was asthmatic, I went through year after year, never tardy and never absent, but--although, many a times I would have to sit up in a chair all night because you couldn't lie down with asthma.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a interesting way that you describe in your book of how they treated asthma in those days that required a fire and something, I suppose--how did they do that?
Speaker 2: Do what?
Speaker 1: It required heating something up on the fire or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, treatment for asthma then was just not there.  There was a, something called Asthmadore, and it was like a powder.  And you lighted the powder, put a hood over your head and inhaled it.  My father [James Edward Height] had asthma too, so the two of us usually had to go through this at the same time.  But it was the only way you could get any kind of relief was to inhale the fumes from this little fire.
Speaker 1: So it actually helped, huh?
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, in spite of having the asthma, you played basketball in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--well, actually, when I got to be about twelve, I somehow came out of the asthma.  And then I played basketball.  I was on the high jump team, and I did all kinds of activities.
Speaker 1: All right, so you--I take it you liked school a lot?
Speaker 2: (No audible response.)
Speaker 1: You really liked school, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I wasn't one who preferred those active sports all the time.  And I liked the music and, in high school, I liked the debating society and things of that sort as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, church was a big part of--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The church was a, very a part.  And I lived next door to the church.  And, often, my mother [Fannie Burroughs Height] would volunteer me to help with whatever was going on in the church.  But in addition, I was very active in the junior choir and the Sunday school.  I played the piano for the Sunday school.  I was the chair of the Junior Missionary Society, and I was in the junior choir.  My father was the choirmaster.  And so I was very active in the choir and all singing activities.  And all the, we used to put on different kinds of activities for the church.  And I always had a major hand in that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at one point you formed a singing group, I believe, with some other young ladies, right?
Speaker 2: In high school.  There were two other students, Peggy Lee and Dolly Slaughter, and the three of us formed what we called the Jolly Three Trio.  And we sang together.
Speaker 1: And you--?
Speaker 2: We, we also did concerts.  We could, we could offer our services, and I wrote around to different churches and I told them,  we were three girls who wanted to go to college.  And we could do concerts.  And we did solos, we did piano, solos, we did duets, we did the trio.  And we could do any of these programs and offered it to them to give them sixty percent of the proceeds and forty percent to us.  So we got some dates and we did well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there's a story in the book about listening to KDKA, which was the first radio station in the country--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --out of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And hearing some of your music on the radio (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of my--Dolly Slaughter called.  She heard a group on the air, and she called me.  She said, well, Dorothy, you should have heard this group that are on there.  They're imitating us.  And it was The McGuire Sisters (laughter).  And I had to laugh because they never heard of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were involved in several big oratorical contests in high school, right?  And you were known as a orator in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it's an interesting thing.  I was always a good student, but I was very shy.  And in that period, I developed a very large repertoire of poetry, [Paul Laurence] Dunbar and other poets.  And my English teacher encouraged me to--in fact, she enlisted me and said she wanted me to represent the school in an impromptu speech contest.  Well--and she's, she had to coach me for that.  So that I moved from the poetry to the impromptu speech.  And then when I was a junior in high school, I saw an ad in the gym when I was coming to a basketball game, saying if you want to go to college, enter x oratorical contest and I did.  And I, it was on the Constitution of the United States.  And I won my four years in college.  And that was very important to me because, if you remember, 1929 when I graduated, was the year of the Great Depression.  And I learned--I made my speech around the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution.
Speaker 1: Now, also, in high school, you, you were the secretary, class secretary, right--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for the class.  And you were a pretty good student, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was always pretty much--I was never below the third.  I was always the first or second in any class that I was in.
Story_ID: 18144
Speaker 1: I read that your mother [Fannie Burroughs Height] was active in the Pennsylvania Federation of Colored Women's Clubs?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and you heard Maude Coleman speak, and she was a state rep for Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to Williamsport, Pennsylvania because I was very active in a, in a junior and girls' clubs of the Federation of Colored Women's Clubs.  And we went to Williamsport, Pennsylvania for a state conference.  And there was a woman with--Maude [B.] Coleman, who had been elected to the legislature.  And she gave a speech that really intrigued me because it said to everyone, there's a openness, a high way and a low way, and you choose the way your soul will go.  And I couldn't rest till I got a copy of that, and I learned it.  For me, it was kind of a high point because it help--it helped me to see through who I was and what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all your life, you've been around women--you've seen women organizing and, and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and doing things.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you've been a--and from the--.
Speaker 2: Cause my mother was very active in women's clubs.  And my father [James Edward Height] was very active in the [Order of] Knights of Pythias, the [Modern] Woodmen [of America] very active in church circles, very active in choir circles, my dad; organizations of choir directors and things of that sort.  So both of my parents were, were very much involved with organizations.  And I cannot tell you how often I would do my homework and fall asleep on a church pew or several, waiting for one of them to finish one of their meetings.
Story_ID: 18145
Speaker 1: Tell us about what race relations were like in Rankin [Pennsylvania]?  You lived in a diverse community--.
Speaker 2: A very diverse community.  And generally speaking, there was a, a real good relationship for various people.  I, for example, was the secretary of my class and a Croatian boy, Billy Vodner, was the president.  And when it came time for the junior prom, he said, why don't we go to the prom?  We went to the prom.  I mean it was not sort of anything special.  There was a good relationship between all the different racial groups in the community.
Speaker 1: But there was some tension in the west of Pennsylvania, when you--I mean there's a story about being with the basketball team, I think and getting in trouble--.
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I was the Western Pennsylvania champion in the impromptu speech contest, which meant that I then had to go to Harrisburg [Pennsylvania], the state capital, to compete with the other area champions.  And when my principal and teacher drove me from Rankin to Harrisburg, when they got there and the hotel manager saw me, then he said, he didn't realize that I would be colored so he wouldn't let us stay there.  And that evening when I--and my mother [Fannie Burroughs Height] had told me before I left home, she said, well, no matter what happens, keep yourself together.  And so when my teacher was so upset, I said, well, I know I must hold myself together.  And I--she was worried about when I would eat and where I would dress.  So I just told her, I could go to a delicatessen and I could make myself a sandwich, and I could take my clothes to the Carnegie Hall and dress in the ladies' room and so I could move on from there.  And that's what I did.  And it was very significant that, in the impromptu speech contest, you draw your number, and there were seventeen in a contest.  And I drew number seventeen.  That's no advantage because each one gets ten minutes' notice.  You draw your, you drew, draw from twenty-five topics, the one you're to speak to.  And I drew the Briand Peace Compact [Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact], and so as I was speaking, I said, the peace had come 2,000 years ago, but that it had not been heeded, the messenger of peace had come, and that [Aristide] Briand had said that peace would come only, not just through a machinery such as the League of Nations, but had come through the hearts of people.  And so I drew the picture of the fact that, that evening my principal and my teacher and I had been turned away, just as the messenger of peace, 2,000 years ago had been turned away at the inn.  I was surprised when it was all over because the only colored person I had seen in the whole place was a janitor who had gotten me some drinking water.  And he and I were the only two, and the, the auditorium was packed.  And the judges were all white.  But I got the unanimous decision of the judges and I was first-prize winner.  And it was a, it was a very pertinent experience because on one hand, my principal and all of them had come to be with me, and we were turned way.  On the other hand, an all-white judges gave me the decision.
Story_ID: 18146
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about who some of your mentors were cause I, I suppose you had a number of mentors.  Who were some of the teachers and mentors in the community for you?
Speaker 2: There were two teachers in high school who were very helpful to me.  One was Myrtle Peters who was my English, and she was the one who first took an interest in helping me to enter contests and, and whether they were written or spoken contests.  Mary Moore was my Latin teacher.  She was also my home room teacher, and she was a person who took me on one day and said that I was left-handed writing, and she had me come to her house two evenings a week, and she helped me to learn to write with my right hand.  So those teachers were very helpful.  They, they were both Irish Catholic.  They both had a, had a capacity for involving you, for helping you to get involved and keep involved.  And Ms. Moore had the Latin Club, and, of course, I was very active in that.  And Mrs. Peters really was the person who coached me, who urged me to enter the oratorical contests.  And after I would write my orations, she would read it and give me her comments and so forth.  So that I was very fortunate to get both of them.  In addition to, a friend of our family's, Burt Logan, who was a, very good with speech, and he used to help me also.  He was the--I called him a minister, but he wasn't really a minister.
Story_ID: 18147
Speaker 1: When you won the Pennsylvania, the Elks oratory contest for the scholarship and had a chance to go to the national, there was a--you had a rival, right?  Someone who claimed to have won it as well, right?  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, when I went to downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], from Rankin [Pennsylvania], which is about a forty-five minute streetcar ride, and I got there prepared to enter the tri-state contest, which was Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, I was supposed to have been a Pennsylvania winner.  And when I got there, a young man, James--John Thornton came up and said, what was I doing there?  He was the winner.  Well, no one in my family was an Elk, and his, his family was in the Elks.  And Mrs. Alethia Fleming, out Cleveland, Ohio, who was an Elks officer just said to me, well, you cannot be in this because this young man who represented Steel City Elks was the, to be it.  Well, I then, immediately went out and got my mother [Fannie Burroughs Height] to give me the money.  And I called Judge Houston who was the commissioner of education.  And he said, "Well, aren't you that girl who's been winning all those contests?," because I had won at every level, coming to the state level.  And I said, yes.  He said, "Well, you tell them if you're not in the contest, I will declare it illegal, and will not let it stand." Well, that's what happened.  And they withdrew the, their opposition of me entering.  And when I won the decision of the judges, it was a very, it was a very interesting experience because this, this same woman could hardly speak because she had brought a young man from Ohio that she was promoting.  But my mother was there, and I stood fast, and I had the decision, and I was pleased.  Years later, Thornton called me--I saw him, and he said, well, you beat me that time, but I've made up my mind, no one will ever beat me again (laughter).  But it was a trying experience to come to enter a contest where your mind has to be on your oration, and I had to go through all of this.
Speaker 1: Now, and he went on to become a union leader, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he later became very active in the union, union movement.  And he said to me, he said, once you beat me.  He said, I said no one else will beat me again (laughter).
Story_ID: 18148
Speaker 1: With the Elks scholarship, you chose to go to college.  I mean you chose New York University [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you manage to choose New York University over other schools?
Speaker 2: I didn't really choose New York University.  I chose Barnard College [New York, New York].  I had very good recommendations to it, and I chose it because at that time, I had thought I'd like to study medicine.  But when I went up to Barnard College, and I took all the exams, and I had all my grades, but when I reported as they sent out the notice to report, Dean [Virginia C.] Gildersleeve explained to me that they did not know that I was a Negro, and they had two Negro students, Belle Tobias and Vera Joseph.  But she said, you're--that I was young enough that I could wait a while and come back later.  Well, of course, when you finish your schooling and you come out the valedictorian of your class, the thought of waiting one year to get into a school was just traumatic, but I ended up going down to NYU to try to get in.
Speaker 1: Now, Barnard was--College was trying, was telling you that they had a quota of black students?
Speaker 2: Yes, a quota of two.  And one of them graduated, the next fall, they could take me.  But they never had more than two at a time, and why, even later in life, when people say to me affirmative action is about quotas, I know it isn't.  I know what a quota is, and I know how you feel about a quota.  But when I went down to NYU at the suggestion of my brother, and my sister took me, my oldest sister, when I got there and the dean asked me if I had any papers or had applied or had a diploma, had anything, and I said, no.  My sister said to me, she said,"Well, Dorothy show them your letter from Barnard with your grades in it."  And so I did.  And the dean simply looked at it and she said, a girl that makes these kind of grades doesn't need an application to NYU.  So I was taken in, and, you know, it was a great, not only, not only a relief, but I mean it was sort of a saving point.  Interestingly enough, in later years, both of the schools gave their highest honors, a honorary degree from Barnard College--from NYU, and a medal of honor from Barnard College.  And I told both of them my story.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you like NYU?  And what was your experience at NYU?
Speaker 2: I loved NYU.  It was--in fact, it probably was where I needed to be because it, it has a widely diverse population, and all of my teachers were very helpful, very good to me, very strong.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you started NYU in 1929, I believe?
Speaker 2: Right, September 29.
Story_ID: 18149
Speaker 1: When you were there [at New York University, New York, New York], you organized a chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority?
Speaker 2: I sought to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I went up and we got all the reports in, the dean found that not all the, not all the young women interested had the grade points that the school required.  So that I gave up--had to give that up, and I later became a member through the citywide chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were some of the activities that you were involved in at NYU?
Speaker 2: Well, at NYU, I played basketball.  I was one of, one of the two African American students on the basketball team.  I played it the first year, but my parents, being older, the Depression being so severe, I felt that I needed to get my education over as soon as possible.  And so I got permission, and I was able to finish my bachelor's degree in three years and use the fourth year of the scholarship for my master's.  So I gave up the sports to do that.
Speaker 1: So you had a, sort of an intense--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --time of studying, I guess.  Now, you were involved in some community activities though too.  Tell us about the Ramses Club and what that was?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it's interesting.  There was--we had a number of African American students there.  And we weren't--we didn't see ourselves as a caucus, but it was kind of a natural grouping.  We got together and talked.  And there were some very brilliant students in the group.  And one of them, Hulan [E.] Jack, became borough president of Manhattan.  But in the course of all of this, we decided that we would organize what was called the Ramses Club, which gave us a way of seeing ourselves as African Americans and discussing Africa and, and our own interests and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay, why was it called the Ramses Club?
Speaker 2: Well, the young man who had done some research, he decided that--he though that would be a good name because they wanted to use it, use the whole Egyptian background and that sort of thing.  And using this to keep us, relating ourselves to Africa.  That was his, that was the main point, and that we would see ourselves as, as African.  There--see, African American students at City College [of New York] and at Hunter College also were organizing.  And so periodically, we would all gather together and have lectures by Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois or other people that we could hear from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that Paul Robeson lecture.
Speaker 2: Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes.  We had just a wide range, and it was a very rich kind of experience.
Speaker 1: And also Kenneth Clark had something called the Touchstone Club, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, Kenneth Clark--Touchstone was the group, and was the name of the group at City College, and there was Kenneth Clark who later did the action on Brown vs. Board of Education, John Marcell, a, a number of those students.  And then at Hunter College, we had a group of young men so that we all gathered together around certain things and worked together.  Kenneth Clark and I were among--and with [James] Jim Robinson who was at Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York], we were, we were part of a group called the Harlem Youth Council.  So we had that organization too.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the youth councils are very important in your--when you were--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would say that, I would say that for me, the--all the years of my life, especially my teenaged years, were the formative ones.  I think that, that because I was a part of this, going around with this group, but also I was a part of--I made connections at NYU with a student who was active in the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion church.  And I had been so active in Rankin [Pennsylvania] in the church that I wanted to find out some youth group.  And through his contact, I met the people at AME Zion Youth Group, that Dr. Carl Hythinberger (ph.).  Then I became active in the United Christian Youth Movement.  So I was very active in a number of movements, but for me, it was through those activities that I got a sense of, you know, what I wanted to be and what I wanted to do.  It, the, the Christian Youth [Association] movement, through that I--in 1937 I was sent as a world, as one of ten American youth delegates, to the world Conference on Life and Work of the churches.  It was my first world ecumenical experience.  It was a very significant movement.  Through the American Youth Congress, I had been one of the young people Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt had come to Hyde Park to plan for the world conference of youth.  And all of these of activities helped me to see, not only who I was and what my interests were, but coupled with the fact that I had already started studying the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments in high school.  All this kind of made things come together for me.  And that's why I often say that I may be ninety-one years old today, but it's what I did at--when I was nineteen that made the difference.  That's where I really got my start.  It's really where I got the kind of grounding and a sense of a life's work so that I, I know the difference between having a job or having a position, being elected to it or employed in it or anything else, and having a sense of a life's work, what you want to give your life to, what you want to work at.  But that started for me before I was twenty-five.

Speaker 1: You had a diverse and kind of rich background in Harlem [New York] in so many different kinds of organizations.  Now, you--for a while you were a proofreader for the 'Negro World' too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was in graduate school, there was a student, one of the students who was a journalism student.  And he complained constantly about this demanding job he had at the 'Negro World,' which was Marcus Garvey's newspaper.  And so one day, I convinced him, I said, well, why don't you just give that job to me.  And he said, well, maybe they won't, won't want you.  I--see, he wondered whether a girl would be taken.  And I said, well, let me go and see.  So I went to see Mr. Merchant [NOT FOUND], and I was employed to take that job.  It was one of the best things ever happened to me because I had the experience of seeing the Garvey principle that black has to be excellent in work--at work, that there was, there was no way of just saying, well, I've done the best I can.  And that was not good enough.  It had to be excellent.  And I, as a proofreader on that newspaper, I learned so much that has made a real difference in all of my work that I do.  In addition, it gave me, coming from a small, rather conservative community, with a small black population, it gave me an opportunity to be related to something where it was clearly focused on the contribution of black people.  It gave me a, a chance to be a part of a movement.  I didn't, I didn't get into all of its aspects organizationally cause I was in school, but it gave, but I still was in touch with it from, when I had to read the preparation I had to do for things, but also with taking hold of that message that whatever you do, black people had to show the best that they had.  And then they had to be willing to make some sacrifice, but also they had to be willing to stand up for what they believed.  And I, I, I found that a very important element of my own development.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, nowadays, and it's not as bad now as it used to be, but there was a period of time when, whenever the Garvey Movement was written about, it was scorned, you know, and what you're saying is a lot different from what--.
Speaker 2: Well, it was then, but you see this was his newspaper.  So no matter whatever anyone said, we said what he wanted us to say, and what we wanted to say in that paper.  At that time, you remember, he was, he had been exiled in 1927 so that he, himself, was not there.  But he used every means of communication available to us, and everyone of those people who worked there, especially Bill Merchant, to make sure that we got the philosophy, the requirements for production and the--that we had the commitment to the kind of goals he was setting.  And his movement was one of the most significant in this country.  And many people felt that because he talked about "back to Africa," that there was something wrong with it.  And I don't think that it was ever fully understood.  But for me, it was a very rich experience, being able to fill the strength of blackness and how you could somehow enhance your own life as a person, being a black person, if you could take hold of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you, you also attended some of the activities of the Harlem History Club in New York, too, as well?  That's Dr.  Willis [N.] Huggins and the group out of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  There was, and I think this is another thing.  And I grew up in a Harlem that I would say was really a, sort of a Renaissance Harlem because you had such developments and stuff.  Also, where the stress was on both history and economic development.  Now, we're back to this now, after the Civil Rights Movement.  But I wonder where we would have been if we could have really taken some of what Willis Huggins and others were trying to say about our--your, economic development, putting the cultural and the economic together, even helping us to see the importance of supporting our own artists as well, as well as our businesses.

Speaker 1: Harlem [New York] was, was alive with art and creativity, and some of it was popular art and some of it was fine art.  Now, who were some of the musicians in Harlem that you knew or--?
Speaker 2: Well, first there was Duke Ellington, Sy Oliver, Cab Calloway.  For a while, I lived next door to the Mills Brothers, and there was Lena Horne, Count Basie.  The interesting thing is that, at that time, many of the musicians had little work, but they would work downtown and then come to Harlem--there was a restaurant on Seventh Avenue, where sometimes the peo--they would be helping and waiting tables and singing with three (unclear).  And, you know, it was, it was a remarkable kind of experience.  It was also a time when Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen and John [Oliver] Killens and all of them were very much a part of life and Paul Robeson, of course.  So, and I worked for Paul Robeson on what he called a Housing Coordinating Committee cause he was trying to do more about housing for the poor, as well as doing his singing.  So it's, Harlem was just a marvelous place for me to grow up.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that one of your--that you lived close to W. C. Handy?
Speaker 2: I lived next door to W. C. Handy.  And we would spend holidays together.  His daughters, particularly, Catherine [Handy Lewis] and, and they--we were friends together.  And whenever we were with Mr. Handy, he always played the 'St. Louis Blues.'  I do have to say that it was his song, but other people played it better, but he certainly was the creator.  And we always--I always loved to hear him tell about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have a story about it, about the 'St. Louis Blues'?
Speaker 2: Well, he would just, you know, he would just say how he took the feelings of people and put them into music, and say "I hate to see the sun go down".  It's almost, it's, it's almost like saying, the close of day makes me sad.  And he would, he had all kinds of stories about some of his work that he did.  And he loved to play the, the saxophone and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 18152
Speaker 1: Now, you also knew, now you, at, at one time you were, you were a student teacher at the Little Red Schoolhouse [New York, New York] too.  You were the first black student teacher at the Little Red Schoolhouse?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the Little Red Schoolhouse was a part of the New York public school system, but Elisabeth Irwin had this special experiment within the schools.  I guess you would call it progressive education.  And when I was a student at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], I--a white student, Margaret Robinson and I were the two students assigned to the Little Red Schoolhouse for our student teaching.  And so it was one student and I were the only people of color in the school.  But it was a great experience because it--Ms. Irwin stressed, you do not teach subjects; you teach children.  And it helped me to understand the importance of involving children and getting children to express themselves and to, you know, to teach them.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were involved also with the Brownsville Community Center too, right?
Speaker 2: When I was a graduate student, I was assigned to the Brown Hill--Brownsville Community Center.  Now, this was in this place where--many remember Mike Tyson.  They always talk about the area he grew up.  It was the highest delinquency area in the city of New York.  The population was Jewish and African American.  And because it was seventy-five percent Jewish, the Jewish customs dominated so that you could purchase anything on Sunday, but nothing on Saturday.  And even the people themselves, because they had no jobs, many only made their living by doing what they called making fires for the Jewish community.  They said, they--you'd ask a man, what is your job?  He says, I light fires.  And that was because a group of, in the old north Jewish community did not light fires on Fridays and, for the Sabbath.  And they employed people to come in and do that.  And that was the only work they had.  So that Brownsville Center was kind of a--it was an outpost, a mission center for the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation.  And we distributed food, which was supplied by the Red Cross.  We worked with getting children out of trouble, everything.  I even helped the Reverend [John] Scott who directed the center, to organize a church, Universal Baptist Church.
Story_ID: 18153
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the [National Black] United Front.  Now, you're involved with United Front, right?
Speaker 2: (Nodding, yes)
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that you knew in United Front and what was it?
Speaker 2: Are we rolling?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, the--when you look at the country today, it's hard to realize that there was a day when we had what we called the United Front.  That was people of all political backgrounds worked together, especially with, and this includes the Communists.  And I think to me the richness of it was that you, we got to know and to work together and to realize some things which we had in common, and then the places where we really were different.  It was the McCarthy era that kind of destroyed that.  And, and also the beginning of all of the war and all of this kind of thing.  But I think the good thing was--and I often wonder how, what it would be like, would have been like if there could have been the opportunity for more young people to have the challenge of working with people who had different political views; not just thinking in terms of parties, but in terms of real political views, the dialect, the materialism that affected Communism, what a real challenge to me and to others who were Christian, that we could work together.  But I think we had to defend ourselves against each other, which was a very, very--it was a growing experience.
Speaker 1: And it's a sharpening kind of experience.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember one time one of the young Communists said to me, because we were working on the issue of world peace, and he said, we always wanted to describe it and say that we are create--we all have one creator.  They did not want to say that.  And finally, he said to me, well, you're always talking about God, wanting to put God into things.  He said, they said, said, "Don't you know I can fly in the face of your God."  And I had never heard anybody speak like that.  But before I knew it, I was saying to him, "But do you realize that it's my God that gives you the capacity to fly."  And from then on, we had a little different relationship.  But the idea of having to, to, not only know what you believed, but to say something in defense or that expressed it, was something that I think is missing now, where you, we have more fear of difference at a time when we need to have more clarity of difference and are willing, each one, to stand up for what they believe.
Speaker 1: And the political organizations don't seem to exist like that any more--.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --where--.
Speaker 2: And, and when, when they were doing a study of, or an investigation around those Communists who were--the eleven or twelve, whatever number it was, and I was called to answer, the most that I could say was that Henry Morton or Carl Ross or any of them, as far as I was concerned, they were decent and strong; that they were people who worked along on issues and were concerned.  And that, though I differed with them and took a different political position, I had to respect them, I had to recognize that they were honestly trying to improve the quality of life for everybody.  And it might have been a different method, with a different philosophy.  But I had to respect them for what they were trying to do.
Story_ID: 18154
Speaker 1: You were deeply involved with the Harlem Youth Council, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in those days as well, and you knew--.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think the thing is the Harlem Youth Council was issue oriented.  We were young men and young women together.  We met at least once every week and sometimes we had subcommittees on things and we'd meet at those times.  But that there was a strong emphasis against lynching, against the chain gangs, that when Thurgood Marshall or Walter White of the NAACP would return from one of their trips in the South, and they would meet with us, we got to know firsthand what was happening.  And then we would organize our efforts to see what we could do.  The NAACP used to hang out a sign that said, "A man was lynched today", because, you know, there were thousand--you know, we're talking about--lynching was kind of an everyday thing at that time.  And when they would hang out the sign, the Harlem Youth Council, we would gather up all of our young people and go to Times Square [New York] wearing black armbands, would walk around, chanting "Stop the lynching".  And we had eighty-eight youth groups in the Harlem Youth Council, every kind of church, every kind of group.  And they would come together.  There was that spirit of activism and determination to bring about change.
Speaker 1: All right, and you were part of the United Youth Committee Against Lynching?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Juanita Jackson, later Juanita Mitchell and I formed the United Youth Committee Against Lynching.  And we, we met every week on the issue of lynching.  And we, as I said, responded every time the NAACP would hang out its flag.  But we went to churches and other places talking against lynching.  We were trying to get the anti-lynch bill passed.  The bill didn't pass, but I think we did a, a great deal to help people understand what lynching was and what was happening, and we built a kind of a sentiment against it.  But we weren't able to get the bill passed.
Speaker 1: That was the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, right, sponsored by a man named [Leonidas] Dyer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is--there was a, you were also involved with Adam Clayton Powell's [Greater New York] Coordinating Committee for Employment, right?
Speaker 2: Very much so (laughter).  If they had a, if they had something organizing, you could count on, I was a part of it (laughter).  Yes, the Coordinating Committee Against--the Coordinating Committee for Employment was one in which Adam Powell trained us as young people to go down to a 125th Street because he said there was not a clerk on a 125th Street.  And he said we needed to learn and to get the message over that we would buy where we work.  And we went downtown to, to tell that to the merchants.  We went in pairs, and we met with them and got some to make commitments to employment.
Speaker 1: So that involved picketing sometimes, and right?  There was picketing involved and some direct action?
Speaker 2: We, we picketed.  Then we went in and talked to management.  We kept a steady report on every business, what attitude we found.  I remember I went to a record shop, "Sam's Record Shop".  And in talking with him, he said to us, my teammate and I, "Why don't you go up to Spears?"  That was a furniture store on 125th Street at that time.  And he said, "You can't take their furniture out of the store.  You can't steal it."  He said, but you could steal my records, and I'm not gonna let anybody come in and steal my records.  Well, that turned me on.  And we went back to Adam, and we told him about it.  So he re--he gave us more pickets to help us.  And we picketed and picketed till we got Sam to change his mind.  But the very fact that he felt free to say to us, if I put--my stores hire any of you, you're gonna steal my records, but you can't steal the furniture, was all that we needed to just reorganize in every way to see what we could do to change his mind.
Speaker 1: Now, there was a Harlem--a riot in Harlem in 1935?
Speaker 2: In 1935, there was, some story was out about a black person being chased by the police.  And I don't know what caused it.  But it was a tremendous riot.  And out of that Reverend John Johnson of St. Martin's Church shared with the Harlem committee that was to deal with the outcome of the riot.  And I was attending that summer the, the United Christian Youth [Association] movement conference in Lakewood--Lakeside, Ohio.  And when I came back, I found that I had been recommended by the committee to be put into the personnel office of the Department of Welfare because while blacks were forty-two percent of the population of the, of the relief and only eight percent of population, there was still not a black in administration.  So out of the, that riot Etta Arlen Hedgeman [NOT FOUND] and I were appointed, she to work in the commissioner's office, and I was the first African American to be assigned to work in the personnel, responsible for the hiring and relating to the hiring policies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me about the NRA, the National Recovery Act.  I mean that's--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's the way things were working.  Adam Powell said, it was the National--it was the Negro runaround because people just could not see what it was doing, what it was recovering.  There was no sign of change in the Harlem community.  And I think that's one thing that, to me, was very important.  And it was, this community suffered, but it also, also fought back, you know, and they were articulate.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, all these organizations that, the Greater New York Federation of Churches, the Harlem Youth Council, all these organizations you were involve-involved in, finally you were, you were selected to head the New York Federation of--or you were employed by the New York--the Greater New York Federation of Churches, right?
Speaker 2: (nodding, yes).
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  How did you get that position and--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was very active in the New York State Christian Youth Council.  As a matter of fact, I was the president.  And the person who was in charge of the youth work was retiring, and she wanted me to replace her as a director of youth work for the Federation of Churches based upon the work that I was doing in the Harlem community and in the state.  And so they--I was working in the Department of Welfare, and it became very clear to me that I liked what I was doing, and I was then in personnel.  But then I was working five days--I'd be working for the city of New York, and my evenings and weekends I was active in the Christian Youth Work.  So that I accepted this offer to be the Director of Youth Work for the Federal of Churches.  And then I was, that same summer, 1937, I was one of the ten youth delegates to the world conference of the churches in Oxford, England.  And when I returned from England, Mrs. Saunders, who knew of my work with the Harlem Youth Council and all the work I was doing around Harlem and all the activities, invited me to take a job at the Harlem branch of the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  So I had these two things at the same time.  But they were good enough to come together and give me the chance to choose which one I wanted to do.  I chose the YWCA because I felt that I could do more than I could do with the churches.  And, but that the YWCA also had a Christian purpose, and I chose to work for the YWCA and the Federation of Churches director assured me and everyone else that whichever decision I make, they'd be with me.  And that's true.  That's what they did.
Story_ID: 18155
Speaker 1: Also in 1937, and this is a big year because you meet Mary McLeod Bethune and Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt in '37 [1937], am I right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1937 was quite a year for me because when I came back, and I was working there at the Harlem Y [YWCA, Young Women's Christian Association], I had the assignment to escort Eleanor Roosevelt into a meeting Mrs. Bethune was holding.  And it turned out to be the meeting of the National Council of Negro Women [NCNW].  And as I was leaving to take Mrs. Roosevelt, I--Mrs. Bethune asked me my name, and when I told her, she said, come back.  We need you.  And I've been back ever since.  And even then, before I could get back, she had put me on the resolutions committee.  And the first resolution that I ever wrote in my life had to deal with child welfare for the National Council of Negro Women.
Speaker 1: Now, what was Mrs. Bethune like?  Tell us something about her.
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: What was Mary McLeod Bethune like?
Speaker 2: She was a magnificent human being, a deeply spiritual person; a person who was both no-nonsense and had a very good sense of humor.  She had an understanding of issues and it was she who came up with the idea, "Leave no one behind" cause she really felt that we needed to organize our efforts and that, as a--as, as really a basic purpose, more than a slogan.  In 1935, she founded--she had founded the National Council of Negro Women as an organization, a national organization.  And this was two years later that I met her.  But I've been very active in it ever since.
Story_ID: 18156
Speaker 1: In 1939, the, the New York World's Fair was going on, and can--.
Speaker 2: Yes, in 1939 the World's Fair came to New York City [New York].  And that was a time when so many young women came up from the South looking for jobs.  And it was a trying time to be working there, with the Harlem YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] because we had so many people women, young women, who not only needed jobs, but often didn't have skills.  So that I worked there with the YWCA on all of that.
Speaker 1: And the Y was also a living facility too, right?  Wasn't it or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you had to--it was probably filled, I guess, to the brim?
Speaker 2: Yes, and we had some that had very good facilities, even in the city of New York, but we had to try to get them open and get them to accept young people.  And I have to say that many of the young women who came in came from the South so that they had their Southern pattern of, of--you know, some of them were timid, even when you tried to open doors for them.  They were timid about moving ahead.  But we had to keep moving at, on their behalf.
Story_ID: 18157
Speaker 1: What did you do during World War II?  What were you involved in?
Speaker 2: Around the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No, just around the wartime.  What was going on in Harlem [New York] during the wartime, and what were you involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, the war, I often said that it seemed like everywhere I got, something catastrophic happened.  When I was at the Harlem branch [of the Young Women's Christian Association], the World's Fair came, and I had to deal with that.  I came into Washington [D.C.] in 1939, and the war came (unclear), and he was here during the war years.  And those were years when so many young women were receiving notices and telegrams saying report to work.  And then they would get to Washington, and there was no real work for them.  They were just sitting in pools.  They would sometimes be asked to type the manual, and one girl said, she typed it ten times.  So the telegram had come immediately.  They dropped everything, but once they got there, and they saw they were colored, they were put into a typing pool and told to type to keep their skills up.  So that I worked against that, and I worked to achieve housing for them and to achieve conditions where they would have somewhere, you know, that was decent to live.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so all these black women were coming here to D.C. and had--there wasn't enough for them to do, I guess, right, you're saying?
Speaker 2: No, they were needed, but the subtle discrimination meant that sometimes the pool of--they had women in it, they are sitting and typing was eighty and ninety percent blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you involved in the desegregation of the army efforts at all?  Did, were you involved in that?
Speaker 2: Desegregation of the--?
Speaker 1: Of the army, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We, we had a major hand, and I think when Mary McLeod Bethune took on a task of saying that there needed to be some young women, some black women in the armed services as officers, then she organized us and took us down, and had each one to speak up for why this could work.  [H.] Elsie Austin, who was a lawyer spoke on a legal base.  Dr. Faraby (ph.), a physician, on the health base.  I was asked to talk in terms of the experience in YWCA of having people of different races living together in residences.  I think we made such a strong case where we went before Mildred [H.] McAfee, who was in charge of the WAVES [Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service], that Ms. McAfee had, one of the officers said to her, "Ms. McAfee, when you have another meeting with Mrs. Bethune's women, let me know a little further in advance so I can bring my lawyer."  And we laughed at that, but it was true.  And that's--the federal agencies had not had that much direct attention of how do you employ women of all races.
Story_ID: 18158
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about the importance of Eleanor Roosevelt.  I think she's a, she's a figure in history that's starting to get, you know, some credit for doing some things that could not have been done had she not been in position to help do them.  Can you speak to her, Eleanor Roosevelt's importance?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Roosevelt was really quite a remarkable person.  Her friendship with Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune was invaluable, not only to them personally, but to the country because Mrs. Bethune did not hesitate to let Mrs. Roosevelt know what the problems were, and Mrs. Roosevelt took a great deal of initiative in going to the president, getting support.  And I think that people developed confidence in her because they knew that she would get results.  I remember when the Tuskegee Airmen were being knocked and said that black men couldn't fly, Mrs. Roosevelt went down to Tuskegee and went up in a plane with one of them.  She not only stood up for what she believed, but she had practical ideas as to what to do with them.  And I was blessed to have worked with her in those early days with Mrs. Bethune, but also in later years, when she chaired the President's Commission on the Status of Women, appointed by President [John F.] Kennedy.  And in both instances, Mrs. Roosevelt never said people are people.  She recognized people as people, but she also recognized we had different kinds of problems so that I didn't have to convince her that as the commission was doing its work, that we needed a special consultation related to the status of Negro women, and, and to look at where we were because our life pattern did not follow that of American women who it is said, they grow up, and go to college, they marry, and they move into the workforce.  That's not the pattern in a, in the African American community.  So many women, many never get to, ever get to college, but also many of them, even if they marry, they continue to work.  They do not stay home with their children.  They're--they try to get into the local--the only reason they're not working often is that they cannot find work.  And there were things like that Mrs. Roosevelt had the sensitivity to realize that we were not asking for something special, but we were for--asking for recognition that when you describe American women, you've got to follow the life patterns of all, and they are different, based upon the extent of which it is effected by their economic status and their race.
Story_ID: 18159
Speaker 1: There was an incident on a train, at a--on a train platform as you were going to a conference in Black Mountain, North Carolina, I think it was.  You want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: When I was doing a YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] conference in North Carolina, near Asheville.  It was one of the few times--one of the early times when the YWCA and the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] had joint meetings.  But the unique thing about it was that there meetings were interracial.  And we had this conference.  I arrived on the grounds and found that the staff who had been working there were very upset because they had been threatened by the [Ku Klux] Klan.  The young men who were coming to the YMCA conference were industrial workers, across the state of North Carolina.  They were already on their way to the meeting.  So there was nothing we could do to stop them.  But the whole situation had been caused because one of the young men who'd been there from the YMCA, had carried some pictures to be posed--to be printed to the druggist, drugstore.  And the drugstore had taken one that had black and white young men and women in a, in a swimming pool, had blown it up to a huge size and said, see what the YMCA is doing here to mix the races.  That, of course, caused great disturbance.  I went to the, when we--I, we went and we began our work.  And I went and talked to the director of the camp who was a man who had been in the, in the armed services, and he had a little different perspective.  He welcomed our group.  And he therefore, went and talked to the mayor.  We talked--and our director talked to the chief of police because the word was out that the Klan was gonna march on our camp and destroy it.

Speaker 1: We were telling--talking about the story from the North Carolina story in 1947.
Speaker 2: I, I was the leader of our team, and all of my colleagues were white, except for a Chinese young woman, and, and a Lebanese.  They were two visiting teachers with us.  After all appeals failed, the director of the camp came and said that he thought that I should get off the grounds because they were not able to prevail.  And so they took me to the home of the one school principal, the black woman living in the community, and the others were taken to a motel.  After we were gone, the [Ku Klux] Klan did have, march on them, and they had all kinds of--not just, they didn't just have guns.  They had knives and, well, steel bars and that kind of thing.  But since there was no black person on the grounds, they went back.  The interesting thing about that was the Chinese young woman had hysterics because she was very concerned.  The Lebanese young woman who was with her also was concerned.  But one of the things that bothered them was they couldn't understand how it was that the motel took them and they were not--I was not that much darker than they.  They could not understand that.  And years later when I went into Beirut [Lebanon], Edma Bayuthe (ph.), the Lebanese YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] worker, told an audience, and she was talking to me, that--about this incident.  And she said, she could not, she could not understand the race situation in this country.  The interesting thing is, the next year, at that same camp, some of us who left the grounds were at the train station.  The temperature was about a hundred degrees.  So we were all standing out, white and black, talking to each other.  And the janitor, a black man, came and said, they don't want you standing out here.  You'd better go in the colored waiting room.  And I said, well, I'm--we're all right.  We'll stand here.  Then another attendant came and said, go through the colored waiting room.  And soon a policeman on a motorcycle came, and practically ran over us.  He ran right up to us.  And he said, "What are you doing standing out here?  You're supposed to be in the colored waiting room."  Well, there was a young woman, one of the black students who'd been at the conference was there with me.  And she was holding onto my arm, and she clutched it, and she said, oh, Ms. Height, please do what they say because my brother refused to do what a police said, and he shot his arm off.  So I said to her, well, you go ahead, go through if you want to.  But she didn't.  This policeman followed us, got off his motorcycle, followed us because I said, well, here comes our train.  He said, you'd better not get off to that train.  I'll blow your brains out.  And I don't know what it was, but some way or other, I was just determined I was going straight to the train.  So a couple of my white colleagues, who were going to the white section, and I worked on together with this girl.  And I went on to the Jim Crow car.  As soon as, and as soon as we sat down, this young student began to hemorrhage, and we had to take her to a Nashville [Tennessee] hospital.  When I told Roy Wilkins of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] of this later, he said, one good thing is that you were a woman because had you been a man, you would have been dead.  And he said, and you were there surrounded by all those white women, and they did not want to shoot you with all of them.  So it was a kind of experience that, you know, really represented kind of the mood at that time and the recognition that any kind of mixing of the races--they called it, any kind of gathering like that was suspect, and they tried to do what they could to destroy it.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: But the YWCA, I have to say, stood its ground.  The National Board of the President called the attorney general and asked him to see that we were protected.  And the state officials promised protection, but they said, of course, we won't be able to tell you what will happen before we get there.  So you didn't have a feeling of law--being, protected at any level.

Speaker 1: In the late '40s [1940s], what were the major aims of the National Council for Negro Women [NCNW]?
Speaker 2: Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune's purpose, she said, in 1935, the Negro woman, trained and the untrained alike, stands outside of America's mainstream of influence, opportunity and power.  And she wanted to bring organizations together to increase our power and to work on those things that affected us, all the issues that affect education and health and employment and all the issues that affect our lives.  And she felt we would use our power more effectively when we did it in a concerted fashion.  And she stressed collaboration and networking long I heard much talk about networking.  She talked the importance of organizations really focusing on those things that make sure that no one is left behind.  And that was, that's--and that's what the general idea that we have been following, opening opportunities for women, training women to take advantage of them, using trained women to open doors, and to help others.

Speaker 1: In 1948, things, racial relations in the United States had come to a critical juncture with--after the war basically and the be--you know, the beginning of the Korean conflict, and the returning GIs wanted opportunities and the country was not responding fast enough.  A. Philip Randolph, you know, called for a march on Washington, right?  Were you all a part of those deliberations and discussions?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Were you a part of those discussions, ma'am, about the--I mean concerning the march on Washington, the proposed march on Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and there was a real concern because despite the fact that we had disproportionately been a part of the armed services; that our people were returning from the services, finding no jobs, and at the same time, we had these fast growing war industries, and we were not being employed there.  And so I was a part of what was then the National Negro Congress that Randolph had called.  And he kept pressing hard for seeing to it that we let it be known that, that the impact of this on our communities was one that should not be tolerated.  And he, therefore, called for a march on Washington.  And in his pressure in that direction, despite the fact that many people wondered how many people he would get to follow.  But he was so clear that President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which established really, the Fair Employment Practices Commission.  And incidentally, that was the major piece of action that affected the black population since the Emancipation Proclamation.  There had been nothing going through the legislation.  Whatever else had happened, had happened through the courts.
Speaker 1: So, so the march was called off, basically, and as there was no march--no, the march was called off, I would say.
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, ma'am.  I'm saying that they called the march off, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it really meant that the march--he didn't have the march once that had happened, no.
Story_ID: 18163
Speaker 1: You've met with every president since [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, Eisenhower, well, tell us about, you know, some of those meetings and what some of those meetings were about?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they were different.  The, my meeting with, with President Eisenhower, had to deal with getting his approval of a federal law to establish in the, in the nation's capital, what is the first memorial to an African American or a woman of any race, is the [Mary McLeod] Bethune Monument in Lincoln Park [Washington, D.C.].  And we worked several months to get President Eisenhower to sign that bill.  It meant that we had to do that without costs to the federal government.  But it was he who signed that bill, and we worked on it for fourteen years, through several presidencies and several sessions of Congress.  And in 1974, that monument was unveiled and delivered to the federal government as a part of the National Park Service.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is the first monument to a black woman and--?
Speaker 2: It's the fir--it's the first monument to a, an African American or to a woman of any race in the nation's capital in a public park.
Speaker 1: So there was not even a monument to a white woman in Washington?
Speaker 2: No, no, none at all.  To my knowledge, there still isn't.
Speaker 1: Well, that's significant.  It's 2003 now, and--okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's quite an accomplishment for those days and even for now, it would be quite an accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 18164
Speaker 1: As the Civil Rights Movement started heating up, and, you know, Brown v. The Board of Education passed in '54 [1954], I mean what was the National Council [of Negro Women] doing in regard to those issues at that--.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that all of us were very active in hoping and, that Brown v. Board of Education would bring the right decision, and it did.  I think now we're coming up to forty years--fifty years since that decision.  And we're seeing that we've made some progress, but we're far from having improved education for all children.
Speaker 1: Do you--many people that we've interviewed have mixed feelings about school integration now that it's taken place.  They all agree that it should have happened, but at the same time, they will admit the end of the black schools, you know, black high schools and public schools in the South and other areas.  How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--and I hear many people saying that, you know, this was a backwards step.  I think that the integration as it was thought of was--not to say that there were not good schools that were black schools, but that there ought to be open policy, and that separate schools as a requirement was illegal.  The decline in education, I think has little to do with, with the Brown v. Board of Education.  I think that decline is due to the neglect of the school.  If you go back and look and see that even where they had, we had good teachers in the schools, often those teachers were working with inadequate facilities and with inadequate buildings and the like, so that the drive towards opening up the schools, to me, is an important one because if we're going to live in a society for people of all races, we need to learn how to work together.  We need to learn together how to work, and that this become a very, as, as important as anything.  And I, I, I hope that as we come up now to the fiftieth anniversary, we will redouble our efforts to see how we can correct some of the things that we failed to do once we had this new foundation and law.

Speaker 1: Women, black women in this country were a powerful force in the Civil Rights Movement and, and women like Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer.  How did the, what did the National Council for Negro Women [NCNW] do to help support women in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Perhaps, one of the little known fact for recognition is that women, children, youth were indeed the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.  We had strong male leadership.  We had strong male participation.  But the, I think that's one thing that we have to have recognition.  And that there were many women who, who would be known, but many who will never be--whose names will never be known, without whom the Civil Rights Movement could not have succeeded.  If you look at any one of the areas, you'll find that, that there--and especially when we went to meeting, that often the, the platform was predominate male and the auditorium, audience, predominately female.  And I think that--I, I see several historians researching now to be able to tell their story cause I think it needs to be told.
Speaker 1: One of the key figures in the Civil Rights Movement, in terms of particularly organizing in the South was Ella Baker.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I you knew Ella Baker as well as Bayard Rustin, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, they--both.  And I think Ella Baker did a great job in organizings, particularly students and, because she worked well with young people.  And I think the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] thrived because of her help.  And, of course, Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] helped them too.  But I think that when we talk about the Civil Rights Movement, we often forget the role that the freedom rides, the sit-ins, the role that youth played at so many levels to give that movement its vitality.
Story_ID: 18166
Speaker 1: You've met most of our presidents from [Dwight D.] Eisenhower on, personally.  What's your assessment of some of them?  And maybe we can start with Eisenhower.  Can you--you have an assessment of his administration?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it, I think that--when I look at civil rights, we have to say [Harry] Truman's support and acts to desegregate the armed services was a major blow to segregation in this country, that, that--that was a major step forward.  And I think that Lyndon [B.] Johnson's strong position and support of the civil rights legislation and the Civil Rights Movement cannot be challenged by anyone that what he did was very significant.  Others played parts, but those two things stand out for me that really need to be recognized.
Speaker 1: Okay, of all the presidents we've had, those are probably the two that actually did the most for civil rights in the country?  Okay, now many people think--they have, I guess given John [F.] Kennedy a lot of credit, but it was really Lyndon Johnson that really did the most, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when you go into homes, you see a picture of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], and then you see John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy in the same frame, but Lyndon Johnson is missing.  Is he, what--?
Speaker 2: (nodding head, yes).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think the fact that Lyndon Johnson was a Southern, who had changed both intellectually and emotionally made a, made a great deal of difference.  I think he understood what the issues were.  I remember being in a meeting he had when he was vice president in which he said to this group of black leaders, some 400, he said, you know, knowing my background, you were hesitant to get me, but you wanted John F. Kennedy as president, so you let me come along.  But he said, what you don't know is that Mary McLeod Bethune put my integration diapers on me during the NYA [National Youth Administration] days.  And that's when Mrs. Bethune was serving in President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's administration as director of minority affairs for the National Youth Administration.  And he said, Mrs. Bethune--he called Mrs. Bethune and said, "Mrs. Bethune you've asked me to go to [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], Tallahassee [Florida]."  And he said, "That's a colored school."  And he said, Mrs. Bethune said, "Lyndon Johnson, I didn't ask you what color the people were.  You're a representative of the federal government, and you go where you're assigned."  And he said, and believe me, I went.  But he said, she put my integration diapers on me then.
Speaker 1: He was kind of a homey person--.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --in his general, you know, disposition in these meetings, from what I've heard.
Story_ID: 18167
Speaker 1: I've seen photos where you're the only black woman in the meeting, you know, where there, there're a like a roomful of people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And some of the black male leadership is there, but you're the only black woman there.
Speaker 2: I was a part of the United Civil Rights Leadership group.  That group, interestingly enough, really did not start out to be the United Civil Rights Leadership group.  Early in, or late in 1962, Stephen Currier, president of [The] Taconic Foundation, called together Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young and James Farmer, James Forman, A. Philip Randolph, Jack Greenberg, who had succeeded Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr. and me for the purpose of assessing how American philanthropy could be made more responsive to the needs of the black community.  We were--everybody agreed, they would come, give these meetings priority, would send no substitute, and that we would meet about every six weeks.  We were doing very well with those meetings when on June the 12th, 1963, Medgar Evers was assassinated.  And so Stephen Currier then called us together for a breakfast at the Carlyle Hotel where Roy came, but he had to leave early to go to the funeral, and Stephen had arranged for him to have a special chartered plane to take him to Arlington [National] Cemetery [Washington, D.C.] to Medgar Evers' funeral.  And the rest of us remained.  And each talked--I talked about what was happening to young women in the hands of law enforcements orders--officers, in the height of the Civil Rights Movement.  And Whitney Young, among other things, said to them, "We know more about what needs to be done than we have the resources to do."  And that stimulated a great deal.  And in that meeting, almost a million dollars was collected to help this, these, these groups, the National Council of Negro Women [NCNW] became the custodian for the funds that were taken in for the Medgar Evers children because we had an educational foundation that could do that at that time.  But I've often thought that it was as if it were the hand of God that this group should have been working together, over those months prior so that we'd gotten over the little competency--comp--pettiness, competition; that we had reached the place where there was a kind of camaraderie, and we could laugh at each other's differences and so forth.  And so given those funds, and given where we were, the group incorporated as the United Civil Rights Leadership, and that's the group that developed the strategies that took through the Civil Right Movement.  And all of those stuck together, and as I said, except when Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in jail or something like that, all the principals met together.  And I think we came to a sense of what unity means over against uniformity.
Story_ID: 18168
Speaker 1: You were talking about the plight of young women during the Civil Rights Movement, during, arrested by officers and so forth in the South.  What are some--Now, this probably a very ugly side of the, of the Movement--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) talking about.  And what specifically--?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a meeting in Atlanta [Georgia], and we called young women from all of the key spots where there was this--where young women had been jailed.  And many of them were assaulted in the, in the jails.  Some of the young children, really young ones said, at Selma [Alabama] and others, how they huddled together so they could look out for each other and protect each other.  The--some of them were submitted to very severe vaginal examinations, told that they were looking for drugs and the like.  And they used Lysol and things of that sort.  So that there was a great deal of suffering that people didn't know about, even after they got to jail.  At one place in Selma, they kept saying, they gave us boll weevil soup, and that was--that meant that they just had trash.  They fed them things that they were, I guess, hoping would make them sick.  But the suffering of so many of the young women at the hands of law enforcement officers was an issue--we had Lena Horne go with us, around to help us dramatize.  When we got back to New York, and we held a press conference, every press came.  The only one who reported anything was the 'Amsterdam News' because what most of them said was that if they had reported it, since these were law enforcement officers, they would be forced to prove what they were saying.  So that you had a, even an unfair treatment of the news.
Story_ID: 18169
Speaker 1: 'The New York Times' and the other major organs of the press didn't publish this information at all.
Speaker 2: They didn't carry it.  And when we called and checked with them, many of them said, you were reporting on police officers, and we would have to prove that in order to not be libelous.
Speaker 1: They didn't want to do what most newspapers do and say, "allegedly" or something.  They didn't even do that, huh?
Speaker 2: (shaking head, no.).
Speaker 1: Well, did the federal government promise to try to protect the women in those situations?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the--there were direct efforts made by the Department of Justice, but you have to bear in mind, they had all these makeshift jails.  They were simply lofts that they cleared out.  They were places that were not really made for jails.  So they, they were hard to, to guard and hard to take care.
Speaker 1: And probably hard for the government to monitor if they were even inclined to do so, right?
Speaker 2: (shaking head, yes).
Story_ID: 18170
Speaker 1: Tell us about the March on Washington in '63 [1963], what role you played in that?
Speaker 2: The March on Washington was a glorious experience, 250,000 people marching in one accord.  There was a climate, there was a whole climate in the country of indignation, that segregation had to go and so on.  And I think that the disappointment for me was--only disappointment, was that we didn't have a woman speaker.  The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], John Lewis, did speak because they had threatened with their speech.  The only female voice you heard was Mahalia Jackson singing the National Anthem.  But the rationale for not having a woman speaking was that in the churches, in the unions, in all those organizations, you have women.  What we were trying to get over was the message, there's a difference when women speak for women, and not speak for the, the church or some of the institutions.  But in the end, we gave that up and decided to join in and give full support and not cause anything that would be disruptive.  And as a result, I think all of us entered into this great moment when Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] gave his "I Have a Dream" speech.  And we all were a part of it, and I think we all were grateful that we had that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Now, that next year in '64 [1964] when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party was formed in Mississippi, there were some prominent black women that did get a chance to speak in the national spotlight.  Among them was Fannie Lou Hamer.  Did you get a chance to meet her, and I know you did, but--.
Speaker 2: The women have always been very clear.  Fannie Lou Hamer, you remember, always said, "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired".  But the fact that they were able to stand up and say, the Democratic Party cannot say it represents all of us if we're not included.  And if we have a delegation up there speaking for us, that is not inclusive, that it is not representative.  And I think the unique thing was that when those three women got to going on it, that the Movement just grew.  And, you know, as you knew, it was unanimously adopted that it was--really, it took that, the kind of ingenuity that you had in those women, Unita Blackwell and Victoria Gray, with Fannie Lou Hamer taking the lead, all of this, this was the way it happened.
Speaker 1: What were those names again?  Can you give it a little slower?
Speaker 2: Fannie Lou Hamer, Victoria Gray and Unita Blackwell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Those were the three that I knew who had--the most active.
Story_ID: 18171
Speaker 1: '64 [1964] is also the year that [Lyndon B.] Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act?
Speaker 2: '64 was the year of the Civil Rights Act of '64--.
Speaker 1: And were you present?
Speaker 2: And it was also the year when John--when Bob Moses organized the freedom schools in Mississippi to give children a chance to prepare to go to the schools and help them to learn and learn how to learn.  The National Council of Negro Women [NCNW] organized teams, interracial teams of women to go into Mississippi to support the schools.  We also had a small staff.  The staff, that end of it, the beautiful thing was that every woman had to agree to working on segregation when she got back home and also use her talents when she was there in Mississippi.  And that, I think made a real impact in the situation.  The 'New York Times' called it, the women came from behind the iron-- from behind the cotton curtain, cause they recognized what it was.  The--we had 114 women under the National Council of Negro Women over, over a period of months went into the, what we called the war zone, Philadel--of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And then it was a war zone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some people got hurt there, and there was a lot of fear, but there was a lot of courage in(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, and I think that for many it was hard to fathom why you needed so many different kinds of activities.  But as the schools moved along, and people saw the results, I think they realized--we were, my colleague, Polly Cowan, who was white, and I were in a car going towards the church in Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  And suddenly, we heard a car behind us, and we looked, and it was following us.  When we got to the church and went in, within three or four minutes, a bomb went off.  So it was really a Molotov cocktail.  And everybody was real, very--for the moment jittery, but a student from Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] who was in the whole freedom school, rushed to the organ and played the Hallelujah Chorus, and everybody relaxed and joined.  And it was that kind of sense that you had of young people who have enough imagination, enough equipment and spiritual capacity to do a thing like that.  It made everybody feel, at least comfortable and at least felt that we among friends, and we had not been hurt, and they were grateful.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any stories from the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: I think one of the things that the National Council of Negro Women did do in that period, was that we developed a home ownership program, and--for the poor, where the income could not be over five thousand a year.  And that home, the homeowners' program had a home buyers' association which helped people to learn the economics of, of housing, how to, you know, how to keep it going and how to keep their property up and how to use it.  And that's proved a very real contributions.  This is also the model for the use of Turnkey III in the Indian reservations.  We're very proud of that.
Story_ID: 18172
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were doing, ma'am, when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: When Dr. King was assassinated, I was directing a YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] training session in Aurora, Illinois.  And when someone brought the first message, we didn't quite get it, but by the time we got the message, everybody was not only stunned, but even someone said, let us offer a prayer to see what's better.  Lee White, who worked at the White House found me and caused--gave me the message that President [Lyndon B.] Johnson wanted us to, to come directly to the White House.  And we did that.  And I went--(phone ringing).
Speaker 1: We should probably pause a second.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Um?
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So I went straight to the White House, and the president, of course, like all of us, was stunned.  We tried to see what we could do to try to get out some message, but, of course, as the news traveled, cities began to burn, and there was eruption--cities, more than 400 cities were burned.  And there was little we could do, but I think it proved to be a movement in the coun--in the nation when the strong forces for good realized how strong were the forces of reaction.  And so I think it made everyone redouble their efforts and work all that we could to end the violence and to protect our communities.
Story_ID: 18173
Speaker 1: Can you kind of summarize some of the highlights of the, of your career and of the National Council for Negro Women [NCNW], since that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I would say that during this period that I have been a part of the Civil Rights Movement, I was a part of the strategy group, part of the--I represented the concerns of women in that group.  And then I've been a part of helping with the women's movement to move that forward.  And in the mid--in the course of all of this, the National Council of Negro Women has had to be a source, not only for information, but for helping to see what the issues are and to clarify them, to develop our leadership so that we can respond to them effectively and really to help us learn how to get our story told in a fashion that it would be understood.  And it's an eternal struggle because, even now, we have young people who have gone through the open doors, they don't know how they got opened.  And I think that what we need to do is to see how we can do a better job at getting our history told, of helping them to understand what the struggle has been and helping them to understand that they're not called upon to do the same thing because the strategies, the techniques of the past may have been useful in the past, but that they need to look to see where we are today and how they use the new gifts that we have, the new technology that we have.  So many parts of new technology, I don't even know the names of, but whatever they are, for us to help to move things forward.  Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune said, the freedom gates are half ajar; we have to free them; we have to pry them fully open.  And that's what we're trying to do, open wide those freedom gates.  It's a big task.
Story_ID: 18174
Speaker 1: Ma'am, at this juncture in your life, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think that one of the things that is material, that I could say, is that I think that I have, am proud that I had a hand with the National Council of Negro Women [NCNW] in putting Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune in Lincoln Park [Washington, D.C.] , in developing the Bethune Museum and Archives [Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site, Washington, D.C.] as the only source of, of--devoted in the archives to black women's history, and to helping the National Council of Negro Women achieve a goal of a strong presence by having the ownership of a building on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Congress.  And I feel that if I were to look at the other part of my legacy, it would be that I have, I think I have shown that one--that you have to stand by, stick by, pursue your course.  I cannot name any one achievement.  I would say the greatest one, I would feel is, that I started out early on a course, and I've tried to follow it.  And I've been working on the same thing all of my life, and that I've been a part of and had the opportunity to work with so many strong people who have helped me, who have mentored, who've been there to help.  And, of course, so many that you had to work against because they did not see or share the vision.  But I'm grateful for all those I've worked with who have shared the vision and the fact that I have in place some things that we can build on for the future.
Speaker 1: Now, you said a moment ago that young people can't do exactly the same thing that you did, but there're some things that they can do.  I mean what--don't they kind of lie in the same areas though, of--?
Speaker 2: They're not only in the same area.  We have achieved the Voting Rights Act, but unless we vote, we don't have the benefit of it.  We have to help more of our young people understand what the struggle has been, not in a romantic sense of knowing this person or knowing that person, but in a sense of knowing that Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the whole Civil Rights Movement was not about a dream, but about changing a system to bring about social justice, equality to make all of those things real; that we have to redouble every effort to see to it that, now that we have the law, that there is the enforcement.  Now, that we have desegregated an unconstitutionally declared separate but equal schools, we have to redouble efforts to improve education.  We have to work at that.  In other words, as I see it, the struggle goes on.  It began way back in, after slavery--in slavery, really, and it has to continue, but the important thing now is for us to see that because the covert--the overt signs of colored and white are and all those are gone, that racism has not gone.  It's deeply imbedded and that we have to see it in terms, not only of personal bigotry, personal prejudice, but something that is institutionalized, and we have to be willing to look at the systems under which we live.  And we have to be, be ready now to press every level of government to gain and more and more support till we make freedom and justice and equality a reality.
Speaker 1: And one last question, ma'am, and this slightly different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as one who earnestly tried to live her faith, to put it into action, who tried to identify with the basic needs of people, and tried to be of service and to try to do that which will advance not just one, but others.  And I think that I would like to be remembered as one who tried through organizations to harn--help harness the collective power of women, to be concerned not just about each one individually, but for all.
