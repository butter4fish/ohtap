 Gill. Today is December 15, 2008. I   m visiting with  Dr. Tom Thedford in his home northwest of Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Tom, you had a long and distinguished  career on the faculty of Oklahoma State University   s College of  Veterinary Medicine. But I   d like to back up, if that   s okay with you a  little bit and talk about your early life. Could you share some  information about where you grew up, your family, things that  influenced your life early on?  I was born in Smith County, Tyler, Texas. That   s eastern Texas, east of  Dallas. We lived on a small farm that my great grandfather originally  bought and then my family lived there. I lived in Tyler until I was 14  years old on this small cattle farm. We had cattle, sheep, pigs, and just  some farming. My dad always worked off the farm as well as  on  the  farm. So I   ve been around livestock since I was just   I guess ever since  I was born. And we had that farm until my mother went into an assisted  living facility back in   I don   t know, five or six years ago, we sold the  place. We moved from there to out on the High Plains to Crosbyton,  Texas. I was in school there one year; the next year we rented a farm  over north of Lorenzo, Texas. This is near the Lubbock area and I  finished high school at Idalou, which is just east of Lubbock. From  there, went off to college, Texas A M; six years there, got a bachelor   s  degree in animal science and a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine degree  from A M in 1959.  Backing up to your earlier life again, two things come to my mind. It  must have been quite a change from east Texas out to the High Plains in  west Texas. What was the story about the move that far?  The reason for the move   yeah that was a big change from the east to  flat nothing almost for miles and miles. Daddy was somewhat of an  6  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  entrepreneur and one of the things he saw happening was mechanization  of cotton farming. And when John Deere came out with a cotton  harvesting machine, a stripper, cotton stripper, he was one of the first  owners of one. The year before we moved, he went out there and  harvested cotton. With a machine and two men you could harvest it as  high as 20 or 25 bales of cotton in a day, whereas it would take five or  six people two or three days to harvest one bale. So that was the reason  we got into that business, and the next year we moved out there. He  wanted to farm in that area, and he did for a number of years. I helped  him with the farming and we farmed for three or four years, I guess, out  there.  This special influence on you growing up, your parents, what were some  values that you learned that you took with you the rest of your life?  I think probably   we had a big family. I had four sisters. I was the  oldest and the only son. So probably one of the biggest things that I had  impressed on me very early is that I had to look after my little sisters, so  the responsibility of doing that and the responsibility of farming. While  we were in east Texas when I was nine years old, Daddy was drafted  into the military in World War II. At that point of time we had about 500  head of hogs on feed and about 50-60 heads of cattle. We had to sell the  hogs because there wasn   t any way a nine year old could take care of  them. But I could take care of the cattle while he was gone. He was in  the Navy and he had so many dependents, it was five children at that  time. As soon as the war was over, this was in 1944 I guess when he  went in, as soon as the war was over, he was one of the first ones to get  discharged and sent on back home. So I guess I learned hard work and  responsibility at an early age primarily because of having to take care of  this stuff. Started milking cows when I was, I don   t know, four or five  years old. It was my responsibility to see them milked every day.  You had to grow up fast.  Yeah, for a while.  While your father was gone. Wow, mercy. Thank you. So you did your  undergrad studies at College Station at Texas A M?  Yeah.  What do you remember about your undergraduate experience there?  I   m sure you were in the Corps  of Cadets  right?  Yeah, first two years mandatory Corps. It was one of the best  experiences I ever had in my life. It was tough. Do some more fast  7  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  growing up. But I was just 17 when I went down there. I was just a little  bitty guy. Weighed about 130 pounds I think. The first semester, I grew  about 3 inches and put on about 25 pounds. It was a good experience.  But the Corps, I   ve thought many times I think that probably was the  thing that really developed my ability to study and my ability to learn. I  didn   t get very many challenges in high school. High school was very  easy. I was just in high school three years. I skipped my junior year in  high school because I had enough credits to graduate with one   lacking  one. That was English. So I took it as correspondence. I never was really  challenged in high school. I got down there, and believe me, I got  challenged in a hurry.  About learning and time management both, wasn   t it?  You know I   d never had a science course except just general science in  high school, and I was going into veterinary medicine and chemistry. I  had to buckle down and get with it in a hurry. That was the good thing  about the Corps. You were required to  attend  what they called Four  Point Call to Quarter, CQ. Every night at seven o   clock you sit at your  desk with, I had not four points, six points. You had four chair legs and  your two feet on the floor and you had to have a book open in front of  you and you sat there from seven to ten and you couldn   t even get up  unless you had permission to. At 10, you had thirty minutes to go take a  shower and get ready for bed, and be in bed by 10 o   clock. The next  morning you were up at 6:30 and get on with the rest of the day. But if  you   re sitting there, you might as well be studying.  (Laughter) That   s right.  No radio, no television of course, we didn   t even have television. And  had to be quiet. You couldn   t even talk to your roommate. You had to sit  there and it was study time. It taught me to study.  Well Tom, did you know when you went to A M that you wanted to be a  vet? And if so, where did that come from?  Well, yes I did. That was one of the  things  I guess I always enjoyed.  My mother used to love telling stories. I don   t know if they were true or  not. But she said I used to shoot birds with BB guns and then try to treat  them and make them well. But that   s her story. I don   t know if it   s true  or not. (Laughter) But I always enjoyed working with livestock. And we  always had cats and dogs around the place, and it was usually my  responsibility to help take care of some of that stuff.  Then, when we lived at Crosbyton after we moved to west Texas, one of  the people there who was very influential in my development was Dr.  8  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Bill Romaine who was the local veterinarian. I would sometimes make  some calls with him and he   d come out to our place to look at our cows  or our horses or whatever. When I got into school, when I started out in  school I was lucky enough to get a scholarship, the Sears Roebuck  Scholarship for entering freshman in agriculture. So I enrolled in  agriculture and the pre-vet curriculum and the animal science curriculum  were almost lock step. Actually, it was animal husbandry at that time, I  guess what they called it. So I had that for one year, that scholarship. I  did my veterinary work that way. Then I got the animal science degree  by doing additional work with my veterinary curriculum. Both degrees  have been very useful.  Did you go two years in your pre-vet program at that time?  Two years pre-vet, four years vet school. Yes, I was lucky to get in after  two years.  Could you share a little bit about your professional career before you  came to Oklahoma State University? So you graduated from vet school  at A M in what year?  1959. And I immediately went to work as a private veterinarian for a  quarter horse ranch in Waco. I worked there about six months and that  was not what I thought it was going to be. We had a little disagreement  and I decided the best thing for me to do was move on as a professional  thing. They asked me to do some things that I didn   t think were honest. I  couldn   t do them legally and I had responsibilities to the state of Texas  and my colleagues so I decided that wasn   t the place for me. So I left  there and I went into practice in Floydada, Texas. This was a general  practice. Garden snakes to  circus  elephants, whatever came across the  board. And probably about 60  of my work was food animals, cattle  and sheep and a few goats. A little bit of horse work. And 30-40   maybe were dogs and cats. I was there for almost six years.  So how did you hear about the opening at Oklahoma State University?  You came here in    65, is that right?     65.  So how did you find out about the job? Could you tell us a little bit about  the recruiting process?  Well what happened, I had one daughter at that point and my wife was  expecting her second child. I came home one day from work and it  dawned on me that even though my clinic was next door to my house,  that I had not seen my four year old daughter awake in over two weeks. I  9  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  left before she got up. If I came in during the day, she was usually taking  a nap. And then I didn   t get through work until she   d gone to bed. I  thought to myself, there has got to be a better way of making a living  than this. So I decided to seek employment somewhere else, something  different. I had two or three options. One option  was  I filled out the  papers for commission in the Air Force, which was the second time I   d  done that. The first time when I was working for this ranch I got offered  that job and didn   t go. I didn   t mail the lease papers for a few days. I   also  mailed out some papers to look at government employment, and I  wrote Texas A M, Kansas State University, University of Missouri, and  Oklahoma State University inquiring about jobs. Oklahoma State was  the only one that had a job opening at that time. They agreed to  interview me if I would come up, and I did. The job was in the small  animal clinic as a small animal clinician. I decided that would be okay.  So I sold my clinic, loaded up my   this was, I had both daughters at that  time (in the interim the second one had been born). Loaded up the kids  and my wife and we moved to Stillwater.  Who was dean at that time? Holm was it?  Holm, yeah. Glen Holm. The guy that hired me was Gene Jones who  was a small animal clinician there. And  J.  Wiley Wolfe was the  department head. An interesting combination of people.  I was going to ask you, as I understand your career took you  to  more  large animal and food animal practice. So your first teaching  assignment though was small animal?  Well, I came here in December, and I guess it was in June of    66, Dr.  Lewis Moe, who was one of the original faculty members here in the  college and was an ambulatory clinician before the farm services  clinician made calls out in the country and treated animals out there, Dr.  Moe retired. Dr. Wolfe called me one day and asked me would I be  interested in taking that job, and that was more to my liking than small  animal. I enjoyed working with small animal but I liked being inside. So  I took that job in September then moved into large animal.  Well, actually, that   s not totally true. That summer, Dr.  Eugene M.   Jones, who was a small animal man, broke his foot. He couldn   t work.  Dr.  Stanley C.  Acree was the other small animal clinician left and took  a job practicing in Midwest City. So I was the only small animal  clinician left. Simultaneously, with the Guatemala contract that was  going on with the USAID Dr.  Eric I.  Williams and Dr.  Lester   Johnson were both sent down to Guatemala. The other two people who  were in the clinic had gone to other jobs. So in the mornings, I ran the  small animal clinic. A new graduate, Dr. Taylor was his name, did some  10  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  of the large animal work and I did the ambulatory  (farm services) work   in the afternoons. So it was two of us that ran the clinic for the summer.  You might not have had much time to see your daughters that summer  either.  But then in September   we had full staff at that point   things leveled  out.  Well Tom, can you recall a little bit about what the facilities and  equipment were like when you got there in    65?  Well, they were better than I had practiced with but they were still pretty  crude in many respects. We had pretty good working chutes for  livestock. We had one big old surgery table and we had the infamous  wrestling mat that we used most of the time.  Tell me a little bit about that. We were sharing early how Dr. Lester   Johnson  had visited a little bit about that. It had the large operating  table, and as I understood it, it didn   t tilt, you couldn   t move it up or  down so it was difficult getting large animals on it.  Well, it would tilt over, but you couldn   t do anything, it just went flat.  But anyway, you had to strap the animals to it before you laid it down.  They didn   t like that too much.  And it wasn   t hydraulics, it was all manual.  It was hydraulic but it was a slow moving thing. You had to get them  tied before so they couldn   t jump off of it and you could anesthetize  them standing. So many times it was just much simpler just to  anesthetize them, let them collapse onto the wrestling mat, which was, I  don   t know, three inches thick or so. I mean it was thick. And they could  lay on it and it wouldn   t put pressure on their nerves, it didn   t cause  paralysis to them, and it was so much easier on our knees.  Let me see if I got this picture, Tom. You   ve got, let   s say a large cow.  So now this is a wrestling mat, I mean literally, that you probably  cleaned up, sterilized and laid them on the mat.  Yes.  And you   re down on your hands and knees operating on this cow. What  were some trials and tribulations of that kind of surgery?  Well, it wasn   t too bad. It   d been better if you could stand up. It was  11  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  hard on your back after a while. Your knees got kind of tired. But you  learned to be pretty efficient and try to get through it a little faster. But  there was always the job of   as soon as you got them up and got them  back on their feet and moved off, then you had to clean the mat right  quick before the gore got dry and you had trouble getting it clean. But it  worked. It was a pretty good system.  (Laughter) I   ve heard the expression going to the mat, but never thought  of it in terms of operating on an animal  That   s a great story. Who were  some of the key faculty? You mentioned some names early when you  came there. And then could you follow it up with what you remember  about some of those early faculty members?  Well, the department head was Dr. Wiley Wolfe. Dr. Wolfe was an Iowa  native but did his veterinary work at Texas A M. He was one of the  most unique individuals that I ever knew. He was department head and  the man was everywhere. He always knew what was going on. You   d  see him sitting in his office and you   d think if somebody walked in,  you   d think this guy probably doesn   t ever get out of this office. But he  knew exactly what was going on everywhere all of the time. He was  really a unique guy. Very nice guy. Very fair and upfront. He believed in  teaching. And he wanted you to do your teaching and take care of the  students. He told me, when I came up here, he said,    Go to the meetings,  learn new materials, teach the students, do your job, and I   ll take care of  you.    And that   s what I did. He was a good man.  Some of the others were Dr. Newton Tennille, our radiologist. And we  always laughed at Newton and we   d tease him about being an old bear  because he was back in kind of a dark place. And he   d come out of his  cave growling you know. (Laughter) But he was a neat guy. He took  care of the radiology stuff. Lester Johnson was our large animal clinic  head and an absolute gentleman. One of the most gentle and nice and  professional people I   ve ever known in my life. Had a long and very  deep friendship that continues to this day. He   s a fantastic veterinarian  and just a gentleman, too. Another one was Dr. Eric Williams. He was  an immigrant from Wales and he was always everywhere doing  everything. And another   I had some exceptionally good veterinarians  that I was able to work with and learn from in the process of coming  here as a fairly young, not very young   well I guess I was 29 when I  came here. I got a lot of good experience. Learned a lot from these guys.  They were good people.  What about personalities? There had to be some characters on the  faculty. Is there one or two you can recall? Stories you have there?  Newton Tennille was certainly a character. He was a good one. Let   s see  12  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  who else. We had a lot of people come in and go out. I   ve always said  that it   s amazing the number of very famous people that have come  through Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  They come here and we give them some training and then they move on  somewhere else. And I can   t think, we   ve had     Are there some that stood out in your mind?  I can   t think off the top of my head.  Well Tom, back to your specialty, your specialty being sort of large  animal, but also you were department head I think one time, of surgery  and medicine, is that right?  Well, no, actually I was   well let me give you a little run through there.  I was ambulatory clinician for nine years.  And that   s what you said earlier.  Go out and take care of the farm calls. Usually, herd medicine.  Occasionally, we do some individual animals, but a lot of herd work.  And then in 1974, I had the opportunity to join Colorado State with the  USAID program in Kenya in Nairobi at the College of Veterinary  Medicine at the University of Nairobi. I was actually on loan from OSU.  So I never actually left the protection or hospice of Oklahoma State. I  was just on loan to Colorado. They paid OSU, OSU paid me. I was there  for two years, and then I came back.  Can you tell us about what you did there? Some of your experiences in  Nairobi? It sounds pretty fascinating.  It was very fascinating. Again, when I got there I taught infectious  diseases like I had right here in Stillwater. I was head of the ambulatory  clinic and that was the primary way that we saw livestock was go to the  farms, because many of these people, nobody had transportation. Again,  we were working primarily with food animals.  So what would it have been, some domestic animals you worked with  there in addition with what we think of     That   s all I worked with were domestic animals.  So just cattle primarily?  Cattle, hogs, sheep, goats. Did a little bit of horse work. Most of the  horses were owned by Europeans. The Africans primarily had donkeys. I  13  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  worked with the Africans. As an ambulatory clinician I had   we had  vehicles, used old land rovers. I had a driver, guide, interpreter; he  served in all three purposes. Very nice guy named Gitau Kihara. And  Gitau was my   he was my right hand as well as my teacher in many  cases. I   ll tell you a funny story about that. But we would go out to the  villages and treat the animals. Many many times these villagers would  walk in to tell us they had a sick animal. They didn   t have transportation  for themselves even. It may take them all day to walk in there and we   d  go out the next day to see the sick animal, but we   d go out and treat  cattle and we had some pig farms that were primarily owned by  Europeans, for the most part. But all of the villagers had cows and sheep  and goats. Cows are probably what I spent the most on.  I had in my mind that you might be taking care of some more exotic  animals.  The only exotic thing that I touched, other than  some animals    I did a  lot of hunting while I was over there and game watching and that kind of  stuff, but the only exotic animal that I treated was  when  the game  department brought a warthog up one day and they wanted to know if  anybody knew how to get a blood sample from this warthog. Well, I had  bled hogs all of my life, all of my professional career. I said sure, I   ll do  that. So I went out and I drew a blood sample from this warthog and  they were all impressed with that. I said it was the only time I touched  one of those animals in a medical sense in the two years that I was there.  But mostly it was teaching students.  You have a story about your interpreter and driver?  When I first got there, like most graduates from most veterinary schools,  when you   re going through your curriculum and they start telling you  about these exotic diseases that we don   t have in this country, you kind  of turn it off. You don   t listen real good. And I got over there and we  went out on this call. We had this cow and oh she was sick, she was so  sick. I didn   t have a clue what was the matter with her. And good ol     Gitau, he was helping me along. He went around and he pulled her  tongue out of her mouth and he turned it over. He said,    Dr. Thedford,  are these little blood spots, little petechiae on the bottom of this tongue?     And I said,    Yes Gitau, those sure are.    And he walked around and he  pushed a big enlarged lymph node in front of her shoulder up and he  said,    Do you think   is this lymph node possibly enlarged?    And I said,     Why yes Gitau, it sure is.    All this time, we had four or five students  standing around watching us and talking to us. And we did two or three  other things like that with him giving me the clues. Finally he said,    Do  you suppose this could be East Coast Fever?    And I said,    Gitau I   m  sure it is.    So I made my first diagnosis of East Coast Fever right there  14  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  with the able assistance of Gitau Kihara. (Laughs)  You were talking about your career and how it evolved. So you had your  experience in Kenya and then from there?  Back to Oklahoma State. At that time I was back on ambulatory. I had  the ambulatory clinic from 8 o   clock in the morning to five o   clock in  the afternoon. At that particular point in time I was also put on 50   extension. So I was extension veterinarian for the State of Oklahoma  from 5:00 in the afternoon to 8 o   clock in the morning. Those people  liked to work me to death. After a year of that, Bill Taggart was head of  the extension department and Bill Brock was our dean at that time. I met  with both of them and I told them,    Gentlemen, I don   t care what you  do. But get me out of this mess. You can make me all extension or you  can make me all clinic or 90  one or the other. But get off of this 50/50  thing. It   s about to kill me.    So they got together and they agreed. And  after a year, then I became the extension veterinarian. I was 90   extension, 10  clinic.  For the state of Oklahoma?  For the state of Oklahoma.  Special contract and probably different sources of funds and everything.  Oh yeah, this was federal funds. For a whole lot of it. That was when I  started into the extension program. All 77 counties. I   d go out and give  programs for the farmers and work with veterinarians on special cases  and that kind of stuff.  In other words how was that different from a practicing or teaching  veterinarian? You   re in different kinds of activities and services. Could  you share a little bit more? You said you went out and visited with  practitioners?  It was still teaching. But it was mostly teaching farmers how to utilize  veterinary services and my primary goal was to teach these guys to  recognize disease in their animals early enough and get intervention by a  veterinarian to get some results. The last thing you want to do is to  bring in one that   s going to die in 24 hours and ask the vet to try and  save it, because it   s not going to work. But if you can look this thing     and the other thing that was going on in that particular time, we were in  the throes of Brucellosis eradication   Bang   s disease. I worked with  Winrock International, over in Arkansas, and I worked with the  foundation down at Poteau.  15  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Kerr Foundation?  Yes, with the Kerr Foundation. We put together, and I was the  spokesman, a videotape we used to tell farmers about Brucellosis and  the costs and what it can do, and what we can do, and how the program  ran. This was a national program. That videotape was used all across the  South. In all the states that were having problems with Brucellosis at that  time, as an educational thing. That actually led up to a job that I took  later with Winrock International.  Took a leave of absence for a year, is that right?  Took a leave of absence for a year and went over and worked for them  and did a bunch of educational programs for them and put together, I  wrote two books.  Well, as I recall, were you in Haiti as part of the responsibilities?  Yes, early I was in Haiti. I was down in Haiti for a while with that. We  sent a bunch of goats down there, and I went over to meet the goats and  get them off the plane and get them out to the little town of Hinche,  which is way out in the center of the country. It was interesting. We  brought these goats in. They were just a pretty good kind of dairy goats,  you know. We had people walk in 50 miles to see these big goats. They  couldn   t believe how big they were, because any goat  that  got big  enough   the bigger the goat, the quicker it got eaten. They slaughtered  it. So it was kind of a natural reverse selection process, and they were  selecting for smaller goats all the time. Some of them weren   t over 18-  20 inches tall.  Oh, my gosh.  But they were goats. So that was an interesting thing. That was kind of  an off shoot  that  came out of that. But I was an extension veterinarian  for 27 years.  Did you get them to wait long to grow larger goats?  We hoped that these   I don   t know. We left those goats down there. I  was just down there two or three weeks, and then I came back home. We  had a program there that they were trying to get people to get more     well we were looking at the standpoint of bigger goats have more meat  and the fact dairy goats are for milk. One of the very unusual things  about the Haitian people at that particular time (I don   t know if it   s still  the case or not) but they believed that if you fed goat   s milk to boy  babies, that they would not develop their manhood properly. They would  16  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  some way or other be influenced so they wouldn   t give their boy  children goats    milk. But they would give the girl children goats    milk.  And the poor little things, they all needed some kind of nutrition. It was  one of the projects that they were trying to get these people to do. It was  interesting these weird ideas that people get.  How many years did you say that you were in extension?  I was in about 22 years.  Twenty-two years. Now were you 90  during that time?  The whole time.  The whole time. So a lot of your career then was spent in extension.  Actually I was an extension veterinarian. Did all these programs, worked  around the state going out to visit with farmers, this that or the other.  And usually it was my programs where we   d get together working with  the county extension agents. Then in    88, I was asked to interview for a  job with Kansas State University. I was accepted as the person to go up  there and went to Botswana in southern Africa for two years. That was  another one of those deals that   s like the other one. I was on loan from  Oklahoma State to Kansas State. There I was doing primarily research in  goat disease, goat problems.  Where was this again?  Botswana.  Botswana, just north of South Africa?  Just north of South Africa. Used to be Bechuanaland back in the days  when I went to school. And it   s a high dry plateau. It   s part of the desert,  the huge desert, the Kalahari Desert. It was very, very dry. They raise a  lot of cattle, but goats are the primary meat and milk source for the  people and I was working with them.  And you were you there for two years?  A little over two years actually. About two years and three or four  months.  You   ve had some pretty incredible experiences. A lot of different places.  From there, did you get back into teaching, research then later in your  career, out of extension?  17  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  When I came back, Dr. Joe Alexander was the dean then. While I was  over there, he wrote and asked if I would come back and be the Assistant  Dean of Outreach. So in that respect, I had charge of my own extension,  and I was doing a lot of extension work myself. But over the whole  extension program, continuing education, alumni affairs (where I met  you), also some development. Worked with development with John  Kathy. And I was that until I retired. Now one thing, I   ll back up, in that  interim between the time I left, got back from Winrock International and  went to Botswana, one of the things that we did here was develop a  satellite mediated educational program for veterinarians. And we did, I  think, three or four or five of those and we broadcast those all over the  United States. They were really really successful. And as a matter of  fact, one of my colleagues, Dr. Louie Stratton, who is retired now, lives  over in Cookston, he told me the other day, and I hadn   t realized this,  didn   t know it but he wrote a letter to the American Association of  Extension Veterinarians telling them what I had done in this education  thing and they were aware of it too, recommending me for an honor, and  I was given the Extension Veterinarian of the Year Award in    89.  National?  National.  National Extension Veterinarian of the Year. Wow, that   s a pretty high  honor   It was very nice.  And what year was this?  I was in Africa during that time. My secretary went down to San  Antonio to the American Veterinary Association meeting and accepted  the award in my behalf. But we did some good things, did some neat  stuff on that.  So with teleconferencing, there would be several hundred participants  and they   d be nationwide?  Nationwide, yes. We had the videotape that people could check out and  look at; usually most of them were about four hours long. I mean, we   d  do two two-hour sessions.  Would most of the people be practitioners?  Practitioners in this case.  18  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  You were active throughout your career with practitioners and alumni  relations and that   s where you and I first met. Can you tell me about  some of your activities on campus and off campus in addition to what  you talked about in terms of working with practitioners? What were  some of the things you did? Did you consult? Did you put on some  conferences?  Yeah.  Did you go out and speak? What were some of the activities surrounding  that?  Well, one of the things we did was   back years ago, we used to have  what we called our annual OSU conference and then there was a period  of time when we didn   t have it. I don   t remember what the reason was  for doing it. It was a need to do it and I started that thing back up again.  We had our fall conference of veterinarians, Oklahoma State Fall  Conference of Veterinarians that still goes on today. We reinstituted that  and what we would do is we would bring nationally known speakers into  the state so our practitioners didn   t have to go out of state to learn from  them. It was usually a two day conference. It   s still a two to three day  conference. It grew tremendously. We went from 150 people to we get  400-500 now I think. It   s really great. That was one of the things.  I continued with the farm programs that we   d go out to the counties and  give to the farmers. One other thing we did was I developed a  teleconferencing type thing and we used telephones. I would put  together sets of slides with a narrative and I could mail these slides out  to several county extension people. Then, we   d get a conference call set  up and I would sit in my office here in Stillwater and lecture to three or  four counties simultaneously over this conference call. Then we could  take questions from each of these county extension directors back in and  then I could answer them.  And they   d be viewing the same set of slides that you were looking at  there in Stillwater?  I was looking at a set of slides and they were looking at the same set.  That   s great. Tom, in your mind, you represent the College of Veterinary  Medicine in your relationships with alumni and then even served as  representative of the College of Veterinary Medicine on the Oklahoma  State University Alumni Association. Can you share with us a little bit  about how important good relationships are with the alumni and  perhaps what you think are the important roles alumni can play?  19  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  That was very stimulating and very frustrating sometimes to try to keep  these alumni relations going. I think one of the important things to do is  to recognize   to try to get to our alumni, the fact that so many of  them   we   ve got people from our college that have gone out and done  national and international things. I mean these people are well trained  and they do great and glorious things. A lot of times, I think our local  people go back to the country or the city that they came from and they  are not as exposed as much to these other folks. They tend to have a  little less   kind of an inferiority complex I guess. I think we need to  build that strength and that knowledge that,    Hey, Oklahoma State did a  good job for you and you did a good job for them. And between the two  of you, you learned a lot and they benefitted from having you there.     Anytime we can build this kind of a thing, and that is what I tried to do.  I   d go out and talk to these alumni groups.  At the fall conference, we always had an alumni meeting. We   d have  reunions of the classes come in and we   d have every five years however  many there   d been out we   d have their reunions if they wanted to have  them. In my office, we   d put the reunions together and do that. It was  very important to do that and I think it helped some.  As I recall, you also had a distinguished alumni award as part of your  reunions or your annual meetings?  Yes, we started having our distinguished alumni awards. Usually, it was  one of the older classes that we would get the nominations from and we  would honor those people. And that   s still going on today, too.  When I got to visit with Dr. Joe Alexander, former dean of the college,  he talked about the importance of relationships in two or three powerful  ways. You might speak to one. Of course, they   d help with fundraising.  He said often they would connect you with someone else. A corporation,  another individual, an owner that didn   t have a relationship or degree  with Oklahoma State University, it   s important in creating and them  helping to network after creating relationships, helping fundraising and  then bringing business to the college. Is that your perception as well?  Yes, that was one of the more important things I think this alumni  relations did. One example is one of our early graduates knew this  gentleman, Mr. Siddington. And this guy was a farmer, he had a little  dairy farm, and they   d brought him here, showed him the college,  showed him what we could do and the vet school and the animal science  department. This guy was impressed with that. And when he passed  away he left something like  2.5- 3 million, maybe  4  million , I don   t  know; it was a bunch of money. Half of it went to the College of  Agriculture and half of it to the College of Veterinary Medicine. And  20  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  this guy never, I don   t even know if he graduated from high school.  Mr. Siddington?  Yeah. And we   ve got two chairs that this funded in addition to some  scholarships I think. But that   s where   and this has been repeated  innumerable times   many times since I retired that we had someone that  a veterinarian knew that wanted to do something charitable. They come  to the vet and say,    Can you suggest something?    And when they  suggest Oklahoma State University, well that   s   .  Makes a difference.  That   s a good deal.  That   s  what happened.  You   ve had a very varied life of teaching to extension to research. What  in these areas of your professional career, what has given you the most  personal satisfaction?  Oh, that   s easy. Teaching.  Teaching?  Yeah, I love to teach. I enjoy the students, I enjoy teaching them. That   s  been my biggest thing. I was lucky enough to one year win the Norden  Award for teaching.  Outstanding teaching award? The Norden Award?  Yeah.  Do you remember what year that was?  Oh, I can   t remember. It was back there a ways. That was a great thing.  It was a fine thing. I really enjoyed that. I still teach. I have one little  course, just a two hour course that I teach, a small ruminant medicine  and surgery. I teach Sheep, Goats and Llamas. And I do that spring of  each year. It   s an elective. This coming year I   ve got 53 or 54 students  signed up for it, which I think is pretty good.  Llamas is a hobby of yours, right?  Yes.  You own how many llamas now?  21  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Nineteen now.  And how many years have you been in a llama business?  Oh, since    84.  You   re probably an expert in llamas then.  (Laughter) Oh, I   ve messed with them a long time.  And you   ve got some goats as well?  I got some goats this year.  Looking out the window.  I got some goats this year to eat some brush up around here. I like goats.  I used to raise sheep at one time, I raised registered sheep. So this small  unit thing I   ve been involved in for a number years.  Well, maybe back 30,000 feet to get kind of a larger view. How   s the  college in your mind changed over the years, you know in the 40 to  nearly 50 years you   ve been     Well, when I came here we had a maximum of 48 students. I think it was  seven states that we took students from, contract states. So we didn   t  have very many Okies come in. We   d have one maybe two girls per  class. Probably 60 -70  of students were going into food animals or  large animals, horses or cattle, this type of thing. Today, we have at least  I think it   s got to be 80   required  by state statue Oklahoma graduates  or Oklahoma residents, which is good. About 70  female. About 10   maybe at best are going into food animals or large animals and food  animals. It   s been almost a complete reversal. I don   t know if I   m  qualified to say whether it   s better or worse. It   s certainly different.  Certainly a different situation. I think we have a real problem trying to  get more food animal people into that area now. And it   s going to take  some special efforts to do it. It   s harder work and it   s not quite as  rewarding as small animal. There   s so many more things that they can  do with dogs and cats. Practice a higher quality of medicine they refer  to. A lot of times   .  And it   s primarily  practiced  there in their facilities.  Yeah.  They   re not going out.  22  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Yeah. And they can do all kinds of lab tests and all kinds of diagnostic  imaging and that kind of thing. It just gets too expensive on larger  animals. That   s one of those things that I enjoy by teaching this course I  teach. I try to teach it from two standpoints. I teach it from the stand  point of production animal medicine or you   ve got a herd of goats or  sheep out here and you   re raising them for meat and fiber. You have to  pay attention to the price or the value these animals have in your  diagnostics and your workups. You also have pet goats and sheep, and  the fact that in many cases money is not an object there. They want their  animal saved. Whereas, if that was a production animal, we need to  sacrifice it so we can find out, so we can protect the rest of them. I try to  cover both of these angles and try to get them to understand that there is  a difference in that. In their responsibility, the veterinarians     responsibility to determine what you are going to do or what she   s going  to do or where you   re going or how are you going to handle these cases.  What kind of alternatives do you want to give your clients?  Sometimes you have to give them several alternatives. And some of  them may not be the best quality medicine under the circumstances.  What have been some significant milestones, significant achievements of  the college during your tenure?  Oh, probably the biggest and greatest leap forward is the new hospital.  And it goes back 25 years or so, but it just totally changed our whole  way of doing things. The library is many, many times bigger than it was.  Our facilities are so much better. Our staff numbers have increased. Our  research potential has increased. I personally sometimes feel that maybe  sometimes I don   t think we   re doing quite as good a job at teaching as  we used to. We   ve kind of shifted to the research thing a little more. And  that makes it a little difficult on some of these kids, I think. A good  teacher is hard to find. When we get one, you really need to hang on to  them. And if they   re a little backward in their research capability,  sometimes it   s worth ignoring that I think, just to keep that teacher.  You talked about changes at Oklahoma State University. In your mind,  how has the veterinary medicine profession changed over the years?  Well, we have a lot more veterinarians than we used to have. They do a  much more complete job. I mean my goodness, when you stop and think  about it, we do MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). We do CAT scans  now. We have all kinds of blood tests and things that, when I went  through school these were a dream. We could do an x-ray and blood  count and that   s about it.  23  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  So technology has been one of these changes?  Technology has advanced tremendously. Much of the technology  advancements that have occurred in veterinary medicine have been  precursors to advancements in human medicines. They came through the  veterinarian channels first and then they went into human medicine and  medicines. So there have been a lot of changes. Now they   re pushing  more towards the concept of one medicine. You know human, animal,  zoonotic problems, meaning that they occur in all species whether  human or animal. You know that   s a different attitude that   s come up in  the last few years. So there   s been a lot of changes in the profession, and  I think for the most part they   re good.  And I think as you indicated earlier probably the change into more  women.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely, and into veterinary medicine.  And this has had some good effects. I think at the risk of   I don   t want  to sound sexist at all. But I think that women have made this profession  more gentle. They have made it more caring in many cases. Us old guys,  we were probably crude, rude and probably socially unacceptable in  many cases. (Laughter) But I think there   s been some changes and I  think they   ve been good changes, for the most part. One of the kind of,  maybe not quite so positive things, is the profession has to some degree  advanced more to the second income profession rather than a primary  income profession because of so many women in there, some are  mothers and have kids you know. A lot of them are not full time     Work in the clinics with other doctors?  Right, maybe they   re part-time or their children come first, which they  should as far as I   m concerned, it   s the right thing to do. But it has  changed the dynamics I think a little bit. We   re adapting. We   ll take care  of that.  One thing we were talking about just a minute ago, some of the research  for a relatively small say under-resourced university like ours and the  College of Veterinary Medicine. Yet, we   ve produced some research that  has made millions and millions of dollars of difference in the industry.  Could you summarize or share some of those key research contributions  we have made in our college?  Yeah, one of the first ones was way back there. We were one of the first,  24  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  as a matter of fact, we had a patent on the only useable effective  anaplasmosis vaccine. Anaplasmosis was and still is a major source of  loss of lives in cattle and that vaccine was one of the first ones that came  out   the only one for many, many years.  Which professors were involved in research in that area, do you recall?  There was a guy named Cleaver who worked up in Pawhuska. Bill  Brock was involved in it. I don   t know who else. Following on that line  about blood parasites, which is what that is, Sydney Ewing has worked  with Ehrlichia, which is a parasite with primarily dogs and cats and he   s  done a lot of work in that. Kathy Kocan and her group there at the  college have done a lot of work with tick-borne diseases and blood  parasite tick-borne diseases. They   re just about to come out with a  vaccine in that area. It   s an advancement on the anaplasmosis thing. It   s  going to be a tremendous amount of value.  Some of your research, I know back several years ago, was in wild  animal diseases. Did you work with some of those areas?  I didn   t do any actual bench research. Most of the stuff that I   ve done is  practical applied-type thing. I   ve worked with drug approvals. When I  was overseas I was working with production problems and disease  problems. As far as from a practical aspect, I   ve not been involved in the  so-called bench research to any great degree. I have worked with a  number of researchers on other things like Al an  Kocan. Al was active  here in research, I worked with him. We were a pretty good team. He  was a good researcher and I had a good practical approach to it. Put the  two of us together, we made some good progress.  What about anaplasmosis? A lot of research was done in that area. But  also brucellosis, is that correct?  Brucellosis. The main thing I did with that, I didn   t   now we   ve had  some people do brucellosis research here and they   ve done a good job  on that. They   ve come up with some new vaccines there which have  been   again this is large animal type stuff. My involvement in that was  primarily from an education stand point, making the farmers aware of  the costs and the downside of this disease and what it would mean to  eradicate it and how they can benefit from it. That had to be done  regardless of how much knowledge we had on eradicating or preventing  the disease because if you didn   t have the support of the farmers, it  wasn   t going to happen. I spent probably six or eight years working on  that, and that had a lot of good things happen there.  Some other things that we   ve done as far as research, we   ve done some  25  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  reproductive disease research. There are several people who   ve worked  on that. It   s still currently from bovine respiratory disease, there has  been a world of research done on that. Tony  Anthony W.  Confer, Bob   Robert  Fulton, Bob Smith   s been involved in that. These are the ones I  pull off the top of my head, but there   s been a big effort in bovine  respiratory disease research. I worked with Bob Fulton on blue tongue  back some years ago. I   ve been kind of   where I fit into these research  things is kind of as a footman. I   ve worked with the farmers, going out  working with the livestock in the situation. They   re kind of the brains,  I   ve been the brawn I guess you could say. Like you said, there   s been a  tremendous amount of good for the livestock industry that   s come out of  this school in the form of good research. And that   s above and beyond  the fact that we   ve had some really good practitioners and clinicians.  Tom, was there some research that leant itself to human medicine and  HIV and AIDS. Did we do some work with the partnerships with the  University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center?  I think there was, but I don   t know much about it. There was some stuff  done there. And I know that there   s been some   I think there are some  things that have been done with the university in general as well as  health sciences through the lab animal facilities that we have here now.  Through all the years and all the different ways you   ve been associated  with Oklahoma State University, do you have some favorite memories of  your time at OSU?  Well, I guess I   d have to say that Oklahoma State has been good to me.  I   ve had some opportunities to do some things that had I just stayed in  practice, I never would have. I   ve so enjoyed the opportunities to travel  to Africa and they   ve supported me so much in the learning  opportunities. For example, back not long before I retired, I had the  opportunity to attend a meeting of the International Sheep Veterinary  Society in Armadale, Australia, and I got to go over there. Then while I  was gone, I went over and visited New Zealand. The opportunity to see  these other societies and how they operate, that   s been very helpful to  me in teaching small ruminant medicine and surgery because the  different aspects and the different ways they do things over there and  how it affects our situation in this country. So that was a good memory. I  sure enjoyed my African times. They were really good.  And I   ve had some really fun times with the students. They   re  challenging, they   re sharp, they   re smart, they keep you on your toes.  Sometimes they can almost swallow you, or sink your boat if they  wanted to. But they   re nice. And they won   t do it. I   ve really enjoyed the  teaching aspect.  26  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Are there some special students that stand out in your mind that you   ve  been teacher-mentor to that have gone on and been successful?  Yes.  Any names you want to throw out there?  Well I think the DuBois kids, you know Paul the original and then his  boys, they   ve been good and one of them, his wife. Bob Morris was a  good kid that I worked with a lot of years that I still have contact with. A  more recent one, there   s my neighbor kid that was kind of my boy. I had  two girls, and he was my neighbor kid, Mike Lunsford. He   s in practice  over in northwest Arkansas now. Mike is a really neat young man and  I   ve enjoyed him. I   ve had a number of them come out and work for me.  Suzanne Caruso was in small animal practitioner in Tulsa, she was one  of my helpers out here on the farm, took care of the llamas while I was  gone. Joanie Noelle helped her some. Oh gosh, there have been so  many  Most recent was Brant Carter and his wife, they   re in school now.  Just neat kids, you know. They   re just good. I really enjoy being with  them and working with them. Brant has been really interesting.  We were talking earlier about some recognitions, some highlights in  your career. We talked about the Norden Outstanding Teaching Award,  your National Veterinary Extension person of the Year. Other awards or  special recognitions you have?  Well, I got recognition from the Oklahoma Veterinary Medical  Association   a special award from them. When I retired the Veterinary  Alumni Association made a special recognition. And oh there have been  a number of things. I guess one thing that I did enjoy too was I had four,  two or three two-year terms, I was on the Secretary of Agriculture, U.S.  Secretary of Agriculture Advisory Board for Foreign Animal Diseases. I  got to go to meetings and meet in Washington, D.C. and that area and  visit with other professionals from around the country on that. That was  a nice thing. Another thing the university allowed me to do was back in  the    80s I was a chosen to attend the Plum Island foreign animal  diagnostician course. And it   s only been two or three veterinarians from  OSU who have had the opportunity to do that. They gave me the time  off and allowed me to go do that and that was really a highlight. That  was a wonderful thing.  I   m sure, Tom, over the years there have been some frustrations and  disappointments as well. Some of your frustrations?  I guess one of the things that I kind of wish I had the opportunity to do  but under the circumstances it just didn   t work out, I would have liked to  27  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  at some point in time have been able to go on and finish my graduate  work. I did some graduate work here at OSU. Almost got a master   s in  parasitology and then I got promoted and I couldn   t get the degree here.  I actually looked into going away to pursue a master   s or a Ph.D. and  every time I put my pencil to it, I couldn   t afford to do it. It was just one  of those things with a family and responsibilities here, I was better off to  stay right where I was. And there   s been times where I wish I   d been  able to go ahead and do that. The university or maybe it   s the state, I  don   t know, they had a policy that you couldn   t get your degree if you  were a tenured faculty member, you couldn   t get your degree here. I  think that   s a little shortsighted.  Does the college at this time today support faculty members in getting  advanced degrees?  Oh yeah, they encourage it as a matter of fact. Advanced degrees or  board certification. I was never board certified and I did not get an  advanced degree. And I don   t think you could go the way I   ve gone  without them now. I think that   s a given. It   s probably okay. I   m kind of  a dinosaur in that respect, but that   s all right.  Well, you alluded earlier to the fact that you   ve had other opportunities  to go other places. What   s kept you at OSU so long?  That   s a good question. I can answer that in several angles. One, I was  offered the job as extension veterinarian for the state of Nevada. There  were two things that kept me from going there. One, the cost of living  was a whole lot higher. I was going to get a nice raise in my salary but  when I looked at increased costs of living compared to here, I could sell  my house and the five acres I had at that time and that would bring  nearly enough to buy a two bedroom condo out there. It just wasn   t  feasible. Economically it was not   it would have been a step backwards  and I didn   t feel at my stage of life I could do that. I think I could have  gone to Alabama as their extension veterinarian, but I just liked  Oklahoma better. I was offered a position as a veterinarian with  USAID   U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington,  D.C. It was a two year appointment and I just didn   t think I wanted to  live in Washington, D.C. I thought it was a fantastic opportunity, but I  just liked Stillwater better. And then when I got ready to retire I had  people who asked me,    Where are you going to move?    And I said,     Man, I   ll never move from Stillwater.    (Laughs)  Well, so for a Texan, we made an Okie out of you.  You made an Okie out of me. And you know they may shoot me in  Texas because of that, but that   s okay, I like Oklahoma. One of the  28  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  things about Stillwater and OSU, you   ve got so much   you   ve got  Oklahoma City and Tulsa. You   ve got things in the arts, you   ve got  athletics   you know you   ve got all kinds of entertainment things you  can do. Good medical facilities and I   ve got a lot of good friends here.  Stillwater   s just home.  It   s a good place to live, isn   t it?  A good place to live. And I   m happy being here.  Again from your observation over many years, what advice would you  give to a current or future faculty member or administrator about how to  best advance the mission of the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine?  Well, I think there   s two things that could be involved here that you   ve  got to keep in mind. Number one, the primary reason we   re here is the  students. You   ve got to take care of those kids. Make sure that they get  the right kind of education, the right kind of attention and the right kind  of help. Any way you can help them with their tuition, I think that   s a  good deal. And that   s, I  don   t  know  if  you were aware or not, I  established a scholarship to help with that. I think that   s something that  has to be done.  I think you have to remember, to advance the school you   ve got to  remember the practitioners out there. They have an integral interest in it  and they   re part of what makes it operate and keep it going. Going back  to that thing about they know people that can help this school, I think  that   s very very important. I don   t think you can ever walk away from  your base of graduates, alumni practitioners in the state. And many of  the practitioners don   t have to be necessarily just OSU alumni. We get  them from everywhere and they   re all important. If we show we care,  show we   re interested, I think we can advance our college that way.  I   m not a very good person to get involved in politics, but there   s a lot of  people out there in our graduates that can. I know right now that we have  three representatives in the State House that are veterinarians. And our  relationship with them is certainly not going to hurt us and it   s important  to keep that in mind.  I think from an administrative stand point, I probably wasn   t a very good  administrator. But I think that there are some things that are important  there. I think a really good administrator surrounds him or herself with  capable people and then listens to them, which makes life a whole lot  easier for them if they do that. Give them their head; give them the reins  to turn loose at the reins. Let them do their thing. If they   re good and  they   re smart and they   re capable, they   re going to make you look really  29  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  good.  What areas do you think OSU College of Veterinary Medicine should  look to in the future to advance the college? If we had additional  resources, where we should put it?  Where they would go? I think one of the things that would be really  worthwhile and something I think could do the job, I think we   re unique  that we have such a broad agriculture base in this state and we have such  a big food animal base in this state. That   s one of the areas we ought to  be pushing. I realize it   s not the most lucrative. I realize it   s not the most  genteel. Large animal practice is hard, dirty work. But it   s important  work. You look at the fact that we   ve got literally millions and millions  and millions of acres of land in this world that are not capable of  producing crops, but they are capable of producing a high quality protein  with the livestock. And we need to keep them healthy and alive and  gaining. We   re going to have to depend on animals for production of our  food and fiber in the future. We need veterinarians to take care of that. I  think with Oklahoma   s broad base in that area, we can be a center here.  And that   s one place that I   d like to see us go. Whether that   s going to  happen or not, I just don   t know. I think it would be a good place to go.  Tom, it   s hard to think in these terms, but what   s been your legacy you  think over the years?  (Laughs) I don   t know. I just never thought about it.  You   re old enough to be thinking about your legacy.  (Laughs) I   m definitely old. That   s for sure.  (Laughter)  I guess   I would like to be remembered as a fair, honest and practical  teacher. That   s what I guess would be what I   d like to see left. And I  hope that happens.  While at the same time you   ve been I am sure a wonderful teacher,  you   re legacy has been even broader than that, Tom. When you think of  your legacy, I mean extension and people   s lives you   ve touched,  practitioners. How do you want to be remembered with those people,  alumni, practitioners, and the general public?  I   d like to be remembered as a supporter of our college and the  university, and again someone that was practical and open minded and  would   I guess one of the things I did for many years was that I carried  30  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  a lot of ideas from the field back to the school, and I tried to take the  information from the school back to the field. I   ve been a purveyor of  information and goodwill, I guess is where I would fit in there. Not a  good answer, but     Tom, what, if anything, would you change? You talked about perhaps  getting some graduate degree and training. Anything else you would  look back and change?  Not much. I think I   ve had a really really interesting life. You know, just  when you break it down and look at the professions from the quarters  that I   ve been involved in. I was ranch veterinarian for a while, I was a  general practitioner for a while, I was a small animal practitioner for a  while, I   ve been a teacher for a lot of years; I was an extension  veterinarian for many years; I was involved in international development  for five years. The profession has been very very good to me and I   ve  enjoyed it very much. I   m still involved to some degree but I   ve moved  on to some other things, you know. Somebody asked me,    How can you  quit being a veterinarian?   And I said,    I guess if I   m smart enough to  learn to be a veterinarian, I can be smart enough to learn to do something  else.    (Laughter)  I   ve enjoyed retirement and I   ve enjoyed doing other things and taking  care of the livestock out here at this little farm. I do wood working, I  enjoy doing that. I enjoy reading. I enjoy learning things still. I really  enjoy traveling; we do a lot of that. I don   t know if I would change  anything much. You know, I think it would have probably been  advantageous from a career development standpoint to have done  graduate work or got a board certification. But I might have moved on  somewhere and I wouldn   t be in Stillwater and I   m not sure that   s a  good idea.  Anything else we haven   t covered? Anything you   d like to add?  I guess one thing that   throughout my career I   ve had the support of  some really, really fantastic folks. My parents were very supportive in  what I wanted to do and help for the good, going through school. My  great uncle, my granddad assisted me monetarily to get through. It didn   t  seem like much at the time, but it was enough to keep me going. My first  wife, we were married for 42 years before she died. She always  supported me in everything I did. She went to Africa with me twice. My  daughters were supportive in everything that happened. And Libby, my  second wife, has been fantastic in supporting me in the same thing. I  couldn   t have done it without these people. I guess I consider myself  probably one of the luckiest guys in the world to have had this many  good and strong and supportive folks around me. And my four sisters,  31  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  Gill  Thedford  you know, they   ve been supportive on the things I   ve done. I   ve been off  up here in Oklahoma and they   re all down there in Texas, you know. But  they think this is a good deal. I couldn   t have done what I   ve done  without all the help from these folks, that   s for sure.  Well Tom, you bring up a question about maybe support of deans. You  worked with gosh six, seven, or eight deans.  All of them but one I think at this point.  Any thoughts about any of the deans that have been particularly helpful  to you or that you had a great relationship with?  Yeah. Bill Brock was dean when I went to Africa the first time. He  encouraged me to do it. He protected me while I was gone and he  assisted me when I got back. Bill was involved in our Guatemala project  and he was aware of the broadening experience of international work  and what it could mean to you and he encouraged that. And I really  appreciated that with him. He was a real pillar in that respect. Pat  Morgan   s been a friend for years. He and I   ve worked together on a lot  of different things. He was dean when I went off to Arkansas to work for  Winrock. Joe Alexander supported me and gave me the opportunity to  be one of his    deanlettes    as we referred to them, one of his assistant  deans or associate deans. And I think we had a really good relationship  there. I think Joe did a good job of   he was an extremely good person to  work with fundraising and people out in the field. He kind of did what I  talked about a while ago; I think he surrounded himself with capable  people and he let them run the place and he kind of got out of the way  and I appreciated that. He let me run my shop the way I thought it ought  to be run. I think it ran smooth and I think it did the things it was set up  to do.  What do you think of having one of our own, Dean Michael Lorenz, head  of the college now? You probably remember teaching him some classes?  Mike Lorenz was one of my students. Mike Lorenz was my next door  neighbor from when he was a senior. Mike Lorenz was very  instrumental in helping me save my old Dalmatian dog when she picked  up rat poisoning-strychnine. Mike   s one of the brightest and best I think  we   ve ever produced. And I think he   s done a fantastic job. I   ve been  extremely pleased with what he   s brought to the college and the way  he   s handled it. And I think with his experience at other schools, his  experience at Cornell as a grad student, then Georgia and Kansas State, I  think they prepared him well to come here and do what he   s done. I  think he   s learned a lot from them and has progressed right on up that  line and I see a real bright future for us in the school. I think it was a  32  Gill  Thedford  Gill  good move when he came here. I   m pleased with what he   s done. As a  general rule, I   ve gotten along with all the deans that we   ve had. The  only one we had nobody got along with him, (laughter) he didn   t last  very long back some years ago. Brock was good, Pat was good, Joe was  good, and Mike has been very, very good. I think things have gone  pretty smooth. I think we are fortunate to get these people. And they   ve  each brought their own little difference, their little quirks, their little part  to build on. I think it   s helped the school.  I guess I   d have to say that the profession of veterinary medicine is  smaller and the number of schools is very small. When you look at the  grand scheme of things with the quality of schools and all of these big  name schools here and there, maybe, Oklahoma State College of  Veterinary Medicine or Center for Veterinary Health Sciences as they  call it now, maybe we haven   t garnered the peak that some of these other  schools have in an area, but I think when it comes down to producing the  best practitioners of any place that we   re tops. I think we   re absolutely  tops. I think we   ve produced the best and the brightest as far as those  going out and doing the work of the profession out in the  field . And  when you   ve seen what they   ve done and you go back and you look at  the accomplishments of our graduates it   s just fantastic. This little old  school has not been supported many times as well as it could be from an  economic standpoint. Sometimes we just had to pull our belts in and  really grunt to keep things going. And it   s done a fantastic job.  Anything else?  I can   t think of anything right off.  I appreciate it, thank you.  -------  -------
