Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted by [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden.  The videographer is Randall William Brown [Randall Brown], the location of the interview is 5904 Bloomingdale Terrace at the home of our HistoryMaker in Rockville, Maryland, and the date is November 10th, 2006.  Mr. HistoryMaker, would you please give me your full name, and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: My full name is Elmer Turner Brooks [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Elmer T. Brooks].  The first name is E-L-M-E-R, middle name is T-U-R-N-E-R, last name Brooks, B-R-O-O-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  General Brooks, would you give me your date of birth and where you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born on December the 30th, 1932 in Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital] here in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that you're retired, but how would you describe or label your profession, your occupation over your lifetime?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually had several occupations I, I guess you would say.  My primary occupation was as a military officer in the Air--United States Air Force, for thirty years.  I also spent about seven years with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]; three years while I was in the Air Force, and then another six years, after I retired, I spent at NASA Headquarters here in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then I had a brief career in, in business over in London [England] in investment banking; it was so brief it hardly is worth mentioning.
Speaker 1: Well, we'll mention it though (laughter).  It was an interesting detour, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  We're gonna come back and explore all of those positions that you held in some detail.
Story_ID: 392258
Speaker 1: Before we get to the formal part of the interview, so to speak, we have a few warm-up questions as we call them--People magazine type questions--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --which will give the viewer of your interview, the viewers, another slant on your personality.  And so my first question is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  Probably pork chops, greens and mac and cheese as a meal (laughter).  There are lots of other things I like; I'm pretty epicurean but I, I like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of year--season?
Speaker 2: Right now.  I, I like the fall, especially in the Washington, D.C. area; you get the most clear, crisp days with a lot of sunshine.  If we're lucky, we get a lot of days in the 60s and 70s [degrees], so--ideal for me.
Speaker 1: Good.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color used to be red but I think I'm--I worked my--as I got older, I worked away from red.  I'm trying to think do I have a favorite color now--might be shades of red still--yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I like beaches.  As you know, Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] is one place I used to go for, for beaching, but the Caribbean, of course, and Florida, California.  I just like the environment of a beach.
Speaker 1: I'm a beach bum, too (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't care where it is.  The last warm-up question, do you have a favorite saying or phrase that you like to use from time-to-time with family or friends or neighbors--something philosophical that you like to share with people?
Speaker 2: I don't--I can't remember one (laughter).  They might say that I have one, but I don't think I have one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 392259
Speaker 1: As we were saying earlier, we're going to begin by talking about your family and your family roots, and beginnings of your family way back so that we have a sense of, of your growing up years, your development, and how you came to be the person that you've been and that you are now--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your accomplishments and so on.  And so we're gonna start with your mother.  Would you give me your mother's full name, her birth year, and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother was Lelia Corinthia was her middle name, her maiden name was Williams and last name was Brooks [Lelia Williams Brooks].  She was born in Augusta, Georgia, and I don't recall the year now without looking at something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it was 1888, you said on your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighteen eighty-eight [1888], right.
Speaker 1: --on your questionnaire.  Where did your mother grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Georgia in her youth, and I guess in her late teens she moved to Brooklyn, New York with her half-brother--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --who also had started in Georgia, but he moved to Brooklyn.  And she lived with that family in, in Brooklyn, New York for quite a few years, and then moved to the Winchester, Virginia area in a little town--historic town called Opequon [Virginia] and--right outside of Winchester, and that's where she met my, my father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] and married later on.  She taught school down there in Stephens City [Virginia] near Winchester.
Speaker 1: She was born in Augusta.  Did she spend any childhood years in Augusta, or w- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: She did?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she ever share with you any stories about her childhood, growing up years in Augusta?
Speaker 2: You know, I heard very little about her childhood.  For one, one reason, I guess you'd say, my mother died when I was relatively young; I was fourteen when she died, so I guess when you get to the age where you'd be naturally inquisitive--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and question your parents about things, they had already died.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I don't recall anything much at all about Augusta, Georgia from my mother.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, okay.  You said she was a school teacher.  Where did she prepare for teaching?
Speaker 2: She went to a college down south, and I think it was a school in Georgia and I can't recall the name of it. I may have it in some of the historical documents, but I don't recall (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  And your mother passed when?
Speaker 2: She passed in 1948.
Speaker 1: How do you remember her as a person, her personality particularly?  What was she like as a, as a person?
Speaker 2: She was a beautiful woman, both physically and interior.  She was a very calm person; I never recall her raising her voice, even when she spanked me with a switch on my legs for doing something wrong when I was a kid--she never raised her voice and she was never--I never saw her angry at all, which was amazing when I think back on it. But just a beautiful person--a saint in my estimation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about her mother?  Can you give me her mother's name, your maternal grandmother, and when--where she was born?
Speaker 2: Corinthia Williams [Corinthia Daniel Williams] was her mother's name, and I know absolutely nothing about Corinthia, never--she was dead before I was born, so I never got a chance to meet her.  In fact, I only met one grandparent, and that was Walter Brooks [Brooks' paternal grandfather, Walter Henderson Brooks]; he was the only one living during my lifetime.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: She, she also was from Georgia, and I'm not sure whether she was born in Augusta or, or some other town in Georgia (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 392260
Speaker 1: Would you give me your father's name and his birthplace and birth year?
Speaker 2: My father was Warren Randolph Brooks [Warren Brooks, Sr.], and not sure of his birthdate either, without referring to something.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1874] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--in fact I'm having trouble remembering where he was, was born--the location.  I have to check that for you.
Speaker 1: I think Gordonsville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Gordonsville, Virginia, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: In Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his occupation?  What did he do to--?
Speaker 2: After he came out of school [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], he went to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] as a traveling worker for the YMCA. He did that for a while, but most of his life he was a mail carrier, and the latter part of his life, the last few years, he was a government worker here in Washington, D.C. working in the programs that Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] had established after the war [sic.].
Speaker 1: Where did he grow up?  He was born in Gordonsville, Virginia; did he--was he raised there, or--
Speaker 2: He grew up, I think, probably most, mostly in Richmond, Virginia.  My grandfather, Walter Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks], was a slave in Richmond, went away, then came back to Richmond to, to preach, and so my father was with him most of the time.  Then they moved to Washington, D.C., so a good part of his life was in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Washington, uh-huh.  Did your father share with you stories and memories of his growing up years in Richmond?
Speaker 2: Again, not that I can recall.  He died when I was six years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And I just don't recall any stories that he told me about his growing up years.
Speaker 1: What about his father?  Tell me about your grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know more about Walter Brooks.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Walter Brooks your, your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Walter Brooks is, is my idol.  When I think of a Christian man and a Christian life, I think of Walter Brooks who I think epitomized everything there is to, to be as a Christian.  He began his life as a slave in Richmond, Virginia.  He was a slave until he was fourteen years old.  He achieved his freedom at the end of the Civil War where some of his family were liberated by my great-grandfather [Albert Royal Brooks] being able to purchase their freedom.  My grandfather had to wait 'til the end of the war to be freed along with his brother.  Now, when they were freed, they had already learned to read and write by virtue of some kindly white people who had taught them how to read and write, mainly through teaching them the Bible in Sunday school.  My grandfather and his brother, Prince [Prince Albert Brooks], matriculated from Richmond all the way up to Rhode Island to a Pres- I think it was a, a Quaker school; it was called Wilberforce Institute [Carolina Mills, Rhode Island], run by Quakers, and they received a--I guess the equivalent of a high school education there. And when he was about sixteen, he went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Ashmun Institute; Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], and I believe he was in the second graduating class of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, he and his brother both.  His bro- my grandfather Walter, stayed on for a year in, in theology, and got a bachelor's [degree] in theology there at Lincoln University.  His brother Prince came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and went through law school there and became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you know about your grandfather Walter Brooks' slavery years?  Did he have a--what do you know about his slavery, what did he do?  Where was he?
Speaker 2: He told us a few stories and then he--
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: --wrote a few stories.  He wrote poems and then he wrote a, a brief history of the family.  He, he was at home until he was eight years old, which was unusual--it was a, a unified family; a husband and wife and the children all were in a house in Richmond, Virginia; they were still slaves (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As slaves, yeah.
Speaker 2: --all of 'em (laughter), but they did maintain a family existence at that time, and his parents pretty well sheltered him from the, the hardships of slavery.  Then, when he was eight years old, the owners of the family sold him to the Turpin and Yarbrough Tobacco Company in Richmond, and his father had already been working as a slave in that tobacco company. That was pretty harsh work; it was hard work, and he worked from sundown to sun- sunup to sundown, and he would tell us that he would run that mile and a-half from his home to this factory every morning, and if he were a minute late, he would get beat, and if he did anything wrong in the factory--chop the tobacco wrong, or whatever, he would also get a whipping.  So it was pretty, pretty hard work there, and so he spent all of his slavery time in this tobacco factory until he was fourteen years old.
Story_ID: 392261
Speaker 1: He told us about his, his father, Albert Royal Brooks, sitting before the fireplace in their house reading the Bible to them and reading things like Milton's [John Milton] 'Paradise Lost'; he had those books that he owned as a slave, so that--after he had learned--my great-grandfather learned how to read and write then he taught his children how to read and write as well.
Speaker 2: So, who was Albert Brooks?  Tell us.  Could you go back another generation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Albert Royal Brooks--we're just learning a lot about him in the last, say, twenty years in our family, but we did a lot of research and found that he was quite an interesting char- interesting character.  He, first of all, had been a field hand in Chesterfield County in, in Virginia as a slave for many years, and then he came to--well, while he was a, a field hand, he met the acquaintance of, of Lucy Brooks [Lucy Goode Brooks]--who became Lucy Brooks; Lucy Goode at the time.  She taught him how to write and he was able to forge a pass so that he could come to Richmond [Virginia] from the plantation to visit her, which he did often, and then he was sold to another slave owner in the City of Richmond.  But while he was a slave, while he was a slave, he had an arrangement with his owner that he could have his own business, so he had a, a livery business which was horses and buggies--limousine service, if you will.  He serviced funerals and picked people up at the train station and delivered them around the city like a taxicab, that kind of thing.  Started off with one horse and one buggy, and ended up with, I understand, several dozen horses, and twelve or so buggies to go along with that.  So he became quite a, quite an entrepreneur in the City of Richmond, as a slave.  Of course, most of the proceeds had to go to the owner, and he was able to save enough money, though, that in the--by the year the 19- 1862, he was able to buy his wife's freedom, his freedom, and several of his children he paid for in gold nuggets, it was said.  He became a deacon in the church, the First African Baptist Church, which was part of the First Baptist Church of Richmond, Virginia; it was an integrated congregation initially--the blacks sat on one side, the whites sat on the other side.  Then, the black and white congregation separated; the white congregation became the First Baptist Church of Richmond, which it still is, and the black congregation became the First African Baptist Church; that still exists in Richmond as well.  And my great-grandfather was a deacon there; my grandfather [Walter Henderson Brooks] was ordained in that church and gave his first sermons in that church.
Speaker 2: Tell me about Lucy Brooks, your great-grandmother.  She was also a slave (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was also an interesting woman we found more about in recent years.  She was a slave as well; as I said, she taught Albert how to write.  She was a slave in a household in Richmond throughout all of her slave life, and then when she married Albert, she was able to move into a house of their own there in Richmond.  Once the Civil War ended, Lucy, with a, a group of women and the help of the Quakers in Richmond, began a, an orphanage for slave children [Friends' Asylum for Colored Orphans; Friends' Association for Children, Richmond, Virginia], and that, that location is still active down there now.  We had a family reunion, we went down and visited the location.  The Friends--it's a Friends organization--still there at that place; not an orphanage anymore, but more of a community center, I guess you would say.  But we were able to bring her--just a sideline story.  We had a, a portrait that allegedly depicted Lucy Brooks, and it was sort of a stereotypical dark brown-skin woman in slave garb, but Lucy Brooks looked like she was white (laughter), and so when we took the photograph down and presented it to the center, they were, they were quite surprised that she didn't look anything like the, the idealized picture that they'd put up there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that's the picture that you're holding, aren't you, in one of the news articles that I, that I looked at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 392262
Speaker 1: You actually can go back another generation to great-great, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know a lot about them--
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but we got a few names back there--
Speaker 1: I looked at your family tree and--well, just tell us a little bit about the great-great--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peggy, Peggy Henderson we know was, let's see, yeah, that was a great-great [paternal great-great grandmother]; she was a slave also, of course.  She probably--I don't know whether she--she didn't marry.  I don't know if she married him or had, had--at least had a child by someone named Brooks, but he obviously was also of pure African descent because she said and my [paternal] grandfather [Walter Henderson Brooks] said that all the way through that generation were pure African. So, Peggy Henderson and, and whoever this person Brooks was--now, we found out that the adjacent plantation b- was run by the Brooks family--white Brooks family, so we assumed that slaves there also took the name Brooks, and that's where the Brooks name started back there in that generation.  There was also a family oral history that Peggy's mother was called--so it be great-great-great (laughter)--was called Big Peggy, and that's about all we know about her, but we do have the indication that her name was Big Peggy and, and she was also in that same area [Chesterfield County, Virginia], so at least those generations were, were here in the United States.
Speaker 1: Now, was there another great-great that I saw in the family tree?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I don't, I didn't--you're very fortunate to be able to, to go that far back, very fortunate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Most of that information we've gathered over this last twenty years, as I said, doing research, so--those are people I really never knew but were just happy to find--
Speaker 1: You actually have a book called 'The Brooks Chronicle' ['The Brooks Chronicles: The Life and Times of an Afro-American Family,' Charlotte K. Brooks and Joseph K. Brooks].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Now, who put that together?
Speaker 2: My--the primary author was my si- my sister-in-law, Charlotte K. Brooks, who's the wife--was the wife, she's deceased now, of my brother Walter Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks II], my oldest brother.
Speaker 1: I remember her well; great lady (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) You, you know them both.
Speaker 1: I know them well.
Speaker 2: Charlotte Brooks was head of the English department here in Washington, D.C. Public Schools [District of Columbia Public Schools], and Walter taught in the public schools here in D.C.  And their son also, who's an archivist at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] was able to gather a lot of information through the archives down at the Library of Congress.  So they did the research and the writing of that, of that chronicle.
Story_ID: 392263
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Lelia Williams Brooks] and father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] meet?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, they met in this place called Opequon, Virginia, outside of Winchester, Virginia.  My mother was a school teacher in the area down there living in, in Opequon with the family, the Tokus [ph.] family down there, which was half- her half-brother's family.  And my father had gone down there to recuperate from tuberculosis, so he went from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to, to Opequon, and it was sort of a retreat for him to recuperate from tuberculosis, and they met there and, and married later.  They got married down there in Virginia.
Story_ID: 392264
Speaker 1: Tell me about their family--your siblings.  Tell me how many brothers and sisters you have.  Would you give me their names and when they were born, and where they are today?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm gonna have a problem with when they were born again (laughter), but I'll give it a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you have it here.
Speaker 2: It's written down (laugher).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The oldest--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all my, my, my father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] had two children by another wife before he married my mother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he had Thelma Amos was her married name--Thelma Brooks Amos, and Evelyn Brooks Woodson.  Those were the two oldest.  Then after he married my mother, Lelia [Lelia Williams Brooks], and he had seven children.  One [Ottinette Brooks] died in infancy and the oldest is Walter Henderson Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks II].  Walter--I wanna say he was born in New Jersey, but I'm not (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Montclair [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Montclair, okay--Montclair, New Jersey.  Next to him was Julia [Julia Brooks Wynn] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old is Walter now?
Speaker 2: Walter is ninety years old and--
Speaker 1: Ninety?
Speaker 2: --going strong; my golf partner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My oldest sister, other than my two half-sisters, was Julia Brooks.  I don't remember where Julia was born.
Speaker 1: Opeequa?
Speaker 2: Opequon, Opequon, Virginia. Opequon.
Speaker 1: Opequon, Virginia, okay.  And she's still living in, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania right now; a life-long school teacher as well.  I have a--just a, a lot of school teachers in my family.  Next to Julia was Warren Randolph Brooks [Warren Brooks, Jr.], my father's namesake.  He's a medical doctor, internist in Los Angeles, California now, and--
Speaker 2: How old is he approximately?
Speaker 1: Warren is about eighty-five.  And next to him was Dorothy Corinthia Brooks [Dorothy Brooks Thompson].  Dorothy is deceased. She was a U.S. government worker in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] during her lifetime.  Can't recall where, where Dorothy was born either (laughter).
Speaker 2: Akron, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Akron, all right.  That's where they lived before they moved to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], all right.  Then, after Dorothy was William Terrell Brooks [William T. Brooks], the brother next to me; he's seven years older than I am; he's eighty years old, and I think he was born somewhere other than Akron if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 2: Akron.
Speaker 1: Akron?  Okay, Akron, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Question.  Walter was born in Montclair, New Jersey, Julia in Opequon, Virginia--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --then you had Akron, Ohio.  Different places?
Speaker 1: Different places my father had moved to on a temporary basis, and he spent--I think that was during the time he was working with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], at the Red, Red Bank, New Jersey and Montclair, New Jersey at times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: --and Opequon might have been just coincidentally they were down there visiting (laughter) and, and the child came at that time, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And then he--in Akron--
Speaker 1: And Akron--they lived in Akron for a while.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, YMCA work do you think?
Speaker 1: No, that, there, he was a postal, a postman.
Speaker 2: That's where he did--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --okay.
Story_ID: 392265
Speaker 1: How far back can you remember?  What are your earliest memories as a child?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: I can recall the age of three, four and five--somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I recall my father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] quite vividly walking me to school, holding my hand walking me to school.  I recall him bringing me a cube of sugar from the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] where he was working.  Every day he'd bring a cube of sugar back; that was my treat--wrapped in a little piece of paper like the sugar cubes that they used in the coffee. Recall him being a pretty stern man when he wanted to be.  I can remember him punishing my brothers mainly (laughter), and chasing them around the house, and I can recall my brother William [William T. Brooks]; I don't know exactly what he did, but my father was after him with a, with a razor strop, and he would run up the front steps, cross the second floor, down the back steps (laughter), and then he'd probably trap him around our circular table we had in the, in the dining room, and that was the end of my brother (laughter).  But that didn't happen very often.  But I recall him as being a loving father and certainly treating me very well.  I recall the, the day that he died, that he had--I couldn't go into the hospital for whatever reason they didn't let children under a certain age go into the--certain rooms of the hospital, but he was dying, so he called for me and I went in, and I remember having a brief conversation with him before he died.
Speaker 1: Any other pre-school memories?  Pre-grade one, pre-kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can remember skateboards, small bicycles and tricycles, wagons, roller skates.  I can remember roller-skating up the street.  We used to cash in bottles for deposit money. If you bought a bottle of pop, you'd get--on a big bottle, you'd get five cents; small bottle--you get two cents on a small bottle--pop bottle.  So I was skating up to the store to cash it in and of course fell down, cut my hand very badly (laughter), so I can remember that very well.  I can remember some mischievous things (laughter). Don't wanna own up to all of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but BB guns and, and dart guns were my nemesis; seemed I'd always get in trouble with those.
Story_ID: 392266
Speaker 1: We didn't have any playgrounds in our, in our area of D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  I lived in the 1700 block of T Street Northwest.
Speaker 2: I was just gonna ask you what street did you live on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, T Street Northwest in D.C., which, I guess you'd say it's on the--it's sort of in-between named areas.  Adams Morgan [Washington, D.C.] is the closest area, which is called Adams Morgan now.  In fact, it was named Adams Morgan after Morgan Elementary School [Thomas P. Morgan Demonstration School; Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] that I attended, and my siblings did as well, which was right near the house.  And the Adams School [John Quincy Adams School, Washington, D.C.] was the white school up the street on 19th Street, so Adams Morgan became the name of the area.  Of course Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] was probably about ten blocks away, in southwestern- southwesterly direction. And about two blocks away to the east was what's now called the Shaw neighborhood [Washington, D.C.], so we were sort of in-between all of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we didn't have any playgrounds, as I was saying, so we played in the street mainly, even though cars were parked on both sides of the street.  So it was stickball, and football, and dodge ball, and any kind of ball we could play.  And of course we broke a few windows out in the meantime, kicking footballs and hitting stickballs--things like that.  But we had a lot of fun; we raced in the street.
Story_ID: 392267
Speaker 1: General [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Elmer T. Brooks], do you ever return to 1757 T Street?
Speaker 2: I certainly do.  I, I drive by there on occasion when I'm conducting a tour of my old neighborhood [Adams Morgan, Washington, D.C.] for friends and family, it's a little different now than when I lived there.
Speaker 1: How is it different?
Speaker 2: Well, when I grew up there, it was a, a, a street--that entire block, which is a very long block between 17th [Street] and 18th Street on T Street, of single family houses, and even though I don't think anybody was rich on that street, but I guess it was a middle class street, and every house was--had a family in it; you knew who that family were, and you knew all the members of the family.  Now, it is mostly white, so it went from mostly--almost exclusively black to mostly white on that same street.  It looks the same--the exterior looks essentially the same. Still have the big sycamore trees there, the planting of the tree boxes out front where I used to play (unclear) and marbles out there in front, but it is a different complexion.  Up at the corner of 18th and T, there was a Jewish family that had a, a small grocery store that we all went to; that's where I was taking those bottles of pop to, to cash 'em in; well, they graduated to a liquor store, which became a very popular liquor store in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and they bought up the property around for parking lots so that people would come in from all over the place to buy liquor there by the case.  Then, they sold that, and now it's a very popular Hispanic restaurant; I think (unclear) about a four or five-story restaurant that stays full all the time on that corner.  So that's the main difference in the neighborhood that I see now.

Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about your neighbors--your--the neighbors of your parents [Lelia Williams Brooks and Warren Brooks, Sr.] to the left, the right, across you.  What were their occupations?  What were the neighbors doing as you remember?
Speaker 2: The ones I can remember mostly were teachers in the public school system [District of Columbia Public Schools]; a few in the--at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and Miner Teachers College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], otherwise professionals.  I recall a few families who were passing for white (laughter) two doors down and--on the other side of the street about halfway down.  They had some different kinds of jobs that we weren't--we didn't know anything about.  One of the jobs was as a tour guide down in the, the historic district down in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  That was a job that blacks normally didn't get, but the patriarch of that family had that job.
Speaker 1: Can you give me the names of any of the adult neighbors who were teaching at Howard University?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to think who was at Howard at that time.  Hm--I can't recall a name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't recall a name now--no (shakes head).

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about church life--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --as you were growing up with your brothers and sisters and your parents [Lelia Williams Brooks and Warren Brooks, Sr.].  Did you attend church regularly?  What church, and where was church in your life as you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well, my [paternal] grandfather, Walter H. Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks], who came to Washington [D.C.] in 1882 to take the pastorate of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], which, at that time, was located at 19th [Street] and I Streets Northwest, near the White House [Washington, D.C.], not too far.  Most of the parishioners came from the Georgetown area [Washington, D.C.] when Georgetown was predominantly black; of course all that changed in the '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  We all went to church (laughter); our grandfather saw to that.  We went to Sunday school, we went to church, we went to prayer meeting, we went to just about all the services.  My siblings and I, especially my siblings, were asked to sit on the steps to the pulpit during, during the sermon, so he was sure that they were there.  I recall mainly sitting in the third pew on the left-hand side during, during the, the sermons.  My aunts and uncles, of course, also attended that church, but my grandfather preached until he--essentially, until he died.  He was--about six months before he died, at the age of ninety-four, he was still preaching at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church.  He died there; he died in 1945. So, we have a long history of a, of a Christian background in the family; a strong, strong Christian background.
Story_ID: 392270
Speaker 1: From what I've gathered looking at your family history materials and talking with you, you have had a number of family reunions, and so that's become a tradition and--but let me ask you about the traditions of your family on T Street.  What were the annual traditions that you remember with your mother [Lelia Williams Brooks] and father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] and siblings at holidays, special events?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I remember is the Fourth of July; we would always have a bag of fireworks that everyone had on the black.  You'd take out your shopping bag and you would light your fireworks with Roman candles and the sparklers and what have you; that was always a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Were they legal?
Speaker 2: At that time they must have been legal; everybody in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] used 'em (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause when I grew up they were illegal--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think they were legal at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and we had to go, and we had go to Rhode Island to get them.  I was in New Bedford, Mass [New Bedford, Massachusetts], so we had to go over to Rhode Island to buy them; you couldn't buy them in Mass.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  I think the, the big noisema- the cherry bombs and things were illegal; we had a few of those, too, but they were illegal.  I think the ones that just made sparkles were legal.  Christmas, of course, was always a big holiday as it is for everybody, a big family holiday.  What else can I recall there?  Just as far as a celebration on the street, I can recall when, when Joe Louis was boxing.  Anytime he'd win a fight, we'd all be, of course, rooted to the radio, and when he'd win a fight, all--everyone would pour out into the street and be cheering, celebration (laughter) it's just like a holiday when Joe Louis won, won a fight.  I can recall the Louis-Conn fight--Billy Conn, when he fought him at Griffith Stadium [Washington, D.C.] and beat him; this was just a big celebration--
Story_ID: 392271
Speaker 1: You were quite young, of course, when FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] was first elected in '32 [1932].  In fact--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were born that year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And his second term, he came up with the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] expanded--did the WPA resources impact your family in any way?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a job for my father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me
Speaker 2: He started as a GS-1 and I think ended as a GS-2, so he didn't go very far in the ladder, even though he was a college graduate; he graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  But he was at the bottom of the rung of the, of the General Schedule, the civil service there.  But it was a job and, and during those times, those years--the, the Depression [Great Depression] years, it was good to have a job of any kind, so it was beneficial.
Speaker 1: What did your father do after the '30s [1930s] into the '40s [1940s]?  What was he doing at that time?
Speaker 2: He, he died in '39 [1939] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right (unclear).
Speaker 2: --so he didn't get a chance to move on at that point; it was pretty late in his life anyhow, and most of his life, as I said, was a post- postal carrier, and this was sort of the, the denouement, the downtrend in his life.
Story_ID: 392272
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up on T Street [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I can remember the milk man, the ice man, both coming by on horse-drawn, horse-drawn carriage, and the watermelon man pulled by a horse, and would have a cart full of watermelons in the summertime.  That was a great time, and he would come by saying, "Watermelons, watermelons, ripe off the vine, and we plug 'em all the time."  It was some rhyme he used to sing as he came down the street.  So, you go out and you get a plug a watermelon; he would cut a little piece out, and you taste it; if you liked it, you'd buy the watermelon.  The milk man would bring unpasteurized milk in the, in the, in the bottle and put it on your step right outside the door.  He would also come in a, in a horse-drawn cart.  And there was an umbrella man, someone who repaired umbrellas.  He didn't have a cart, he had a big carriage on his back where he carried umbrellas and scissors; he sharpened scissors and knives, and he repaired umbrellas.  There was a peanut vendor, and he would come by, he--what was his thing?  "Peanuts, peanuts, one for a nickel, two for a dime, everybody looking had a darn civil mind." (Laughter) That was the rhyme he used to come down there with.  The ice man who had a horse-drawn cart--we'd have to put a placard in the window, a square placard, and on each, the top of each side would be the poundage of ice you wanted for the day--50 pounds, 25 pounds, 10 pounds, 5 pounds, and you would turn the one you wanted to the top so he would--in the front window, so he would come and have his tongs and he'd bring a big block of ice up.  And we had an icebox, not a refrigerator, but it had an ice compar- compartment in the top and he'd put the block of ice in there, and one of my jobs was, of course, to keep the water pan emptied at the bottom of the, of the icebox.  One of the great days was to get a Kelvinator, as it I think it was called at that--it was the first refrigerator.  So, we had a Kelvinator and got rid of the ice (laughter), and that was a great day, even though I had to defrost all that thing and all that.
Story_ID: 392273
Speaker 1: Let's begin to talk about your formal schooling.  How old were you when you started elementary school?  You mentioned the school that you first attended, the Morgan School is that correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about entering elementary school.  What do you remember about those early years in school?
Speaker 2: Well, Morgan Elementary School was actually called Morgan Demonstration School [Thomas P. Morgan Demonstration School; Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  I think it was called that because the--it was a school that the Department of Education [Office of Education; U.S. Department of Education] used to--as a show school kind of thing.  Excellent teachers at that school.  I went--started off at the age of five at Morgan.  I can remember my teachers very well; they were, they were excellent.  I remember my sixth grade teacher who later became a member of our church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.]; she lived around the corner from us on U Street, 1700 block of U Street.  In fact, she lived on the 1700 block of T Street when she was teaching me at, at Morgan.  And she was the one who got me to write, so I began writing poetry and wrote essays under her, and won a few national contests--poetry and, and an essay contest for 'The Role of Civil Aviation in the Postwar World' [ph.] I think was the essay that I won (laughter)--
Speaker 1: In elementary school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school in sixth grade.  [U.S.] Department of Commerce sponsored that one.  I can remember her taking me down to receive the award and she took me to lunch afterwards, and that was a big day in my life.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school; yes, I did.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Generally, a good student 'til I got a little older (laughter).  I was a good student, got good grades mostly--through most of my schooling. Had so many teachers in my family that I couldn't do but so much wrong when I was a kid (laughter); they were on my case (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The ethnic, cultural makeup of the school at this time--?
Speaker 2: It was, it was all African American.
Speaker 1: All-black?
Speaker 2: Yes, teachers, principal, and all the students.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And they came from the neighbor- it was a neighborhood school, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you went there through grade six, or beyond?
Speaker 2: Through, through grade six (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Through grade six.
Story_ID: 392274
Speaker 1: What was the next move then?
Speaker 2: Next was junior high school, called junior high school--middle school now.  I started off at the Francis Junior High School [School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens] down in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], and all of these places I walked to from my, from my home on T Street.  I spent one s- one semester at Francis, but all of my friends from Morgan [Thomas P. Morgan Demonstration School; Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] had gone to Banneker Junior High School [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  Banneker is now a high school [Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.]; it used to be a junior high school, but it was an excellent school as well, so I transferred to Banneker Junior High School and spent two years at Banneker.  And by the way, I skipped a grade; I skipped the second grade in elementary school and the ninth grade in junior high school, so I was ahead of my time (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two years, two years.
Speaker 2: Two years, yeah.  I enjoyed my time at Banneker.  I started playing basketball--sports in, in Banneker my second year, and became quite an avid athlete after that.
Speaker 1: Was there African American, or black history and culture taught in the courses you were taking either in upper elementary or junior high?  Was there any black history being taught?
Speaker 2: In elementary, in junior high and high school, we all studied black history.  It seems to me, as I recall, it started off as one day (laughter) was the official day, but the teachers usually would spend like a week, where they would concentrate on black heroes' contributions.
Speaker 1: So that would have been what we call the Negro History Week [Black History Month]?  How did you--what
Speaker 2: Negro history w- yeah, Carter G. Woodson's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  But what about during the entire year?  Were you taught black history and did you have (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We were, in elementary school and, and, you know, famous people in the area would come in and speak to us, you know; we'd have a chance to meet them.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of those speakers who--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Carter Woodson in high school, and I'm try- in fact, he taught at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] before he taught at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Who else came down there?  Hm.
Speaker 1: How do you remember Carter G. Woodson coming in to speak to you?  Do you have memories of--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I don't guess I was duly impressed at the time because I didn't really know all the history of Carter G. Woodson; I'm, I'm much more impressed now than I was then.  But even then he was a very impressive man.  To know that he had received a Ph.D. from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and all that kind of thing, was very impressive to us. So he was, he was a role model.
Speaker 1: So, your junior high years went through grade nine, is that what I heard you say?
Speaker 2: Went through grade nine, yes.  And then I, I went to--actually went to Dunbar High School at that time.
Speaker 1: When you were in grades eight and nine, before you went to Dunbar High School, did you have any notions or clues about what you thought you wanted to do career-wise--what you wanted to be, as we used to say?  Did you have any thoughts?
Speaker 2: I guess--just to clarify one thing, I was seventh and eighth in, in Banneker, and then I, I skipped my ninth grade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, after the eighth grade I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to the tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Any notions about career thoughts at that point?
Speaker 2: I had certain things that I liked to do and was good at.  I was good in science, most of the sciences--mainly the, the biological sciences--zoology.
Story_ID: 392275
Speaker 1: I was also good in art, and I'd studied art under Lois Mailou Jones.
Speaker 2: You did?
Speaker 1: Yep.  You know her from Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm talking about her all the time, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  Well, she had a Saturday morning art class in Washington [D.C.], right up the street from the Morgan School [Thomas P. Morgan Demonstration School; Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School], 18th [Street] and California Street.  She conducted this art class for about--I guess for about ten students, and I was one of her students from age six to age thirteen, and there's a painting on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was just gonna ask you, do you have any of her work here?
Speaker 1: I got one--not of her work.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That's another story (laughter).  But I have one of my own that I did--
Speaker 2: Oh, well I wanna see that, but I want you to tell me why you didn't have any of hers (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: But--I lost my train of thought.  Where were you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was just excited about the fact that Lois Mailou Jones was your art teacher for, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and she taught me mainly watercolor and pastel crayon, tempera colors and sculpture.  And I liked sculpture.  In fact, I, I won an honorable mention in the Ivory soap National Soap Sculpture Contest, sculpture of a, of a polar bear that I made out of a big, big cake of Ivory soap.
Speaker 2: What kind of a teacher was she, and how do you remember her?  How did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was a, a very demanding teacher, she had her own thoughts on how art was supposed to be, and I didn't always agree (laughter), agree with, with--
Speaker 2: She was teaching at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: She was teaching at Howard--
Speaker 2: --at the same time that she was working with you on Saturdays?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when I went to Howard, I took a course from her at Howard as well.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: But she was, she was excellent really--she--and she had an assistant, it was a French woman who also taught and she was probably the most hands-on--was from this French woman that I call Mademoiselle; I don't, I don't even remember her name, but she did most of the hands-on teaching of watercolor and tempera color when I was there.  But Lois Jones, she painted a, a portrait of her Saturday morning art class; there were about five of us--five boys--and I was right in the middle.  It was a, it was a large painting--oil painting, and I wanted that painting.  And when I was up at Martha's Vineyard, I don't recall what year it is now--after she had retired, she was--doing some painting still up at Martha's Vineyard.  She said she wanted me to have that painting, and I was extremely excited.  I said, "I definitely want it."  Said call her when I got back to, to Washington--first thing when I got back to Washington, she got back to Washington, I called her and she invited me up to her house on 17th Street, and she--her house was a, was a gallery really; she, she had most of her paintings hanging in her house rather than her gallery, and that was one of the paintings there, and says, "There is the painting."  And she said, "I'll tell you what; I will sell it to you for half-price."  So--I won't get into figures, but the figure was pretty steep for me, and I finally agreed.  I said, "I have to have that painting."  But I think I was out-bid by a, a physician in Florida who got the painting (laughter), so I didn't get the painting.
Speaker 2: Who was that?  Do you know?  Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Who was the physician?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't remember her name; it was a female obstetrician, as I recall--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --who was an art (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it wasn't somebody in the picture now; you said they were all boys--
Speaker 1: No, no, she was just a collector of art--black art especially.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 392276
Speaker 1: You skipped grade nine and you went to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Before you tell us about your experiences at Dunbar High, and your academics and your extracurricular activities, would you, for those who are going to study and use your interview, tell us a little bit about the history of Dunbar High School and the significance of Dunbar High School.
Speaker 2: Dunbar High School is--is and was a unique school.  It was the first African American high school in the United States, founded in 1870 as I recall.  At that time, it was called--it was some name [Preparatory High School for Colored Youth] before it even was called the M Street School [M Street High School].  For a brief time it had another name, but became the M Street High School for quite a while before it became Dunbar High School.  But just about--and, and this was the first college preparatory high school also in, in the nation, for African Americans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For African Americans.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, it drew students from not just D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but from as far away as Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and Fredericksburg [Virginia]--
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: --Alexandria [Virginia], and people came from all over the place to go to, to, to school here--
Speaker 1: Even though you weren't, even though you weren't a resident of the district?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I don't know how they worked that, but maybe they used someone's address or what, I don't know.  But anyhow it, it was a magnet school that drew, that drew students, and a fabulous school.  At that time, we had lots of well-educated African Americans--Ph.D.'s like Carter G. Woodson, who had a Ph.D. from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], who could not get a job teaching at Harvard or any other white university at the time, so they, they matriculated to the Washington area and either taught at, at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] or taught at Dunbar High School.  And a lot of them started at Dunbar, as Carter Woodson did.  Numerous teachers down there had Ph.D.'s, and the rest of 'em probably all master's degree holders.  It had a reputation of excellence; at least 90 percent of the, the students graduated and went to college. Not 90 percent graduated, 90 percent went to college.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But almost 100 percent graduated.  I can't recall any student, during my time there, who was failing--either hearing it from a teacher or hearing it from a student, saying, "I'm failing a course."  They wouldn't hear of anybody failing.  Everybody in a class was expected to pass, and they did whatever it took; if it took coming in in the evenings for the evening tutoring sessions, or come to my house, they made sure that everybody got by and everybody graduated.
Story_ID: 392277
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the teachers and instructors by name, and those you remember [from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  You probably remember all of them, but tell me some of the instructors really, you remember well.
Speaker 2: I can remember a Dr. Nixon [Alfred F. Nixon], who was my biology teacher.  He was one who created my love for biology, I think, at the time; he was an excellent, excellent teacher of biology, and just made it so interesting that you couldn't help but love it, so throughout the rest of my, my school years, I almost didn't have to study zoology and biology; it just seemed to become second-nature, and I (unclear) it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did that course have a laboratory dimension to it?
Speaker 2: It did, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, the laboratory for our chemistry department that was taught by a Dr.--oh, I'll think of his name in a minute.  But that, that laboratory was removed from the school, the old school, and taken to the Smithsonian Institution [Washington, D.C.]; it was a display of an early American labora- school room (laughter), and it was just a--the rudiments of a, of a chemistry lab there.  But it was the actual laboratory that we had there.  So we didn't have a fabulous laboratory by any means, but there were--you know, we had some beakers and some test tubes, and a Bunsen burner or two (laughter) and things like that, and a few tweezers and dropper--droplets.
Speaker 1: Any other teachers you can recall by name?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can think of Lillian Brown [ph.], who was my English teacher, who gave me an appreciation of Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and of Paul Laurence Dunbar.  So, she had me to memorize a Paul Laurence Dunbar poem for our graduation exercises--class day, and we always had to learn lots of Shakespeare soliloquies for, for school as part of our, our lessons. So she, she was a great teacher--a great teacher of English.  Mrs. McNeal [ph.] taught English as well; she taught English grammar.  I learned how to diagram a sentence from Mrs. McNeal, so that stood me in good stead throughout all my life.  I knew exactly what the predicate and (unclear) and the predicate verbs were of any sentence, and all subordinate clauses and phrases, and what have you.  She made it interesting and something that stuck with you.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything about your history courses?
Speaker 2: History, unfortunately for me, was not a good course; I, I don't remember a lot.  I, I only got to appreciate history later, I think, my college years--
Story_ID: 392278
Speaker 1: Tell me about your athletic participation at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Senior Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.].  What sports were you involved with?
Speaker 2: Well, I was fairly young.  As I said, I went to Dunbar when I was thirteen, and went out for the basketball team that year and I made the team.  I was a second-teamer on the basketball team.  I was essentially too small to play football; I must have weighed about 125 pounds and, and I was about my same height as I am now, so I was just a rail at that time, so I deci- decided not to play football.  My second year, I had an operation, a hernia operation during football season, so I couldn't play football, but I did play basketball and did well in basketball; I was the first team in basketball, and made honorable mention in the all-city selections. My best year was my, my third year where I made first team, all-city, and all-conference in basketball.  Of course, we had two leagues at that time; we had the black league and the, the white league, so the--never the twains did meet in competition--official competition.  But we did manage to get together in the summertime out on the asphalt courts; it's called the neutral territory, somewhere about midway in the city, and we'd pick a, pick a, have a pick-up team of, of the black athletes and the white athletes, and we'd get together and play each other, so we had a pretty good idea of who was who, and (laughter) what the capabilities were on both sides.
Speaker 1: So you did well at Dunbar High in--?
Speaker 2: Did well there, did well in football my senior year as well.  Played and--at that time you played both ways, offense and defense; I was great on offense, zero on defense (laughter).
Story_ID: 392279
Speaker 1: In addition to Carter G. Woodson, who came into your school, were there any other African American men or women that you remember coming as speakers to talk in the auditorium or the classes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--oh, the names are getting away from me.  The first African American [Wesley A. Brown] to graduate from the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland], and I, I just saw him not long ago because he's, he's a graduate of Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], but he used to come back and speak to us.  He left the [U.S.] Navy as a lieutenant commander, as I recall. I'll think of the name in a minute, but he was very inspirational.  Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., who was the first African American general, an [U.S.] Army general.  He went to M Street High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] as a matter of fact; graduated from M Street High School.  His son, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was an [U.S.] Air Force general.  He spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C. although he didn't go to Dunbar High School; he was here at different times in his life.  So Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. spoke to us there.  Colonel West Hamilton [West A. Hamilton], who was one of the early pioneers in the Army, came in and spoke to us quite frequently.  And then we would get scholars of one, one stripe or another, like Carter Woodson.  I can't think of who else was there, but they would, they would make sure there was a steady stream of, of, of role models--
Speaker 1: Coming in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to come before us so that we would have someone to look up to and emulate.
Story_ID: 392891
Speaker 1: As we had examined earlier, there were a number of people in your family who were school teachers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were they watching your progress through, through Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  Were any of them close by to watch you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, absolutely.  Unfortunately, while I was at Dunbar my, my aunt died--Aunt Julia Brooks [Julia E. Brooks]; she was the assistant principal down at Dunbar.  She was sort of the one that really kept tabs on me and my academics; sort of acted as a guardian after my, my mother [Lelia Williams Brooks] and father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] died.  My mother died before that same year, in 1948, and my father had been dead quite a few years, so I lived with a sister and brother, mainly, in my high school years.  My mother died in '48 [1948], so she was living during two of my high school years, and after that, I lived with a brother and sister.  And my, my brother at the time was at Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], so he was really preoccupied with his studies himself, but he tried to keep track of me.  My sister was married and had started a family, so she was a little preoccupied too, but she, she tried to keep track of me.  But I guess from about the age of fourteen there, for my second year of high school, I was pretty much on my own and I had to fend for myself.
Speaker 1: Well, your aunt was teaching when you were there, or she was--?
Speaker 2: She, she was still there 'til she died in 1948 as well.
Speaker 1: But she was teaching at Dunbar (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she taught in the first part of her career at, at the old M Street High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh, she wasn't there when you were there then.
Speaker 2: She was there as the assistant principal when I was there.  She had been the assistant principal for twenty-six years--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and died in office there at--in 1948--
Speaker 1: I see, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) my second year.

Speaker 1: Any other memories, or things you wanted to say about your years at Dunbar High [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  Let me ask you this.  Any of the close friends that you had at Dunbar High School, are you still in contact with them today?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.  I, I see them quite often; some are fraternity brothers.  I can think of--let's see, I think four of us from Dunbar, or five of us, were on my Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity line at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] my second year at Howard, and they finished high school there.  One was Andrew Chambers, who went on to become a three-star general in the [U.S.] Army; he had a brother [Lawrence Chambers] who became a two-star admiral in the [U.S.] Navy, which is kind of unique.  Another friend, Hugh Robinson [Hugh G. Robinson], went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York]; he and his brother [Roscoe Robinson, Jr.] both went to West Point out of our high school class, and Hugh became a two-star Army general in the Corps of Engineers [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers], and the president of a company down in Dallas [Texas], last I heard; I keep track of him.  Every once in a while we're in contact.  I keep track of the Chambers, all three of them.  Another brother who I keep track of.  Two or three others that I see quite frequently, we still keep in contact.  Some of them have had military careers and have gone through entire military career, now retired, back in the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] area, so we see each other frequently.

Speaker 1: During the time you were a student at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], did you have weekend jobs, or after school jobs, or summer jobs?  Did you work during those years?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I did work.  I guess the, the longest spells were in the summertime, and I worked for the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] recreation department, and it helped that my brother Walter [Walter Henderson Brooks II] was a regional director in the recreation department; it was one of his jobs, so he made sure that I got a job in the recreation department, which I enjoyed a lot.  The job I actually enjoyed the most was sh- street shower operator.  I would take a, a large shower nozzle and a large crank, handle, and travel to the poorest neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.  First have the kids sweep the street up, and I'd go to a fire hydrant and screw this nozzle on and turn the water on, and the summertime this was a great treat for these kids who had no swimming pool or anything like that in their neighborhoods, so I was a popular guy.  And I would just travel to about ten sites during the course of a day, turning on the street shower.  That was a lot of fun.  I also was a, a playground--assistant director and a playground director.  I was assistant director at the Langston Playground [Washington, D.C.] right near my home.  During my high school years, I lived in Carver Terrace projects [Washington, D.C.] up in--at Maryland Avenue at 21st Street, and Langston Terrace [Langston Terrace Dwellings, Washington, D.C.] was the, the next set of public housing right down from there; I was assistant playground director there.  And lastly, I was playground director at Ivy City, an area of Washington called Ivy City, and I had that job before I left.  The last job I had was aircraft parts cleaner, which sounds very intriguing and important, but when I went to the job--and I, I went to this job as a result of a friend of mine, Frazier Hemphill; he went through a--what do you call it--employment agency--and they, they sent him out to the National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.] to the All American Airways; it's since defunct, of course.  I think they had three DC-3 [Douglas DC-3] airplanes in this hangar at--the first hangar you get to when you, when you drive into the National Airport.  And anyhow, he was going out there, and I was trying to find a job as a senior, high school senior, so I said, "Can I tag along with you?"  I went ahead with, with Frazier, and they hired both of us as aircraft parts cleaners.  Well, what that amounted to was cleaning the honey bucket out of the airplanes (laughter), scrubbing the, the carpets, and scrubbing the seats, so--and also the underbelly of the airplane that accumulated carbon from the engines blowing carbon back.  So we'd get this gunk in a long handle brush and scrub the bottom of the airplanes and then wash 'em off.  That was aircraft parts cleaner.  But it was a, it was a fairly good paying job for those days, so--and one side benefit was that I could fly that airline to Cincinnati, Ohio, which was the closest stop to Miami University, Ohio [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio], which I later went to, and then I, I had free transportation (laughter) up there to school.

Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: In 1949.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-nine [1949].  And what came next in your life after high school graduation?
Speaker 2: After high school graduation, I had a little bit of a dilemma.  I was, I was a big athlete at that time, I was a big jock, so I wanted to get a, a athletic scholarship, and surprisingly enough, not even the, the African American universities [HBCUs] were doing a lot of recruiting in those days.  Howard University right here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], they weren't recruiting any D.C. boy; none of the other colleges were as well.  So, I was thinking, I didn't have any parents and I was sort of on my own--didn't have any money, so I figured, well, I better stay here in D.C. and go to Howard.  So I, I did get an academic scholarship to Howard there--a full-tuition scholarship to Howard University.  The first year up there I was on the dean's list and did well--played basketball, made the first team in basketball.  Second year, I joined a fraternity.
Speaker 1: What fraternity?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity.  Xi Chapter up there at Howard University.  There were eighteen of us on our line--we had a fabulous line; the guys have been very successful since that time--all eighteen.  And as I mentioned to you earlier (laughter), I found out where all the parties were in the Washington, D.C. area, so I managed to go from the dean's list to academic probation in one semester there in my second year, and decided it was time to leave Howard University (laughter).  Since they weren't paying a lot of the bills anyhow, I might as well go somewhere else, so I decided to transfer after two years.
Speaker 1: What did you enjoy about the fraternity at that point in time?  What was--what did it mean to you?
Speaker 2: Fraternity and sorority, the Greek organizations--they were the essence of social life at, at universities like Howard, and Howard is a very social place, as you might know.  Everybody dressed up to go to class; I wore a coat and tie to go to class, the girls wore stockings, and some of 'em even wo- came to school in, in, in fur coats and things like that, so it, it's a kind of a--that was the environment at that time.
Speaker 1: Had you declared a major at that point?
Speaker 2: I had; when I first went there, I decided to be an artist, so I declared my major as commercial art, and I studied under Lois Mailou Jones, who was an instructor there--a professor at Howard University.  That didn't last (laughter); I decided after--into my second year, that maybe art wasn't the way to make a living at that time.  I'd investigated possible jobs after college and I didn't see much out there, so I transferred to my second love which was zoology, and that became my major, and I started that, that at Howard and continued that through Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] when I transferred.
Speaker 1: Who was teaching biology and zoology at Howard at that time, do you recall?
Speaker 2: I can't recall the name.  I, I can recall faces very well, but I can't recall the name of the, of the professor.  I, I, I can tell you one thing, the professor I had in zoology--freshman zoology at Howard, taught me probably more zoology than I learned in two years at Miami University as a, as an upper classman there in, in zoology.  It was really rigorous academics.
Story_ID: 392895
Speaker 1: Now, did you go directly to Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  Was there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --time in between, or you--
Speaker 2: No, I went directly out there.
Speaker 1: Well, why Miami University in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I was not doing well academically at, at the time, although I knew I could recover, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But why did you select Miami University?
Speaker 2: The summer after my second year, my brother Walter [Walter Henderson Brooks II] and his wife Charlotte [Charlotte K. Brooks] were working on their master's degrees at NYU [New York University] in New York City [New York, New York], and they stayed for the summer with a, a woman who happened to be an alumna of Miami University and--a black woman.  I went up to visit that summer--the first part of the summer, just to visit with 'em as I was passing through New York City, and my brother and his wife suggested that I might wanna try another school, I wasn't doing too well at Howard.  And I said, well, fine with me; I don't know where I can get in and how much money I've got to carry me, but I'll look into it.  And this other woman said, "Why don't you try Miami University?"  I thought she was talking about Florida, of course, first of all; never heard of Miami University of Ohio.  And she gave me some brochures and things, I learned about it.  I didn't think I knew anyone out there, but I found out two of my high school classmates were at Miami University; they had family in, in Oxford, Ohio area, so they went out there to school.  They worked at the--the parents worked at the university, so they got free schooling out there.  So, I applied.  I wrote--first of all, I wrote a letter to the basketball coach, Bill Rohr out there, and said--sent him some clippings of my exploits in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and at Howard (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had you been, had you been on an all-star team at high--in high school basketball?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I was on the southern conference all-star team--
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: --in, in high school. And an honorable mention all-CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association] I guess it is, at Howard, my second year.
Speaker 1: What position did you play?
Speaker 2: Started off playing center. Shows you how times have changed; I'm 6'3", and been that way ever since I was thirteen, but I was one of, one of--there might have been one other boy who was a little bit taller than I was in high school, and not too many who were much taller in college.  One I can think of is Earl Lloyd [HistoryMaker Earl Francis Lloyd] who became the, the first African American to play in the NBA [National Basketball Association]. He went--he came through Parker Gray High School [Parker-Gray School; Parker Gray High School] over in Alexandria [Virginia], and then went to West Virginia State University [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] down at--
Speaker 1: Okay, good, so you went to--you got in touch with the coach at Miami and what happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Got in touch with the coach; all he would do is to promise to try to get me an athletic scholarship; said I looked like a good prospect.  "Come on out and I'll try to work a scholarship for you."  So I said, "Okay."  I jumped on All American Airways (laughter), and flew out to Cincinnati [Ohio] and hitchhiked from the airport there [Greater Cincinnati Airport; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Hebron, Kentucky] up to Miami University, which is maybe sixty miles away, I don't know.  And got there with very little money in my pocket, and talked to the coach and he tells me after I get there, low and behold, that they can't give scholarships to transfer students.  So he said, "If you play on the JV [junior varsity] this year, next year I'll try to work a scholarship for you."  (Laughter) Well, I did that; I played on the junior varsity but decided after one year of junior varsity, which I was the co-captain of that team and one of the leading scorers, but I, I decided I had enough basketball; I better get my studies done, so my second year out there I, I didn't play basketball at all.  But I got, got work working in the dormitories washing pots and pans and dishes mainly; that was the, the job that carried me through 'cause I could also get my meals in the dormitories as well.  So I sort of ate and worked with the, with the athletes who had those kinds of jobs there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 392896
Speaker 1: Now, you were majoring in biology with the idea that--what were you gonna do with that degree?
Speaker 2: Well, I had hoped to be either a doctor or a dentist.  I started to think, well, I'm good at sculpture, I'm good at science, maybe I'll be a good dentist.  So I--that was sort of my last thought, I think, coming into--coming out of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and going to Miami University [Oxford, Ohio].  So I was in a--what they call a pre-dental and pre-med curriculum out there, which was all of the sciences--chemistry, physics and, and biology, and stayed with that until I graduated and discovered I didn't (laughter) have enough money to go to dental school, so I didn't get to dental school, even though that was a, that was a hope for a while, but it didn't last too long after that.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came out of Miami University, the first thing I did--because I, I, I married this wonderful woman there who was a student, Kathryn Casselberry [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks], we got married my senior year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year were you married?  What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954]--
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 2: --and we started a family immediately.  And so by the time 1955 came around and I was out of school, it was time to get a job, first of all, to support my family.  So that was a very disheartening time in my life, I have to say.  With my sheepskin in my hand, going around in person interviewing for jobs all over the Miami Valley area [Ohio]; the--Oxford [Ohio], of course, right there in town, Middletown [Ohio], Cincinnati, Ohio; Hamilton, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio.  I literally walked the streets of all those cities trying to get a job of any kind, and was not--could not be hired.  I would get either, "You're over-qualified," "You'd be a distraction and a poor morale factor for the rest of our workers here," or, "You're under-qualified" for some unexplained reason.  And I would see my classmates from Miami getting jobs; in fact, I went on interviews with several of 'em and they'd get hired, and the guy would tell me, "Come back in three weeks," or "I'll call you in three weeks," and never hear from him again.  I was almost becoming a rebel at that point, I'll tell you, and I finally got a job with the po- post office as a postal clerk, pitching mail in pigeon holes.  That almost drove me up a wall; I didn't think I--if I had worked at that much longer than the--the most of the year that I worked it, I'd gone crazy (laughter).  I was in there with other African Americans who had master's degrees and Ph.D.'s, they were pitching mail right alongside me.  Usually, it was a second job for them; most of them were teachers who used this as a second job, and they worked the swing shift mainly.
Story_ID: 392897
Speaker 1: So, that was an unhappy time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was your wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] doing at this point?  She--
Speaker 1: My wife was taking care of the child who we had at that time--
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: --and then the following year--
Speaker 2: Did she graduate the same year you did, or--?
Speaker 1: She didn't graduate; she was two years behind me and so she had to drop out.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Unfortunately I, I sort of brought a halt to a budding musical career because she's a beautiful singer and was then.  She was on a, a voice scholarship at Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio], a four-year scholarship, and had sung all of her life and still sings.
Speaker 2: Who was your first child?  Give me her name and where is she today?  What's she doing?
Speaker 1: Karen Lavonne Brooks [Karen Brooks].  She is living out in Chantilly, Virginia, and she is a, a mother of three, and spends her time raising the family now.  She was a systems engineer for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] during her working life. She probably'll go back to work again sometime shortly.
Speaker 2: And then the next year you had your second child?
Speaker 1: In '57 [1957], I had Victor Allen Brooks [Victor Brooks], and he is an urban park ranger here in, in Washington, D.C. right now.  He's single at this time. The third child was Eric Wayne Brooks [Eric Brooks], and Eric is a systems engineer right now, working for the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve System] in the District of Columbia, and my last child was Mark Anthony Brooks [Mark Brooks], my youngest, who died in 19- 1998.  He was a contract administrator and a contract manager for a firm out in Ca- Corona, California before he died.
Story_ID: 392898
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a family, you're coming out of Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio] looking--working at the post office; that lasted about a year, maybe less.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was next in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a, a brief (laughter) jo- a brief job as a, a pharmacist assistant; I thought maybe I'm--finally I'm gonna get close to--
Speaker 1: Science?
Speaker 2: --science and biology.  This was a government job--pharmacist assistant at the VA hospital [Dayton VA Medical Center] in Dayton, Ohio.  So I jumped on it; took the exam and aced it and ran up to the VA hospital (laughter).  The pharmacist--I wanted to find out my duties the first day, and the pharmacist gave me a pail and a mop (laughter), and he said, "After we get things dirty here during the day, I want you to rinse down all these beakers and things and then mop the floor," (laughter).  Well, I, I quit that job the first day, and after that I was trying to get into the [U.S.] military.  I'd gone through ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Miami and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], [U.S.] Army ROTC at Howard.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you about Howard ROTC.  You did participate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went through Army ROTC at Howard--
Speaker 1: Howard, okay.
Speaker 2: --but when I transferred to Miami, they didn't have Army ROTC, they had Air Force [U.S. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps] and Navy [Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps].  I picked out Air Force and fortunately, I'm glad I did.  So I went through Air Force ROTC, but that was the end of the Korean War; it ended right there--well, right in there, and they didn't need the, the number of second lieutenants that they had been producing through ROTC and academies, and what have you, so they didn't call me in as I expected to be called in right after graduation; they didn't call me in.  So I sat around in the post office for most of the year, and then finally they did call me into the [U.S.] Air Force. And my first assignment was to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to an air reserve flying center.  On the orders that I received, it said 2253rd ARFC [2253rd Air Base Group]--I abbreviated it--860 (unclear) Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  So I flew to Pittsburgh and caught a taxi to this location, and the taxi driver dropped me out in front of Tutti's Bar and Grill [ph.].  I said, "No, I'm going to the Air Force."  He said, "I see Air Force guys down here all the time (unclear); there's one now."  (Laughter) So, sure enough, I went into this bar and grill and the guy behind the cash register was Tutti [ph.], and he explained to me that he had a front end to this old milk barn, but it used to be a dairy barn, and they converted the front end of it to a bar and the restaurant, and he said, "You can part those beads, hanging beads back there in the back of the restaurant, and take a left, you'll be in the Air Force," (laughter).  So that's what I did, went through the beads, went through a door, and I was in an air reserve flying center.  Why they would send a new lieutenant, with no experience, to a place like that--this was the dregs of the Air Force, believe me.  I spent five years with this outfit--my first five years.
Speaker 1: Five years?
Speaker 2: Five years.  I (laughter), we were training reserves.  They were flying C-119 Flying Boxcars, and the administrative part was right there in the, in the middle of Pittsburgh, and they flew out of Greater Pittsburgh Airport [Pittsburgh International Airport], out of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, which is about twenty miles away.  But I was initially the tr- assistant training officer, knew nothing about training, knew nothing about flying boxcars or the Air Force, for that matter.  And my second job was as the adjutant, and that was administrative duties, and I became more familiar with that, and did that pretty well, but it was a terrible first job (laughter), and I was ready to get out of the Air Force at the end of that period (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your family was there with you when you were there in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: Family was there with me, yes--first in Pittsburgh, living up in (unclear), which was right above--which was above the Liberty Tubes, or Liberty Tunnel there.
Speaker 1: Was--they weren't on the base then?
Speaker 2: No, no base; wasn't a base there.  Well, there was a base; it was a small reserve base, as I mentioned, out at Coraopolis.  We did move out there after I spent three years in town, then we moved to Coraopolis and we did move into a house off-base, and I worked as--I was selected to be the base personnel officer out there at the, the Greater Pittsburgh Airport.
Story_ID: 392899
Speaker 1: So you said you were there five years.  What came next?
Speaker 2: After that I--as I said, I was thinking about getting out; starting to get out of the [U.S.] Air Force and go do something for real.  But my commander there was a colonel, Fancher [ph.], decided that--Colonel Ferwick [ph.], I'm sorry, he arranged for me to get an overseas assignment.  He thought he could keep me in, in the [U.S.] military; he kind of took a shine to me, and I got an assignment to the Republic of the Philippines as a detachment commander at a radar site which was up in the northern part of Luzon in the Philippines, and I could have turned it down and resigned from the Air Force at that period, but I said, what the heck, let's--'cause I could take my family with me and live over there with my family, so I said, this is a pretty good opportunity, so I, I took that assignment.  And turned out that that assignment, plus the next one, turned me around, and I got to actually like what I was doing in the Air Force, it was a lot of challenge.  As a detachment commander of this radar site, I had responsibilities over the personnel and the facilities there, so it was a responsible job that taught me a lot about leadership.
Speaker 1: What came next?
Speaker 2: After that, my wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] was about to have our fourth child, Mark [Mark Brooks], and so we--I petitioned the commander to move to Clark Air Base [Philippines], which was the large installation on Luzon [Luzon Island, Philippines], and they moved me down there with my family and I moved on, on base, had base housing, and became a division chief in the personnel office for headquarters, 13th Air Force.
Speaker 1: What rank did you have at this point?
Speaker 2: At that point, I was a captain--a lieutenant, then a captain; I think I made captain there. And that was a, a good job; enjoyed that.  I decided, at that time, to accept a regular commission in the Air Force.  I was offered a regular commission then became a regular officer at that time, so I stayed in.
Story_ID: 392900
Speaker 1: After that, I applied for missile duty (laughter), coming out of the Philippines.  People don't normally apply for missile duty; it's not glamorous duty, sitting down a silo in the Great Plains of the United States.  But I thought that if I was gonna stay in the [U.S.] Air Force, I needed an operational specialty; I couldn't fly--my, my eyes were not good enough.  I tried at least three times to pass the eye exam for pilot training, but I couldn't pass.  Tried every ruse I could think of to get through there, and just couldn't, couldn't make it.  So I sa- missiles were the next big operational opportunity for officers who wanted to succeed in the Air Force, so I applied for Atlas training, the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM], and strangely enough, I was turned down for that; I didn't understand why.  I had a great record up to that point, but I did have friends in high places.  The general who was commander of 13th Air Force and the colonel I worked for both interceded with the higher headquarters and said, "Take this guy or he's gonna get out of the Air Force on us, and send him to missile training," which they did.  And I went to missile training at Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska, and I spent five years there.
Speaker 2: Now, tell me about that training.  What were, what were you involved in learning how to do?  And what was the progression?
Speaker 1: It was a very intense five weeks there.  For me, it was learning a new--what computers were all about; I didn't know anything about computers, so I had to learn what a computer was, the innards of it, how it worked, the Ps and the Os, and transistors and all the rest of that, so I learned communications.  Had to learn rocketry--how you make a, a rocket that boost these warheads--all about the nozzles and the aerodynamics of it and what have you--about the guidance system, about gyros and about spatial alignment for gyros, and those kinds of things, so it was a very intense course of five weeks, and I had to leave my, my family in, in Lincoln, Nebraska.  I got home once or twice during that period.  We lived in a--my wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] called it a haunted house there; it was the only house we could get (laughter) in Lincoln, Nebraska.  Unfortunately, it was an old--creaky, old frame house.  But I left them there and--unhappily.  They didn't like it.  Then, came back to Lincoln and, after some on-the-job training, went on alert as a strategic air command--a deputy missile combat crew commander, so I was a number two guy on a five-man crew.  I had a crew commander which normally was a major, a lieutenant colonel, or, in a few cases, a captain.  And the deputy crew commander was either a captain or a lieutenant.  So I was a deputy commander initially, working for a major, and then after a couple of years, I was upgraded; I became the first crew member to be upgraded to crew commander as a captain.  I had my own crew.  We did very well; we became an instructor crew to--teaching, teaching the other crews the ins and outs of the system, and won a few awards as being the top crew in the squadron there.
Story_ID: 392290
Speaker 1: Why don't you continue the progression--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --through the various positions, and give us kind of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the end of five years at Lincoln, Nebraska [at Lincoln Air Force Base], we, we retired the Atlas F missile [SM-65F Atlas] and closed down that, that, that wing there.  Coincidentally, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] was looking for some help in the management of their systems; they had grown from a relatively small cadre down at Langley, Virginia, and they were--they had envisioned the, the Gemini [Project Gemini] and Apollo programs [Project Apollo]--had those on the drawing board at the time, so they had some excellent engineers and scientists, but they didn't have any good managers.  Oh, they had some good managers, of course, but they needed help in the management area, so they came to the [U.S.] Air Force for some experienced managers.  They interviewed thousands of us (laughter), and selected 128 Air Force officers to go to the various NASA sites, primarily the Manned Spacecraft Center [Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center] at Houston [Texas], and the Kennedy Spacecraft Center [John F. Kennedy Space Center] down at Cape Canaveral [Cape Kennedy Air Force Station; Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral, Florida], and Huntsville [Alabama] is the other place where they, where they test the rocket engines.  I went to Houston and became a flight control technologist in the flight control division, working for Chris Kraft [Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.] down there; started off with the, the Gemini program, which was the two- two-person capsule, which launched, coincidentally, on a Titan missile, which I'd worked with in the Air Force, and then I transitioned to the Apollo program, which was the three-person capsule, and that launched on the, the huge Saturn V missile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I worked in the flight control, as I said, preparing the documentation for the flight controllers to use on the, the missions.  These were the orbital missions around the, the earth, and we were using remote sites for command control of the, the capsules, once they, once they had gone into orbit.  That was a fabulous assignment, of course, and I, I sort of helped to lay the groundwork for, for the moon missions that came along after I'd left there, but I got--I was there through Apollo 6 I think it was when I left there.  Apollo 11 was a year or so down the road.

Speaker 1: What came next?
Speaker 2: After that, I was selected for--oh, I, I was selected for the [U.S.] Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory program as a flight controller, which was essentially the same kind of thing I was doing at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  The Air Force was gonna launch [U.S.] military people into orbit into what's called a Manned Orbiting Laboratory.  I went out to California, picked out a house and everything else, had a assign- had orders to go there, then they cancelled that thing after about a year, and I never got to work in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory business; they cancelled the whole program.  As it turned out, I went to the Headquarters Air Force, a military personnel center at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas [Universal City, Texas], and became the assignments officer for all the scientific and technical pers- officers in the Air Force.  This was a, a good assignment; I got a chance to learn a little bit about all of the, the specialties in the Air Force. Spent four years there, I left there and was selected for the Industrial College of the Armed Forces [Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy] in Washington, D.C., Fort McNair [Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C.]; that was a, a graduate-level program that the Air Force conducts.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the program there, program of study and where--what--that was an important turning point, was it not--
Speaker 2: It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in your training and your development?
Speaker 2: I said the Air Force, and that's the [U.S.] Department of Defense conducts that, that school; it's right there, side by side with the National War College [Washington, D.C.], and these are equivalent level schools.  The Industrial College of the Armed Forces, as the name implies, dealt with the industrial side of the Air Force, or procurement, acquisition of weapon systems, things of that nature.  So we, we went to Italy to look at a gun maker over there, an auto-maker over there, we went to California to study under ARCO [Atlantic Richfield Company], the oil company, conglomerate.  We also had a companion program with George Washington University [The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] where these courses, plus some others that I took, were counted toward my master's degree, so I got a Master of Science degree while I was there.  It was quite an intensive year--ten months actually of, of academic training there at Fort McNair in Washington.
Speaker 1: And where was your family during this time?
Speaker 2: They were--we were living in Hillcrest Heights in Maryland, outside of Washington.
Story_ID: 392292
Speaker 1: So, after that nine month industrial college [Industrial College of the Armed Forces; Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy, Washington, D.C.], what was the next assignment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I was selected to go to the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] for the first time.  That time, I went to work for the undersecretary of the [U.S.] Air Force, who was also the director of the National Reconnaissance Office [Chantilly, Virginia], which is the office that oversees all of the satellite programs that do reconnaissance, and I became the executive officer, the number--working directly for the, the director of National Reconnaissance Office. Did that for about a year, maybe two years, and I was fortunate enough to impress the undersecretary of the Air Force in my interfaces with him, and he recommended me to Jim Schlesinger--James Schlesinger [James R. Schlesinger], who was the secretary of defense, to come to his office to work as a military assistant.  So, I was selected to, to become a military assistant to James Schlesinger's special assistant, Tom Latimer [Thomas K. Latimer], and Latimer had all of the interfaces with the White House, presidential travel, all of the intelligence aspects of the services for the secretary of defense he worked with, and I, I was an action officer for him.
Speaker 1: Who is president now?  (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: That was under Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: Nixon, okay.
Speaker 2: This was the last year of Nixon's (laughter) reign, and of course Nixon was impeached and he left office and Schlesinger left office at the same time.
Speaker 1: And who followed Schlesinger?
Speaker 2: Schlesinger was followed by Donald Rumsfeld the first time.
Speaker 1: And so you--?
Speaker 2: And I was not the Air Force selectee to be interviewed for military assistant for Rumsfeld when he came in, but because I was recommended by Schlesinger--by undersecretary of the Air Force, and secretary of the Air Force, I came in the back door, so the Air Force had nominated their fair-haired guy and I came in the back door and I was hired as one of the two military assistants for Rumsfeld.  So I, I spent a little over a year as his military assistant and he was, of course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what did that work involve specifically?
Speaker 2: --working for, for Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.].
Speaker 1: What did that, what did that entail, specifically?
Speaker 2: I was the, the doorkeeper for the secretary of defense in a lot of cases; myself and, and his principal executive assistant, we sort of decided who had access to the secretary and when. I was the final reviewer of correspondence for the secretary's signature, I was the executive, if you will, executing the secretary's directives among his staff, so the assistant secretaries, the undersecretaries; I would convey snowflakes, as you will, which is handwritten notes, or even formal notes saying he wanted this, that, and the other done, or not done; I would transmit those and interpret those for the, for the staff.
Speaker 1: What was it like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I also interfaced with the White House.
Speaker 1: --what was it like working--what was it like working for him, and how do you remember him?
Speaker 2: I remember him pretty much as he is now, as a tough guy--a, a dedicated patriot, I'd have to say that.  And on a personal note, we got along very well most of the time; once in a while he blew up, but he was not, not one to solicit or take a lot of advice.  He was a very knowledgeable, brilliant guy; usually had his mind made up when meetings came around, and he sort of dictated how things would go.  He would hear advice, but not al- very seldom would he follow it (laughter) was my impression.  Now that's, I might be exaggerating a little bit, but not much.
Speaker 1: Well, that's what you perceived.
Speaker 2: And--but, a, a good person personally, to work for.  He--I was invited to his home many times, invited out on the presidential yacht to entertain congressmen and senators and things like that.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) President Ford was in office at this point?
Speaker 2: Ford was, was the president, yeah, for that--little over a year.  So, it was a tough year, I'll say that.  He worked long hours, you know; he would come in 6:30, 7:00; I had to be there half hour before he got there.
Speaker 1: What time did you go home?
Speaker 2: At 9:00, 9:30 at night.  That happened at least five days a week, and on Saturdays we'd have a half day; I'd work from about eight to four [o'clock].  That was a half day work.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Then on Sundays, I would take, take paperwork to his home and pick it up--pick up what he had signed or written notes on and get it distributed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even on Sunday, huh?
Speaker 2: --to the, to the staff on Sundays if it was important.  So, a tough, a tough job (laughter); a burn-out job (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was about a year, right--you say?
Speaker 2: That was a little over a year, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 392293
Speaker 1: What was your next appointment, assignment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, then was--President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] went out, Rumsfeld [Donald Rumsfeld] went out with him, and Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] came in as president and brought Harold Brown in.  Harold Brown was one of the Whiz Kids; he and McNamara [Robert McNamara] were among the Whiz Kids, as they called them, for Jimmy Carter--a very brilliant man intellectually.  He was the only person I, I really know who is a true speed reader.  I mean I've seen demonstrations and things but I've watched him on a day and day out basis, speed read and just go through a page (gesture) page just like that, and at the same time writing marginalia--notes in the margins.  And I could take a stack of papers literally a foot high into Harold Brown and come back an hour or two later and he has gone through that entire stack and have notes on all of them.  And more than that, he could--a month later he could tell you what was on a certain page on a certain document; he was just a phenomenal brain.  He was a much easier guy to work for--a little bit reclusive, not--rather shy socially.  I can recall a, a cocktail party for senators and congressmen in his office which is a lar- a huge office in the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], and I lost track of him at some place; I was circulating around among the, the congressmen and senators, and he was at his desk working on paperwork while this cocktail party was going on (laughter).  He just wasn't a social animal at all, but a fine gentleman and one who was, was easier to work for, though he was a hard worker also.  He--at least he had it in his regimen--every evening at about 7:30, he would go to the Pentagon Athletic Center and swim for forty-five minutes. So I finally got smart and I'd go to the Pentagon Athletic Center and play basketball for forty-five minutes while he swam (laughter), and then come back and wrap it up from, you know, around 7:30 'til about 9:00--
Story_ID: 392294
Speaker 1: During these very, very busy weeks, months, years intense work, what did you do recreationally to relax and take care of--?
Speaker 2: Well, basketball was still my first love as I, as I mentioned, and fortunately, we had that Pentagon Athletic Center which was adjacent to the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], so every chance I get--I, I got, I would go over there and play pickup basketball and--
Speaker 1: But I mean with your family, what kind of things were you able to do to get away (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we--any chance we'd get--we didn't have many chances to take vacations but I, I'd try to get at least a one-week vacation during that period, and if possible, a two-week vacation at, at a stretch. Even though we were authorized a thirty days' vacation a year, I never did get thirty days (laughter).  I'd be lucky if I got twenty days or fifteen days.  But we would take trips, you know; it was the usual places--Disney World [Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida], Disneyland [Anaheim, California], museums, we liked the opera, we liked the symphony, we liked to go to museums.  Being in Washington, D.C., the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution] is just a fabulous place, and all while I was growing up, I used to walk from 1700 block T Street down to the Smithsonian, which is probably, I don't know, thirty blocks at least, I don't know--more than that, probably.  But I'd do that on any, any given day, and I spent a lot of time in the Smithsonian, and so did my family.  All of my kids were--the boys at least--were athletes in high school, in college, and so I would go to their games, go to all their activities; all of them are musicians.  My wife's [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] a musician, so all four of them, my children, took up some kind of musical instrument, mainly piano and organ.  The boys played woodwind instruments as well, and their children are all musicians as well now (laughter), so our grandchildren are musicians; I think that all came from my wife. So, music and lots of activities--we believed in keeping them busy to keep 'em outta trouble--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so (laughter).
Story_ID: 392295
Speaker 1: Your work under Harold, with Harold Brown ended, and what came next?
Speaker 2: I spent, I think--let's see, two and a half years I think--yes, two years with--no, a year and a half with Harold Brown. I left in the middle of his term as secretary.  I was, I was getting a little burn-out there at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and I solicited a field assignment to get, get my--re-blued, as they say in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Re-blued?
Speaker 2: Re-blued, yeah, you have a blue uniform and you get back into the Air Force and do something before they forget about me completely, even though I had a high level job.  If you're not in the Air Force, they forget about you and you don't, you don't get your promotions, you don't get selected for the job (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your rank at this point then?
Speaker 2: I, I left there as a colonel, a full colonel.
Speaker 1: Full colonel?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was fortunate after that, and it probably didn't hurt that I was coming from assignment with the secretary of defense, but to be selected for vice commander, the number two guy at a missile wing in Strategic Air Command, so I, I got the Titan II wing [381st Strategic Missile Wing] at Lincoln--at McConnell Air Force Base, Wichita, Kansas, and we went through an unfortunate event after--I think it was about six weeks after I was there, we had a catastrophic accident with a missile at Rock, Kansas; the missile blew up, and two enlisted personnel lost their lives trying to repair the, the leak; it was massive leak of oxidizer in the bottom of the silo, and they tried to unplug a poppet valve by sticking their fist in, in that valve--massive, huge valve, to try to un- make it pop back into place.  There was an O-ring that had flushed down through the system and stuck in that valve but kept it propped open partially, and all of that oxidizer just spilled into the bottom of the silo; this was nitrogen tetroxide, which is a very corrosive toxic chemical.  When it boils off, becomes a nitrous oxide, and then nitric acid; if you inhale it in your lungs, it becomes nitric acid in your lungs.  So, even though they had protective clothing, they had some rips in their clothing and unfortunately, two of them lost their lives trying to repair this thing before we evacuated them out of the silo.  I was the vice commander during that time.  The way the Strategic Air Command operated there, if something happened--something catastrophic happened on your watch, you were fired (laughter).  So, unfortunately, the commander, the wing commander, was fired after about six months, and I was elevated to be wing commander prematurely; normally, I would have spent about eighteen months at least as a vice commander learning the ropes. As it turned out, it was six months, and I became the commander of the wing.  So, as you can imagine, we had a wing that had a record of poor maintenance, poor safety, and a ma- catastrophic accident and a couple of lives lost, so I had to take over that environment and try to turn it around; that was my challenge (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: Big challenge, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) fortunately I was, I was up to it. We--after two years of command there, we had become--we had won the, the, the Blanchard Trophy, which is a--sig- signifies best missile wing in Strategic Air Command. This was a competitive event; it's held every year, and we won that.  We were selected as the--got the Air Force Safety Award, got the Strategic Air Command missile maintenance award for the best maintenance office.  We did well--after that.  So, that was why I was promoted (laughter) I presume, to brigadier general at the--toward the end of that assignment.
Story_ID: 392296
Speaker 1: And what was next?  You now have--
Speaker 2: From there [McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas], it was back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], to the Pentagon again.  I went back as the director of international negotiations in the Joint Staff, that's the organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. My first assignment there was--I was appointed by the president [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] as a deputy commissioner of the US-USSR Standing Consultative Commission, and this is a, a small group of Americans and Soviets who would meet in, in Geneva, Switzerland to arbitrate alleged violations of the ABM Treaty, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
Speaker 1: What was that treaty?
Speaker 2: Was the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which was part of the SALT I treaty, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talk treaty [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks].  The ABM Treaty, which is probably one of the, the finer treaties and more, more originally adhered to treaties that the United States has been engaged in, was to make sure that no one was doing anything in the intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM] area that would violate the terms of the SALT treaty.  And we had chances to call the Soviets' hand on a couple of things during that period of time.  But I got a chance to negotiate face to face with who I think was a KGB agent, who was their number two guy, so the number two guys would kind of discourse and the number one guys would discourse; I would--I worked for--strangely enough, the four-star general, retired, Richard Ellis [Richard H. Ellis] became the commissioner of that commission after he retired from Strategic Air Command as a commander-in-chief, and then I was--I became his deputy there, so he had a Soviet general who was his counterpart, and that was a very interesting time, of course we worked through translators and what have you.
Story_ID: 392297
Speaker 1: The work of a director in the arm control negotiations was one of the highlights of your career (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it certainly was.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I--when I think of my career, I think of three pieces.  I think of the time when I was a warrior, a cold warrior, and the Cold War was essentially 1945, the end of the Second World War [World War II, WWII], through 1990, when the Soviet Union folded--it was caput.  During that period, it was Strategic Air Command, and those bombers and missiles that were the--was the counterforce to the Soviet Strategic Forces [Strategic Missile Troops].  And it was by virtue of our strength in the United States that the Soviets didn't, didn't put missiles--intercontinental missiles into Cuba; that was the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I was sitting in a silo during the Cuban Missile Crisis for forty-eight hours there (laughter) with my hand on the, on the trigger, ready to go if President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] said so, if the, if the Soviets hadn't turned around and taken those missiles out of Cuba.  Well, fortunately, that happened.  But in any event, I look at that part of my career as a, as the warrior part.  Then, the second part was as an arms controller, an arms reducer.  Because strangely enough, the [U.S.] military, during the period I was there in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I took a lead role in urging the reduction of nuclear weapons, and we had tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, so did the Soviets.  And we felt that certainly no more than 5,000 nuclear weapons was more than adequate for deterrence against any adversary we could envision in the future, so we were working toward that goal, bringing it down to 5,000; now, they're trying to get down to 1200, in the latest round of, of talks.  But I was involved in every arms control negotiation and agreement that we were involved in--the Law of the Sea [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea], the CSCE, the Conference on Security in Europe [Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe], MBFR [Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions], which is the Mutual and Balanced Forces something (laughter) in Europe.  But this was--all of these were essentially with the Soviet Union was a major player on the other side, and we had, of course, negotiators.  Principal negotiators would go to the different pla- mainly, Geneva, Switzerland, but also some other places--the UN [United Nations] and Mons, Belgium, places like that, to negotiate these agreements.  I'm very pleased to say that the, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty] that we engaged in with the Soviets and both sides agreed to, that the principal elements of that agreement, I believe, were, were advocated by my office and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and, of course, we had to go through an interagency process--CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], the National Security Council staff, the civilian side of [U.S.] Department of Defense, which didn't always agree with the [U.S.] military side, but we had some pretty strong conservatives on that side--Richard Perle , Freddie Clay, and some others--the state department [U.S. Department of State], the Arms Control Disarmament Agency [U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]--all of these would get together in interagency groups at the same level, and I was sort of at the, the number two level down in the, in the government negotiating all of these things.  Very challenging, very interesting.  Then, just to wrap it up, the latter part of my career was with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], and this was the peaceful uses of space--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I made the full transition there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so this brings you almost about thirty years now.  We're talking about mid-'80s [1980s] at this point, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes it does, yes it does.
Story_ID: 392298
Speaker 1: When did you retire?
Speaker 2: After leaving the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I had one more assignment in the office of the secretary of defense; this time, I think I had the longest title in the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], I was the assistant deputy under-secretary of defense for research and engineering, strategic and nuclear--strategic and theater nuclear forces--that was one title.  And anytime they put (laughter) assistant, deputy, and under as a qualifier before you get to the title, you know you're pretty well (laughter) pretty well down the, down the pipe, you know, on that one. That, that job--not a bad job, but I spent my last years in that job and decided to move on, and retired from the [U.S.] Air Force after thirty years.
Speaker 1: But, however, in 1994, you became the deputy associate administrator of NASA's [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Office of Space Communication [Space Communications and Navigation].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you had a period of time here, though, approximately ten years, nine years of quote retirement.  What did you do during that period of time?
Speaker 2: Immediately after I retired, was another period that I, for whatever reason, I had difficulty finding suitable employment; part of this was being picky.  Certain types of jobs, especially trading on my, my previous association with politicians in the secretary of defense's office, or the general offices there.  Of course, there were lots of jobs that they just sort of stepped into in civilian life after they came out.  I didn't wanna do that, I didn't wanna study war anymore after I got out, so I decided to go into other areas.  I--initially, I went into the high tech business teaching some of the entrepreneurs in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] how to do business with the [U.S.] Department of Defense--how to sell their computers, computer systems, and what have you, and primarily worked with what's called Techworld in Washington [D.C.] now, having them set up that organization, give them interfaces in the government to deal with, and that kind of thing.  I did that for a while, and then it was sort of fortuitous that I got a job in London [England] working for some Saudis.  They wanted to set up a branch of their investment banking firm in London, so--guess it'll be a long story--but I, I got picked for that and, with no experience in investment banking, went to London, picked out an office after spending a lot of time walking the streets of London looking at offices--I picked an office site right on Hyde Park [London, England], outfitted that office; they gave me carte blanche to spend whatever I needed to on the office furnishings so I bought (unclear) furnishing--(unclear) furnishings from Italy, Austrian chandeliers, a Persian rug, the whole, whole bit and so--carte blanche.  Beautiful office there, and also hired the initial staff.  We had a staff of about six people, plus drivers and chefs, and that kind of thing.  But we, we did investment banking of a sorts; it wasn't a traditional investment banking.  We did a lot of handling the, the resources of, of these rich Saudis (laughter)--buying estates around the world; I, I, I bought three of them in London for them to visit once in a while--one in Marbella, Spain; another one in Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California--they had, they had estates all over the world.  There was a lot of commercial real estate that we did--buying of hotels, banks, those kinds of things, oil companies.  And that was mostly--I, I mean we did a little securities work, but that was just of another branch off from me; I didn't do too much of that myself in securities, but that was extremely interesting period.  I did that for about three years in London, then came back.
Story_ID: 392299
Speaker 1: Decided I wanted to come back to United States--missed my family and my grandkids.
Speaker 2: I was gonna say, your family didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they didn't go to London [England]?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, my wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's right, your children are older (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We had a flat, had a flat a half-block off of Kensington Palace [London, England] there--beautiful (laughter).  Came back, and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] had tried to hire me when I got out of the [U.S.] Air Force, it was one of the jobs I had turned down.  But I decided that wasn't so bad (laughter), maybe I'd wanna go to, to NASA, so coming back they said that they'd pay my transportation back, and wanted me to come back to the headquarters [NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.] to, to be the deputy associate administrator for management, initial job.  Well, my initial job actually was special projects for the administrator; I came in and was a trouble shooter for the administrator of NASA.  Then I became the deputy assistant administra- deputy associate administrator for management, and that had cats and dogs--security, logistics, transportation, aircraft, IT, information technology--little bit of everything in that job, and we were responsible for all of NASA.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: After staying in that job for a while, then I moved--my last job at NASA was deputy associate administrator for space communications.
Story_ID: 392901
Speaker 1: What were your responsibilities and what roles did you play in the NASA's [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Office of Space Communications [Space Communications and Navigation]?
Speaker 2: There, we were responsible for all of the communications throughout NASA--all of its centers, its nine centers and the headquarters.  We supported every mission that NASA had, had whether it was an aircraft mission--well, half of NASA is of course aircraft--research and development testing, and the other, other part is the space mission.  So, the space missions we had to operate the worldwide Deep Space Network, which had these large eight-five foot antennas that were, some of them in Goldstone, California [Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, California], we've got some in Spain, and some in Australia, and they focus on deep space; they're able to talk to the spacecraft and receive data back from the spacecraft, and we have to transmit that in and capture it in computers and, and on tapes and disks.  And then, of course, is the administrative communications--the telephones, the--your PCs [personal computers] and what have you that--we're responsible for those as well throughout NASA, and tying those networks together so we'd make sure that it is a network of being able to transmit through certain nodes out in the field--might be halfway around the world, through a spacecraft, and relay information between spacecraft in space.  We have communication spacecraft up there stationed in orbit around the earth, and we relay information from the mission aircraft- the mission spacecraft through those tracking and data relay satellites back to the earth, and we're able to go both ways--commands up, and data coming back down.  That was essentially it, and we--every mission, of course, we were integral in part--in the planning for every mission because we had to do the communications and the command and control part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many missions did you, did you service in--during the time--
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't count the ones at the headquarters; went through lots of science missions.  A lot of missions the public doesn't even hear about, you know--
Speaker 1: That you don't hear about--we don't know about.
Speaker 2: --which are great missions by the way--these science missions that they send out to find out all kinds of interesting things, but they're just not the big spectacular (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Some of it was zoological, are they not?
Speaker 2: That's true; in fact, I worked on one mission that--I was working with an Italian scientist when I was in the [U.S.] Air Force working at Johnson Space Center [Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas].  The, the experiment was the--a frog's inner-ear, and how, how weightlessness affected a frog in space.  So, I worked with this Italian scientist to, to set up that entire experiment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So zoology, zoology came back.
Speaker 2: Zoology finally came (laughter) into play, yeah, right.  That sort of wraps up the, the, the space systems.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in this work at NASA?
Speaker 2: I stayed--I, I spent about three years down at the Johnson Center, down in Houston [Texas] and--while I was in the Air Force, then after I retired, I spent about another six and a half years at NASA Headquarters here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 392902
Speaker 1: Throughout all of your assignments, appointments, positions, what was your greatest--which one of these presented the greatest challenge?--or maybe there were several--greatest challenges for you?
Speaker 2: I had some interesting assignments, and some challenging assignments, but I guess I'd have to say that commanding the strategic missile wing [381st Strategic Missile Wing] at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas was the, the most rewarding, the most challenging, the most frustrating; all the adjectives you can think of, it was the most (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why was it the most, as you reflect back on it?
Speaker 2: Well, it started off very strangely.  When I was picked for this assignment as the vice commander to come in as the number two guy in that wing, that struck an unpopular note out there with the incumbents out there, of course.  They had a, a number two guy already; he had to be reassigned somewhere else, and they had a number of--a lot of heirs to the throne--potential heirs to the throne who thought they were gonna be next in line--the chief of operations, the chief of maintenance and those, those people, all four colonels like myself--and they expected to get this job as their next promotion as vice commander.  Well, when I got the job, they weren't too happy with me.  I got a strange phone call from the commander out there; he said, "When are you coming out here?"  And I gave him a date.  He said, "Well I wanna know is we wanna have a welcoming party for you and get it over with."  (Laughter) That was the sum substance of the, of the conversation.  I said, "Okay."  So, I, I went out there.  The welcoming party was that first evening we got out there; my, my wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] went into the officers' club and was met by an irate redhead who just was very angry, said, "Your husband has taken my husband's job, and I don't like it and he doesn't like it and we don't want you here, and we're sorry you're here."  (Laughter) That was the welcoming party.  We drove up to our house on the base there and, and we had the inhabitants of the other officer housing there standing on both sides of the road like it was a, like it was a circus parade or something, and they were watching us go by--no smiles, no nothing--watching us go by.  Then I find out later, much later, that the city fathers in Wichita [Kansas] had corresponded with the commander-in-chief of Strategic Air Command asking him not to send me out there when they found out I was African American and, you know they didn't give any good reasons or anything like that.  Somebody said, it's probably because they didn't want you to be a member of the country club 'cause the commander always got honorary membership in the country club out there, which made no (laughter)--didn't make a bit a difference to me.  I didn't wanna be a member of the country club anyhow.  But this was some opposition that--from the city fathers who were very integral in, in their support for the [U.S.] military there in, in the City of Wichita, and the senior officer on that base, which would have been the commander, was the senior military officer in the State of Kansas. So I dealt with the governor, the congressmen, senators, and what have you.  So, anyhow, after a couple of years and we turned things around, I also made friends with the, the civilian fathers, got rid of some of the malcontents there in the military who didn't wanna work for me or with me, and helped them to get a job somewhere else, and got some guys in who were gonna be on my team, and we, we turned the thing around.
Story_ID: 392903
Speaker 1: So, that was, that was the challenging part.  Plus, that accident--we still had the aftermath of the accident.  We had all of the congressional (unclear) over there--Senator Dole [Bob Dole], Senator Kassebaum [Nancy Kassebaum] stayed at my base [McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas].  Congressman, oh, Glickman, Dan Glickman, he was the congressman for Wichita [Kansas], and he was making his name by following up on this accident was there and, everything was--the, the tenor was that the Titan II missiles [LGM-25C Titan II] are unsafe because they're leaking.  But they were leaking, but you--we're talking about little crystals on the outside of the skin of the missile, so I had to get that turned around, too.  And then we had an investigative reporter for The Wichita Eagle there who decided he was gonna make the, the, the Titan missile his, his reputation maker, and he was always accusing us of one thing or another and interviewing some disgruntled airman who had some weird story about what was going on at the base.  So, all those challenges we had to go through and we survived 'em all (laughter) satisfactorily.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was there another major challenge?  Was there another one that comes to mind?
Speaker 1: Oh--yeah, the arms control thing was certainly a challenge.  Just getting those--because it was dealing with some--often dealing with an adversary right there in the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] on the civilian side of the [U.S.] Department of Defense, which wasn't good.  We agreed on most things, but some things we didn't agree on, so I don't think they were too happy with me or the (laughter) or our, our product.
Story_ID: 392904
Speaker 1: I think we're coming down to what we call wrap up questions--
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with The HistoryMakers interview, and the first question is, is there anything else you would like to add to this interview that I've not asked you about that we haven't had time to discuss?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I, I may have mentioned that my family is a, a family of educators.  Most of my sisters and brothers were school teachers, school administrators.  I've got a cousin who's the tenured professor at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now.  I've got
Speaker 1: Who is that?
Speaker 2: That's Evelyn Higginbotham--[HistoryMaker] Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham. She's the widow of Leon Higginbotham, Judge Higginbotham [A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.].  Another niece who taught at the, at the D.C. teach- University of District of Columbia [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], aunts and uncles, and my, on my grandfather's side, his siblings, most of them were, were school teachers as well, so it's just each generation.  Also, that we had a--not only a tradition at Dunbar High School [Preparatory High School for Colored Youth; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] ever since about 1882, everybody coming through Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C., but also Howard University [Washington, D.C.], in Miner Teachers College [University of the District of Columbia] in Washington, D.C.  My father [Warren Brooks, Sr.] went to--well, my [paternal] grandfather, Walter Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks], went through theology school at, at Howard University divinity school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.].  My father graduated from Howard, he had sisters and brothers who graduated from Howard, their children graduated from Howard, I went to Howard, my daughter [Karen Brooks] graduated from there, a son attended there, so, we have a long history of, of Howard University students.  What else?  My aunt was--Aunt Julia E. Brooks was a teacher at the old M Street High School [Washington, D.C.], the predecessor of Dunbar, and then the assistant principal of Dunbar High School for twenty-six years until she died in 1948.  She was a renown disciplinarian down there; she probably--I--she--I don't even think she'd have the energy to roll over in her grave if she saw what's going on schools today, but she was--used to have a ruler, and we had dances there in the armory of the school, it was on the lower floor.  It was a big open area, and we kept our rifles for the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in that armory.  Well, we'd have our, our dances there--the proms and things; she would go around with a ruler and make sure everybody danced one foot apart, so she had that reputation.  She also had a reputation of going into the Howard Theatre in Washington and emptying it of Dunbar students who had cut school to go to a matinee on a Friday to go see somebody like Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], or Count Basie, or whatever (laughter) who all came to the Howard Theatre.  So we all, all had to get to a matinee at some point at Howard Theatre.
Story_ID: 392905
Speaker 1: Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.] no longer exists.  The building--is the building s- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The old building is not there; they tried to save the facade, but it didn't work, so now--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a big campaign of alumni to, to work on that.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah, Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] and a whole bunch of others who, who were alumni from there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do you remember Hayden Johnson [John Hayden Johnson]?
Speaker 2: I remember that name, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was one of the persons (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --who fought to keep that up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a distant cousin--not really distant, but--
Speaker 2: All right, all right.  And now they're on New Jersey Avenue, which is sort of on the back end of where the, the ball field was--the athletic field, the new school, which I think is a monstrosity architecturally, but they are coming along.  It's now a, a, a neighborhood school; it doesn't--it's not a magnet school, and they have their problems but they're also doing very well, and I'm on the board of directors of the Federation [Dunbar Alumni Federation, Inc.], which--Alumni Federation, which is--we're trying to increase the scholarships and financial aid to graduates there and help the school along as best we can.
Story_ID: 392906
Speaker 1: What other organizations are you currently very active in besides the one you just mentioned?
Speaker 2: That, the Dunbar Alumni Federation [Dunbar Alumni Federation, Inc.], I'm active in.  I'm very active in my church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], only now it's on 16th Street.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: They moved in 1975 from 19th [Street] and I [Street].  I'm--have been a trustee for years down there.  I was chairman of the trustee board for quite a while; right now, I'm the vice chairman of the trustee board.  Senior usher board--I was president of the senior usher board for a while.  Was on the committee to select a new pastor, which we did eight, nine years ago now.  Ran the budget committee down there for quite a few years, so I've been very active in church work at the, at the church.  I've been a mentor and a member of the board of directors of the Luke C. Moore Academy High School [Luke C. Moore High School] in Washington [D.C.], which is the only alternate--alternative high school in the D.C. public school system [District of Columbia Public Schools].  That school takes kids who've been expelled or suspended from school; if they wanna try again, and they look like they have promise, then they take them back and try to get them through high school.  They have a good record in doing that, so I work with them.  Also work with, with Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] students as well.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so you're, you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Doing a little bit of consulting here and there--
Speaker 1: --you're a teacher, too.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Story_ID: 392907
Speaker 1: Given the large number of teachers in your family over several generations, have you ever thought that you might have taken a different career path at all, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you, I admire my [paternal] grandfather so much, he was such a strong role model--Walter H. Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks]--that one time I even thought that I wanted to be a, a minister.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, I just never got the call, I guess you'd say (laughter) to, to become a minister, but he was certainly one of the stronger role models in my life.  Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was a strong role model when I used to sell Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] magazines and, and Ebony magazines when I was in, I guess, junior high school [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.]--the only place that would talk about the 99th Pursuit Squadron and the 302nd Group [302nd Fighter Squadron], all the Tuskegee [Tuskegee Airmen] people was the black media, not the white media, so that's where I learned about them, and they became role models for me, so that's, I think, where I sort of started being channeled toward the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Then, there was dentistry and, and medicine. My brother [Warren Brooks, Jr.] went into--to medicine, and I thought that I would wanna go there too, but I think finances were the biggest impediment, but beyond that I, I had other interests at the time and went, went a different direction.
Story_ID: 392908
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd still like to do during your lifetime that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Well travel.  I like to go to new places rather than the same old place all the time, so my wife [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks] and I, when we get a chance we, we travel.  I just like being a grandfather, as my wife enjoys being a grandmother and watching these--
Speaker 1: How many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: Actually, we got eight--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and just watching them come up and grow and develop and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are their ages in terms of range--they range from the
Speaker 2: They range from, let's see, the youngest is nine--that's the, my daughter's [Karen Brooks] youngest daughter, and the oldest--actually, I have a step-granddaughter.  My son Mark [Mark Brooks], who died, had a stepdaughter, and we claim her as a, as a granddaughter and she claims us too, so she's in the family; she's twenty-six now, I think--she's the oldest; otherwise, eighteen is the oldest of the grandkids.
Speaker 1: I see.  How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: I'm very happy with it.  Yeah, I can, I can think of other things I could have done but I, I certainly never--have never dwelled on that.  I have the most beautiful marriage that anyone could, could hope for--fifty-two years of wedded bliss, as they say, with a wonderful woman who has supported me every, every step of the way.  I have a wonderful family, so I just--family life means everything to me, so church first, or God first, then family, and then country; it's sort of come in that order for me.  And I love all three of them, and I've given my life to all three of them--
Story_ID: 392909
Speaker 1: What are the values that have been the, the things that you've really held onto during your lifetime?  What are the specific values that, that you've held onto?
Speaker 2: I, I've learned that integrity should be at the foundation of everything.  In fact, the [U.S.] Air Force has a, a motto; their motto is, "Integrity first, Service before self, and--," what's the last thing (unclear)--, "Excellence in everything we do," this is an Air Force motto--recent Air Force motto, but I can subscribe to that; I, I subscribe to those principles.  I think that in any relationship with people, and everything we do is a relationship with people, I don't care whether it's church, the [U.S.] military or the government, the business--whatever it is, we don't deal with things really, or we shouldn't be dealing with things, we should be dealing with people. We have to lead people; we have to follow people; we have to get things done through people.  And so leadership to me is, is, as, as an old definition says, having a willing follower t- that you can take to a place they wouldn't go on their own, and I believe that as well, but I think it has to be built on integrity first, which engenders trust, and from trust you get loyalty and respect, and those, those are sort of building blocks, I think, for any relationship, whether it's in an organization, building a coalition among agencies or companies or what have you, or just building a team of a few or many individuals, or a family.
Story_ID: 392910
Speaker 1: What message or lesson do you have for your children, your grandchildren and the children of the world?
Speaker 2: First of all, be prepared for whatever you're gonna do, and that means--to me it means education; it means higher education really.  Can't do anything much with a high school education; you can hardly do anything with a bachelor's degree anymore.  So, that's the mes- first message I wanna get across is get yourself prepared so that when the opportunity comes, and f- only a few will come in a lifetime, but when it comes, you're ready to step through the door of opportunity with your bags packed already with--ready to do the job.  You can't wait 'til opportunity comes and say, oop, I'd better go out and get a master's degree, or I better finish high school, or I better finish college.  You gotta be ready and waiting.  Might be a long wait, but when it comes, then you gotta be able to take advantage of it.  So, education to me is the key to, to success for everybody, especially for African Americans.  African Americans who would drop out of high school--oh, my goodness, it pains me--and so (laughter) I wanna see 'em get through high school at the very minimum, and then try to urge them into going to some technical training at least, or junior college or community college or, or a regular four-year academic school.
Story_ID: 392911
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the greater Washington, D.C. African American community?  When I say greater, I'm talking just about the District [District of Columbia], but all of the African Americans in, in the general area.  What are your hopes and concerns (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, in this season of elections, (laughter) that brings to mind voting, number one, and that's back up on the, the top burner as getting the District of Columbia a, a vote that counts in the [U.S.] Congress, and hopefully, at some point getting a senator to go along with it.  I think D.C. ought to have at least one, probably two, Congress persons who can vote; not just the committee, but the vote on the floor.  Eleanor Holmes Norton is, I think, a wonderful representative of D.C.  I hope she, in her career, gets a chance to vote on the floor as a, as a delegate.  D.C. has a, a rather unique black population--well-educated; more-so than most places in the country.  Economically more well-off than most places in the country.  Prince George's County [Maryland] out here where my son lives, the richest African American community in, in the country, with lots of successful people.  So, I wanna see those people bring some more people behind them, number one, to make sure they are mentoring, encouraging the ones who haven't quite made it, or are not able to make it; bring them along, and I'd like to see them have some clout in business, in the government, and to be able to get their slice of the pie, I guess you'd say.
Story_ID: 392912
Speaker 1: Last question: how do you wanna be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, it may change, but first of all, I wanna be known as a, as a good Christian man, at least, who tried to be a good Christian man even if he wasn't; we all slip once in a while.  A good family man who tried his best to, to raise a, a family, and someone who used the talents that God gave him to the best ability that he could.  Someone who left--lived a happy life and hopefully helped someone else along the way.

Speaker 1: This is a photograph of me, Elmer Brooks [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Elmer T. Brooks], at my grandfather's house in an uncharacteristically formal pose, about 1937; about five years old.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is First Lieutenant Elmer Brooks at Wallace Air Station in the Republic of the Philippines.  I was detachment commander of the radar site there, and that was about 1960.  I'm holding a baby python.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my great nephew Keith Amos, who was doing extremely well as a, as an actor in Hollywood; he was on TV and, and had some lead roles in films, as well as supporting roles.  He died about 1999, and that was taken about--right before then, about '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Good.
Speaker 1: This is Corinthia Williams [Corinthia Daniel Williams], my great-grandmother on my mother's side--my--I'm sorry, my grandmother on my mother's side.  I have no idea when that was taken; obviously, she was a relatively young woman.  I, I never knew her at all.
Speaker 2: This is me, Elmer Brooks, and my mother Lelia C. Brooks [Lelia Williams Brooks]; it was taken in our house at 1757 T Street.  I was about, I would say, eleven years old I'll say.
Speaker 1: This is the Brooks family reunion held in Washington, D.C.  We're standing in front of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.] on 16th Street Northwest, and that was the 1979 reunion, I believe.
Speaker 2: This is Colonel Elmer Brooks, commander of McConnell Air Force Base [Kansas] and the 381st Strategic Missile squadron [381st Strategic Missile Wing].  I am escorting Senator Bob Dole for a tour of the base before I give him a detail briefing on some missile leaks that we had.  That was 19- that was about 1980.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: These are my paternal great-grandparents.  On the right is Lucy Goode Brooks, and on the left is Albert Royal Brooks.  I would have to say this was the late 1800s, but I don't, I don't know the exact date.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Starting at the top left is my grandfather, the Reverend Dr. Walter H. Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks].  To his right at the top is Eva Holmes Brooks, his first wife and the mother of all of his children.  The bottom left is my mother, Lelia C. Brooks, and to her right is Warren R. Brooks [Warren Brooks, Sr.], my father.  These were taken at many different (laughter), different times, at different ages, so--let's see, my grandfather, I would say, would be in his eighties there.  That would be in the 1930s, and his wife, who died quite a ways back, was probably the early 1900s for her when that was taken; she was a young woman.  My mother, that was taken in the latter part of her life--I would say around 1945, I'm gonna say.  And then my father, that was when he was a young man; I never knew him to look like that; that was about--I'm gonna say he's in his twenties.  That's the closest I can get on that.
Story_ID: 392313
Speaker 1: This is a page out of the commemorative booklet for the second tri-annual all-class reunion of Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School], Washington, D.C.  The family has a long history of graduates at that school; they are listed at the bottom of the page, and the year they graduated.  The photograph is of Julia E. Brooks, who taught English and Spanish at the school, and then for twenty-six years was the assistant principal and dean of women there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: These are my siblings.  Elmer Brooks [HistoryMaker Brigadier General Elmer T. Brooks] on the far right, next to me is my--on the, on the left of me, is Dr. Warren R. Brooks [Warren Brooks, Jr.], then my sister Dorothy Thompson [Dorothy Brooks Thompson], another sister Julia E. Wynn [Julia Brooks Wynn], my brother William Brooks [William T. Brooks], my half-sister Thelma Amos [Thelma Brooks Amos], and my brother Walter Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks II].  This was, as I recall, 1989 family reunion.
Speaker 2: This is my immediately family.  I'm on the lower right-hand side; next to me is my wife, Kathryn C. Brooks [Kathryn Casselberry Brooks], next to her is my oldest, my daughter Karen Lavonne Brooks [Karen Brooks].  The back row, far left, is Victor Allen Brooks [Victor Brooks], then Eric Wayne Brooks [Eric Brooks] and Mark Anthony Brooks [Mark Brooks].  Mark died in 1998, and this photograph was taken about 1975 or '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: This is my wife and I, Elmer and Kathryn, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.] two years ago, 2004, at our fiftieth wedding anniversary celebration and renewal of our vows.
Speaker 2: This is the family reunion in Los Angeles, California, and that would have been in 1994; I think I said a different date before.  That's all I had to say about that one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the budding romance of Elmer Brooks and Kathryn Casselberry.  I was an [U.S.] Air Force ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] cadet, and that's the uniform I have on at Miami University of Ohio [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio], and Kathryn was a freshman, I believe, at Miami University of Ohio.  This was about 1953 at the Air Force ROTC ball.
Speaker 1: This is the conference basketball all-star team in 1949.  I am the tall, lanky one on the left center, right next to the coach who's in a suit.  Another f- a famous face there is--the third from the left is Maury Wills; we called him Sonny at the time, in high school; he had a family of athletes.  He was an all, all-sport athlete.  He went on to become a star base stealer and an all-star baseball player in the baseball league--professional baseball league [Major League Baseball].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is me in a play; I was a part of the Miami University theater group.  In this play, I was the Brutus Jones in Eugene O'Neill's 'Emperor Jones' ['The Emperor Jones'] and that's a scene.  That would have been about 1953.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is Secretary of Defense Harold Brown awarding me the Defense Meritorious Service Medal at the conclusion of my duty as his military assistant in 1978 at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: This is a scene from the Friends' Asylum for Colored Orphans [Friends' Association for Children, Richmond, Virginia], which was the original group.  Right now, it's a community center in Richmond, Virginia.  We visited this Friends organization, which was founded by my [paternal] great-grandmother, Lucy Brooks [Lucy Goode Brooks].  Her picture is the one I'm presenting to the organization down there, and we made a tour of the, of the city and the facilities; that would have been 1989.
Speaker 1: This is a group that was organized by the chief of staff of the [U.S.] Air Force.  Affectionately, they're called the gray beards.  These are people who've been associated with missiles and space in their, in their working careers.  I was one; I'm the third from the left in the back row.  One that may be recognizable to many is the man seated to the right--seated to our, our right of the lady in the middle in the red dress.  That is General Bernard Schriever, who was considered the father of intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] in the United States.
Speaker 2: This is a group that received honorary degrees and were designated and selected as distinguished alumni of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.  I was fortunate enough to receive that honor as a distinguished alumni.  I'm second from the right in the back.  Standing right--sitting in the wheelchair is James Brady, who's Ronald Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] assistant [press secretary] who got shot along with President Reagan.
Speaker 1: This is 1980 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  This is General Richard Ellis [Richard H. Ellis], the commander-in-chief of Strategic Air Command presenting the Blanchard Trophy signifying the best missile wing in Strategic Air Command to, to me.  I am receiving it on behalf of the 381st Strategic Missile Wing, McConnell Air Force Base, Texas [sic. Kansas].  We won that competition that year.
Speaker 2: This is me as a missile combat crew commander for the Atlas F missile system, and my deputy, August Mendikey [ph.], who was first lieutenant at the time.  We're sitting at a console beneath the ground in the plains of Kan- of Nebraska, and this is what our command post looked like for the Atlas F missile [SM-65F Atlas].  We're probably running a countdown on the missiles to launch it, or a simulated launch, that is.  That would have been about 1958, I wanna say.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is my official photograph as a brigadier general, about 1982 at the Pentagon.
