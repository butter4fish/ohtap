Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, January 20, 2012. I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Marcia Mitchell. This interview is being conducted as part  of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History Project. Marcia  was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 2011. Thank  you for joining us today.  Thank you, it   s nice to visit with you.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Can you tell us  where you grew up and a little bit about your early life?  Well, I grew up right here in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I   m one of those few left  that are native Tulsans. I went away to school at Drury University, but  other than that I   ve been right here in Tulsa my whole life. My parents  owned a chain of bakeries. So as I grew up, a great deal of my time was  spent in the back of a bakery. I learned a lot in the back of a bakery and  worked there in the summer times and a lot of Saturdays growing up, so  I   m very thankful to my parents because they taught me a lot through  that process.  Were your parents originally from Tulsa?  My mother was, but my father was actually a Floridian. So, he was from  the Deep South.  Okay, and growing up, you   re young, you   re a little girl. Are you  attending big schools? Small schools?  Actually, I attended just a regular elementary public school and just the  typical size. Then Horace Mann Junior High School in Tulsa and then  transferred to Edison. That was a larger school. It was a very large  graduating class.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  During this time, are you gravitating toward any subjects that you just  really like, enjoy?  Yes, especially as I got into junior high and high school, I loved speech  and drama. I also loved English. So, early on, I was kind of moving in  that direction.  And did you become a pretty good baker?  Well, no baking, but I did have kind of an interesting promotional  experience in the back of the bakery. Actually, my very first job, I was  four-years-old. My dad knew that they had a big challenge in the back of  the bakery because they have these huge room-sized ovens. They did a  lot of deliveries, so the back door was constantly sliding open and closed  to get the cakes out to the delivery truck. Of course, they couldn   t air  condition, so we had a constant challenge with flies. So, he put a fly  swatter in my hand, and he told me that he would give me a penny a fly.  And of course, that was very exciting to a four, five, and six-year-old.  So, I really got very good at it by the time I was like six or seven years  old. I was quite fast with a fly swatter. That particular little occupation  came to a screeching halt one day because I got so good at it, I actually  killed 100 flies in the course of one weekend and got a whole dollar, of  course. I was so proud of my dollar that I went to the front of the bakery  and was showing all the customers the dollar that I earned, and telling  them how I earned it. So, my dad decided that maybe it was time for me  to no longer kill flies.  From that point on, I folded boxes. I   m sure you   ve seen those big  bakery boxes. Well, they have to be creased and folded, and so I put  together bakery boxes for a number of years. Then, he decided I was old  enough to stand on a Coke crate and ice cakes. I was taught how to ice  cakes. I remember I iced many a chocolate cake. I always looked  yearningly at the decorators. I thought that would be the coolest thing in  the world, to learn to decorate cakes. Eventually, they did teach me to  decorate and I have that skill to this day, and I   m very grateful for it. Not  everybody can really decorate cakes. It   s a lot of fun. I   ve used that skill  throughout the years.  So, I got to work across from some really wonderful women and  decorate cakes. It took me one whole summer to master roses, but I  finally mastered learning how to make really pretty roses. So, I  decorated cakes, and then I went away to college. Because I went to  summer school, I chose to do a summer program. Actually, it was a  theater arts program. Each summer   I never came back home to work in  the bakery again. They actually sold the bakeries right before I got  6  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  married. That was definitely the end of my bakery career, but I learned a  great deal in the course of all that because I actually did start working at  the age of four and again, until I was tall enough to reach the top of a  table, I was standing on Coke crates. I remember that to this day. I didn   t  like it at the time. I thought I was having to work way too hard, but it  really taught me to work hard. It taught me good work ethics. Of course,  I had to be on time to work, and I couldn   t slack. It was teaching me  something very valuable, though I didn   t recognize it at the time.  Are you an only child?  No, I actually have an older sister. She   s three years older than me, and I  had a younger sister who passed away when I was just a little girl.  So, family was always very important?  Family was always important. I always think of my dad as the one that  really taught me the importance of being able to work hard. He   d had to  work hard his whole life and that was one thing he really wanted to  impart.  To  make sure that we were able to persevere and that we had  the stamina to work hard. That proved to be very valuable in the years  ahead when God called upon me to be the one to actually launch this  work. If my dad hadn   t taught me to persevere and to have a lot of  stamina, I think I would have given up many a time. But he taught me  that.  My mother taught me so much, too. They both taught me a lot about  integrity and honesty. My mother was one to want to make sure that  there was balance in my life and it wasn   t all work. So, she made sure  that I had dancing lessons and had some fun thrown in there. She also  taught me two others, probably two of my most important life lessons.  One of them was where there   s a will, there   s a way,  to  not give up.  When there is a challenging situation and it looked like there is no way,  to look again, because where there is a will, there is a way. I have just  seen that proven true time and time and time again in my lifetime. She  just had a    Do or die, this can work, you can figure this out, you can do  this,    attitude toward everything.  She also taught me to pray. Always pray. The way I learned how to  decorate cakes, my parents had had an order for a huge wedding cake,  tiered cake size, Fourth of July cake for a country club. So, all the  decorators, by the time it was delivered, Fourth of July, it was     everybody was off on vacation except the delivery guy. He was just  delivering the cake. Well, he hit a bump in the road. The cake went up,  the truck went down, and they did not meet in between well. (Laughs)  The cake was just   the decorating on it was destroyed. The cake was  7  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  still intact. He called my parents, of course, and said,    I have destroyed  this cake.    Of course, very expensive, a big order for this country club.  So, of course, my mother could not get in touch with any of the  decorators. She looked at my older sister and I and said,    Girls, today  you are going to learn to decorate.    So, she took us to the bakery and she  put decorating tubes in our hands and the whole cake practically was just  these little stars, which was the most simple thing you can do on a  decorated cake, and we did stars all day until we finished that cake, and  it was delivered to the country club. (Laughs) That   s a classic example  of    Where there   s a will, there   s a way.    Some people might have said,     We can   t get it done.    But they were also people that were really  committed to if you   ve given your word, you stay true to that. So, they  had committed to having this cake there, and the cake was paid for, and  she was going to make sure that it was delivered and it was a beautiful  cake, and it was. I   ll never forget it.  And what was the name of the bakeries?  The bakeries were Mary Lou   s Pastry Shops. I   m sure many Tulsans, if  they view this video they will remember chocolate   clairs and so many  different types of breads that they made. Fruit nut bread and salt rising  bread, but particularly the chocolate   clairs people will remember.  You decided to leave Oklahoma for college     Yes, my sister had gone to Drury University for a short time, and I had  visited her and really loved it. It was a small campus. I graduated from  Edison, so it was a huge graduating class and Drury was very small, but  I liked that idea. Very, very excited about going there and really never  had a regret.  Growing up, did you have an idea of what you wanted to become when  you got older?  When I was real little, I remember dreaming of being a missionary, and I  always envisioned myself in Africa. (Laughs) I   m not sure why, but to  me, missionaries were in Africa when I was really little. Then when I got  into my high school years, I think greatly because of my little sister, my  aspirations changed. My little sister would have been special needs and  she died when she was five and had been sick much of her life and we  adored her. My older sister and I would like dress her up and pretend she  was a doll, and we really did just adore her. She really remained in my  heart, always.  8  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Marcia   s younger sister, Kathie Louise Mobley.  As I got a little bit older and was exposed to more of the world and  what   s out there in the world that you can become, I became acutely  aware of the whole arena that could help a child with special needs. And  in particular, I was interested in speech pathology. I did my senior high  school senior paper on becoming a speech pathologist. I still have it and  got an A on it. I was so proud of that paper. Some really nice comments  from my English teacher, who I adored. She had a real influence on my  life. Then I met with a high school counselor who discouraged me from  becoming that. Right or wrong, I kind of bought into what he was  saying. He just didn   t think that was a good match for me.  So, things just kind of fell into place for me to go to Drury University,  and they didn   t even have a program in that arena. But they did have a  wonderful speech and drama department. I just felt strangely pulled into  that arena and loved that experience. We were required to be involved in  three productions a year, so it was very, very   it required a lot of  endurance because you end up studying in the wee hours of the morning  because you   re usually at rehearsals until late, late night. But I loved the  experience and had a lot of lead roles in plays the whole time I was there  and choreographed musicals, thoroughly enjoyed   I have some of the  most wonderful memories of being a drama major at Drury. Also some  of the hardest because I remember having to stay up all night studying  because I had been at rehearsals until late. I can remember saying,     After I graduate, I will never, ever again stay up late unless I absolutely  have to  I   m going to make sure that nothing mandates that I have to  stay awake at night.    (Laughs) So, to this day, I still love going to bed  early and really love being able to get a full night   s sleep.  You graduated in   ?  I graduated from high school in 1963, and I graduated from college in  1967. I actually graduated in three and a half years. I graduated in  January, but I went back for the graduation in June of    67.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Why were you trying to speed it up?  I really wasn   t intending to do that. I think that I chose being involved in  drama over the summer  rather  than being in the back of the bakery, to  be honest. (Laughs) Actually, there was a summer children   s theater arts  program that I chose to be in each of the summers and that gave me  hours. I usually would take another course along with that. To my  amazement, as I entered my senior year, I realized that though I had not  intended to do so, I had the credits to graduate in January. So, I did.  So, you   re nearing graduation. Are you thinking,    All right, I   m ready to  hit the big time,    or   ?  What am I going to do? (Laughter) Actually, I wasn   t sure what I  wanted to do. I graduated with all that I needed to become a teacher.  Speech and drama or an English teacher, and had already done my  student teaching, and loved student teaching. I just knew I loved  teaching. But I still wasn   t sure I wanted to dive into teaching  immediately. So, got home and was just kind of like the world was out  there and what was I going to do. For a very short period of time, I  considered, maybe I   d like to be a flight attendant until I realized, at that  time, I was too short. Now, that would not make a difference, but I was  too short. So, that was a very short-lived dream. When I realized I  wasn   t going to be able to do that until I could get a teaching contract, I  decided that I would wait for a teaching contract and in the meantime, I  did some substitute teaching and choreographed a musical at Memorial  High School and really enjoyed those months.  And so, you   re teaching, everything is great   what   s going on?  Well, actually, very soon after I got home from college, my dad had  some banking business that he needed to do, and he asked me to go with  him. We walked into a   actually it was a savings and loan. There was a  gentleman there that I had known as a child. His family and my family  had always been good friends. I had not seen him since I was a child,  and he looked very different. And evidently, I looked very different to  him. He saw me across the  room at  the savings and loan. Anyway,  long story short, we were reacquainted and began to date and fell in love  and were married in July of 1967.  All right.  So, we were married for about three years, and we decided we wanted to  begin our family. I knew immediately I wanted a baby girl. Everybody  said,    You shouldn   t want a boy or a girl, you should just want a normal,  10  healthy baby.    I wanted a normal healthy baby   girl. I did everything  everybody advised, like they said,    Wear a lot of pink, sing little girl  songs.    I would have done anything anybody advised me to do to  hopefully increase my chances of having a baby girl. On August 11th of  1970 at 11:59 pm, I finally heard the doctor say,    Well, it   s a girl.    I  cannot express to you what joy I felt in that moment. That moment  actually was the beginning of a whole new world for me that I had no  idea I would ever enter.  I had taught for the past three years. I retired from teaching to have our  baby girl. I just thought I would be a retired schoolteacher and now  Mommy. Twenty-four hours after she was born, the doctors came in and  said,    I guess you know, you have a special baby.    I said,    Well, of  course she   s special.    I didn   t expect everybody else in the world to  agree, but I felt like she was very special. The doctor said,    No, I don   t  think you understand. You see, she   s very special because she   s very  rare. Only one in fifty thousand babies are born like her. She has been  born with a very rare condition, which among other things, means that  she will be at best legally blind. But her vision is going to range  somewhere between less than normal and blind. You   re not going to  know where it   s going to fall for about five years, but you need to know  that now.     I didn   t hear anything else that the doctor had to say. My whole heart  and mind and being froze on one word, blind. I had never ever in a  million years imagined that this would happen. But as he continued on,  my mind raced back to a time when I was a little girl and I was sitting on  a porch step with another little girl reading to her because she was totally  blind. She was a wonderful little friend and I adored her, and I was in  awe of what she could do. One of the things that she did so well was to  play the piano beautifully by ear, and I was so intrigued with her that we  asked who her piano teacher was, and I was introduced to her piano  teacher was and began to take  lessons  from him. I was equally  fascinated with him because he could tell always whether I had the right  fingers on the right keys or if I hit a wrong note even though he too was  totally blind.  As I thought about her and I thought about him and then my mind raced  on, as this doctor was talking on and on, to a time when I was in college.  One of the plays that I wanted to audition for was The Miracle Worker,  the story of Helen Keller. So, to prepare for that role, over a period of a  month, I spent most of my time under a blindfold and with cotton in my  ears, experiencing the world of the blind and was awarded that role and  studied the life of Helen Keller in depth and what it was like to be blind.  I will never forget that experience. So, as I lay there in the hospital room  and this doctor was talking on and on about our child and that she might  11  not ever see, those were the memories that flooded my mind.  Then I also remembered my first day of teaching, discovering that I had  had a totally blind student in my classroom. So, I was remembering that  throughout my life, I had been constantly exposed to blindness, but  never imagining this. Quite honestly, what happened in that moment  was, and especially after the doctor walked out of the room and I  continued to kind of think on all of those things, all of a sudden it was  almost as though my life was a puzzle and now this piece had been put  into place. And it was as though all of that had been a preparation, but I  didn   t want that preparation. Everything within me wanted to shout,     No, no, no  I don   t want to have been prepared for this.     I cried for the next three days. I asked one question over and over and  over again and that was,    Why? Why Lord? Why have you done this to  us? How could you do this to us?    I didn   t get an answer for about three  days. Then one day, my husband was supposed to have arrived at the  hospital room and he was very late. And so, I was very curious as to why  he was very late. When he finally got there, I asked him why he was so  delayed. He had a hard time explaining. I remember he walked over by  the window and he said,    I was on my way here and I began to wonder  how we will describe this big wide world to our daughter if she cannot  see.    He said,    As I studied the world around me, wondering what words  could we possibly use that would adequately describe       he said,     Honey, it was as though God opened my eyes for the first time.    And  he said,    I looked at birds in flight and I, for the first time, noticed just  how graceful they move through the air.    He said,    I noticed clouds,  really in a way I have never paid attention to them and how every single  one is different and how the shapes and the forms are so varied.    He  said,    I noticed how white they are against the blue, blue sky.    He said,     I just saw things in a whole new way. Grass was no longer just a big  green mass, but it was trillions of tiny individual blades.    He said,    I just  couldn   t take everything in enough, and I just kept driving.     As I listened to him, I remember looking at the roses by my bedside that  someone had delivered and wondered how we would describe those to  Missy if she could not see. We had named her Missy. All of a sudden,  they became much more brilliant in color than they had been just  moments before. I believe what happened that day was that we began to  see in a whole new way. But I believe it was not so much just that, we  also began to see that this was not something that God had done to us,  but rather something God had done for us. He had allowed us to give  birth to a beautiful baby girl, who in her infancy had begun to teach us  before she could even talk. And, her life had begun to lead us closer to  God before she could even walk. We decided that day you can   t get  much more blessed than that. We had no idea what all God was going to  12  do through her.  So, we took her home and we   d asked the doctors,    What do we do?     And they said,    Well, you take her home and you love her and you just  treat her like a normal child.    So, we took her home and we loved her,  but treating her like a normal child was something else because there  were so many things we didn   t know. I knew just enough to know   I  knew just enough about blindness and about education to know that we  did not know enough to be able to provide for her the early intervention  that she needed. We knew that she was not developing as rapidly as  other babies her age. We knew that when we smiled at her, she didn   t  smile back at us. So, I began to worry a lot.  The days passed and the months passed, and I just became almost frantic  until one day I remembered something my mother had always said to  me. She had always said,    Marcia, just pray. Just pray. When you don   t  know what to do, just pray.    So, I began to pray that God would  somehow send us help because I knew how much she needed. I knew  the value of the first six years of life, that those are the most important  learning years we ever experience. I knew we were wasting valuable  time, but I did not know how to teach her. So, we prayed and very soon  after that, we learned about a place in Oklahoma City. It was the only  place that we could find. There was nothing in Tulsa that worked with  children who were visually impaired until they reached the age of six. I  knew that that was too late. I knew that there were children being placed  in classes for the mentally challenged, even though they were just blind  at the age of six. Because they were so developmentally delayed because  of their visual problem, they were misdiagnosed.  So, when we finally learned about the closest place to us being  Oklahoma City, we wrote and asked if they would be willing to help our  child and they wrote back and said,    We actually only work with deaf  blind children, but we would be willing to at least see her.    So, then for  a month I worried about the fact that Missy wasn   t deaf. I knew she  wasn   t deaf and my husband said,    My, word  If you don   t have  something to worry about, you dream something up. That   s ridiculous      And I said,    But I want them to accept her,    and I was so desperate for  help that that   s the way my mind went. Eventually, we took her over to  Oklahoma City and we were greeted there by some just wonderful  professionals, teachers, therapists, a social worker, and they greeted us  warmly.  I remember dressing Missy up in her best pink frills and lace, thinking  maybe that would influence them. After they kind of oohed and awed  over her, they said,    Why don   t you put her down,    and they instructed  me to just place her in the middle of this big room on the floor. And I  13  remember stepping back, praying,    Dear god, please don   t let her do  anything wrong.    Now, what a five-month-old baby can do wrong, I  don   t know, but I didn   t want her to do it. They just watched her. The  first thing she did was to stick her thumb in her mouth, and I remember  thinking,    Oh, don   t do that     Just as quickly as I had that thought go  through my mind, one of the teachers went over and swooped down and  picked her up and began to pat her on the back, saying,    Oh, Missy, that  is so good. That is so good      I looked at her, I   m sure so strangely, and she smiled and she said,    Oh,  you don   t realize what she   s done, do you?    I said,    I guess not.    They  said,    Oh, this is wonderful. She   s discovered her midline.    I said,    Her  midline?    I didn   t know we had a midline. They said,    Yes, she   s  discovered her midline.    I said,    What do you mean?    They said,    Well,  we have a midline, and we have an arm on the right and an arm on the  left and a leg on the right and a leg on the left, and right in the middle is  our mouth. She has discovered that midline. Do you understand how  wonderful that is? That means that she can now feed herself, and she can  do paddy cake and so many things that we do that involve our midline.  That is wonderful  You have cause to celebrate     I was so proud of that  baby.  In that moment, I learned something else wonderful and valuable. I  learned how important it is for teachers to affirm parents. I felt like we  must have done something right because that baby had done something  so good. They put us on what they called a child study center home  program. That meant that they would   they sent us back to Tulsa to  follow a specific program for her. They wrote it all out on a legal pad.  Complete, I remember, with little diagrams and they would draw little  stick figure girls, and they   d always put a bow on the top of her head.  Then we would carry out their suggestions at home. They were so  simple, but they were so profound in the impact that they had.  For example, they suggested that I carry Missy on my back as long as I  could stand each day. I thought,    What on earth is that going to do for  her?    But I remember that they asked me, one of the first questions they  asked me was,    Is she a good baby?    I said,    Oh, she   s a wonderful  baby.    They said,    Is she content to be left in the crib for long periods of  time?    I said,    Oh, yes, she is.    They said,    You need to get her out of  the crib, and you need to get her on your back.    I wondered what good  that would do until the first morning when I tried it and I put her on my  back. I remember going to the kitchen and realizing that as I opened the  oven door, she was feeling the heat from the oven door opening and  closing and the cold from a refrigerator door opening and closing. She  could smell bacon frying and hear it sizzling. She could feel my posture  changing as I bent over to make a bed. She could feel the vibration in  14  my back as I spoke. All of this just from one little suggestion.  At that moment, I realized the value of expertise being lent and  providing a child the early intervention they need when they have  special needs. So, we carried out their suggestions. They suggested that I  wore a certain kind of perfume, lots of it, all the time, so that Missy  would know if I even entered the room. Because a sighted child sees  Mommy enter the room and feels,    Oh, all is well with the world, there   s  Mommy.    But a blind child doesn   t see you, so doesn   t know that you   re  there when you   re in and out of the nursery. So, they said,    You want  her to know of your presence.    My husband was advised to wear a  certain kind of men   s cologne, same kind, lots of it, all the time, so that  she would know when he was near. Of course, our friends knew we were  coming for miles because we were always doused with that same kind of  perfume and cologne, but all of these suggestions worked wonders.  By the time Missy was one-year-old, she was functioning at a normal  developmental level to our joy and delight. All the while, I was worried  this time about another little girl. Every time I heard about her, it was a  burden because she too was visually impaired. People kept telling us  about this family and suggesting that we get together with them, but we  didn   t know them. We knew of them. We just didn   t feel comfortable  calling them even though we were in the same city. Well, little did I  know, they kept hearing about us. Every time they turned around, every  time we turned around, we would hear about each other, but we just  didn   t know each other well enough to call. We just knew that we both  had little girls who were visually impaired.  One Sunday morning, God took care of all of that. We were all ready to  go to church, and Missy and I were standing out next to the driveway,  waiting for my husband, Phil, to back the car out of the garage when all  the sudden he closed the garage door and said,    We can   t go.    I said,     What do you mean we can   t go?    He said,    The car is dead.    I said,     Well, that   s terrible. We   re all ready to go to church,    and it took a lot  to get ready to go to church with the baby. He said,    Honey, I   m sorry.  The car is dead. I don   t know why it   s dead, but it   s dead. We just can   t  go to church.    I said,    Well, why don   t we just walk?    He said,     Because it   s ten miles to church,    and I said,    No, no, no. I mean why  don   t we just walk to the little church down the street. We   ll just visit  there this morning. We   re all ready to go.    He said,    Okay, but hurry up  because if there   s two things I cannot stand, it   s to be late to church and  the other is to have to sit up in front. And if we   re late, I know we   ll end  up in front.     So, we rushed with the diaper bag and all our paraphernalia down the  street. When we got there, the parking lot was jam packed and the lobby  15  was empty, which meant only one thing. We stepped just inside the back  of the sanctuary and I was looking around, unable to spot an empty seat  anywhere when all the sudden, I realized an usher had spotted us and  was smiling broadly and motioning for us to come forward. I knew he  was already too far forward to suit my husband. He was about halfway  to the front of the church, but it was too late. People were beginning to  turn around and look. So, we began to follow this usher, and he kept  going and going and going. I thought he would never stop and he didn   t  until he reached the second row from the front of the church, where he  ushered us into, literally, the last two seats available. Those last two  seats just happened to be next to this couple. The couple with the  visually impaired little girl that by this time we had been hearing about  for over a year and a half.  Somehow, I just knew that morning that God had orchestrated our  meeting. We call it our miracle morning because we became very close  friends. Of course, immediately, we told them about the program in  Oklahoma City, and they immediately signed up and scheduled a time to  go back to Oklahoma City with us. But it was during that visit that the  professionals there explained that it wasn   t going to be enough for their  little girl, who had reached the age of two by that time. They said,    She  needs a program in Tulsa. Are you sure there is nothing there? Or you  need to move here.    There was no way that they could move. So, all the  way home, we talked about it. Then, finally, something very special  happened. I don   t really remember who said what to whom, but one of  us said to the other,    Wouldn   t it be wonderful if Tulsa could have  something like that in Oklahoma City?    And we just began to dream  about it.  By the time I reached home, we were determined to get someone to  establish a program like that. We had even begun to strategize exactly  how we would go about it. We would visit with every doctor,  administrator, director that we could get an appointment with, and we  would convince them of how vital it was to Tulsa and that Tulsa had no  such program. So, we began to set up our appointments. And you can  imagine how thrilled these CEOs and directors and administrators and  doctors were to see these two young moms in their twenties with  bouncing baby girls on their laps. Each one did see us, but each one had  the same response.    I   m sorry ladies. We just don   t have the staff.       I   m  sorry ladies. You   re right. It sounds like an important program. I   m sure  there are others in the community like yourselves that need it, but we  don   t have the space.       I   m sorry ladies. You   re right. It   s a viable  program, but we don   t have the funds,    one reason after another until I  was ready to give up. But, Sheryl, the mother of this other little girl, had  this childlike faith. I had been a Christian since I was twelve, and I had  always felt that I had a lot of faith, but this was way, way beyond  16  anything I   d ever imagined. She just had this childlike faith, and she  believed that we should just keep trying, that God would make a way.  So, we set up an appointment with one last pediatrician. I figured he was  the only one we hadn   t talked to in Tulsa. Finally, the day came, and we  sat across a big brown desk from this rather austere looking gentleman.  And by that time, we really had our routine down pat. I would talk until I  ran out of things to say and then she would pick up where I left off, and  we thought maybe we could just wear somebody down. (Laughs) So,  that day, we had our appointment, and I remember him looking over  reading glasses at us and saying,    What can I do for you?    Well, I  started in and I talked as long and as fast as I could and when I ran out of  steam, Sheryl picked up where I left off and when she ran out of steam, I  picked up where she left off. We told him about all the children that had  to be here in Tulsa and the importance of early intervention and how  desperate we were and how there needed to be something and about the  program in Oklahoma City and that he was the last and could he please  help us.  I remember there was a very long, very uncomfortable pause and finally  he said,    Ladies, it sounds to me like if you want this center, you   re just  going to have to build it yourselves.    Well, I was just outraged. I had  had it by that time. I couldn   t believe that these people were turning us  down and they had to understand that we couldn   t do anything like that.  All the way down the hallway, I expressed my irritation about this man.  All the way down the sidewalk, I expressed my irritation with this man.  In fact, we had been sitting in the car for quite some time, and I was still  expressing how angry I was with all of them for that matter when all of  the sudden, it dawned on me that Sheryl hadn   t said a word. She was  sitting there with the most angelic looking expression on her face, and  then it hit me.  I said,    Sheryl, you are not thinking what I think you   re thinking.    She  smiled sweetly, and I said,    Sheryl, we wouldn   t even know where to  begin. We wouldn   t even know how to start to begin a program like  that.    She smiled and she said three words I   ll never forget,    But God  does.    I said,    I know. I know. I   m sure that   s true. But, Sheryl, if those  doctors think it   s going to be so expensive to start a program like that, I  don   t even want to know how expensive it would be. We don   t have a  dime to begin a program like that.    She smiled and she said those three  words again,    But God does.     That was when  I came face-to-face with  a question. Did I really believe what I had always said I believed, that  God could do anything? Because I knew that we couldn   t. I was a retired  schoolteacher, she was a homemaker. I knew that we didn   t know the  first thing about starting a program like this.  17  By the time we got home, Sheryl   s faith was so strong that she had  convinced me that we should just trust God and that he would show us  the way. I   ll never forget my husband   s face when I walked into the  living room and I said to him,    Well, Honey, guess what we   re going to  do?    He said,    What?    as he looked at his newspaper. I said,    We   re  going to start a wonderful program for children with special needs, and  it   s going to be complete with medical consultants and therapeutic  equipment and specialists and teachers and         by that time, his paper  was coming down. He said,    Honey, you   ve got to be kidding. You  wouldn   t even know where to start.    I said,    I know, but God does.    He  said,    Well, that may be true, but you don   t have any money.    I said,    I  know, but God does.     So, much as you would pat a child on their head and send them on their  way to build their sand castle or whatever they   re going to do, that   s  pretty much what our husbands    response was. But like I said, Sheryl  had this incredible kind of faith. I don   t have time today to tell you what  all happened, but I can tell you that I found out the answer to my prayer  and the answer to my question. Did I really believe what I   d always said  I   d believed? I   d asked God to show me. And my prayer and question  was answered on October 3rd, 1972, when the doors to a little tiny  school, a program for visually impaired children opened its doors. It was  at Tenth and Utica. We had five children, five very dedicated volunteers,  and one teacher. We called it the Little Light House. We had raised three  thousand dollars by the grace of God that I hoped would last forever.  And of course, it did not. But that was the very beginning.  The Child Study Center agreed to kind of serve as consultants to us, and  they did. That was the beginning of a whole new world for me, a world  that I   d never imagined being thrown into. But it was at that point in  time that I began to realize a calling in my life. Sheryl was pregnant, and  so I was asked to serve as the Executive Director. We had two staff, a  teacher and myself. Forty years later I can tell you with even more  certainty the answer to my question. Yes, God can. He really can. Over  the years, we   ve served hundreds, nearly a thousand children. Now, the  children are not just visually impaired, they are children with all types of  disabling conditions. Interestingly, within the first year and a half of the  Little Light House   s  beginning , we were referred to as a model  program throughout a six-state region. So, God really had us on a fast  course. He moved us very fast and he provided every inch of the way.  We continue to rely on God and trust Him for provision, for guidance,  for encouragement, for comfort when it got rough. And there were tough  moments, but he has continued to make a way in every single situation  that we   ve faced.  Today, we sit in a beautiful twenty-two thousand square foot facility that  18  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  was tailor designed for these children. We moved into it in April of  1990. It was a 2.2 million dollar project, and we moved in debt free. The  children and the families pay no tuition. We don   t receive any  government funding, any kind of United Way funding. We are 100  percent supported by private donations. That makes it, to me, a miracle  that we continue to operate. Our budget now is about 1.7 million a year.  We never know where it   s going to come from. But in all forty years, we  have never gone a dime in debt. As I mentioned, we   ll celebrate our  fortieth anniversary next October, of 2012.  So, it   s been quite a journey. My daughter is now forty-one. She says  she will never be able to hide her age because everybody identifies her  as having been one of the inspirations for the founding of the Little Light  House. We   re very proud of her. She is an amazing young woman. She  went to Oklahoma Baptist University and then went on later and got her  master   s degree. She does grant writing for the Little Light House now  and also does our monthly publication and teaches private voice and  piano in her home.  At the age of thirty-two, she actually got a driver   s license. She is  technically legally blind, but she was fitted at Johns Hopkins Hospital  with state of the art contact lenses and they declared her able to drive.  So, now she drives, and that opened up a whole new world of  independence for her. But, I think she serves as a real inspiration to a lot  of youngsters. She has done just about everything she set her mind to.  She wanted to go snow skiing, and she went snow skiing. She went  backpacking in the Colorado Rockies, a twenty-mile hike. So, she really  hasn   t let her vision stand in her way and like I said, we   re very proud of  her. She continues to be an inspiration to me to this day.  How did you come up with the name?  Actually, an attorney called us because he was working on the legal  papers. We didn   t even know what a 501(c)(3) was, much less that we  would need to acquire a 501(c)(3) status. So, finally, an attorney took  pity on us and said,    You need to let me help you.    He called and said,     I need a name.    We were sitting at my dining room table and we knew  we were going to be working with blind children. At that time, it was  just going to be for the blind, and as I said, now we serve children with  all disabling conditions. But we knew in New York, there was a Light  House for the Blind. So, we thought,    Well, you know, we   re going to  be serving little children who are blind, so why not, Little Light House?     So, we chose that name. Now we see it in a whole different light. I think  it was God ordained that we named it Little Light House, but now we  see it more as a beacon, a beacon of hope for families with these  children with special needs.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  And today, how many students do you serve?  We have sixty-four children on a day-to-day basis. When we expand, we  will be able to serve more than double that amount. The sad news, right  now, is that we have over one hundred waiting to be served. That   s a  two to three year wait. And since we serve birth to six and have  continued to be an early intervention program, we   re losing half our time  with these children. So, we are very excited to be able to build this  expansion, which we pray will be not only a school for these children,  but actually these classrooms have become a classroom to our world. Let  me explain that. We   ve had delegations from over twenty-three nations  visit the Little Light House. We now have an international intern  program, where interns, individuals come from all over the world  to  train with us . We   ve had them from India, from Kazakhstan, from  Kenya, from China, from the Philippines, from Germany, really from all  over the world. They come as individuals to study. They come with their  own funding, but while they   re here, we don   t charge them for training  that they receive here. What   s really exciting about that program is then  they return to their homeland and they are able to pass those skills on.  We had one young lady that came from the Philippines, and she has now  trained over a thousand people. She has conducted seminars all over the  Philippines and typically, there is ninety to a hundred at her seminars.  She has been able to pass on what she   s learned here. Just got an email  yesterday from a young lady that is in India and she too has conducted  seminars and workshops, passing on her skills. In addition to that, when  funds are earmarked as such, we do send our professional teams into  other nations to provide training that they are not able to get there. We  conducted a four-day seminar in China as requested by the Chinese  government, conducted a four-day seminar on autism. So, we do go also  out around the world when there are earmarked funds for that because  we don   t use operating funds to accomplish that. So, we do have people  now coming from all over the world.  We also work with over eleven colleges and universities here in Tulsa.  And just over the last year alone, we   ve had over a thousand college  university students coming in to learn and study at the Little Light  House on how to work with these children. So, as I said, our classrooms  have really become a classroom to our world. We also now have a Little  Light House in Mississippi and a Little Light House in Denton, Texas,  and we call these our affiliates. They now, in fact, just yesterday, we  said goodbye to two teams who had come in for training. So, they  looked to Little Light House headquarters, which we now consider  ourselves to be, for training. So, we mentor them, we help them get  established through teaching and training. They do have to generate their  20  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  own funds for their own Little Light Houses in the other states. But we  have had families, literally, uproot from other states and move here to  get these services. So, when we had strong appeals to replicate in other  states, we finally felt that it was time to respond to that. And about six  years ago, we began the replication process. We hope to have Little  Light Houses across the nation one day, beyond Mississippi and Texas.  Wow, did you ever imagine the impact?  No. No, I really didn   t. You know, I   ve often talked about how God is so  merciful with us. When we respond to His calling, He will just  illuminate one little steppingstone at a time. Once you get on the next  one, then He will illuminate the next. So, in no way could I ever have  envisioned the end of the pathway that He had for me. Never would  have imagined that He was calling me to a life, really, that has been my  life work, of this work. But interestingly, if I go back in my story and  back to the beginning of this interview, you asked what I wanted to be  when I was in high school. I aspired to be a speech pathologist. I never  became a speech pathologist, but now I direct a staff of speech  therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, we have a  registered nurse, assistive technology specialist, a low vision specialist,  special education teachers from a wide diversification of specializations,  and a wonderful team of associates. So, He has me in the middle of the  world that I had really wanted, in the middle of the field of study that I  had wanted. I never dreamed of this.  Interestingly, as I mentioned, I majored in speech and drama. So, as I  was scrubbing floors of the first little school that we opened and  stripping walls and painting and so on, I thought,    I will never use my  speech and drama now, if this is what I   m going to be doing.    Little did I  know that I would be doing over a thousand speaking engagements over  the next years. So, I did use my speech and drama. So, probably for  those who might ever hear this interview, I would just offer this, that     this is not an original analogy, but I   ve heard of the analogy that our life  is like a tapestry. God sees the picture on the top. We kind of see all the  strings and so on, underneath, and so not always does it look like the  picture. And can we understand the picture? God has a perfect picture of  what He wants our life to be. I believe, now, with all my heart that God  orchestrated every part of my life. Even to working in the bakery. I don   t  know about the killing of flies, but I do know that in the back of the  bakery, I was taught to work hard. God knew that I would have to be  able to work hard to continue this work during times that were really  difficult.  I do believe that in the back of the bakery, I was also taught integrity. I  worked across from some ladies that didn   t have much in this world.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  When I decorated with them, I gained a real appreciation for people  from all walks of life and have that to this day. One of our most  treasured contributors to the Little Light House was a gentleman that  actually, the first time he ever visited us and presented his contribution,  presented us with a baby food jar of nickels and dimes and quarters. I  don   t have time to tell his whole story. It is in my book, Milestones and  Miracles, but we eventually learned that he lived in an old renovated  school bus and his heat was the flame from a gas stove. His bed was a  mattress thrown in this gutted school bus.  I treasured him as a friend and feel that God placed high value on his  donations. As much value as he might place on a thousand dollar gift or  a ten thousand dollar gift. Don   t get me wrong, I certainly am grateful  for all those people that have given and been used by God so graciously.  I believe we live in one of the most wonderful communities, wonderful  states and wonderful communities in the world. You know that has to be  true if this community has supported this work since 1972, and God  working through them has not allowed us ever to go a dime in debt?  That   s got to be a miracle, but it   s also got to be a wonderful community  that is obedient to God and willing to be used by God to give through  them.  Do you ever keep up with your students, post-graduation?  We do, and we love to hear from them. It   s really interesting. They   ll  just kind of stroll in from time to time. It   s very exciting to see. As I  mentioned earlier in the interview, I am a huge, huge believer in the  importance of early intervention. I was, when Missy was born, but I am  even more so now because I have seen the impact that it can have. I  know one young man that was developmentally delayed, especially in  the arena of speech. He is now working at American Airlines. We did a  wonderful follow-up story on him recently. One of our little girls with  Down syndrome was actually homecoming queen at her high school in  Dallas. She made national news on one of the major networks and they  covered her story. She is an inspiration to her whole school.  We consistently hear of remarkable stories of remarkable success of  these children. When we go out around the world, when I   ve had  opportunities to speak in other nations one of the things I like to do is to  advocate for the value of these children because as you know, as  probably most of your listeners know, there are many countries where  these children are not given an opportunity for an education and in many  cases are allowed to die. I have a real heart and a real passion to be able  to advocate for those children and to change that paradigm and help  people to see these children have incredible potential. It   s up to us to  find the keys to unlock that. I believe in the key finding process, God  22  uses these children to impact us far more than we will be able to impact  them. So, I really   I   ve seen the value of it. I   ve seen these children  become remarkable successes.  When I go out to other nations to speak, what I like to do is to share  what I call success shorts, short success stories about those who have  been faced with what would seem to some to be insurmountable  challenges and how they have overcome them. Many of the countries  where I   ve been, they   ve never heard of Helen Keller. I love to tell that  story. Talk about an amazing success story. She is it. But I also love to  tell them the story of our own daughter because in many countries, the  thought of someone legally blind driving would be out of the realm of  any kind of possibility. But I also love to share the stories of the children  who, at best, maybe all we   re able to teach them is to communicate by  nod of the head. Maybe we   re able to get them to grip a finger. I love to  share with people the worth of those children. What I wish our whole  world could do is to see these children from God   s perspective because  each one of them has tremendous value and worth.  Years ago, there was a neonatal pediatrician. At that time, there were  only like fifteen in the nation, and she was volunteering in our  classroom. So, I was quite curious to know why on earth this woman  who could earn so much per hour of her life was volunteering for us in  our classroom. I went down to meet her and I asked her the question,     Why are you giving, freely, your time here?    She said,    I was invited to  one of your community luncheons.    We have community luncheons on a  regular basis, still do, and just invite people to come and learn more  about us. She said,    I was taken on a tour and given the opportunity to  look in through these observation windows at these children. When that  happened, I saw children just like ones that I   ve pulled the plug on.     Tears came to her eyes and she said,    I   m here to give back.    And she  volunteered for quite some time. At that time, she was between contracts  and just waiting for that to be negotiated out, but she was a dear friend to  the Little Light House.  I saw that paradigms can change just by individuals learning about,  seeing about, being around these children. That   s one of the reasons I   m  so passionate about our college university training program because as  these nursing students and doctors and therapists and teachers come in  and they see these children, it changes their paradigm. I believe that  hospital care for children with special needs, in time, if enough are  trained to understand the value of the lives of these children, I think it  will change. The seminar that we did in China, at the very end of the last  day, we gave the Chinese delegates an opportunity to share what they  had learned. I will never forget one Chinese lady coming to the  microphone and she said this, she said,    In the part of China where I  23  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  come from, we consider always these children as trouble. But because  you have come and you have taught us and what we have learned, we  now see these children as flowers with potential to blossom.    And we  knew that our message had gotten through. When we have students  come from other parts of the world that is the one thing that they pretty  consistently share with us. That is one of the most important things that  they have learned, is the potential of these children.  Well, you wrote a book. Tell me about your book.  Well, it   s called Milestones and Miracles and on the front it says,    The  story of the Little Light House,    and it is. It is our story. For years, I  would be given opportunities to go out and speak and people would  want to know,    How did it get started,    and,    How do you survive?    and  I would share with them. It is what I would call one God story after  another. I would always leave frustrated because there was so much  more I wanted to tell them and I didn   t have time. A very, very dear  friend of mine went over, we would have lunch, especially if we had  others there, she   d say,    Tell them this story. Tell them that story.    She  would always end the conversation with,    When are you going to write  that book?    I always knew God was calling me to one day write a book,  but I had scribbled notes on napkins and legal pads and notepaper and  my notes were everywhere.  I almost lost my opportunity. I had a really close call and ended up being  rushed to St. Francis Hospital here in Tulsa by EMSA, and I just  remember as they were transferring me to the operating table, bargaining  with God and saying,    If you will just give me one more chance, I  promise I will write it.    I had always just been too busy, and so after that  I went home and I began gathering up all my notes, which took awhile,  and began to pen the story that I believe God had given to me to share.  Because, you see, I believe with all my heart that God established the  Little Light House for these children with special needs to give them  every opportunity to develop to their maximum potential. But I also  believe that God established the Little Light House to have a platform in  which He could share his love with all his children, all of us. To be able  to demonstrate that He is still alive and well, and He is still in the  miracle-working business because in this twenty-first century, we are  still seeing miracles around every corner. I define a miracle as  something you really can   t explain from a human point of view. It had to  be God.  So, this book is filled with God stories, miracle stories, and the stories of  how God grew this ministry and how He provided every inch of the  way. I really felt pregnant with the book and it was just a relief just to  deliver it. I honestly did not know but what it might just remain in a  24  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  safety deposit box for the rest of my life. But a precious woman was  determined that it would be published and helped to get it published. We  have now sold and given away thousands of copies over the years. But  it   s God   s story.  You   ll have to revise it soon.  I do plan to actually do Milestones and Miracles Two, if God gives me  the chance. I   m not sure that that will be the title. I think rather, the title  might be Divine Connections because I have seen God literally, connect  people who don   t even know each other, literally from all over the world  to accomplish what He wanted to accomplish.  And you   re still going strong with it.  Still going strong. The ministry is still going strong and the Lord willing,  I will stay with it as long as He calls me here.  Well, George Bush named the Little Light House one of his Points of  Light. How did that come about?  Well, I   m not even sure how he heard about us and how it came about,  frankly, that we were named. We were just stunned to learn about it. I do  remember when the call came in from the White House, the receptionist  thought it was a joke and almost didn   t put the call through. (Laughter)  But it was a very exciting time for us, and we were so honored. Actually,  the big focus of his program, Thousand Points of Light, was focusing on  volunteering, as most people know. I thought it was an incredible tribute  to our ministry, but also to the community of Tulsa and to our volunteer  program. Little Light House is one of the most volunteer intensive  programs in the city. We now utilize over one hundred volunteers, where  we really have a goal of more than two hundred volunteers that we  utilize on a regular basis, under this roof. We cannot do what we need to  do in the classrooms without them. These children need a one-on-one.  Our goal for our children is one-on-one.  I haven   t really talked about it very much, but when these children come  in off of our waiting list, they are seen by a team of professionals and  then we meet with the parents, and we use a trans-disciplinary team  approach in developing a very individualized prescriptive program. The  chairman of our board loves to refer to us as kind of the Mayo Clinic  approach to special education, because we really do utilize the entire  team. The parents are involved, our physical therapists, our occupational  therapists, our speech therapists, our teachers, our assistive technology  specialist, our low vision specialist, all of them work together. So, we   re  really approaching the children from all directions, all areas of their  25  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  development. And then we design a prescriptive program just for that  child. So, in order to carry out such a prescriptive and individualized  program, we really do need one-on-one for most of the children. So, we  have a lot of volunteers, and we   re always, always needing more.  Do you have to keep up with the trends in education and   ?  Absolutely, and I   m glad you asked that question because we have  begun hosting conferences here at the Little Light House, professional  conferences where we invite other professionals, other speech therapists  or physical therapists from all over the state to come and join us as we  bring well-known national speakers in to provide state of the art  techniques and coaching. The beauty for us is that our entire staff can be  trained and we don   t have to pay for them to go across the nation to get  that training. We   re able to kind of link arms with other professionals in  the community. We don   t believe in operating as an island. We love to  connect with professionals from all over our community and share  information, exchange information. We need to be putting our heads  together, not pulling apart, in order to best meet the needs of these  children. So, now we do host professional conferences for that very  reason, just to keep us current.  ------- End of January 20, 2012 interview -------  All right, we   re picking back up with Marcia Mitchell. This is part two of  our interview. Thank you again for joining us.  Today is February 22,  2012   Thank you.  Well, let   s begin today by learning a little bit about   we learn the  background we need from our careers in many different places. It   s not  always the classroom, sometimes it is. Where do you think you   ve  learned the most for the career you have today?  I may have talked about this a little bit last time, but I think that as funny  as it may seem, working in the back of my parents    bakery taught me a  lot. I didn   t like it at the time, because it was hard. Bakeries are typically  not air conditioned in the part that I was working in, but it did teach me  perseverance and stamina and that you just have to work hard in life.  Though I   ve been totally dependent upon the Lord for provision, at the  same time, God expects us to apply ourselves. So, it has required a lot of  hard work. I think had my parents not taught me to work hard, I don   t  think I could have endured for four decades. (Laughs) So, I   m very  grateful for that.  26  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  I think there are also just some real practical work ethics that went along  with just working hard and working smart, and that has been very  important within this career. I think also I gained a sensitivity towards  children with special needs and individuals with special needs through a  friend that I had when I was a little girl. She was blind and I used to read  stories to her on our back porch step, and she introduced me to a blind  piano teacher. I think I gained sensitivity from him, as I took piano from  him. So, I think those kinds of experiences increased my sensitivity to  individuals with disabilities. In addition to that, the people that I worked  with in the back of the bakery, I think, imparted to me a real sensitivity  to people from all walks of life and all socioeconomic levels, and I  developed, I think, a real love just for people. I think those are probably  the things that helped me most.  Well, looking back on the career and the work you have done and  continue to do, let   s talk about career highlights.  Okay, well certainly one would have to be   one that immediately comes  to mind, of course, our founding. That day that we actually opened the  doors because it was a dream come true. We got the doors open. It was  October 3rd of 1972. I will never forget that day. We had been scrubbing  floors and painting walls and getting everything ready, and when we had  that first day when five little children came through the doors, and we  had five volunteers and one teacher in this little tiny frame house, it was  a huge day for us.  I think another really significant highlight was a moment in time when I  was actually in China. It was a fairly small geographic area, but a very  dense population. It was a geographic area of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma  and the population of Tulsa, Oklahoma if you can imagine. It was an  area where a young international intern who had studied at the Little  Light House was opening his own center. After studying here, he carried  those skills back and opened a center for children with special needs in  China. We got to be there for the dedication. It was very different from  our dedications here. There were lots of fireworks going off and many  government officials attending it that day. The children, most of them  were deaf, but yet they danced for us. It was just an incredible,  incredible day. We were so moved by the dedication of all the people  that had surrounded this young man.  One significant thing was, I asked him, I said,    Obviously, you all have  been open for a few weeks. What was the actual date you opened your  doors?    He thought about it for a minute and he said,    Oh, October 3,     which was the exact same date that we opened our doors and he had no  way of knowing that. It was just a very special moment to   I think it  was   goodness, we had already been in existence for well over twenty  27  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  years, and to see this young man starting a center similar to the Little  Light House on the other side of the globe partly because of the  influence of the Little Light House was extremely rewarding, a very  special highlight. And then, of course, you know, inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame was a very, very special day for me.  Well, speaking of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, when you were  notified that you were going to be inducted, what was going through  your mind?  I remember we were on the road. (Laughs) We were in the car, and I  didn   t recognize the phone number, so I almost didn   t take the call.  When I realized who it was and what she wanted, I was completely  taken back. I had no idea. It was a very humbling moment. You think of  the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame and immediately, some pretty  amazing people come to mind. So, to be inducted alongside so many  amazing and remarkable and inspirational women was truly humbling.  Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  Yes, yes.  Was it Pam Peterson?  Yes, it was Pam. Yes, it was a wonderful honor to be actually inducted.  It was a wonderful honor to be inducted by Pam Peterson.  Did you have lots of people in attendance that day?  We did. (Laughs) We had a big crowd and I wasn   t really anticipating  that, but I actually have some relatives in Oklahoma City, and so they  were all there. My precious mother-in-law and aunt and sister and  nephew and the list just went on and on. I had quite a little cheering  crew there. I also had some wonderful staff members that had come over  for the day, so it did all make me feel very, very special.  Well, everybody seemed to have quite a crowd there at the  Oklahoma   History Center, so it was a very wonderful atmosphere.  It was packed, it was a great day.  Well you know, you sat up on that stage and you accepted the award.  Through the years, you have probably made a difference in not only the  lives of many, many children, but you   ve probably inspired a lot of  people that have worked for you, here. How do you feel now that people  look at you as that role model?  28  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  To be honest with you, I hope they look right past me. That would be the  desire of my heart. There   s a scripture that talks about loving to boast in  my weakness. I really identify with that because I know that I did not  have   I   d been taught to work hard, but I did not have any of the skills  or the knowledge to establish a ministry for children with special needs,  much less a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. I didn   t even know what  that was when we started. So, I really lacked the skills, I lacked the  knowledge. Even though I was a very ordinary person, I had taught  school for three years, the other co-founder was a housewife. We were  trusting in a very big God.  The one thing that I hope people would see, when I say see right past  me, I would hope they would see the big God that I serve and see that  the more inadequate you feel, the more you lean on God. The more you  lean on God, the more He is strength and His power is revealed. And I  think that has happened here. We   re sitting in a beautiful twenty-two  thousand square foot facility that was tailor designed to meet the needs  of these children. That has come from a little tiny framed house with just  five children. Hundreds of children have been served over the years,  now has a global outreach, this project was 2.2 million dollars. We  moved into it debt free. I can   t explain that any other way other than a  miracle. I define a miracle as a divine intervention, something that  happens. You just can   t explain it any other way.  The fact that we are tuition free, providing these services at no tuition to  these families, receive no government funding, people that are even  skeptics would have to quickly say, and often times do,    Yep, that would  seem like it would have to be a miracle.    It really is. We just depended  on the Lord in the very beginning. We continue to depend on the Lord  today and now our budget is like 1.7 million. We   ve launched a sixteen  million dollar capital campaign. We   re almost 76 percent of the way to  our goal. That just has to be a work of God. So, my prayer would be that  people would actually not see me, but see the God that I serve.  I think the work that you do, though, and how it   s been replicated in  other places and how you   re able to reach out and work with so many  others, not only here in the United States, but abroad, really speaks to  the impact you have had on many.  The work has gone way beyond anything I ever dreamed. I had dreams,  aspirations that it would be a very well established center serving many  children, but never in my wildest dreams did I imagine a global  outreach. Never did I imagine that we would be actually training a  thousand college and university students a year who come and rely on  the Little Light House for practicums and internships and observations.  29  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Never in a million years did I imagine that we would have individuals  from literally, all over the globe coming to study here and spend  anywhere from eight weeks to two years studying and then carry those  skills back to other parts of the globe and impart those same skills to  others.  There was one young lady who came and studied with us for two years  and returned to her homeland in the Philippines and conducted seminars  all over the Philippines and ultimately, trained thousands of people as a  result of the skills that she gained here. I would love to think that those  people are now imparting the same skills onto others. I never would  have imagined that we would have a Little Light House in Mississippi  and another one in Texas with the hope and the dream that one day it  would be replicated in other states. But, when we began having families  actually uproot and move to Tulsa, Oklahoma in order to enroll their  child here. That was when we really began to dream of perhaps, one day,  being able to replicate in other states. So, to answer your question, no, I  never imagined that the Little Light House would be so far reaching.  That has been extremely rewarding.  Well, throughout the course of your interview, you   ve made mention of  many people who played a key role in your life and in the Little Light  House. Is there anybody you would like to acknowledge at this point?  Oh, there are so many people, that gets a little difficult. (Laughter) You  don   t want to leave anybody out. I would say that   and this lady has no  idea who I am, nor that she ever had an impact on my life   but Dale  Evans Rogers wrote a wonderful little book that changed my life. It   s  called Angel Unaware. I   m sure many of the people that will be in your  viewing audience will have heard of it or read it. But that little book  completely changed my life. So, I   m very much in her debt. Dale Evans  Rogers has served as an incredible inspiration to my life. Then there was  a gentleman named George M  ller who actually lived in the eighteenth  century, who was totally dependent upon God and had such an  incredible amount of faith that he was able to accomplish extraordinary  things even though he was an ordinary man. I think he was another one  that really has impacted my life.  But in the here and now, there have been many wonderful friends that  have been an encouragement along the way. They have been  cheerleaders, if you will, for the ministry as well as for my own personal  efforts and when I got discouraged, they were there. I certainly would  have to say my husband and my daughter who have sacrificed a lot in  order to allow me to do what I feel that God has called me to do. I will  be forever grateful to them for being willing to make those sacrifices.  People have a tendency to see me and to think of sacrifices that I have  30  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  made, but truly, theirs have been huge sacrifices. I would want my world  to know the sacrifices that they made.  There is also a group of women early on in the history of the Little Light  House that really discipled me. They really taught me how to trust and  how to live day by day, really relying on the Lord to be my strength and  to be my guide and to live by what I call biblical principles. I mention  them in my book, and I   m very, very grateful to them. There are others  that I do mention in my book, a very special lady named Alma Robson,  who was a mentor to me for a number of years. Another lady named  Aliene Murdock, who was the director of the  Tulsa  Recreation Center  for the Physically Limited that allowed us to use the little building next  to theirs, who was also another wonderful mentor. So, I   ve been very  blessed over the years by having a number of wonderful people that  have served as inspirations to me.  Well, if you could give advice to fellow Oklahomans today, what would  you tell them?  If you can dream it, you can do it, if God   s calling you to it. There is an  illustration that I love to use, that if God said    Start walking,    I hope I  would be obedient and start walking. If God said,    Keep walking,    I  pray I would be obedient and keep walking. If I came to the edge of a  cliff and God said,    Keep going,    I pray I would be obedient and keep  walking, but I would make real sure it   s God talking and instructing me  before I would do that. That   s why I say, if you can dream it, you can do  it, if God is calling you to it. I believe God does not call the equipped,  but rather, He equips those he calls. If He has called you to do  something, then I believe He will give you everything you need to  accomplish it.  I believe God is calling all of us to reach out to our fellow man. I think  we   re born to bring glory to God. We   re born to be a blessing to others.  So, you find what that is that you   re to do in service to God and you trust  Him to equip you to do it. So, I encourage people to find, to seek God as  to what is their assignment because if they seek God and they find their  assignment, they   re going to make their world a better place one way or  another if they really trust him to give them everything they need to  accomplish that assignment. I think if everybody in the whole wide  world was doing that, we would be living in a different world.  Most definitely. For women who find themselves in similar positions that  you were in, especially early on, any words of advice, wisdom you could  share?  Pray. (Laughs) Because that   s what I started doing in the very beginning.  31  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  We had no services. I had a child that I knew needed early intervention.  Again, it was not out there. I knew I did not know enough to be able to  help her to be able to stay on developmental level, and so I did  something my mother had always taught me to do and that was to pray.  The rest is history. But I would just encourage them to pray. I would  also encourage them to seek mentors. Someone they can talk to,  someone that could help them kind of get beyond the emotion of the  situation and begin really thinking clearly about,    Well, I   m in this  situation. What does God want to do through this?     There is also another scripture that I love,    All things work together for  good for those who are called according to his purpose.    That was a real  turning point in my life when I stopped asking why,    Why has this  happened to me? Why were we given this child that is potentially  blind?    but began to ask God how He could use our circumstances for  good. When I began to ask how instead of why, God began to turn  things around. So, that   s something else I would encourage people, if  they   ve been faced with a crisis or what would seem to be something  very sad or very traumatic in their life, instead of asking why, begin  asking how God might be able to use that situation for good.  Well, looking to the future, what   s next on the agenda for you?  Well, we have some pretty big dreams. Actually, years ago, right after  we built this building, I had surgery and I was recouping. I remember I  had to do these exercises and I was laying on the bed doing these  horrible exercises and said,    Lord, where to from here? Am I done?  Have I finished my assignment?    Like I said, we had just moved in here  and it   d been a pretty exciting thing. We   d come from just a few  thousand square feet to this twenty-two thousand square foot facility,  beautiful facility. I will never forget the words, not audible, but very,  very strongly heard in my mind,    We   ve just begun.    (Laughs) It took  my breath away. It really caught my attention. I really felt like the Lord  was revealing to me some direction that we were to go in the future.  Part of that direction has to do with our affiliates, Little Light Houses  that are in other states. At the time, that really was not even a dream. It  was just something that I really felt impressed that day. That he was  saying,    The Little Light House is to replicate across the nation,    which  was pretty overwhelming to me in that moment. Now, it   s not quite so  overwhelming now that we have one in Mississippi and one in Texas,  but at the time, it seemed pretty overwhelming.  Then He also really began to impress upon me something else that has  actually come about, and that is our college and career students as well  as international students. He began impressing upon me that the Little  32  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Light House classrooms would actually become a classroom. That in the  process of helping these children, we would be teaching others how to  help these children. That we were to have a model program that people  from literally around the world would come and study the most effective  techniques, the latest state of the art approaches to working with these  children. Again, that thought was also pretty overwhelming to me.  Then there was another very clear impression, and that was that we were  to become a platform in which people across America would come to  realize that so many of these families don   t have a church home because  people in churches really don   t know how to reach out to these children.  They feel inadequate. One day   and this is a dream that has not been  realized   but I pray that there will be an opportunity for us to actually  be used by God in this way and that is to equip churches across America  to be able to reach out to these children. Open their doors. It   s a pretty  typical situation. If you take a little child that has cerebral palsy or is  blind, whatever, to Sunday school, that   s it for the Sunday school  teacher to throw up her hands and say,    But I don   t know how to help  him. I don   t know how to teach him.    That   s understandable.  With the bible-based curriculum that we   ve been working on for over  two decades that is actually designed for typical children but makes  adjustments and adaptations for children with special needs, this will  actually enable preschools, Sunday schools, even vacation bible schools  in churches across America to be able to use this curriculum for typical  children, but also that when they have a child with special needs come  into their classroom, they   ll be able to actually work with that child and  make a difference. So, it   s a curriculum that will actually open hearts  and open doors to these children and I think can make a huge difference  for children and their families across America. That dream has not been  realized, but I believe we are in the neonatal stages towards making that  a reality.  That seems like an area that really hasn   t been focused on.  It is. It   s that the population of individuals with disabilities is the largest  unreached population in America.  And to be able to offer some type of curriculum to churches to let them  know, this is how you can help, I think would make all the difference.  I believe so, too. I have a friend that is now speaking in places all across  America. He   s speaking to pastors and in seminaries. The one thing he  continues to get is,    We   re willing, we don   t know how. Give us a  curriculum.    We only have a curriculum for the preschool level, but if  you can begin to teach little tykes, there   s really not that much difference  33  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  between you and this little guy that can   t see. You may not be able to  hop as well as your buddy Jimmy, but you may be able to draw better.  We all have different abilities to help children to be able to see these are  just children who are differently abled, to be able to find what these  kiddos can do.  If we can start there, then when they get a little older they are not going  to be fearful if they see somebody in a wheelchair, in a grocery store or  somebody walking down the sidewalk with a cane. I think we can  overcome the fear factor in adults if we can start at the child level. We   re  not aware   there may be, but we are not aware, we have not found  another preschool curriculum, bible-based curriculum that has  adaptations for children with special needs. So, it is our prayer, our  dream to publish that. Not only across America, but that it would be  distributed around the world and make a big difference for children with  special needs being able to be accepted into settings where currently,  they are not.  Looking at the future expansion of the Little Light House, you   re in the  middle or towards the tail end of the capital campaign?  We are. Actually, we are hopefully toward the end. Very close to our  goal of being able to build a sixty-eight thousand square foot expansion  to our twenty-two thousand square foot facility. Once built, we will be  able to serve twice as many children. We will be able to serve between  120 and 150 children here and meet their very individualized needs  through state of the art educational and therapy services. But as I  mentioned before, what is really exciting about that, is this facility will  also provide observatories where, whether they   re coming from around  the world or whether they   re coming from across town, a college or a  university across town, they will be able to sit in observatories that are  similar to surgical theaters and look down into two different classrooms  and learn. They   ll be almost like a classroom observatory.  Again, as I mentioned before, what is really exciting, is that our  classrooms are becoming a classroom. The Little Light House has kind  of moved from being a quality, state of the art preschool or early  childhood Christian developmental center for children with special  needs to a training center. The training ground is our classrooms, but  really, we feel like we can impact thousands more children by training  others in how to work with these children. Yes, we can serve between  120 and 150 children when we build this new facility, but how much  greater would it be if we could impact thousands, just like we have  impacted children in the Philippines and in China and in Russia and in  Costa Rica and in Mexico, different places we have been and conducted  seminars or we have trained individuals who have come and studied  34  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  here. And now, they are making a difference in children around the  world. So, I think it   s a real efficient way of being able to impact  children all over the world in the process of impacting the lives of these  children here.  Any timeframe on when you   ll break ground on the new project?  When we have all the funding. (Laughter)  That   s a good answer.  When we have all the funding, which we hope is in the next few months.  And we are very, very hopeful we will be able to break ground within  the next six months.  Wow, that   s great. Well, as we come kind of towards the tail end of the  interview, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oh, that   s a great question. First of all, I   m a native Oklahoman, and  there aren   t that many of us around anymore. I   m a native Oklahoman,  and I   m a native Tulsan, and I   m proud of it. I just think we just live in  the most wonderful state and I have to say the most wonderful city. I   ve  always loved Tulsa. I   ve always loved Oklahoma. I just think it is   I  love being in the buckle of the Bible Belt. But also, the people are just  friendly, they   re warm. We hear that all the time. All you have to do is  visit an area that is not so friendly and then you come back and you   re  really glad you   re home.  But in addition to that, I would have to say how moved and how blessed  I have been being in Tulsa. I believe with all my heart that this is truly  one of the most benevolent cities in the world. You can   t have a center,  501(c)(3) developmental center for children with special needs, that  provides tuition free services, receives no federal funding. We also don   t  happen to receive United Way. We are not eligible for that. So, given  that set of circumstances on a financial level, for us to have been able to  start out with just a prayer and a dream and three thousand dollars  almost forty years ago and today, to have a global outreach, to be  training over a thousand students a year, college university students, to  be able to have individuals from all over the world coming and training  here, to be launching a sixteen million dollar facility expansion, to be  sitting in a facility that is debt free   that says two things to me. One, I  serve a mighty God, and that there are thousands of people in this  community who are open to God working through their lives to make a  difference in the lives of others.  We have had delegations from over twenty-three nations visit the Little  35  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Light House. One of the questions I typically get, especially from  developing nations that really do not value the lives of children with  special needs. They   re intrigued when they walk in these doors that,     This whole building is totally dedicated to helping these children?     They   re pretty intrigued. But what intrigues them even more is how this  is funded. Typically, after we take them on a tour and show them  hospitality, we will sit down and often times they will ask,    So, where  does the money come from?    I love to be able to tell them, and I will  typically say,    You know, we have trusted in God from the very  beginning, but we know that God works through people. There are  many, many wonderful people in this community who have allowed God  to work through them to give very generously.    Typically, they will say,     Why? Why do they do that? Why do they give?    I   m able to just  simply respond,    Because they care about other people.    I don   t know if  you can say that everywhere you go. I just think it is such an  incredible   the Little Light House itself is such an incredible tribute to  the Tulsa community, Tulsa and surrounding areas. It   s just an  incredible tribute.  Is there anything you   d like to add that I haven   t asked you about?  Yes. (Laughs) Something that I think a lot of people don   t know about  the Little Light House is how volunteer intensive we are. Little Light  House truly is one of the most volunteer intensive organizations in the  city of Tulsa. If I could put something on the front page of the  newspaper, I would put,    Little Light House is always in need of  volunteers,    and that they don   t need to come with previous training. We  will provide that training.  And volunteers can be old and young and everybody in between?  Volunteers, actually, to serve in the classroom, must be fourteen years of  age. They go all the way up and in fact, just recently, we were doing a  videotaping, and we videotaped this darling little volunteer that has been  here for four years. And even I did not realize that she was eighty-two  years old when she began serving in the classroom. She is now eighty-six  and she will tell you, and she said in front of the camera, that she  thinks the Little Light House is actually keeping her alive. (Laughs) She  shared it with such joy and truly, I have seen   I   ve watched before my  very eyes, her just seem to come to more and more life. She can get  around more easily than she ever did before. She is just a delight to us.  So, yes, no matter how old you are you can still make a difference in  these classrooms. We can accommodate. Ideally, a volunteer would be  able to get up and down off the floor and so on. But if they   ve got a  heart for these children and they have a desire to serve them, then we  36  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  Nykolaiszyn  Mitchell  will train them. In some cases, we have volunteers that come in and they  just read stories to the children. In other cases, they actually are carrying  out individual activities with the children that have been prescribed for  them. We need individuals who just really want to give their heart, give  some time and make a difference.  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  If history was written about me, I would hope that it would say that I  was obedient to follow the calling that God had placed on my life. That I  did not    grow weary  in well doing    . That people were able to see  through my life that I was a very ordinary person serving an  extraordinary God for some remarkable children. I would hope that  history would record me as a loving wife, a loving mother, most  importantly, a dedicated child of God. My prayer would be that I would  finish my assignment.  Marcia, thank you so much for your time. We really do appreciate it.  Thank you. And thank you for such a wonderful honor. I truly am  humbled by it.  ------- End of February 22, 2012 interview -------
