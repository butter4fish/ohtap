 Larson  Wilhelm  Today is November 17, 2009. My name is Mary Larson, and we   re here  with Ms. Jean Wilhelm  in Oklahoma City. We are joined today by  Jean   s nephew John Linehan and his wife Carol.  Thank you so much  for being here today. We appreciate your help with this project.  Oh, you   re welcome.  Before we get started talking about the Waves, I   d like to ask you a little  bit about where you grew up, if you could tell me about where you were  raised and who was in your family.  Okay, I hope I can remember. (Laughs)  Where did you grow up?  In Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  And who was in your family when you were growing up? How many  brothers and sisters did you have?  I had four sisters. No brothers.  Where did you go to school, and what did your parents do?  I went to Saint John   s Catholic School here in Bartlesville through the  ninth grade, and then I went on to the public high school in Bartlesville  from then until I graduated.  While you were growing up, what did your parents do? What did your  father do for a living, and did your mom     He worked for an oil company, Sinclair Oil Company. They had a main  5  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  office in Independence, Kansas where his brother worked, but they also  had an office in Bartlesville, and that   s where he worked.  So, how did you find out about the Waves?  Well, they came to Bartlesville from a   they had a pretty good main  office in Tulsa, the Navy did. And so they advertised and came to  Bartlesville to visit every once in a while. I worked two years at the oil  company here in Bartlesville before I decided to join the Waves. I had to  go back to Tulsa and be examined, get a health examination, and they  approved everything. And when they did, they sent me to New York  City to the women   s college up there.  Was that Hunter College?  Hunter College. I was up there for several months, and then I thought  they were going to send me on to where they were   they let you put  down where you would like to go to work for the Navy, and I had asked  for either the west coast or the east coast, either Florida or California.  (Laughter) And first they sent me to Stillwater, Oklahoma, which was a  shock to me. I thought I was through when I graduated from New York,  but they sent me to Stillwater to the college there. It was a different  name than it is now.  Oklahoma A M? Was that it?  I was there for several months, and from there they sent me to California  and San Diego.  Well, before we talk about that, can you tell me a little bit about what  you did with your basic training at Hunter College?  Well, they drilled us. We had to drill just like the boys drill, and they  didn   t let us go out to see New York on our own. Only the very last  weekend they let us free to go out, and we had to be back to the camp at  a certain time in the evening on Saturday and Sunday. That   s all we had  to see New York City was those two days, but it was interesting.  Were the other women that you were with, did they come from all over  the country at that point?  One girl from back east someplace did nothing but complain when they  took us to Stillwater because she thought she had been put out in the  country, you know. (Laughs) She thought they were out in the wilds. But  then she finally apologized, especially to me, because she knew I was  from Oklahoma, and she said she got another opinion of Oklahoma. But  6  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  see, Stillwater wasn   t very big then either, and it was kind of country  and cowboy, you know.  So, the group that you were with in New York City, did you all come to  Stillwater or did they break you up into groups?  They had us in a train that had boys that they were taking someplace.  Boys were in different train  cars  and they didn   t let them sit near us.  They separated us. It was a big long train, and you   d think we were, I  don   t know, going to Europe or something on a train (Laughs) because it  took us about four days to get from New York City to Stillwater,  because they would stop us whenever a certain government train wanted  to come through. They had to pull us over, and we   d sit there for hours,  you know, on that big long train. Finally, they got us to Stillwater, and  the girls   and I don   t know where they went on with the boys in their  coaches but they took them on. They didn   t drop them off at Stillwater.  So, the group you were with at Stillwater was the same group as in New  York City?  Yes.  Back when you were in New York City, did you have particular classes  besides the drills, or was it more basic training?  They drilled us. Marching, and also they took us to history classes and to  learn all about the Navy and the famous men of the Navy, John Paul  Jones and all those. When we were finally transferred to California, that  Navy place there was divided into groups there because the West Coast  people were trained there. The West Coast boys were trained there  before they were sent, put on ships and sent, to Europe to the war. We  couldn   t go on any ships. The girls couldn   t. Only a few nurses were  allowed on the ships to go to war, and most of those were men. I don   t  know whether they had any women on the ships or not, but not anybody  like us, you know.  What did your parents think when you wanted to join the Waves?  My parents? My mother thought it was a good idea and that I   d like it  and learn something, but my dad didn   t like it. He didn   t want me to go.  He was worrying about those wild sailors, (Laughter) and, boy, those  wild sailors were like little kids, some of them. They were just getting  out of high school, themselves, and they didn   t try to flirt with you or  anything. I think they were almost afraid of us. (Laughter)  Well, and some of you would   ve been older than they were.  7  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Yes, I worked for the City Service Oil Company in Bartlesville for about  two years before I went into the Navy.  Right. So, you   d been out of high school for a while, and you were a  little more grown up than some of the sailors.  Yes, I guess so, and I was more quiet of a person than a lot of the girls. I  didn   t try to flirt or anything. And the office I worked in the Navy in  California, I was the first Wave that they put in the office there. So, I  worked with those men in the office and had to help them work. But  they were nice. They were some nice men in the office there.  So, they accepted you and treated you well?  Yes. There was a man that was the head of this Navy thing in San Diego  where I was. Walter Winchell,  he was  the writer in the paper and  everything. Of course, Walter was Jewish so he didn   t like Germans, so  he was forever putting things in the paper, bad things about this man that  was the head of the Navy in San Diego. And he didn   t like to be  stationed at an office, so he had been on ships all through his Navy life,  this man. And he was, I guess, a nice man, but one day he called our  office and he wanted to speak to the man that was the head of our office.  I answered the phone because the man ahead of our office had another  man in the office with him, and they had closed the door. It was some  kind of a secret thing, I guess. Anyway, I answered the phone for him  and here was this man that was the head of the whole big thing there in  San Diego was calling, and so I told him right away I would get the man  on the phone, that yes, he was in.  So, I ran into the office and opened the door and the man in the office  with him was really a priest that was a friend of his, a young man, and  they were just laughing and visiting in here because this young man had  been sent home because of his health. He had been in a submarine, and  they just let them in there for a certain amount because it   s harder on  them. So, I guess he was telling stories to the other man and that   s why  they   d shut the door. (Laughter) I don   t know. No, but when I told him  who was the on the phone, boy, he grabbed that phone. So, I went  tearing out back to my desk.  Which office did you work in San Diego?  They had divided that place into four different sections, and each section  was named after a famous Navy man. And I was in   I think ours was  Camp Paul Jones, the last one. And as the young men out there on the  western coast were going into the Navy, why, they would send them  through. It was like a school for the western United States. Those kids  8  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  were young, and they behaved and everything. And they had to go  through each of the four places that were named after the famous men.  What was your job in that office?  I was a stenographer or secretary to him and also to a couple of the other  men in the office. One time they had a certain group that went through  our section at the very end before they were put on ships, but the men  came out and asked questions and had them lined up and talked to them.  Well, one day they wanted to see what I could do. They made me go out,  (Laughs) and they gave me a speech to talk to those men about obeying  the officers on the ships and doing what they were supposed to do. But  those kids were quite shocked when a woman came out, when one of  those Waves came out. (Laughs)  Well, it was good for them, right? Getting back to when you were in  Stillwater, what was your average day like in Stillwater when you were  doing your training there?  It was just like going to school. We had history class, and, oh, I don   t  know what all we had. One of the teachers over at Stillwater was a  Bartlesville girl, Katherine Moroney, and she knew me because she was  a friend of my sister Katherine. She said,    When you get out of the  Navy,    she wanted me to come back and finish. See, I didn   t have  college education. So, she wanted me to come back and get a college  education, but I didn   t. I went back to work with the City Service Oil  Company.  So, she was one of the teachers at Stillwater?  Yes.  Do you remember what she taught?  I don   t know what she taught. I think it might have been English, but  I   m not sure.  So, during your days, you   d go to class, and what else did you have to  do? Did you have to drill at Stillwater?  Yes, and we really drilled at New York more than we did at Stillwater,  and then when we got out to California, they said I had to go to drill, and  they had the Navy orchestra play for us on the beach. We   d go out and  drill on the beach, you know, just all these Waves, these girls, and the  boys would start giggling because half of us are going one way, and half  of us the other way. (Laughs) We weren   t really very good at it, but  9  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  finally somebody told my boss, and he said,    She is my secretary.    And  he said,    I   m talking to       He talked to some officer, and so I got out of  it. I didn   t have to go back for that anymore, up and down the beach in a  group and doing things wrong.  Do you remember how many other Waves were in San Diego?  No. There were six of us in the room. It was a good-size building that we  were in, because the six of us had beds in the room where we were, and  we had dressers and closets to put our stuff in, our clothes. Somebody  had to stay up all night long to watch. We had to take our turns on the  watch, so it was always pretty much Navy and Army stuff.  You mentioned your barracks in San Diego, but where did you stay in  Stillwater? Were you in one of the dorms?  That   s where   Stillwater   no, Hunter College was in New York, and  that   s where they took it over, and we used their buildings.  But when you were back in Oklahoma, do you remember what dorm you  were in at Oklahoma A M?  I don   t remember the dorm.  I didn   t know if there were a lot of you together.  Our train got there after twelve o   clock at night, and we were all sleepy,  and it was a whole bunch of us got off the train, and they took us right  direct to the college, and they had called their women back that worked  in the kitchen there. They came back just for us and had homemade rolls  and food and coffee and cocoa for us. So, that one girl that was from  back East that made fun of us so much was just shocked. She thought  that was just wonderful. She said they wouldn   t do it that way in New  York. (Laughs)  When you were in Stillwater, were there other military groups on  campus? Were there any Army men or any other men   s groups?  We never saw anybody else but ourselves. I don   t know where they  were, and there was quite a lot of us there.  What did you do in your spare time?  We didn   t have much spare time.  What did they make you do for exercise? You drilled a little bit.  10  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  We had jobs. Like you had to do your own laundry at those places and  things like that, and sometimes they   ll pick out somebody like to scrub  the hall floor as you come into one of the main buildings.  So, were there any social events or dances or anything that you went to  in Stillwater?  Nothing in New York until that last weekend, and then we were allowed  to go by ourselves to get on a train or something to go into New York  City.  And once you got to Oklahoma?  And some of those girls from back there were real good that were in  with us, and they would help us and knew where to take us in New York  City.  Do you remember what you saw when you got out to see New York City?  No. We went out to where the Statue of Liberty is on that island, but we  couldn   t get off and go on the island because they were painting her.  You know, they have to repair her because the weather is hard on her.  (Laughs) So, they were doing her all over then, so they wouldn   t let us  on that island, but we could just look at her from the boat.  So, once you left New York and you came to Oklahoma, once you were  here, did the people in Stillwater have any social events for you?  No. I guess there weren   t enough from Oklahoma to do anything special.  I was just home for a few days when I had to go out to California.  So, with both New York City and then Oklahoma A M with your  training here, were there girls who left partway through the training, or  did everybody stay the whole time?  One of the girls, when we were in New York, I was glad she wasn   t on  the floor where we were sleeping, but she was kind of a pest. She liked  women, you know, was one of those. And so they finally sent her home  from New York. She didn   t get to go on like we did, so they were  particular and good like that. They watched over us.  Were there girls that got homesick?  Oh, I don   t know. None of them in our group. There at New York, there  was just four in each big bedroom.  11  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  So, when you were in Stillwater, were there any officers you remember  or any instructors or teachers that made an impression on you?  No, I don   t     How about any of the other girls? Did you make friends with any of  them and stay friends for a while?  Yes, the ones that I roomed with in California, there were six of us in a  room and they were nice girls, all of them, and so I wrote to them after I  got out at Christmastime. You know, on Christmas cards, I   d write a  little note to them and they   d write back to me. They all got married, I   m  pretty sure. I was the only one that didn   t get married. One girl was  dating a boy that was in the Navy that was a pilot. They had their  airplanes, too, like the Army, and when he would be called out to go on  a secret thing, it seemed like the Japanese, came over pretty close to  California, and so that   s why these air pilots would have to go out on  duty and fly and chase them back out of there away from us. They   d  never tell you that, but the reason why we knew was because this one  girl in our group dated one of them, and he   d call her and tell her he  couldn   t take  her to  the movies that night because   you know, they  showed movies there and he said,    I can   t take you to the movies. I have  to report for work, and that   s all I can tell you.    He wasn   t allowed to  tell her. And then she found out the next day, or whenever it was over  with. Then he   d tell her they were chasing the Japs.  Did they train any of you as spotters to be able to identify airplanes?  I don   t know. We had to know about ships and their names and what  kind they were. They were all different kinds, you know, big ones and  smaller ones and some that their duty was different from the others, you  know.  So, that was all part of your naval history?  We had to know their duties and their names.  With the group of women you knew from the Waves, why do you think  most of them joined the Waves?  I don   t know. They needed help in the offices so they could release those  boys to put them on ships, and so I guess that   s why they wanted you  to...  Well, with you, when you joined, why did you want to be a Wave?  12  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  I think I wanted to see California. I had never traveled then, and I  wanted to see someplace else, California or Florida.  So, you went from Stillwater to San Diego?  Yes. Oklahoma to New York and then Stillwater and then California.  How long were you in California?  Almost two years. It was a little over a year, I know, for good.  Is that where you were when you left the Navy?  No, I went to   well, they knew they were going to get rid of us first, and  so they were transferring us to different places where they needed us,  and I was back in, I think, Ohio. I listed all the places I was, you know,  for just months, until they had room to send us on to where they wanted  us. According to the states you belonged in, you had to go through it that  way. They had rules. I don   t know.  So, you were there until you got out?  Yes.  What was it like when you left the Waves? Was that hard to do?  No. I was glad I had been through it and had seen different places, and it  was interesting in California because the movie stars and the people on  TV that were famous, they   d give us shows. One time it was nobody but  the Waves they invited, and so we had a whole big auditorium full of  Waves. So, they took pictures of us before it started, before the movie  stars came on, and my sister Rita that lived out here in Oklahoma, she  started screaming at her kids. She said,    That   s Jean     (Laughter) She  said she saw me, but I think once I came back home afterwards, I just  laughed. I said,    I don   t think you could find me.    That whole theater  was just nothing but Waves. We had to be dressed up good in our  uniforms and everything. We all looked alike. (Laughs) But it was Bing  Crosby and Phil Harris and I forget who all in the orchestra and  everything. They gave good shows for us free.  Did they do that a lot?  Maybe once a month or something. Maybe not quite that, but they  always had good ones, and they had the Russian dancers. They had been  over here in the United States before we got into the war, and then they  were still going around the whole United States giving shows. It was a  13  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  ballet thing that they were famous for. We got to go to it, too, because  Russia told them not to come back yet to Russia, because I don   t know  whether they were trying to get their people to spy over here or what  they were doing, but they made them wait quite a long time. So, they  were going all through the United States giving shows, and that   s why  they gave a good one to us.  Who else do you remember seeing?  They had an opera thing that I can   t remember what that was. I went to  that.  So, it sounds like you had more free time in California.  Yes.  Did you have a chance to go out with some of the other Waves? Were  you allowed off base?  Yes. We had a certain time off, like Saturday afternoon.  So, you could go around and see different things in Southern California.  You had to be back Saturday night at a certain time, and then you could  go back out again on Sunday. So, it wasn   t like we were in jail or  anything.  So, when you were with the Waves, what about the uniforms? Were  those practical?  Yes. They had dress ones that were all white, but you had to buy those  and pay for those. They didn   t give you those like they did the navy blue  ones and the dark ones.  So, they were easy to work in, though?  Yes.  When you were with the Waves, did you have a mascot at all? Do you  remember any mascots that you had, like dogs or     Oh, no. I didn   t even see any dogs out there.  Okay. Well, there was a picture at Stillwater of three different dogs that  used to be Wave mascots. But I didn   t know   that might have been  before you got there.  14  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Yes. Or maybe I just didn   t see them.  What are some of the other memories you have from being in the Waves  that we haven   t talked about?  Well, I wrote to different ones for quite a long time, and then as they got  married and they were interested in their families and stuff we kind of  dropped it. So, I don   t send a Christmas card even anymore. I don   t  know. Maybe some of them aren   t even living.  What was the best part of that experience?  Well, I guess it was seeing other parts of the country.  Did you have a chance to stay in California when you were done?  If you wanted to stay there in California, I guess you could, but you  would have to get a job and pay for yourself.  So, you decided to come back to Bartlesville?  Yes, because City Service told me they would hire me again if I wanted  it.  And then you worked with them once you got back?  Yes. I worked for them in Bartlesville and in Tulsa when they moved to  Tulsa. I worked for them, I think, forty-some years.  And what did you do with them?  Secretary in the geological department.  That   s a long time to work for one place.  (Laughs) Yes.  You probably know most of their history, too.  Yes.  Well, is there anything we haven   t talked about that you   d like to   share ?  I don   t think so. The most interesting was seeing new states, because I   d  never traveled before.  15  C. Linehan  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  C. Linehan  Wilhelm  J. Linehan  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Were there any other Oklahoma girls that were in training that went  back with you to New York?  I don   t think so. I don   t know anybody, you know, now.  That would have been pretty brave to not sign up with a friend. I know a  lot of the men that went into the military would sign up with their  friends. So, you just went by yourself.  Well, we had a lot of friends as we worked together.  But when you went to sign up for the Waves, did you go with anyone else  to sign up, or did you go by yourself?  I didn   t usually go by myself because I didn   t know San Diego. The base  was way out on the ocean there. You had to take a bus into town if you  wanted to see the town or eat downtown or something.  Were there any other girls from Bartlesville that were Waves?  No, no. I never met them if there were. There were some from Tulsa,  and she was one that I kept writing to after we both got out. She married  a boy from out that way, I think. I think she married one of those pilots.  The Navy had a few pilots, a few ships that had pilots on them.  Did you go to New York City with her for training?  With a group of girls, we   d go in. We got on a streetcar once going in,  and there were some old men on there, real old, on the bus or something.  Whatever we were on. A couple of them had packages of chewing gum,  so they thought that was a big treat, I guess. They passed it around just  to the Waves. (Laughs) Chewing gum in the streetcar going into New  York City, or the bus.  Do you think people treated you better when you were in uniform?  Yes, I think they treated you better than if you were just in ordinary  clothes.  So, they knew who the Waves were. When you were in Stillwater, were  there other groups that you could join? I heard someone mention they  had a glee club and a drum corps. Did you do anything like that in  Stillwater?  They were good about church if you were Catholic. Stillwater had   was  that Stillwater? No, it was New York City, I think. They had masses  16  J. Linehan  Wilhelm  C. Linehan  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  down in the basement of one building and then upstairs in another one.  You could go to church a lot of times there.  I think you   ve already asked the question about my grandparents, Jean   s  parents, what they thought about her joining, but how about her sisters?  What did Shan or Mother or Anna Mary think about your joining the  Waves?  I don   t know. I don   t think they ever said much about it. Mother thought  it was great for me,  that  it would be great for me. And my dad, no, he  was mad about it. So, I didn   t tell him I was even thinking about it when  I went to Tulsa, because I thought I   d better go and have my physical  exam there because maybe they would refuse me and I wouldn   t have to  tell them anything, then. (Laughter) But they didn   t refuse me, of course.  They were trying to get more, and I didn   t realize that, and so they really  accepted me and said my health was fine and everything and that they  would hear from me again. They had to send in a report on me to  someplace, I don   t know where they had to send it, from Tulsa to I don   t  know.  What did Po say when you told him?  Oh, I don   t know what he said, but he was mad. Mother said,    Well,  she   s an adult and she wants to go. We have to back her.    And my  mother said,    You mustn   t have thought that we were very good parents  if you were afraid she was going to go and fall for those sailors.     (Laughter) That   s what Daddy was worried about. He didn   t want me  to   and I said,    Heavens  I didn   t want to see the sailors. I wanted to see  the world     I asked for either California or Florida so I could see  something different from Oklahoma.  Was your father in the military?  No. He just thought, I guess, that sailors were, I don   t know what, but     Did your mother talk him into it?  I guess she did because it was too late. I had already signed up, you  know. I had to go to Tulsa for the examination, so I had to sign stuff  there that I had already signed. So, I don   t know how I   d get out of it.  Anyway, he finally gave in.  Were you always kind of independent?  I guess so. I don   t know. I was second to the youngest of the family. I  had three older sisters and one younger. They were all married but me.  17  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  J. Linehan  Wilhelm  Larson  Well, the younger one wasn   t married yet when I went in. Rita wasn   t  married then, but the other ones were.  So, once you got out of the Navy, what was it like coming home, when  you came back to Bartlesville?  Well, I went back to work right away. I don   t know. I was just back  again, (Laughs) and I wanted to work so I could get vacation and could  go on a trip some place.  So, you like to travel?  Yes.  Did you go other places over the years when you got your vacations?  Yes. I think the first vacation I went on was with   Anna Mary and  Charles were going over to a fishing thing in Arkansas, and I went with  them because I only had a week   s vacation. You had to work more than  a year to get two weeks of vacation, and then finally you could get three  weeks.  Where were some of the favorite places that you   ve traveled to that you  really enjoyed?  I think Italy would be the most interesting, don   t you? And France was  pretty interesting, but      Yes, Italy was good, but didn   t you go to Egypt?  Yes, but I wouldn   t go back. Well, those people are wild over there, you  know. It was terrible in  Cairo . Well, it was so noisy. Terrible. The  people   they have traffic lights, and it   s a big city, but they don   t pay  any attention to the traffic lights. Here comes a man pulling a wagon  with his horse, and he   s got a wagon full of trees and stuff. He doesn   t  pay any attention to any traffic lights. They honk horns at him. There   s a  lot of horns honking, and they have from those buildings, up in the top  of the buildings, they radio religious stories, but you don   t understand  them unless you   re Egyptian, because it   s their language. And it   s not  just every hour or something. It seems like it   s every few minutes.  They   re radioing it, and they   ve got that going, and then they   ve got  ambulances going because they have terrible wrecks over there, and we  were so glad to get out of there to go around Egypt and see more of the  history of it, you know. But I was glad to   I wouldn   t go back again.  Well, getting back to the Waves real quickly, did you ever get any  18  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  Larson  Wilhelm  benefits from the Navy or any recognition after you left?  No, no. It was just mostly enjoying the country and seeing different  sights and beautiful rivers and stuff, you know.  Would you do it all over again if you had the chance? Going back into  the Waves?  They don   t have it anymore.  But if you had the choice to make the decision again, like when you were  younger. Did you enjoy it a lot?  They wouldn   t let us on the ships, but now, of course, they even have  nurses on the ship, so they let them places where they didn   t let us  before. They were pretty particular, and I guess it was a good thing.  Are there any other stories you wanted to tell us?  No, I don   t think so. I   m just glad I did it.  Well, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for sharing your  stories with us.  Oh, well, you   re welcome.  -------  -------
