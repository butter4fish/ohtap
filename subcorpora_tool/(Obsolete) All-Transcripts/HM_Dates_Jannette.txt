Story_ID: 6136
Speaker 1: I want to start out asking you about your father.  If you could give his name and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, what you know about his background.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Moses Oliver Lake and he is--was the son of Reverend Moses Oliver Lake, who was a preacher who started out in West Virginia and then was in Annapolis [Maryland].  And then was--by the time my father was about seven years old, they moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and Metropolitan Methodist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] was the church that he was involved in establishing in the city.  They left Annapolis very hurriedly.  It's an interesting story, I don't know if you want to hear it all but they left Annapolis very hurriedly, because my father was a sort of maverick child.  And he and a friend--a white friend--did something where a barn in Annapolis caught on fire and burned down.  And they realized that he was going to be in a lot of trouble.  At seven years old, they were gonna accuse him.  So his father actually was in Baltimore at the time and his mother took all the children--he was the youngest--took all the children and bundled them up and drove--or got on a bus.  I don't know how they got there but they left immediately.  Because they thought that he'd be lynched or murdered, if they didn't get out of town so they left and went to Baltimore.  And at the time, she had been teaching in the rural parts of the area.  But when she got to Baltimore, she could not teach, because she wasn't certified so she had to become a maid.  And so she was working as a maid and was staying, you know, all week long.  So, her daughter had to basically work with helping to raise the three boys who were younger.  And so there was animus between them, I guess, for the rest of their lives, because they felt that she shouldn't tell them what to do.  And so, you know, it was kind of--not a very pleasant situation.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about his growing up at all? Any part of it?  Did your father ever--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He talked quite a bit about it because at one point, he wanted me to write it all down and put it into a book form.  And, you know, we had a lot of conversations about that.  He told me a number of little stories that were interesting to hear.  As I say, he was a maverick type of child and with his mother being away, he decided that he didn't have to obey his sister.  And so he was in the street and his sister and brother--and brothers actually--his oldest brother was not as much involved.  But his oldest sister and his brother were very involved in their schoolwork and were very, very focused on doing what they were supposed to do.  And did well in school and went to Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and, you know, got degrees and that sort of thing.  And my father, of course, was out on the street saying, "He had to--he had to find ways to make money."  And so he was involved in that.  Of course, he did a--things that a young boy would do that were wrong.  I mean he would steal pies from the bakery.  He told me about how there was a baker--bakery shop over on Baker Street, actually, in Baltimore and he and other boys would go there and they would steal the pies.  And sometimes they would sell them.  Sometimes they would eat them.  What else did he do? I mean all kinds of things, you know.  They'd steal ice off of the railroad cars that were coming by on the B&O [Baltimore and Ohio] railroad tracks nearby--near where they lived.  And coal--and they would either sell it or do something in order to make money.  So he was always in that mode of trying to figure out a way to make some money as a young man--teenager.
Speaker 1: So he was--he was his father's probably worst nightmare, huh?
Speaker 2: I think so.  Now his father died soon after they came to Baltimore.  I think if his father had lived, I think that might have been a little different but with his father having died of a heart attack--and I think he was about eight when that happened.  His mother is off now going to be a maid all week long and coming home only on the weekends.  His sister and brother are bookish are very focused on doing work and so he was sort of left to his own devices, and went off and did all these awful things that he knows were wrong.  One thing that he did that he talked about was that he had a friend who--and I guess they were about eight years old at the time and they went down to the area--the Inner Harbor [Baltimore, Maryland], which was not at all the way it is today.  It's a lovely place today, but it was really very ugly, and you know, things were falling apart in decay and that sort of thing.  At any rate, they went down to the bay--to this area where the Inner Harbor is and they--neither one could swim.  And they got on a board and decided they were going to go out in the water and went out in the water.  And then, the other boy went down in the water, he said--you know, he said, "He went down in the water.  And I told him to come back.  And he didn't come back." So then he made his way back to shore and then he went home to--to the boy's house.  And he said, "You know--" Butch, I think his name was--he said, "Butch won't come out of the water" and took his mother down there and showed him where he was in the water.  Of course, he had drowned, you know, traumatic things like that happened in his life and I guess in some ways they affected him.  As it turned out, he and my mother met when they were in high school and sixteen years old and my sister was born at that time.  And then, my mother was very focused on helping us to grow.  And she, in fact, always had in mind we were gonna get Ph.D.s and go to--you know, be wonderful teachers and all that sort of thing.  And it was so funny because when I finally got my degree, she said, "I don't know what took you so long."
Story_ID: 6137
Speaker 1: Now let's see, I was talking about my father.  Okay.  One of the things that happened to him was he became the state insurance commissioner, assistant state insurance commissioner.  Because what happened was he became a hustler so he started selling things and he's a born salesman.  And so he was selling liquor because that was what you could do if you were an African American male.  But he also was selling insurance to people and eventually he worked his way into the system and was really good at what he did.  So that was good that he was able to use that skill and talent for a man who didn't finish high school and who was able to use that skill and grow as a result.
Story_ID: 6138
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about your mother--.
Speaker 2: Your mother--and just--you obviously had profound love for your mother.  Okay.  Can you talk about, about--give her name, and just talk about her.  Did she talk about her growing up--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 2: And her family and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes, yeah--(pause)--my mother's name was Iantha Alexander Lake, (crying) and, she grew up very poor.
Speaker 2: I'm awfully sorry.
Speaker 1: This is unbelievable.  Anyway, I don't know.  Anyway, she grew up very poor.  Her mother died when she was about five years old, and she had a brother and a sister, and they wound up in orphanages in the city of Baltimore [Maryland].  And so she had a very, very traumatic growing up.  And she was really sort of looking for love in the wrong places, as she always said.  And when she met my father [Moses Oliver Lake], of course, she was sixteen years old and, you know, he was someone who seemed to show her affection.  So, obviously she wound up married at a young age--teenage mother, a very determined young woman.  As I mentioned to you earlier, she was 4 [feet] 11 [inches] and weighed ninety-five pounds.  And I remember when I was about eleven years old, I looked at her, and I was growing taller and I said, "Are you getting short?" She said, "No, you are getting tall," 'cause I was looking down on her from the time I was about eleven years old.  And, of course, I was the tall one in my family.  And, of course, students laugh at that, 'cause, you know, I'm 5 [feet] 2 and three-quarters [inches].  I was most of my life.  And everybody else, including my father was--he was at eye-level with me but everybody else was, you know, 4 [feet] 11 [inches], five feet tall.  So I thought I was tall 'til I was probably an adult and people started saying "shorty," and I thought, "Who are they talking to? I'm not short." So that's kind of an interesting thing.  But, you know, she was a very dedicated person, working hard with her three girls and determined that we were gonna go to Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], because she--during the Depression, recognized that teachers still worked even though other people did not in the Depression.  And so she said, "You're gonna be a teacher."  And so I had said, "Well I wanted to be a journalist," 'cause I had been writing for the newspaper when I was in junior high school [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] and high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And I was the editor of the paper and editor of this and that, you know.  And I had said something and she said, "Well no.  You're gonna be a teacher first.  And then if you wanna be a journalist, that's fine."  Which is interesting 'cause its turned out that I've done both, sort of, because of what I do now.  But, you know, she said, "You're gonna go to Coppin."  Which is--which was free, you know, I mean it was twenty-five dollars a year, as it turned out.  And then you had to buy books but other than that, you really didn't have a lot of expense.  And we walked from the projects where we lived to Coppin up on North Avenue at the time.  And it was, you know, it was a good way to do.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you, do you know what made her--and her background, what made her so determined?
Speaker 1: You know, I've often thought about that because I can't imagine at sixteen being able to figure out that I was gonna make these children grow and do and all that sort of thing.  But one of the things was that she saw examples in the neighborhood of people who were teachers, and in her church.  And she felt that if she really worked hard, maybe we could be like those people that she admired so much.  And she saw people who had children who took care of them and who handled themselves in a certain way and so she tried to follow that example.  And as I mentioned to you, she made all of our clothes up until the time we were in high school, I think, when we decided that that stuff was corny and we were not gonna wear it anymore.  But she would dress us all alike and, you know, they'd watch for us to come because we were all dressed just alike going up the street.  We had music lessons.  We had piano lessons, and we had dance lessons.  Every kind of lesson you can think of, we had and my--one of my sisters actually is a dance instructor today because she had that experience, you know.  She would take us, put us in the car--rickety old car, and drive to New York [New York] so we could see plays.  We would sit up, you know, where your head needed oxygen at the very top, the cheapest seats.  But we were seeing plays on Broadway when we were, you know, seven, eight years old.  Because she thought you needed that broadening of the experience to know something about the world beyond the projects.  So I always thought, you know--what I thought, I was doing all those things? I felt, no, I don't think so.
Story_ID: 6139
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory? Do you have an earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I remember early Christmases, where we would have, you know, Christmas gifts that she had made and things like that.
Speaker 1: Do you--if you don't--the, the, the--you were born in the projects.  What projects were they?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Actually, we moved in the projects when I was about four or five years old.  McCulloh Homes [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: And what street were they on?
Speaker 2: Druid Hill Avenue, in the city of Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Can you describe Baltimore at that time? You know, what the community was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a very segregated city, as you might guess.  And we went to Booker T.--I mean we went to Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School, Number 122 [Baltimore, Maryland].  We had some really good teachers in that school.  I mean some of them were probably, if it hadn't been segregated, they would have been at the top of their game in the field, whatever the field might be.  I remember we had a music instructor who was absolutely phenomenal.  I mean, you know, just thinking about the talent that he had and what he could have done with it, if there hadn't been segregation.  But we were fortunate enough to have him there.  And he was just so driven to teach us.  I mean we had teachers who--a geography teacher, a history teacher--it was a school that had the very best.  And so they were extracting the best from us and telling us, you know, about what we should do.  I thought they were making it up. (pause, crying)
Speaker 1: If you--if you could take yourself back, can you just describe to me--you know, 'cause we all when we think back have ideas of either, you know, maybe sights, smells or sounds that remind us of our childhood.  And I was wondering if you could do that, you know, think back to sort of growing up.  Either any smells of the neighborhood or food or--.
Speaker 2: Well I guess my mother's [Iantha Alexander Lake] cornbread and rolls, 'cause she could make some really good food.  And actually, in later years, she was not a good cook, I found out.  But she could make those two things.  But she wasn't interested in culinary arts at all.  Sewing, hair--she used to do hair for people in the neighborhood.  That's how she made money and she would sew.  So, she would make things for people, garments, clothes for the children and she would do people's hair.  Those were her ways of making extra money.  And as a result, you know, even today I can do my hair pretty well in between time.  So that I don't have to at every moment be, you know, locked into going to the hairdresser.  So I mean that's one of the things I remember.  That's one of the smells too.
Speaker 1: Of hair?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Now can you share with any other memories of growing up in your household? Any times like--.
Speaker 2: Well my father [Moses Oliver Lake] and mother actually finally separated 'cause they were not getting along.  I keep thinking it's falling off.  They were not getting along so when I was about eleven years old, they finally separated and got divorced.  And my mother had been the main parent anyway because he had been still out there in the street, making money, or thinking of ways to do so.  He opened--he opened two cleaning establishments as we were youngsters.  And he would go to the Royal Theater on Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore [Maryland], where African Americans would come for shows.  And they would--you know, he would get to see them on the stage and that was kind of exciting 'cause every once in awhile; we'd get to go and see a show there.  But he was the person who did the cleaning for the people.  And so he--they knew him on a first-name basis.  And, you know, I remember him hustling around with all those clothes and, you know--so that was something that he did.  And, of course, they didn't do all that well those two businesses and they finally folded.  But, you know, he had a little run of really feeling good about himself and doing some things, you know--that kind of enterprise.
Story_ID: 6140
Speaker 1: What type of child were you, do you think?
Speaker 2: I was the good girl (laughs).  Yeah, but I'm the middle child.  My sister, Mabel, is two years older and my sister, Iantha, is three years younger.  And then my--my father [Moses Oliver Lake] had another child who is about twenty something years younger than we are.  And her name is Cheryl.  She was Cheryl Lake.  And so I was bookish, you know, and I was always reading, reading, reading all the time.  And pretty much stayed in the house and stayed close to my mother for some reason.  And my sister Mabel was always into finding out what was going on in the world.  And she was leading me in that direction from time to time, too, you know.  If I wanted to find out what's going on, I'd follow her.  And then, other than that, stay in and read.  So I had all kinds of books that I read through the years which really took me into other worlds and to an understanding of other people and other cultures.  I remember reading all the books about children in different parts of the world.  For some reason, I was intrigued by that, you know.  And I remember reading, you know, 'Little House on the Prairie' and all kinds of books.  And every Saturday she would take us to the library, Enoch Pratt Free Library [Baltimore, Maryland], and we would go and get a stack of books.  I actually read them, some of the others, I think, maybe weren't as interested.  But she had us really focused 'cause from the time that we were, I guess, born.  I mean from--I can always remember her reading to us, you know, as youngsters.
Speaker 1: Now when you would read the books, you know, and you said, "It took you other places."  What places did it take you in? What worlds did it open up?
Speaker 2: Well I read about children in China and Japan and India and in France and London [England, United Kingdom], I mean all those different books that were for children about children in other worlds so you understood their lives and, you know, a sense of how important the river was in China.  And how--is it the Yangtze River that they called it? How--that was what saved people.  People went to the river to be able to survive because they were able to get water to help get the windmill to go.  I mean it was all kinds of things that helped you understand and then, when I started teaching school I was always able to kind of relate the fact that wherever you go, you use the resources there to survive, you know.  Which was a interesting kind of thing to help children understand, you know, that that's how you survive in this world.  Particularly when you were first pioneering and people were first learning how to figure out how do we live from one day to the next and provide for our families from year to year.
Story_ID: 6141
Speaker 1: When you were at [Samuel] Coleridge-Taylor [Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland], were there any teachers that, you know, influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, I had my second grade teacher, whom I saw not so long ago.  As it turns out, she's not that much older than I am.  Because she was--it was probably her first teaching assignment and she--well let's say she was--she was maybe twenty and we were seven or eight, you know.  And she's still living and looking wonderful.  I said, "How come you look younger than I do,"--but Audrey Johnson Davis.  She was Audrey Johnson at the time and what is an interesting thing, my uncle--my father's brother, who became a major in the [U.S.] Army, but was doing social work, I believe, when he, as an undergraduate used to date her.  And so she then became my teacher and then she would stop over in the projects sometimes and visit with my mother who she know--whom she knew because of my uncle.  So that was kind of an interesting thing but she was one who influenced me.  Again, you know, high standards, extracting a lot from you, telling you that you could do.  I thought those teachers were making it up about segregation to make us work and that's so funny.  And I remember Julia Burns Carter who again was another teacher, who just really was very focused and hard working.  And there were just a host of them.
Speaker 1: So you thought that they were making it up because you hadn't experienced--you didn't know--where about--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I hadn't met any white people (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I just thought that was just--I said, "They're just telling us that, you know but I don't care.  I'm just gonna work anyway," you know.  But we all sort of thought that that was just a thing that they were making up.
Speaker 1: Now what subjects did you gravitate to?
Speaker 2: I guess I liked history and I liked English.  I wasn't particularly enamored of math.  I remember though, that at various points I began to--you know, the light bulb would go off and I would say, "Oh, I get it." And I think if I hadn't been so, sort of intimidated by the boys, I would have done better, you know.  And when I got to graduate school and I had to do statistics and math, I actually, you know, figured it out.  And then when I had to teach math as a--faculty member teaching, teaching fifth and sixth grades--and you had to learn it to understand it to teach it, that's when I began to recognize that math wasn't such an onerous thing as I had thought.
Speaker 1: There was a focus at that time more on boys doing that at times.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now you went to junior high.  Is it B. T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, which wasn't far from our home either.
Speaker 1: And was there anything about that experience that was significant? You were there probably sixth, seventh and eighth, or seventh, eighth and ninth?
Speaker 2: It was seventh, eighth, ninth.  And, you know, that's where--well one of the things that's interesting is I met lifelong friends in elementary school.  We started out together and we still see each other which is really funny.  And you'll see them, some of them in that book.  One friend, we met in kindergarten, Janet Powell was her name.  Smart, really smart and I was in competition with her.  There were--there was a group of--actually it wound up about twelve of us who were in competition.  But we started out the two of us being in competition and respecting each other, you know, at the same time that you competed.  You know, tried to do a good job of whatever you were doing but it was funny 'cause when we were going through school, I remember the twelve of us were competing so much, that sometimes they would say, "I didn't study a thing." And then they would do a hundred on the exam.  And you'd say (whispering), "I know she studied.  She had to.  'Cause she couldn't have got those grades without studying.  It doesn't just leap into your brain."  And so then, you know, you'd start saying, "Oh no, I didn't study either." And then you'd do well too.  So there was that kind of competition, you know.  But, you know, we're godparents to each other's children and all that sort of thing even today.
Story_ID: 6142
Speaker 1: So then you went to Frederick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was there--were you--was that like a sort of a continuation of your process as a young adult?
Speaker 2: Right, and we were in the three course, which is--that was the--you went in as 10-A3, which is the first semester of the tenth grade and then 10-B3 and then eleven and so forth.  So we were in the three course, which were the students who were considered to be the smart kids.  And, of course, I wanted to be one of those smart kids, you know.  And so did she and so did the rest of them.  And so there were about twelve of us who were more or less ostracized by the rest of the school because it was like, "They think they know everything.  People think they think they're cute" and stuff like that, you know.  And so you did have that.  And some of the students who were in that class dropped out because they didn't want the pressure of being, you know, thought of as trying to be elite.  Which was too bad in some ways, you know, because obviously, we need all kinds of people in the world.  If you have talents and skills, you ought to use them and it's just, you know, a shame that that was the case then and is the case today.  You have to fight the battle.  But I think it's worth it because for me, I was just driven to want to do the best I could with whatever I had.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] obviously, was taking great pride in this, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Driving.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Driving force.
Speaker 1: Driving force behind it.
Speaker 2: Now did you--would she like show disappointment if you didn't do well?
Speaker 1: What she would do would be--first in elementary school [at Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Baltimore, Maryland], she would sit with us and do homework with us every night.  And if we had projects, she was helping us get those projects done.  And I remember my sister--my older sister [Mabel Lake] was like, "I can do this myself.  I don't need your help," you know.  But I would always say--'cause I thought she needed to be needed so I would let her help me.
Story_ID: 6143
Speaker 1: I was asking about people in the community.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, Thelma Jackson Lawrence and she was a woman who--I mean absolutely was just devoted to her students [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And just loved them with a passion.  And was trying to understand it.  Because of her I understood literature and I understood [William] Shakespeare, in a way that I would never have without someone.  Because when she read it to us, it was so different from reading it and then she put the emphasis.  And then she would say, to one of our friends, "Clifton Monk, you think you are the be all and the end all," you know.  Quoting from Shakespeare, the be all and end all and that sort of thing and, of course, you got it then, you know.  And then, of course, she made him understand that he needed to sit down and, you know, pay attention instead of, you know, being the center of attention of whatever it was he was doing, and things like that.  She just made it resonate with you, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she really struck me as someone, you know.  And I had a few others, you know, a history teacher who was--who was very good.  I can't think of his name right now.
Story_ID: 6144
Speaker 1: 'The Afro-American' [newspaper], how predominant was it in your life? The newspaper there?  Since you're from Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 2: We were aware of it.  And my mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] would get it because there were--obviously there were things in there from time to time that we'd find of interest.  As I got older and it became, you know, screaming headlines with somebody's head on the front page and (laughs) stuff like that, it got so you would think, "I don't know about this."  It has, of course, come back full circle now and it is much more of a serious, serious publication.  And they're doing good things and I'm just so pleased about that.  But that was part of the reason too because we were not going to be accepted to be a journalist at the ['Baltimore] Sun' paper.  Certainly the only recourse would have been something like the 'Afro' and, you know, I understood my mother thinking, "Go to teach.  And then if you wanna do something, okay, that's fine."  So but the newspaper was marginal at those points in my life.
Story_ID: 6145
Speaker 1: Were you brought up in the church?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] when she got pregnant had a very unsatisfying experience with people in the church who considered that she had gone astray.  And so--and a bad example and that sort of thing so they didn't treat her very well.  And she had spent a lot of her energy and time in the church as she was growing up because that was the one place where she felt that she had a family.  And she sort of, you know, could not believe it, when they turned their backs on her.  And so she was very bitter about the church.  And so she would say, "Well, you know, if you wanna go to church, that's fine."  And then she would send us but she would not take us.  And Mabel [Lake], my sister when we got to be, you know, the age when we could walk to the church that wasn't that far away, I think she had in mind that she could meet up with some friends (laughs) and some people who she might be wanting to kind of interact with.  And so she was like, "Okay, we're gonna go to church."  So we'd all sort of get dressed and we would go.  And you know--but that was it.  It was not really an in depth experience.
Story_ID: 6146
Speaker 1: Any other anecdotes with your friends or things?  You know, between let's say junior high and high school? Any other things that formed you or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Well the twelve of us--in fact, there were more than that in this three class that I talked about.  In--we started in junior high school [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] where there were many of us.  And then got into this three course in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and stayed together that entire time.  And there were girls and boys.  So, there were about twenty-six students in that class.  And I ran into one of the fellows not so long ago, Howard Rawlings, and he was saying that some of the guys had gotten together from that class, and had gone out to, to have dinner and reminisced about the old times.  And they had jumped--just done this a few months ago.  So I mean that's kind of interesting.  And I said, "Well why didn't you invite the girls?  What's wrong with you," (laughs) you know.  And he said, "Oh well we would have had to pick and choose."  And I said, "I would have been among the ones you would have chosen."  (laughs) And he was laughing.  And so it was just, you know,  kind of a funny warm experience. But they stayed together.

Speaker 1: When you--when it was time for you to graduate, were you--were there--I mean was it assumed that you were gonna go on directly?
Speaker 2: To college?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The question was which one.  I got a scholarship to go to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] which was really, you know, great, you know, boost and all like that.  But that was--it was not enough money.  I mean it was some money but it wasn't enough to really--and we didn't have enough.  So, you know, it was Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] for me which as I say was much, much cheaper.  And we could walk back--and my sister [Mabel Lake] was at Coppin.  My mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] had already gotten her into Coppin.  And I say my mother had gotten her in, in that, you know, she pushed her to get good grades, so she could get in because they only took the top 10 percent in the school system at the time.  And so it was a privilege to go there and you were there with top achievers.  That's changed in more recent times and it's a different kind of focus right now but at that time.  So we were in there with students and there were two high schools in Baltimore [Maryland] for black students.  One was Douglass--Fredrick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  And the other was [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And so at Coppin we met some of the kids from the east side, who were so feared, you know.  'Cause we were the west side and, of course, you know, they were the top students from Dunbar and the top students from Douglass.  And we went through the program at Coppin, a wonderful education.  I mean strong good teachers who knew what they were doing, and did it well.
Speaker 1: Could you talk about the history of Coppin?
Speaker 2: Coppin State.  Fanny Jackson Coppin was an educator.  One of the first African American women to get a degree and I can't remember which one but probably in education.  And she was one who founded the college and so they named it for her.  And it's only had about three or four presidents as I recall.  The most recent President Calvin Burnett just retired after thirty years.  It was for girls when it first started out.  It was a normal school for teachers and it was for girls who wanted to be teachers.  And that changed, of course, as time passed.  And it was a normal school.  And then it was--Coppin College and then it was Coppin State College.  And that's what it still is today [sic, now Coppin State University].  Now it's a liberal arts focus, not so much education, although they still have an education arm or a component among the folks who take courses there.  But they take all--sort of courses today.
Speaker 1: I want you to put things in historical perspective in that--that the role that teachers played in African American society.  If you could just do that.  Because to be a teacher was to be really admired.
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean really revered and respected.  I'll never forget the one time we were--some of my friends and I were somewhere near where Thelma Jackson Lawrence lived.  And it was a Saturday.  And we saw her in pants.  And we were horrified.  We were like, (whispering), "Oh my God!  She has pants on."  You never expected it, you know.  They wore stockings and gloves (laughs), you know.  It was really--and you just didn't think of them as ever doing anything that was not respectable and upright.  And, you know, you just held them in such high esteem.  You never thought of them as bending in any way.  And yet she was a very warm person.  But I think that was part of what happened with my mother too, is that she revered and respected these teachers and these doctors who were in the neighborhood.  Which is one of the things we've lost in society today.  Where the people who have money move away from the rest of the community so the kids who don't have it in their families don't have examples that they can look up to and figure out how they can be better and make a better contribution.  And use their lives in a more constructive way.  So teachers had definitely an affect on our lives as we were growing up.
Speaker 1: Now when you were at Coppin, was your sister [Mabel Lake] also there at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was two years ahead of me.  And she--it's funny because she was always full of fun and life and, you know.  She played cards I guess every day (laughs) that she was at Coppin.  And smart.  I mean really a smart woman.  And it's--you know, you can see that today 'cause she does so many wonderful things.  But at the time I think she came out with Ds in courses because she had just, you know, played cards her way through and then gone to parties and just had a real good time.  And then when she decided she was gonna get a master's degree, she went back and she said, "You know, I've gotta fix this."  And so she did.  Got all As in the master's program.  And I'm sure she got all As in the Ph.D. program that she was in.  And just is doing remarkably wonderful work today as a reading specialist.
Speaker 1: And just helping youngsters in--and older people to in so many really important good ways.  But I was always chasing her because she was really innately smart and I had to work at being smart.  That was the difference.
Speaker 2: Now what do you think was unique about the education you received there?  And also was there any sort of inculcation as the role of the teacher, you know?  Did they talk at all about, you know, the role that you would play?  Or, you know?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I remember them talking about what we needed to do and what we had to do.  I mean they challenged us.  I can't think of her name; there was a teacher who taught me English at Coppin and she would again read from different great works and then talk about what it meant.  Interpret it for us.  Help us understand it.  And something about the 'Catbird Seat' was one of the stories that she read and interpreted for us.  And she talked about your having to have the imagination to conceive and then the will to do.  And she had this southern accent.  I can hear her now.  And she was challenging us to say, you know, "We would, in fact, have the imagination and the will" and go out there and do some things with our lives.  And not just be, you know, vegetales--vegetables of society just vegetating.  Just sitting there, but actually making a contribution.  So, you had people like that who really, really were inspiring.
Speaker 2: And are there other things that--were you ever at a point when you were at Coppin when you said, "I don't wanna do this."  Was there any of that?  Or you were totally on a path of commitment to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: I was, I was totally focused on that.  And, I think there's never been any job that I've ever done that I didn't really love.  I mean I loved teaching and then when I got into--when I was doing television, I loved doing that.  And then, you know, I got into administration.  I didn't plan to get into administration 'cause I always said, "I would never wanted to be in administration 'cause everybody hates the administrators.  And give them a hard time all the time."  And then it just sort of happened, you know.  Somebody asked me, "Would you do this" and I thought, "Well maybe I'll try it," you know, 'cause it was paying more money than teaching was.  I said, "Well I can give it a shot."  (laughs) And, of course, here I am.  What ten years later, no fifteen years later and I'm still in it.
Speaker 2: Now when you graduated what year was it from Coppin?
Speaker 1: From Coppin it was 1958.
Story_ID: 6148
Speaker 1: Where did you go work at that point?
Speaker 2: In fifty--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh.  Oh yes.  Okay.  In the Baltimore City [Public Schools, Baltimore, Maryland]--.
Speaker 2: --public school.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, public schools.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right, from '58 [1958] through '63 [1963] and that's when I went and started getting--working on a master's degree.  And then wound up doing the school shows for about eleven years.  And then had four children in that period.  And then started teaching at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And I can't remember the see--now--at one point I did the commercial television for about a year.  I think it was after Morgan in the middle.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But I wanna go back to your first classroom experience.
Speaker 2: Was it what you were--I mean was it a good experience?  Did you like--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I taught at Public School Number 137 [Baltimore, Maryland] and it was an interesting experience.  The students there were--some of them were not really motivated.  Some of them were tough kids.  I think the first year that I taught I had a sort of middle class.  I mean it was not the top, not the bottom, but sort of in the middle.  And one of the things that I wanted to do was try to make them want to learn.  And I just felt compelled to try to motivate them, you know.  And you know, you can get burned out like that.  But it was the first year and so I was like into it you know.  And I think that I was able to get some of them really focused, you know.  I remember the second year I got the bottom group of students made of--up--mostly of these really tough, tough boys.  Some of them taller than me.  And I tried to out psych them--you know.  The boy who was the toughest one in the class---one of things I did is I took them to the jail, the local jail.  And we had a tour there so they could see what it was like, you know.  I remember that experience and they were like, "Oh Lord.  In that little tiny room.  And then you could only go to the bathroom over there--."  I mean it was like, you know, they really were, I think some of them might have even been traumatized a little bit but I thought it was a good thing for them to learn 'cause I wanted them to see the tough side of life.  But there was this really tough kid who was big and old and shouldn't have been in that class anyway 'cause he should've passed earlier.  But there was a little girl who came into the class at the same time from out of town.  Cute as a button and he just was enamored of this child.  And I thought, "Okay, now I've got him," you know, because I used her to make him behave.  And one of the things that we did was I was teaching geography and we were learning the Schottische, so that they could learn a dance from another country.  And they learned about the geography of the country and then, you know, various things about the history of the country.  And then at the end of the year when they had this, you know, big affair in the auditorium, where people did various presentations, they were gonna do the Schottische to show what they had learned during the year.  And so I dangled it over his head all year long that he was not gonna get to dance with her if he didn't behave himself, you know.  And I can't remember all the things that I did but I do recall at one point I said, "That's it.  You're not gonna have--that--you know.  You're not partners any more."  And, you know, he would have to come out.  And then he would apologize and he would say, "I'm gonna do right, you know."  And, you know, he really did try.  And when he was on that stage at the end of that year and those other people who--some of the teachers were kind of laughing 'cause they thought, "They've given the young teacher these jerks to work with" (laughs).  And they figured that, you know, "We'll see what happens with her by the end of this year with these tough kids."  And they were in there dancing on that stage and being just as nice and following direction and doing what they were told.  It was really a kind of a good point for me, you know, to see that we could help these kids to do something worthwhile, creative and fun at the same time.  And I don't know what happened to those children.  Every once in a while I see a few of them, you know but that was a challenge.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Were you at the same school for those six years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually it was five years.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Five years.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Same school.  And, in fact, they were getting ready to transfer me to another school, which was a--gonna be a demonstration school when I left.  And but most of my experience at the elementary school level was with that [Public School Number] 137 the entire time.  One of the things that I did too that I found that was helpful I realized that taking those standardized tests was a challenge for students because they hadn't had the experience of coloring in those little--you know, with that black pen in those lines.  And so what I did all year long was to give them their reading examination at least once a month where it was that, that they had to do that on a--you now--it was mimeograph paper at the time that purple and white.  And I would make up the test for the examination for the reading that they were doing.  And then they would have to answer the questions that way.  To get them so that they could get that practice, you know.  Which I--I mean now I think it really was a good thing to do but at the time I didn't really--you know, I was just sort of trying to find a way to help them do better.  And they did so much (laughs) better on the dumb test.  People were like, "What did--," you know, (laughs) and, you know, I shared with them what I had done but they really did--and part of it is practice.  It really is you know.
Story_ID: 6149
Speaker 1: Now did you--did you find that--I mean in those first five years--and the training that you had received--did you find the training totally applicable?  Were there things that were you found had to be integrated just from a practical standpoint?  That you hadn't learned and just difference between--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, learning how to teach and actually being in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Well see when I was at Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], they had you to do practice teaching.  And so you had to go to two different places in your senior year and be with a teacher who was actually a seasoned teacher.  And I had two really good people who were--who I worked with.  And there were two of us in a class together--in a classroom together with a seasoned teacher and we would teach under her supervision basically.  So by the time I got out there on my own, I thought I knew it all.  I mean I was real ready.  I thought, "Yep, I've got this.  I know how to do this."  And then I also had my older sister [Mabel Lake].  At one point I had said, "You know, I decided I'm not gonna do a lesson plan.  I don't think you need to do that.  It's just ridiculous."  And I had a supervisor coming in to see me and I had said, "I was just gonna take a stand."  And she said, "No, you're not (laughs).  You're gonna do a lesson plan.  And you're gonna do it right because otherwise you're gonna have your name as mud for the rest of the time you have a career in the Baltimore [Maryland] City school system."  And she was right, you know.  So I said, "Oh okay.  Well all right.  I won't take a stand this time" (laughs).  But there was a controversy at the time or a discussion anyway about whether or not you needed lesson plans.  Or whether you should have a free flowing kind of atmosphere, you know.  And I had decided free flowing was good.  "No.  You're not gonna do that.  You're gonna--."  (laughs) And, you know--and from that point on--I mean that was in the early years of my teaching but from that point on I did lessons-lesson plans.  And I do think that they--you have to have a guide.
Speaker 1: And that was the time when they were even probably starting with new math and things like that. Because I know I had felt like I never learned math because of the new math.
Speaker 2: Ah!  I'll tell you.  I mean some of it is so confusing for youngsters who are trying to get the basics, you know.  I mean it's like when they threw out phonics.  I was ready to throw up my hands and just walk away.  I mean how can you possibly have a tool to unlock words if you don't have phonics?  What kind of stupidity is that?  Anyway, that--during the time when I was there, yes we were doing phonics and I do think it gave students the tools.
Speaker 1: Do you think education-wise at the time that you were teaching, do you think that they were better teachers than you see today?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I do.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Maybe it's because--I don't know.  It was more selective because there were fewer people who were going into it from all different places.  I don't know.  I remember at one of the schools where I was a student teacher, we had people who were clearly not prepared.  I mean as I mention--I felt like they were spreading ignorance instead of really teaching because some of them didn't have command of the English language.  And did not have a sense of professionalism.  And for them to be in charge of students was horrifying to me.  Now that was back many moons ago.  I think it's gotten worse and we see people now who are not focused on being professional and having control of the subject matters that they're teaching or supposed to be teaching.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that happened?  You know, what was--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I think the standards were loosened.  And I think we had people going through elementary, junior high, high school and then into college who were ill prepared.  And probably should not in some instances have even been in college unless they had done some remediation before.  So we've got some real issues here that need to be fixed and, of course, part of it was having a warm body in the room to warehouse the children, as opposed to dedicated teachers.  I mean the difference between absolutely dedicated teachers with a dream--from teaching into all kinds of other fields.  I mean we've got people now who are going into businesses, who are going into technology, you know, who are doing all sorts of things.  Particularly after desegregation, when, you know, at one point you had to teach if you were African American and you were at all focused on learning and knowledge and had some intelligence.  You either were a teacher or you worked at the post office.  I think those were the ones, you know, for the most part.  Those were your choices.  And so you had the cream of the crop going into teaching.  And now you have a lot of the cream of the crop doing so many other things.  Many, many choices.  So we're left with a situation that's really not good and I don't know when our society is gonna realize that--that teaching is our foundation of the future.  And if we're not serious about helping young people prepare themselves to be contributors to society, in whatever way their talents take them, what are we saying about the future?  I am astounded at what we pay people to play baseball or whatever those sports are and compare that to what we give teachers.
Story_ID: 6150
Speaker 1: In this whole process while you were teaching at Maryland public schools, you met your husband [Victor Dates].  Right?  And got--?
Speaker 2: Now let's see.  I met him at Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I was at Coppin.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Oh you met him at Coppin.  You were at Coppin, Okay.
Speaker 2: We were nineteen.  And he was at [The] John Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and I was in Coppin.  And the two of us met because we went to the post office to get jobs for the Christmas time.  At Christmas time, they would hire extra people to work and they paid you very well.  I started working when I was thirteen years old actually though.  I worked at a place that was across the street from my house in the projects [McCulloh Homes, Baltimore, Maryland], Joe's Department Store.  It was actually an department store 'cause it was so small but I worked there, 'cause my sister [Mabel Lake] had worked there.  And she had told Joe that she thought that I could work there too.  And so I did but, you know, I did that as a part-time job in order to have enough money to be able to, you know, get to school and back.  And then I found out about this opportunity where you could work at the post office and so I was gonna, you know, just kind of do less at Joe's and work at the post office.  And he was in the line behind me and we started talking.  And that's where I met him, you know.
Speaker 1: And you got married, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Two years later?
Speaker 2: Actually four, four years later.
Speaker 1: Four, four years later--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We met--we met in--what was it?  '56 [1956] and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And you got married?
Speaker 2: --and married in '60 [1960].
Story_ID: 6151
Speaker 1: So you leave Baltimore [City] Public Schools [Baltimore, Maryland].  Do you go immediately to become a TV demonstration teacher?  And what is a TV demonstration teacher?
Speaker 2: Well it was working for the Baltimore City Public School system teaching television shows.  And what I did was--it was a precursor to public broadcasting.  I taught math and science and social studies and history and a series that was a special series on black history.  And so those were the kinds of things that I taught for about eleven years so I was on all three channels in Baltimore at one time or another, teaching the school shows.  And I got to be known (laughs) all over the state because everybody would see the teacher of the school shows.  It was really kind of interesting.
Speaker 1: But why did this--do you know what this was sort of a move towards?  Or had there been funding for it?  I mean it just--?
Speaker 2: It was experimental.  They thought that something--educational television was important to some of the educators.  And they thought, if we had some of the best teachers on television teaching these subjects, then it would be used by some of the teachers in the classroom to get the students focused.  And then they would followed-up.  And so I would teach math, for example.  And then, fractions at second grade level.  And then I would go to the classroom, of course, it was live when we started--at nine in the morning, which is prime time today, for other things certainly not educational publishing on commercial stations--but these were the three commercial stations.  And then I would go and do some follow-up in the classroom from time to time with some of the students.  I would see how they did and that sort of thing.  We prepared teacher guides and, you know--give them instructions about what they should do before, during and after the show itself, and that sort of thing.  Then the series that I did called 'The Black American in History' I think it was.
Speaker 1: 'The Negro in U.S. History'.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) 'The Negro in U.S.--,' that's right.  That's right.  And--.
Speaker 1: It was a two part series.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And that was done, you know, with some people other than myself helping to pull all of it together.  I had people who were  in the history department at the high school level in Baltimore, who were, you know, world re--I mean renowned respected folks.  Who, you know, came up with some ideas about how we should present it and what should be included.  And what should be excluded and that  sort of thing.  So it was a good series, I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: And this was a time also that black studies was just coming into it's--you know, the black studies was still--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --very new.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: I mean it had been--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is '68 [1968] as I recall and, you know, we had the riots.  And you had all kinds of upheaval.  And you had civil rights having really taken I think--it had made people really understand the concerns of people in the black community.  And so you had people really interested and eager to do something and the TV stations particularly.  I think about WBAL [Baltimore, Maryland] which was the station I wound up doing most with--you know, they really were focused.  They're getting ready to have their 55th anniversary and they invited everybody back who had worked at the station.  We're gonna have a big party from all the people who worked there.  Some of whom are in major stations today and major mark--and on national and network television who're coming back to celebrate with them.  But they were very focused on trying to do something of substance.  And this series actually wound up airing about three times because they showed it once in every week and then they showed again a couple of other times 'cause it got good reception.
Story_ID: 6152
Speaker 1: Well I wanna go back, you know, and ask about how even 'North Star' [television series] began?  How the program--?  Because you--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because you--In this--You've actually sort of morphed careers at this point.
Speaker 2: Mm--hm, mm--hm.
Speaker 1: I mean your career has sort of taken on--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: A whole different--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Nothing planned.  I mean, you know, whatever happened wasn't planned.  'Cause my thinking was, "Okay, so I'll be a teacher.  That's fine."  And then opportunities came up.  And I thought, "Well maybe I'll try that."  You know.  What happened with 'North Star', it had started about a year or so before I got involved.  And the woman who was on--Pam Fields was her name--left because she got married.  And so I had done the school shows. And Sidney King, who was the general manager of the TV station called me.  And I had just had my fourth child.  He was five months old.  And he said, "Would you be interested in doing commercial television?  Would you be interested in coming on board as the cohost with Bob Cole on 'North Star'?" And I said, "Each time I've had a baby I've stayed home for a year at least."  You know.  And, you know, I said this in my head.  I didn't say it to him.  I said, "Well let me get back to you.  It sounds intriguing."  You know, how you do.  And then I started thinking about it. I thought, he's only five months old. You know.  I'm supposed to be here at least 'til he's twelve months when he can walk a little bit, you know.  But my mother-in-law was there.  And she was very willing to help and all that.  You know.  And so I said, "Yes."  You know, I thought, "Well I could try it at least for a year.  And, you know, if it doesn't work out, fine."  You know.  And so that's how I got into it.  And it was just grueling.  Because, you know.  I had four children.  They all needed me.  And then I was also at the beck and call of these celebrities who were annoyed at any little thing.  'Cause we were sort of in charge of them while they were there.  And we had to be at their beck and call.  And oh Lord!  It was just--And, you know.  And then, of course, we were out in the community.  And, you know, shooting took so long, as you well know.  And it was even longer then.  So the least little thing--you had a cameraman, you had a sound person.  And then a grip person and, you know.  It's a major operation.  Every place you went I mean it was like--I felt like I was sitting there for days when it was like hours, you know.  But nonetheless we ran into some racism too.  Because one of the things that happened was when we'd take the film back to the TV station, we'd take it into the room where you're supposed to then put it in and have it get processed.  And the people who were in charge of processing were people who were the technicians.  You know, they were all white.  And they did not like the fact that we had this show where we had all this money to go into this shoot all the time--these shoots all the time.  And our film would turn out green.  You know.  We're like "Green film again? Now how did that happen?"  And then, you know, they'd have some explanation.  "Oh well we put a little too much of this--."  But other people's film wasn't turning out green.  And Bob and I were just tearing our hair out. And we, you know, we appealed to the higher management and said, "You know, there's something wrong here."  And, of course, you know, as time passed it got a little better.  Of course, today, you don't have to have that problem.  Because they don't, you know, have the film processed and we're using the videotapes.  So they're instantaneous just about.  But that was one of the experiences that we had with 'North Star'.  It was a wonderful experience on a lot of levels.
Speaker 1: What did you learn though?  I mean it's different being a teacher.  Or even a classroom demonstration teacher, and then going to a--you know, being on commercial TV.  And--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well it was sort of--you know, that journalistic dance that I was interested in.  You know.  I was the--I was the anchor of this magazine. And I was getting to write which I loved to do.  Write these stories and then tell these stories--And then people were responding.  I mean they loved the stories.  Because--and they would almost always--and, you know, Sid King I remember saying to me, "We have never had this happen to this station before."  Where every time we showed--I had a show, we would get requests from people to get a copy of the tape.  So we would have to then send away, have it processed and then get them a copy.  And they would have to pay about $100.  And it was an unbelievable phenomenon.  But they were getting--and it was--you know, we--they were fifteen minute segments that we would have for example.  And in fact, I have a copy of one of the tapes here.  And it would be about something that was going on in the community, told from different angles.  So that we told the story in a balanced way, using journalistic standards and that sort of thing.  And it was just--we were doing I think a service for the community.  And at the same time, entertaining people.  'Cause it was--they were learning something. And also it was done in a way that was intriguing, I thought, you know.
Story_ID: 6153
Speaker 1: Do you have one or two favorite stories that you remember [from hosting 'North Star' television series]?
Speaker 2: I remember the time that I interviewed Minister [Louis] Farrakhan.  And I got a letter from the TV--from the general manager.  He said he had never seen a better interview in his entire twenty-five years.  I have a copy of that letter.  'Cause I was so taken with it.  And the thing is that I remember staying up all night long reading the book that he had written and articles and trying to really understand the man and understand the situation, you know?  And so then we got on the set.  And I was asking what I now know are tough questions.  And later on learned that those are the things journalists are supposed to do.  And I'd say things like, "You know, people in the community are afraid of the Black Muslims."  And his answers were so unbelievably smart. I mean the man is really brilliant.  And, you know, I don't say that easily.  But there're some things that I--you know, am--I take issue with him on.  But the fact is that he's a brilliant man.  And when he would answer in his sonorous way, it was just unbelievably dynamic, you know?  And so I was really following the story with him and ans--asking questions all the way.  And I had a series of questions I had in mind.  But I was asking the questions based on what he was saying.  And then I was also being he advocate for the people who didn't understand why he was saying that and trying to get him to go deeper, and help us to really get a understanding of what they were trying to do.  One of the things too was that they had a neighborhood school [in Baltimore, Maryland]--Black Muslims.  And the students were doing so well on the standardized tests in that school.  And right down the street you had students who were not doing well.  And, of course, his conversation about that was one of the things that's so true about that group.  And that is the family is so important.  The children are supposed to be learning and disciplined.  And they are supposed to have their parents to guide them.  The sort of things that my mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] had said that we had to do in our family.  Here this was a part of their philosophy.  So for me it got to be that I understood better a group that I was afraid of basically too.  And that I was not sure was thinking along the same lines that I thought was good for society.  Now there are some other things that they do that I don't agree with.  But that part of it, I thought, made sense.  So that really struck me.  It was a wonderful session.

Speaker 1: Did you find that in the show ['North Star']--was this the first time that a show like this had been in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: In Maryland?
Speaker 1: In Maryland.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Uh--huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So  it reached as you said, "The whole state."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And so did you--you became a state celebrity. Didn't you?
Speaker 2: Well sort of, yes.  In fact, people today still (laughing) recall that.  And then, of course, I've done other television since then.  But that was what started, I think--They knew me from the school shows.  Because it was on at 9:00 [A.M.].  And so parents were watching along with the students.  It wasn't a thing that was just channeled into the schools.  You know.  And it was commercial television.  So, you know.  I'd see people in the grocery store and they'd talk about what they had seen.  You know, and ask questions and stuff.  So it was kind of fun.
Speaker 1: And even those types of shows have sort of gone by the wayside of recent--right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: But was it viewed as a public affairs show?
Speaker 2: I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 6155
Speaker 1: At the same time [hosting television series 'North Star'] you're teaching at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] though.  Right?
Speaker 2: No.  I was off from Morgan at that time.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: I left there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You left there.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Speaker 1: But I thought you were at Morgan from 1972 to '77.
Speaker 2: I was.  I mean I was at Morgan from '72.  I left--I guess it was '71 that I went to Morgan.  I was there for about a year.  Left and did the TV series for about a year and then went back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now then why don't we talk about--But then you became assistant professor.  Right?  At Morgan?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And so--but at that time you had left the series.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you--'Cause this was a--You know, you're going from having been in K through 12--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's all I'm saying too--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, the shift.
Speaker 1: The shift.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And was that--Was there any difference there?  Or was--.
Speaker 2: I just sort of loved doing it.  You know. I mean it was figuring out how do you reach these kids?  Now the thing is when I started--This was an interesting thing.  I was looking to leave the television series that I was doing, you know, with the Baltimore state school system.  I was teaching the TV shows classroom instruction.  I had had a maternity leave.  They had someone to take my place.  This was the third time or fourth time that, that had occurred.  So by then I guess they had gotten tired of me (laughs).  They're thinking, "She's gonna have another baby in another couple of years." Which wasn't true.  But anyway they thought so.  So they had someone take my place.  So I said, "Well okay, fine.  I'll find a job somewhere else," you know.  And so I said that to my sister.  And she said, "Hey, listen, they were trying to get me to teach reading out at Morgan.  Why don't you go out there and talk to them.  You know, you can teach reading," you know.  Well--and, of course, I had the same background she had basically too.  So I started teaching reading at Morgan.  And then I had been there only a little while and they said, "Wait a minute.  We're getting ready to start a telecommunications program here.  And you would be perfect to help us to do that."  Which is how I met up with Tom Cripps.  So Thomas Cripps and I and a guy named Allen Kennedy got together and worked on designing our telecommunications program for Morgan State.  And then I moved from reading over there.  And I started teaching television courses.  I taught, you know, a history of broadcasting and film.  You know, all sort of things over there in that department.
Story_ID: 6156
Speaker 1: And did that [teaching television courses at Morgan State University. Baltimore, Maryland]  open up a new world for you in many ways that you had--I mean knowing the background.  It's one thing being on the air.  But knowing sort of the background and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It did in a lot of ways.  Because for one thing Thomas Cripps and I then started doing this television series for Morgan, which was a black history series similar to what I had done for the Baltimore City Schools.  And, you know, he and I really were working with people on the faculty.  I remember [James] Jim Lewis, who was the artist.  And who--there's a gallery named for him at Morgan now.  But we did something with him.  We were really showcasing faculty members at Morgan.  And also doing some history.  You know.  And history of black Americans at the same time that we were doing showcasing of Morgan faculty members.  It was--you know, I enjoyed that series.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about Tom Cripps?  Because you did so off camera. But can you--can you talk about him and--.
Speaker 2: Just a wonderful human being who has had a passion for history.  In particular for the film--films that had been done by, for and about African Americans.  And he's written the definitive scholarly work, in my opinion, on the African American participation in the film industry.  He's been at it for about thirty-five years.  He has archival collections in his basement of films from the various folks that he's studied.  He goes all over the world to collect information about the black films that he writes about.  He and I worked together on the series that I mentioned to you.  And he was the one who said to me, "You know, if you're gonna be in higher education, you oughta get the terminal degree."  And I said, "That sounds like a disease."  I was just teasing him.  You know.  And so he said, "No seriously.  You really should.  I mean so--You know, you're smart.  You could do it."  I said, "I'm a working mother.  I'm not a career girl."  He said, "If you're gonna be in higher education, you need the degree.  'Cause otherwise they're don't take you seriously."  So I said, "Oh well okay.  Maybe I should."  He said, "Go down to the library and look at--up some fellowships that they have. 'Cause they have fellowships of all sorts.  And you'll find one or two that might, you know work out.  And then you can see if you can qualify.  You know.  And I'll write a letter for you."  And so I said, "All right."  So I went down.  Of course, I wound up with thirty-five that I was applying for.  And wound up getting one that was really good.  The Ford Foundation Fellowship.  And got that for--and I did it--I got it for three years.  And so I started the Ph.D. program at University of Maryland College Park.  And I left--I left Morgan again.  I left there for two years to do course work.  And just went straight through doing the course work.  And then went back at the end of the second year. And was doing the dissertation while I was still teaching.  And, you know, it was--you know, it was a wonderful experience.  And I--I was really fortunate.  Because what I did was I focused on what I was gonna write about from the minute I walked in the door.  So every course that I--that I took I was writing to make sure that I was kind of refining what I wanted to do for my dissertation.  So by the time I got to the point of actually doing the prospectus for the dissertation, I didn't have to take the course.  So it cut out half a year.  So I was in and out of there in two and a half years.  And I remember my dissertation adviser saying to me, "We ought to give you half a degree, 'cause you've only been here half the time." (Laughing) I said, "No.  I want the whole thing." You know.  But that's because I was really focused on it.  And I knew that I needed to get out of there.  I had four kids.  I needed to get back, get in the groove with what I was supposed to be doing with them and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 6157
Speaker 1: Can you talk about what the subject of your dissertation [for the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] was?
Speaker 2: It was really focusing on children and television and the effects of television on children.  And what I had decided to do was use children in the Baltimore City Schools [Baltimore, Maryland].  And I was looking at the effects of black shows on both white and white and black teenagers to see if there was a difference in their perceptions of what they were seeing.  And there was a difference.  I can't remember all of it now.  But there was a difference between the black and white teenagers and their views and it was kind of intriguing.  So that was it.  And I'm really still doing some things related to that same thing.  It's really all about images again because that was what I was trying to discern.  What are these images doing and how are they effecting us? You know.
Speaker 1: But why--why did you choose that subject? I mean not many--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because I was in television.  And I thought that, that was a frivolous thing to be in.  I thought, "Why am I in something that I really don't respect?" And then I said, "And I've got children, and I'm wondering how my children are affected by what they're seeing?" So I put those two things together.  And I said, "Okay, that's it.' 'Cause I have a passion about that.  And I did.  I was really passionately concerned about it.
Story_ID: 6158
Speaker 1: And did you take the results of that--of your dissertation and use that within the classroom?
Speaker 2: Oh lots of times.  In fact, when I started teaching here, and even when I was teaching at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]--I came here because I was on--I guess what they call soft money.  Maybe I wasn't.  I wasn't on soft money.  But some folks were.  And I was under the impression that they were getting ready to phase out the telecommunications program.  It was a fledgling program then.  Wasn't the way it is now really solidly entrenched.  And the rumor was they were gonna--you know, faze it out.  And we would be all out of jobs.  And I made an appointment to see the president, 'cause I wanted to talk to him about it.  'Cause he had been sending me off to speak for him at various times.  You know, when he couldn't go.  And he had the speech prepared and couldn't make it.  He would send me and ask me to do the presentation.  And so--and we had some rapport established.  You know, 'cause, you know.  I mean I would--I could speak and that sort of thing.  But he--.  I couldn't get that appointment with him.  And I came over to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for a conference.  And I brought my resume and I gave it to a guy who was chair of the department at radio/TV/film at the time.  And I said, "If you hear of anything or if you think, you know, I might fit some how, here's my resume.  Give me a call and let me know." And he called me the next day, 9 o'clock in the morning and they were looking for somebody.  And he said, "Get me your information right away.  'Cause we're really looking." He said, "You know, we don't have many black women who have Ph.D. in communications.  Did you know that?" And I said, "Well no.  Actually I didn't (laughing)." And anyway, two weeks later I had signed the contract.  And then by the time the president at Morgan--I went to see him.  I said, "Well, you know, actually I signed the contract now." And he was like, "No.  You're kidding." You know.  I said, "Well it's only for a year." You know.  "And then we'll see what happens.  And maybe everything will be stabilized at Morgan."  He said, "We weren't gonna discontinue the program." And I said, "Well apparently that's what I had heard." You know.  Anyway.  So he said, "You're just on leave.  So you'll come back next year." I said, "Okay." Of course that was twenty-two years ago.
Story_ID: 6159
Speaker 1: And that began a whole pro--a whole affiliation with this university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right. And did you--when you came in, who was dean of the--who was president of the university first of all?
Speaker 2: It was Dr. Cheek, James Cheek.  You know.  And I think at about that time, his brother King Cheek had been at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] for--as president at some point along this way.  I can't remember exactly what year.  But the president and I had gone and spoken for was [Andrew] Billingsley.  But then Cheek was there.  And then he was only there for about a year and then he was gone.  But when I came to Howard it was James Cheek.  And the dean was Lee Barrow.  So that was '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Now how did the department--What was different between the two departments? Or were they, you know, similar or different in any way resources? Okay.  I just want--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  Howard was just heads and shou--head and shoulders above what was going on at Morgan.  'Cause one of the things I can recall was, you know, you almost never had equipment.  And what equipment you had was broken, and you couldn't get into a studio.  And then people were stealing the your equipment that you could find.  And it was just really, you know, not a good situation.  I think it's much better today.  But I remember when I came to Howard; I called the people over at Morgan.  And I said, "You need to come over here and talk to these people about some of what they're doing.  Particularly with the technology." I said, "Because they're not losing equipment the way we are." We'd buy equipment in September.  In June it was gone.  People were stealing! You know.  I said, "You have to have a system.  Come over here and talk to this guy and find out how to fix that." And so, you know.  I think they did it actually.  But, you know.  Other people were doing things too I'm sure.
Speaker 1: So what--why do you think it's worked so much here for you? I mean in terms of, you know, the whole process and what--.  As you said, you weren't even sure when you came, you know, how long it was going to last.
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember someone who was on the committee.  Someone told me this later on--who interviewed me said, "Ah! She's gonna use this as a part-time job and she'll never be here.  She lives in Baltimore.  Forget her.  Don't even hire her." And somebody else said, "Well, you know, maybe we should.  Let's just give her a chance.  You know." And then when I started, you know, I'm one of those sort of driven people, you know.  I just can't help myself.  And I see people like that too.  And, you know, I remember I took a course at [The Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] once where they were talking about compulsive neurotics (Laughing).  And I said, "There you are.  (Laughing) Found out what your problem is.  You're a compul--." But I just have to do what I have to do.  And I, you know, I wanna see progress.  I wanna see results.  You know.  I just feel that, that, you know.  You have to try to do your best and then see results of that effort.  You know.  And so I think that that is part of what helps me.  Because that's how I tackle the courses.  'Cause they gave me--which at the time I didn't realize--but I had four courses and a different preparation in each one.  So I was teaching television production.  I was teaching history.  I mean I was--you know.  I was teaching broadcast management and advertising and sales.  (Laughing) And that's 'cause you don't know. So I was just doing that preparation and, you know, getting those assignments from those students.  And, you know, just trying to--.  And I got really good ratings from the students.  So I feel like I really, you know, charged them up.  So it worked out.  And I think that was part of it.  You know?
Speaker 1: So you started out in what position?
Speaker 2: I was an assistant professor in the Department of Radio/TV/Film.  I remember the chair of the department said that I--what was it? He said that I was overly zealous.  That was his criticism.  I was overly zealous about whatever I was doing.  But he was the one who was always getting me to do things.  You know.  Like he would say--we have something called Women in Communications. Women in Cable.
Speaker 1: Women in Cable.
Speaker 2: Blacks in Cable.  Anyway there was a couple of things that--and he asked me to be the events planner for that.  You now.  I mean and I--I don't know how I did it.  I was so exhausted.  I remember my feet swelled and I was so exhausted.  I just fell into the bed at the end of the term.  But it turned out to be a really good conference.  You know.  So he got me involved in lots of different things like that.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of your--?  You were a--you said, associate professor, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Assistant.
Speaker 1: Assistant Professor. How long--you were assistant professor for how long?
Speaker 2: Oh for a long, long time.  Because I was here for four years.  And I had sent my paperwork up.  And they said, "There were no other slots available.  At the moment on--you know, in that department" And so they just sat on my papers.  So then I got an opportunity to go somewhere else.  And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. Right?
Speaker 2: Right Coppin. I went back to my alma mater.
Story_ID: 6160
Speaker 1: I had been consulting with them [Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and talking about things they could do.  They had this beautiful TV studio.  And they were thinking about ways they could use that studio to their advantage.  So I was going there to help them build the program and also think of other things to do.  And I was president of the black--I was president of the Baltimore Cable Access Corporation at the time.  And I realized that they could become the access center for the city of Baltimore, which would bring in resources to them that they could also use to help teach the students.  And the students would also be, you know, production folks for doing some of the productions that needed to be done for the Baltimore Cable Access people.  So I was working with helping them to do that and that sort of thing.  And So I went there for a year.  And at the end of the year, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] called me and asked me if I, you know.  They said, "You know, are you coming back?" And I said at that time, "No I didn't think so." And they were saying, "We're trying to get your paperwork forward.  And if you come back we'll move you forward, you know.  So you can get to be associate professor." And I said, "Well you know, that's good.  But I think I'll stay here.  You know, I'm--." I was tired of driving back and forth anyway.  You know.  So then the next year they called me back and they said, "If you don't come back now you're gonna lose your spot on the tenure track.  'Cause you can't stay away more than two years." And then Dr. [Orlando] Taylor was the dean by then.  And he said, "Come and see me.  'Cause I have an idea for you that I think might be intriguing." As it turned out, his associate dean was stepping aside.  And he wanted another associate dean.  And he said, "Why don't you come in as an administrator." I said, "Administrator! I hate administrators.  Everybody doesn't--Nobody likes administrators." You know.  And he said, "Well, you know.  It pays more money.  You know." And I thought, "Yeah, I'll try it." (Laughing) The same thing that I've done before.  You know.  And so I came aboard.  And I was an assistant professor, associate dean.  Which meant I had a lot of folks who were mad at me (Laughing).  Because they had been professors, associate professors.  Some had been associate deans.  I mean, you know.  We had all manner of folks there.  And I didn't realize I was stepping into a hornet's net.  But I was.  And so that's what happened.  Therefore, that it took so long.  Because the paperwork had to go back through the process again.  And as associate dean you make choices and decisions that everybody's not gonna like.  And some of them were in positions to really help or hurt in that--as it moved forward.  Anyway, that's what took so long.
Speaker 2: Well because you were--you were teaching and part of administration.  And administration--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I wasn't teaching actually at that--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You weren't--.  Oh you weren't--.
Speaker 1: I was just doing administration.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And I was the chief person for the academic side.  Because the dean, of course, was fundraising and doing other sorts of things.  So I had to be in charge of what happened academically.  And then the other associate dean was in charge of administrative things that had to do with, you know, scheduling of classes and various other things.  But I was the one who was looking at the academic program, looking at the curriculum, focusing in on what was happening in the various courses and the programs.
Story_ID: 6161
Speaker 1: This is a time where cable television is really sort of come--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: Well it's coming.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's coming.  It's still not--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Broadcast.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughing).
Speaker 2: Let me tell you an interesting aside.  During the time that I was working as the President of the Baltimore Cable Access Corporation, Kurt Schmoke, who's now the Dean of the Law School here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], was the mayor of the city of Baltimore [Maryland].  And he and I had been on 'Square Off' together.  That's another show that I used to do on Channel 13 [WJZ-TV].  It was a weekly public affairs show where you'd talk about issues of the day.  And he--we used to be on 'Square Off' together.  Anyway he put me on the cable commission.  And then I wound up as the chair of the Education Task Force of the Cable Commission.  And so we were very focused on cable at that time.  And one of the things that was driving what we did on the commission was to try to be certain that cable didn't come in there and just suck up all the money and not give back to the community in any meaningful way.  So we were really focused on trying to make sure there was an educational component and there was community involvement in so forth and so on.  I think we lost in the long run.  But we were giving it the good fight.  And so that was just an aside to you.  So that was one of the things that I think [Dr. Orlando] Taylor and I did talk about.  You know, where is cable? Where is it going? How are we gonna make sure that we are somehow connected with that? And that sort of thing.  But the big thing for him was the vision of helping the school to be positioned.  So that it was in, you know, a strong position on campus and a strong position nationally.  I remember him saying to me, "you gotta make sure that you get into these national associations, and are a major part, a major force of what happens nationally with mass com [communications] in the education arena, journalism and mass com."  And so I did that.  And I've, you know, really been pleased about that.  Because right now, I'm up for being President of AEJMC [Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication].  And that's really partially because of him saying to me, "You know, you need to join these organizations."  And I just finished being President of BEA--Broadcast Education Association.  And because he said that, and I thought, that makes sense. You know.  In that way we'll have visibility nationally in terms of higher education.  But we'll also learn what's going on."  And believe me it's important to learn what's going on across the country.  And I stress that with the department chairs today. You know.  We have to be a part of those conversations.
Story_ID: 6162
Speaker 1: How old was its history, the Department of Radio, TV and Film and how had it sort of developed, you know, how did it even come to being, and when you came on, what state was it in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The two oldest departments [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] are Communication Sciences and Disorders and what's now called Communication and Culture at that time it was called Human Communication Studies.  Radio, TV, film really came in--and journalism came in soon after those two really were established in 1971.  And it was partially because of the [Otto] Kerner Commission report where the Kerner Commissioners had said--commission folks had said that part of the problem was that, you know, we were not training journalists of color to be part of the system.  So that they could in fact, help to get those viewpoints out and get those perspectives into play in society which is still a problem today, as you well know.  So as a result of that, they did want journalism and of course radio, television and film.  And when I came, I guess they started in '71 [1971], '72 [1972].  I came in '81 [1981] so it was about ten years old still trying to find its way.  You know, still trying to grow.  I was torn between production and the management sides of what they do in the department as some others are as well.  But you wind up really spreading yourself so thin in order to do all of those things.  And one of the things that they said to me at some--one point--I remember Professor Ford came to me one time and he said, "You've gotta choose.  You either should be management or production.  But to straddle those two is not gonna be in your best interest because you're going to have to have foc--have to face up to a tenure promotion.  And in order for you to have built your portfolio, you're gonna need to have one or the other." So I decided since the equipment was so heavy and I had enough to do with hauling babies around that I would not necessarily stay in production so I moved over to management.
Story_ID: 6163
Speaker 1: And it was in the courses that I was teaching [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], History of Broadcasting and Film and Intro [introduction] to Mass Comm [communications], where students either implied or they said to me, "You know, black people haven't made many contributions to these industries we're studying." And I said, "That is not true." There were no pictures.  There was no narrative that talked about African American participation in any of those industries in '81 [1981] and so what I started doing was weaving in whenever I could--and I would with the history, I would have the decades and I would start with like the '20s [1920s] and then the '30s [1930s], and then the '40s [1940s] and then the '50s [1950s].  I know they get tired of my charts but anyway I have these charts and then I would have categories of things that we would be focused on, you know.  And so you know, that way we could build across that grid every week to make sure that we were staying on target.  And one of the things that I built into that was what were African Americans doing as a part of that in each one of those decades.  So we would--if we were talking about radio for example, that would be one of the items on the grid.  We would--the radio industry--well we would talk about it and weave in what African Americans were doing in the radio industry.  And it was intriguing how much you found out.  I mean Bessie Smith how she saved RCA [Radio Corporation of America] records.  I mean how Nat King Cole, you know, built--was it Columbia Records I think [sic, Capitol Records]?  I mean, you know, you've got all sorts of things happening where if it had not been for the African American participation, there were some times when those industries would have folded.  Those particular enterprises would have gone under.  But those were some of the stories, you know, I mean there were so many of them.  And so I started weaving those sorts of things in so that they not only had the basics, but they also had this extra edge.  And I thought, I hope it will be useful to them in their later lives because they were gonna go into these industries and be the only one in many instances.  And they would then wind up being the authority and if they didn't have something to know about it, I think they were gonna be at a loss.  So we did that sort of thing, you know, we would talk about the first African Americans who were on, you know, commercial television and, you know, what had happened to some of them.  I mean, you know, it was, you know, just an opportunity for me to learn along with the students really.  And they would bring articles in for me too, you know.  And then I found that some of my colleagues in the department were doing the same sort of things 'cause they were getting the same sort of issues from students.  So we sat around a table one day--colleagues in the [Howard University] Department of Radio, TV and Film, and David Honig, who now is a lawyer, who's done--doing a lot of really good work in public policy issues, here in the city but he was the one who called us all together and he said, "You know, we really need to focus in on doing something where we're all going to get this issue of African American participation in these industries together." And I said, "Stroke of genius.  We should do that," you know.  And so we started talking about how to do it and everybody was sharing ideas, ten faculty members.  And I wound up being the one that they said, "You know you should be the editor." That means that I be the one that everybody would turn in their stuff to and everybody had a chapter [in the book 'Split Image'].  And we'd all be finished in a year, you know, eight years later (laughs).  David Honig left, you know.  He came up with the idea and then he was gone doing something else.  And so I was here trying to work with these folks getting them to meet deadlines and actually do this 'cause I thought it was important that we get this done.  We wound up with actually five people and I had the dubious distinction of kicking off--out of our group, because they did not meet the deadlines for the umpteenth time the chairman of the department that I was in and the dean of the school (laughs) because I would say to them, "Okay.  We got this deadline now we gotta have it done by this date." And they'd--I mean they were overwhelmed.  They had too much to do.  I was a faculty member.  I could work it out, you know.  And so I wound up doing five chapters, the introduction and the conclusion.  Then we got [William] Bill Barlow who was doing two chapters and then one chapter from [Thomas] Tom Cripps; and one chapter from Lee Thornton; and one chapter from a guy named 'Reebee' Robert Garofalo from the University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts].  And all of them--you know, all of us really, you know, got this ten chapters done in 'Split Image' and got it up.  Most of the time we was--I was spending my time trying to get it--get a publisher.  And I remember University of California Press [Berkeley, California] said, "You know--you know, they really liked it and they talked about all these things they thought we should do." And we did what they asked us to do.  And then in the final analysis they said, "Well, you know, we've got one that we're doing now so we can't have two."  And I was like, "What does that mean you can't have--?  Do you have more than two of others?"  You know, it's just an insanity that was said at the time.  And, in fact, I wrote back to them after it was published and I wrote 'cause we had this wonderful write-up in the 'Washington [D.C.] Post' [newspaper] and in various other publications.  And I put it all together and sent it to the guy and I said, "See." (laughs)  You could have had this."  And, you know, he wrote back and he said, "I'm glad you found a home blah, blah."  But you know it was very disappointing to have that happen.  But Howard University Press wound up publishing it.  And we got really good reviews about it because they were saying that it was filling a void that hadn't been filled before.  And the other publication that was at University of California Press was going at it a totally different way.  Ours was a comprehensive study that was all ten of the industries that we were focusing on and the pattern and the thread that ran through it that related to the African American experience.  And we were using some of the same source of articles.  At first we had planned to use the articles themselves from other publications but that didn't work out so we had to write ourselves.  And, you know, it was again a wonderful experience, you know.

Speaker 1: Dean Dates, are you saying that the ten chapters [for the book 'Split Image']--when you had that initial meeting, did they take form?  Was that sort of the basis for--how long did it--I mean when did you decide? Was that from the very beginning that you were gonna cover all the disciplines [of media studies]?
Speaker 2: We actually had more than ten when we started out.  We were really focusing on a lot of other areas and some of the--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Like what? Give me--.
Speaker 2: Some of the areas that we focused on later were added in as a later kind of happening.  I think we wanted to focus on children in television.  We thought, okay. And that was one of my babies anyway, you know.  Public policy issues so we were sort of all over the waterfront.  And then with refinement from the publishing companies that looked at it--when they said, you know if you narrow the focus, so that you're really focused really on--even though you can bring in public policy issues but you do that with the framework of the chapters that have to do with radio, television, broadcaster and listener and so forth.  Then your story is hanging together in a better way.  And so that's really why we pruned it--pruned it as we did.  And, of course, we added the public relations chapters in the second edition 'cause public relations wasn't as big as it became later.  And I was able to work on that when I was a Fellow at the Freedom Forum.  So that's how we got that done.
Speaker 1: So did you--the five--so this whole thing--you ended up writing really half the book.  Now why is [William] Bill Barlow's name on--and, you know, if the other people--I'm--?
Speaker 2: Well, when we started out with those ten folks--and the folks who wound up were not the ten folks, right.  They were people on the faculty.  We started out with them and as people started dropping by the wayside, the only one of the original group left was Bill Barlow.  And I told him, if he would just stick in there and hang in there and just really meet the deadline please, cause he had done one chapter.  And I said, "Just do that other chapter and, you know, you can e--you can be coeditor with me,  you know.  Just don't drop out like everybody else did, you know."  And he did it so I said--I kept my word.
Speaker 1: And now this--the book was--it was first published in 1990--.
Speaker 2: 1990.
Speaker 1: 1990, right.
Story_ID: 6165
Speaker 1: You had a lot of basis of material to sort of cover.  I mean tho--those were very productive years in some respects because 'The Cosby Show' had come into being, you know.
Speaker 2: You know--being--I mean a lot of things--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: --sort of had happened--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) We had some meat.
Speaker 2: That had some meat.
Speaker 1: Right, that you would not have had reference for necessarily before well maybe 'Julia'.  I mean I'm just saying.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: In the history of things.
Speaker 2: But I had a chart in there that I, you know, cause for me it's always helpful to kind of conceptualize things in a chart form.  And so that chart for me helped me to see what had happened in terms of the programming from 1949 all the way through to that present day.  And you could see, you know, what had happened.  I mean a show would be on for six months and then gone, particularly dramas, you know.  The comedies stayed on forever, you know, ten years of dra--comedies for--oh I don't know.  There were two shows that stayed on for ten years, 'The Jeffersons' and 'Family Matters'.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say--.
Speaker 2: And, of course the question for me--and, of course, I wrote about this in a chapter of another book--was why, you know.  Why did they stay on and the others did not, you know.  And, of course, there's some commonality about the two.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about their commonality?
Speaker 2: Well with 'The Jeffersons' and with 'Family Matters' you had the usual silly fare that fit right in with what other silly things that are going on in television.  There was nothing that focused on a particular African American experience.  You had a weak male in George Jefferson.  There was no way that from his persona and the way his character was developed that you could have seen him as a sharp businessman who actually succeeded.  I mean, you know, it was just, you know, not something that happened.  Similarly with--oh I can't think of his name.  On 'Family Matters' you have a male who is not the dominant person.  You know, you have Jaleel White really rising to be the one who stands out in that series and he was, you know, silly.  I mean it has nothing to do with the fact that they're brilliant, brilliant comedians who can act, and did a marvelous job of acting.  I'm not denigrating their acting abilities but I am saying that the way that the characters were drawn by the writers and producers, there's a certain message that's being sent forth.  And that's what we have to discern, and not take it out on the actor who is delivering the message because he's hired to do that and does it very well but on those who develop messages and why and how is that occurring.  And that's part of what we try to do in 'Split Image' which is to get at who is developing these messages?  And how should we react to them?  And focus, so that we know we're not just taking it in and accepting it as truth, you know.
Story_ID: 6166
Speaker 1: There are some interesting things about 'Split Image'.  One is that you took it both from the black and white perspective. You--I mean, you know, where--instead of just looking at the white media and what role they had sort of played--is what I'm--but see what I'm--I guess what I'm trying to understand is how did it develop?  How did the title develop?  I mean what is this?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  We were struggling with a title for years, you know.  I mean really trying to figure out--we called it 'African Americans in Broadcasting', but it's so dull, you know.  And we thought, you know,  get something that's catchy, you know.  And then you think of something.  And then, of course, we looked at [W. E. B.] DuBois and that whole issue of the split and the whole thing of the double consciousness and the fact is that we believe that there has been a struggle covertly and overtly by black people to get more of who they are out there.  And we had examples of how that struggle has occurred by means of people like Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte and various others who--Bill Cosby even.  To--who were trying to send a different message from the message that traditionally had been the one about who they are who black males are.  And the same is true of women, and so forth.  So, we thought there had always been a struggle by black people who were thinking to send different messages.  And so, therefore, we thought, okay, this really gets at what it is that we're saying here.  That on the one hand there are people who are sending forth certain images of African Americans and on the other hand black people are trying to send these other images.  And that split is something that's a real issue and problem in the black community.  Now there are some who say today and I think I'm leaning in that direction too, that that split is not so evident in this day and time.  And that, in fact, black people are as much into setting forth the same images that white people have always sent forth.  But my argument about that is that is because black people grew up in this society and they believe and have soaked in the idea of who they are to such an extent that they can't see the bigger picture.  And actually some of the people from the old days who had not been so immersed in all of this probably had a clearer understanding of how they could shape another who we are, another idea of blackness, you know.  So it's rather tragic.  So unless we force people to think--and I remember my children [Karen Dates, victor Dates, Jr., Matthew Dates, Craig Dates] were growing up.  I used to talk about television and analyze the shows and talk about what's wrong, and what people were doing, and what the messages were and that sort of thing.  And they would say, "No, no, no you're ruining the movie! Ma, you're ruining the movie!"  Or, "You're ruining the TV show," you know.  Well now, of course, they call me up and they say, "Did you see this?"  And then they're analyzing it back to me which is really nice, you know cause now they see the value of not just letting that stuff soak into your skin but making it stop and making you think before you take it in, you know.
Story_ID: 6167
Speaker 1: With 'Split Image' and the publishing did you have to fight to get Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.] to publish it?
Speaker 2: Not really fight.  Howard University Press had gone into hiatus.  Cause we had first gone to them and that was in their very early years before it had really gotten shaped as much as it was and they had said, you know, they had an interest but then they went off.  And they were shut down for about five years.  And that's when we went off to the University of California [Berkeley, California], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] all those different presses.  And I tell you--I mean it was a lot of work trying to, you know, go through it with them--talk it through with them.  And then find out that, you know, "Okay, well yeah, maybe but not this time," you know, they were not going to publish it.  And then finally Howard University Press came back.  And they had a new director and so I called him.  And I said, "You know, I've been working on this project for I don't know how many years.  It may or may not have real value.  It would be nice to know from somebody who can look at it objectively.  I think these other presses just are not interested in anything related to the African American experience.  And they say things in sort of a couched way but basically that's what they're saying.  Can you take a look at it and just give me your honest opinion?"  And that was [U.S.] Ambassador [Orison Rudolph] Aggrey and he took it.  And he had it for, I guess it was about two weeks maybe three weeks.  And he called me up and he was really excited.  He said, "I think we've got something here.  I think we've got something here."  And so from the moment I handed it to him, until the day the publication was only about six months.  I mean it was out.
Speaker 1: That was a dream.
Speaker 2: It was and part of it was, of course, that we had spent all those years working on it.  And part of the time thinking we were never gonna get it published because people were still saying, "Well you know, we've already got a black book."  Or, "There's another coming out at another publishing house that will compete with yours so we're not gonna, you know, do yours or whatever."  Stupid reasons in my opinion, you know.  So I mean they did tinkering, you know, little minor tinkering with it and it was out.  We had--we had a wonderful publisher though.  I mean a wonderful editor, Ruby [M.] Essien [Udom] was the editor fabulous woman understood editing just so well.  And she was wonderful in helping to sharpen those sentences you know and, and make them, you know--make sure we didn't have serious grammar problems 'cause sometimes you're so immersed in the writing you don't get it you know, that you're transgressing something.  But she did a wonderful job.
Story_ID: 6168
Speaker 1: Dean Dates you're a little--very, very modest in your discussion about the book ['Split Image'].  And the only reason I say that is that you--and this even goes back to some of the other things you've written.  And it goes back to your doctoral--you know, your dissertation. And sort of also back to an earlier discussions about math and science. You know--but you are very statistical in your approach to things 'cause people can take all kinds of different approaches to a subject matter and I think that that is what sort of separates your book as--you know, from others in that you actually, you know, did--when to sort of the source material studied--did quantitative analysis you know, and put it there. You know, so it would have long standing use.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a compilation of--you could have taken an approach where you--you know, it wasn't--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Anecdotal.
Speaker 1: Anecdotal.
Speaker 2: Or, you know--and so that's what I'm saying.  And I'm wondering was there a conscious decision--I'm just trying to understand the process by which the book developed over this eight year period?  Or was that something that, you know, you drove?  Or was it something that was--.
Speaker 1: It sort of evolved but, you know, one of the things that I know I wanted to do is I wanted to try to make it so that it was accessible to ordinary people, as well as to scholars.  'Cause I--one of the things--I sort of was not too happy about is that sometimes the scholarly stuff is only seen by a handful of people and you spend all that time on it you know.  And I know that some other people really need to hear some of this and understand that in order for us to have a better society--I'm really thinking about my own children.  I wanted them to read it and better understand black history.  And understand why I had bugged them in their childhood about analyzing things.  And I thought, if they--if it was accessible to them, they really could read it and understand it, then I would have done something worthwhile.  And other people would read it and understand it too.  I was also thinking about the students and that was the real beginning point for me; for them to understand it, so that it could be used both as a text, but also as a--you know, a scholarly source of information.  And so that was what I had in mind.  And I didn't know if it would ever work because I know there's a rigidity about, this is scholarly, and this is popular.  And this--you know.  And they've got these rigid kind of categories of things and that drives a lot of what decisions are made related to publishing.  And sometimes it's so counterproductive to me, to what we need in our society.  So although I was really trying to do that, I also was worried that it might not work.
Speaker 2: But you saw that it worked immediately.
Speaker 1: Well it did.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Thank God.  But, you know, while I was doing it, I was, you know, walking a tightrope trying to figure, how do you do this, you know.  That's why I was trying so hard to make sure that the scholarly stuff was in there, so it would be respected.  But then I was also trying to write in a voice that was discernable to ordinary people, who wouldn't get so caught up in all the footnotes that they couldn't get through the pages.
Story_ID: 6169
Speaker 1: Now the book ['Split Image'] did it put the department [John H. Johnson School of Communications, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] on the map though too?  Did it--?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I can't say that (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But--okay--but the reason I'm asking this is that in--this department in terms of the training of black people for--there's--you have a department here.  Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--right has--.  I mean what--does Morehouse--now--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Clark Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Clark Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Right.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Jackson.
Speaker 2: Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and Howard.  Those are the six.
Speaker 1: But Howard is--.
Speaker 2: Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] is now, I think also accredited, so there are seven.
Speaker 1: But--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) There are small programs at some of the other HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but they're not accredited for programs.  See.
Speaker 1: But Howard is at the top, right?
Speaker 2: In my opinion.
Speaker 1: Right--I forget (laughs).
Speaker 2: But someone might dispute it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you we're at the top in this regard.  We are the number one producer of folks who get degrees in communications in the world who are black--African American and/or black.  We do have a large level, both at the undergraduate and graduate level so that is true.  We have the only MFA [Masters of Fine Arts] in film program.  We have the third-ranked program in communication and culture in the country.  That is in intercultural communications, in our communications and culture department, so those are the sorts of things that put us, in my opinion at the top.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about some of the graduates that have come out of this department in your--.
Speaker 2: --you know, your years here?
Speaker 1: Well we've got Isabel Wilkerson who's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [1994].  Vicky Mabry who is on '60 Minutes II' [television program].  And I say Vicky Mabry even though she did not technically graduate out of our school.  She was in arts and sciences but she was doing some things in the school and, of course, she moved in our field now.  And she's on one of our boards and is very supportive of what we do.  Fredericka Whitfield who's at CNN [Cable News Network].  I mean there are a host of, you know, Kellye Lynn in Baltimore [WJZ-TV Channel 13, Baltimore, Maryland].  Lesli Foster here at--I think News Channel 8 [WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.], so the list is really, really, really long.  We've got people who are presidents of colleges who come through our graduate program.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now with--with the department--back to the department.  What approach did you take?  I mean this was a department that was still very new and, you know, it takes time for departments to sort of--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: --find their way and what their focus is on, and whether they're gonna--you know--have hands-on learning or whether they're gonna be more academic, whether they're gonna have internships.  I mean the whole kit and caboodle in an industry that's still was so--you know, is really still very new, you know, in terms of how do you train, you know, people.  Some people like at Columbia College in Chicago [Illinois], you know, they talked about it being a trade, almost a trade school at some point.  And you've seen changes, you know, over the years with that.  So I'm just wondering, you know, what approach--?  You know, when--as administrators here, when you sat down and you said, we want to be like.
Speaker 1: Well we don't wanna be a trade school, that's for sure.  What we wanna do is give the balance to these students so that they have both a background that allows them to understand the art and science of what they do and the place in our democracy for people like themselves who have a strong background in the liberal arts, you know, who also understand communications and can analyze and understand and handle themselves in a communications arena both in terms of the technology and the use of the various technological advances to help tell stories and to decide how to send those stories out or to develop those stories, whether it's in a documentary form or in an entertainment form, or in a journalistic style or whatever.  So, that's one of the things that we really try to focus on.  We think that just to have a trade school is not worthy of being a major unit in a university because the university is designed to help that higher-level intellect get even more in-depth understandings of our world and of a place in it for them that has to do with their intellect.  And then to go out and contribute to society in some meaningful way based on that experience.  And so that's why we feel compelled to focus on the leadership, the leadership for America in the global community that we talk about all the time with students.  And we have a strong honors program here which is the Annenberg Honors Program, from the money that we've gotten from Walter Annaberg and it is made up of about 10 percent of the student body.  And what we say to those students, they are the top students who come here.  And they are among the best in the country in the world actually.  And they do exceedingly well.  A lot of them really do good work.  But one of the things we talk about to them is, not only do we expect for you to do well academically yourselves but you have a responsibility to be a leader here, and then when you go out into the world be ready to step out there and start leading.  And I talk about the fact that whether you choose this or not, just by the fact that you've come to Howard University, is going to be expected that you will lead.  And so you might as well get yourself prepared and do a good job of it.  And, of course, they laugh, you know, especially the freshmen and, you know, they realize after time that it's not a joke.  You really do have a leadership role that's been thrust upon you because you're here and because you've been chosen by Howard University to be a part of us. And you take that choice very seriously because we do.  And then think about the people who you're following.  And you have a torch right now.  You've gotta hold it up high as others have done.  And we talk about the people who've come before them, who've walked in these halls.  And who've been on this ground, and it is a sacred ground.  And how are you gonna make sure that you maintain what was before you and keep that sacred trust.  And I think they get it.
Story_ID: 6170
Speaker 1: Do you ever have parents saying, you know, why should my student--you know, my student wants to go into this area but is there really a career in that? And--do you ever have that instance?
Speaker 2: They ask that question and, of course, we say to them, it's [John H. Johnson School of Communications, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] very, very competitive and if that student is not driven, because they passionately want to do this, they might not be successful because it is a field where you have to get in there and be very, very focused.  But what we try to do is prepare them so that they can compete and so they're feeling so prepared and so confident in what they're doing that they can get out there and really work at it and do well.  So that's really the answer.  But yes it is very competitive.
Speaker 1: What do you see as the future for blacks in this whole area?  And what are you, you know--in answering that, you know, what are you trying to train your student body for?
Speaker 2: Well obviously I think there's a good future assuming our society, our country gets past some of the hurdles that we're facing right now and the challenges.  But, you know, for me the future really is as it has been for the last ten years in telecommunications of various sorts.  I mean entertainment is a driving force in our society today and to be honest about it I think journalism is partially entertainment today, as it was not in the past and it's trying to figure out how do we maintain some of the integrity that can easily be eroded even more than it has been already, at the same time that we fit into what's happening.  Because when you have young people who think that 'Entertainment Tonight' and what's that other show ['Access Hollywood']--there are shows on where they're strictly entertainment shows that they think are the news.  And, and we have to help these young people to understand the difference.  And to understand how they can position themselves as they get out there into these leadership roles that we're talking about to try to make it a society that is better in some way.  You can't change the whole world and we're not asking anybody to do that but we are saying is there's a little tiny piece that you might have some participation in. What are you going to do?  Are you just gonna just be a part of the problem?  Or are you gonna find some ways to help figure out some solution?  That's part of what we try to do.
Story_ID: 6171
Speaker 1: You were upset about 'Driving Miss Daisy' [motion picture, 1989] that was one of the things and can you talk about that?  I wanna talk some about just your views on, you know subjects.
Speaker 2: Well I can't remember all that I thought about at the time but I vaguely recall that to me it was another movie that helped white people feel good.  And I'm not opposed to that but my concern is that why is it that you feel good about this movie?  And who feels uncomfortable?  And I think a lot of black people felt uncomfortable about it because it was a movie that sort of said, "You know, things were so wonderful then.  I mean, you know, people got along so well."  Obviously you couldn't sit in a restaurant and eat with this person.  You couldn't go to the movies with this person.  This person couldn't get a decent education to get a job to use his talents and skills to be a psychiatrist or psychologist which is probably what he should have been if he could have used his skills and talents as a person not of color, you know.  I mean all those elements are in there so for us to pander to the notion of--it sort of reminds me of what happened recently with [U.S. Senator] Trent Lott.  Where he said,  it was so good back then.  Everything was just so wonderful.  Well essentially that's what he's saying and that is that nostalgia thing that makes me uncomfortable because if things had been so good, they were so good for whom?
Speaker 1: Now are there other--any other movie--on the reverse are there movies that you think have done a great thing?  Have moved us forward?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean people often talk about 'Roots' [television miniseries, 1977].  They talk about--but I'm just wondering what movies would you say were--?
Speaker 2: Well I tell you, if I'm thinking about things that are more recent, I--the television series on HBO [Home Box Office cable network] called 'Boycott' was just astonishingly good just so well done.  And I felt like I was back in the days of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] again in some ways but, you know, in thinking about other movies through the years, I think 'Malcolm X' [1992] was just an astonishingly wonderful film.  It was done so well and it really helped us to understand that period.  For me, a movie is good if it helps us to understand a period or a type of person.  Where it helps us to stretch our feeling of humanity and resonates in some way that feels like there's reality to it and that there's some message that we're getting beyond just the obvious, that helps us grow and develop ourselves as human beings.  And I think, you know, one of the movies that I've heard about so much and haven't seen yet, but all that I've heard about it is that 'Antwone Fisher' was just that kind of movie, you know.  So I think, you know, once in a while we get some that really resonate with me.
Speaker 1: What did you think of 'Eve's Bayou' [motion picture, 1997]?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed that.  I thought that it was focused on--you know, it was a woman's movie more than a man's movie.  And that's fine, you know, I think a lot of times for whatever reason the male dominance of movies is extraordinary.  And it's almost as if they were the majority in society, and yet they're not. I think it's because women give in and go to the movie that the male wants to see, instead of going to the movie that she wants to see.  It's not a half and half but it's just, "I don't wanna see that."  So you got all these action movies and you've got these bathroom humor movies that the males seem to like that seem to dominate in the film industry.  And then you have what they call the 'chick flicks'.

Speaker 1: If we look at some TV programs, and I know, you know,  you've talked a lot--talked about examples like 'Good Times' and 'Sanford and Son' and what were some of the others,  but--.
Speaker 2: '[The] Jeffersons'
Speaker 1: 'Jeffersons.'  Right.
Speaker 2: Those three are--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) 'What's Happening' .
Speaker 2: Right.  'What's Happen-', that are often--you know, have been given as reference.  Did you see a difference though between 'Sanford and Son' and let's say 'Good Times'?
Speaker 1: Yeah I did. I thought 'Good Times' really had us looking at people--particularly in the early days, not in the later days before they got J.J. [TV character James 'J.J.' Evans] up there as a 'Dyn-o-mite King'.  But when they first started off with 'Good Times', you had these strong people who were trying to make it in a situation that was awkward, in a community and an atmosphere that had reality to it.  It resonated with me cause I grew up in the projects, and I know that people had rent parties.  And so some of those story lines really made sense to me.  And they helped other people to understand, you know, exactly how our culture survives, how people do, in fact, find ways to help each other.  And so one week, you know, you get to together, have a party at this person's house so they can have enough rent so they can stay there and then next week you might have to do it for another group you know.  But that whole community spirit that we see so strongly in the Asian community, where you find ways to work together was evident in this particular instance with some of the storylines for 'Good Times'.  You know, the father struggling to find a job and to keep his family together and the mother being supportive and trying to, you know, really help him to help them.  I mean all those things I thought were well done.  So for me it was different from 'Sanford and Son' which, you know, was bizarre.  It was taken from a British television series and I think therefore the quirkiness of the British concept was sort of transported over here and kind of pushed into the persona of these two guys living in this junkyard basically.  Just for me it was almost getting into the stereotypical pattern because although if--with the British comedy you had white characters.  And so you had at least people who were from the same group looking at it and interacting and, you know, kind of enjoying it but here you had black characters who were being characterized by whites for whites.  So the humor was resonating with whites at a different level from what we would have had  in that other situation.  And it also, I think, was not with the black viewer in mind that the humor was being developed but with the white viewer you know, particularly because the white viewers are the majority.  Therefore you're gonna have things happening on that show that I think do not resonate with black people and cause them pain and a little bit of embarrassment.  And that was part of my issue with them.
Story_ID: 6173
Speaker 1: When you look at TV shows that were positive, what would you point to, let's say in the last, you know, twenty years?  Or period.  I mean--I don't--the shows that were--I mean people talk about 'The Cosby Show.'  That was--would you consider 'The Cosby Show' in a class by itself?
Speaker 2: I think so, and, in fact, 'Split Image' I put it off all by itself and said, you know, well you just have to put this to the side and say this show, well--was different.  Now there are some who argue that white people looked at that show and said see they made it.  They did fine.  And obviously if other black people didn't make it, it's because they didn't have the wherewithal to do so and didn't work hard.  I think that's letting people off easily because clearly that one show about a middle-class family does not tell the whole story of the struggles of black people.  It wasn't intended to and it shouldn't be that you hook everything on that one show. It's ridiculous.  It was a good show in that it was giving some ideas about a middle-class family.  And when people argue, "There aren't middle class black people."  I'm like, "Have you been to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] lately?  Have you bee to Washington D.C.?  Have you been to Prince George's County [Maryland]?  Montgomery County [Maryland]?"  I mean there are middle-class black people all over the country similar to the ones that I'm referring to, who have in fact established middle class values.  Middle classness is not white.  Middle classness is that you have reached a level socioeconomically and culturally and socially where you do certain things and to say that that is confined to one group is actually--I can't think of the word.  I think it's--well it doesn't make any sense to say that it just belongs to one group you know.
Speaker 1: So in the next--let's say on the next level.  What would you say are positive shows on TV that have existed?
Speaker 2: You mean through the years?
Speaker 1: Through the years.
Speaker 2: I mean I think of shows like 'Frank's Place'.  I loved the show and part of the reason I did was because it was dramedy.  It was drama and comedy, which is what real life is really about.  And it was, in fact, looking at different aspects of the black community from all kinds of different angles.  I just thought it was so wonderful.  And for me the tragedy was that no one protected that show until it found its place because it would take a while to find its place.  'Cheers' [television program] took a while you know.  I mean you could name at least half a dozen shows that were mainstream shows that somebody cared enough to protect and they protected it until the audience found it.  And then once the audience found it, they were loyal audiences because they saw the value in what was there.  With 'Frank's Place' it was on for about three months before they started saying, "It's not gonna make it."  Now that's self-fulfilling because when you start doing that, the buzz is out.  And then they started moving it around the schedule and you couldn't find it.  And then they said, "Ah!  The ratings aren't good."  Hello!  How can the ratings be good if you can't find it?  Every week it's changed to another time and another day.  So for me it was very discouraging to see that show go on and then go off just boom, like that.
Speaker 1: Now when--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I love what HBO [Home Box Office cable network] is doing for, you know, when you're talking about good shows.  I mean they just do wonderful things all the time.  I can't tell you how many different ones in addition to 'Boycott' [television program] it's just over and over and over again. I just take my hat off to the people there who are making that happen.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know why that is happening there?
Speaker 2: 'Cause they got good people there and they've got good people in key positions who are from the African American community who recognize good stories when they see one and help to make them happen, you know.  Olivia Smashum is one you know.  I mean, but there are others you know.  And it's just a wonderful thing.
Story_ID: 6174
Speaker 1: Do you have thoughts about UPN [United Paramount Network]?  Or even its predecessor which was--.
Speaker 2: WB [Warner Bros. television network]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, what happened was they were trying to compete in some way that would allow them to get a part of the market and because the big boys--the 'Big Three' [ABC, CBS and NBC television networks] and FOX [television network] before I guess.  In fact, FOX started it when they were competing against the Big Three.  They were saying, "Okay, how can I carve a niche out where I can, you know, actually make some money?"  And target a group and pull that group that's sort of marginalized by the Big Three?  And, of course, the group they thought was marginalized, and, in fact, was, was the black community particularly young black people.  And then with the young black people, they're the trendsetters for the country anyway so with them come the young whites who then watch and are involved as well.  So that's what happened with FOX.  And then FOX then after they got enough money, they moved on and they started doing all kinds of racist things.  I shouldn't say that but anyway conservative.  And then you had UPN and WB picking up the mantle and, targeting toward the black community.  They've got some good, decent kinds of shows on but they've got some real dumb trash on there too.  I think sometimes 'Girlfriends' is fairly decent you know.  I think 'The Steve Harvey Show' most of the time was silly but once in a while they had some things that made some sense you know.  You can be funny you know. I'm not saying you can't be funny.  So I'm, you know, naming some comedies that I think have done some worthwhile things.  I wanna see drama.  I wanna see our stories told in a way that resonates with us and with other people.  I wanna see more of what happens with an HB--like what goes on with HBO [Home Box Office cable television network] and sometimes Showtime [Networks, Inc., cable television network] does some decent things as well.  I wanna see the networks do more along those lines and they are--have refused to do it.  I know you've heard about the latest controversy with NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  I guess it's MSNBC [NBC's cable television station].  Where they had planned to put on 'The Michael Savage Show'.  It's a big stink about it cause this guy is an outright racist.  And NBC has always for--traditionally for years been the network that led in terms of doing the right thing, in terms of diversity and racial harmony.  Bill Cosby saved NBC's behind.  How then do you do this?  Tom Brokaw, a man that everybody admires and respects, who serves on our board--how can they sit by and allow this to happen?  But this man says things like--he's not only racist, but he's ethnically-challenged also--about the Jews and the Holocaust, he makes disparaging remarks about them.  About they had-- "Should have all been burned in the gas oven."  I mean just stupid, negative things that are hurtful and painful to people.  He says awful things about homosexuals.  And, of course, you know, cannon fodder is what we are in terms of the black community out of his mouth because he's constantly talking about things related to black people and how they shouldn't be considered at all.  And diversity is a joke.  And who wants it?  And, you know on and on.  And so, you know, he's now been given a perch on MSNBC and, in fact, he was so bad that two nights ago all of the sponsors, all said, "Do not put my advertisement on that show."  So that was--I shouldn't say all but six of maybe eight said that.  So that says something 'cause you know it had to be really bad.
Story_ID: 6175
Speaker 1: When you look at shows like 'The Cosby Show' and let's say '[The] Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'  You know, I'm talking really more about Bill Cosby or, you know, Quincy Jones or, you know--what--why did they end of up being--you know, these are hit shows.  Why do they end up being one trip calling in some respects?  I mean you would think that people would be rewarded, you know, all I know--and I don't know--.  Well behind the scenes, I know that Bill Cosby then wanted to buy a network but why could he not have--I mean stayed at least in the role of a very effective, you know, producer of programs?  Of TV programs?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't really have the answer to that.  I do know Suzanne de Passe is our AOL Time Warner professor [sic, Time Warner Endowed Chair in Media at the John H. Johnson School of Communications, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and she talks about the fact that--and Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis said the same thing years ago.  That with the track record that they have had, they should have been able to name their own tune and have people clambering to them because they had proven the value of what they do and the skills and the talents that they had.  They had shown that what they do resonates with other people, not just a small, narrow  group of people, but a huge mainstream audience.  And yet the powers that be still decide that they are not gonna approach them and/or respond to them when they come to them with ideas."  And it is so discouraging because it has nothing to do with the quality of your work, with the quality of what you have produced and with the quality of what you have in mind to produce.  It has all to do with who's in power, and how are they going to keep that power among a small group of themselves.  That's really what we're talking about.
Speaker 1: And do you see things changing really?  I mean because you even said I'm of the mind set that we are now--I'm--of that we are in some cases doing it to ourselves.  And so I'm just wondering--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) How can we change it if we--well I don't think everybody's of that mind set.  If I did, I would give up you know.  I don't think that at all. I think we've got people out there who are clambering and trying and who are figuring out ways and who are gonna be resourceful and succeed in some instances.  But I do think that--now what was your question, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I was saying do you see it changing?  You know, do you see--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I think it has to change.
Speaker 1: And how do you see it change--.
Speaker 2: I think it has to change because number one, this country is getting darker and darker every year and you're no longer gonna have a majority of folks who are white European in this country.  In addition to the fact that part of what we're facing right now with this whole situation of--with Iraq, has to do with this whole color factor, in my opinion.  Most of the world is dark.  Some small portions of society are white, yet the dominant force in the world comes from white Americans and white Europeans.  And the fact of the matter is that those in the white community have tended to be greedy and power hungry and not interested in--and this isn't all of them but this is how they are being perceived.  They're perceived as interested only in themselves and how they're gonna get more for themselves and not in the whole world and how the world is suffering.  And is not being assisted in some ways that are important for our survival as a planet.  And so this is part of what I think causes some of what people keep saying, "Why do they hate us?"  Well part of it has to do with this perception of this greedy, selfish, self-centered, out only for me and mine mentality which we see reflected in what is happening in the entertainment and journalism worlds today.  Same has been true through the years.  I mean when the commission--year after year after year we've had commissions.  The [Robert M.] Hutchins Commission [Commission on Freedom of the Press] in 1945 [sic, 1944].  The [Otto] Kerner Commission in 1972 [sic, 1968].  I mean we've had all these different commissions through the years to study the problem that we have with society and consistently they talk about the fact that you need that diversity of viewpoints.  You need people who are a part of the establishment to help shape what goes out from us, about who we are as entertainment or as journalism.  And we've constantly have this shutout.  People from HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, who want to go into journalism and in other mass comm [communications] fields, year after year after year are not obtaining opportunities to do so. We're turning them out and they're going into other arenas, because they're not getting the opportunities and yet people are saying, "We need diversity.  We're looking for diversity" and yet they're not hiring.  And students from other schools, mainstream schools--who are mainstream students get these jobs consistently.  When black kids get in, they do exceedingly well.  It's been shown over and over again but they run into this hurdle of trying to get in the door and that's a real issue.  And so for me the common sense is gonna have to prevail, as we see our position weakening on the whole planet.  And as we see the country getting darker, people are gonna have to say we've gotta fix this problem.  We've gotta have these viewpoints and perspectives.  If we don't we don't know what people are thinking.  And we're gonna be going in one direction and our audience is in another direction.  And we're gonna lose.  They're gonna lose viewers.  They're gonna lose money and then on and on.  So I think time is gonna take care of this but in the meantime, in the mean time, it's a problem.
Story_ID: 6176
Speaker 1: What about the historic, institutionalization that has occurred with underclassing African Americans?  And if we get to that point, why will those who have been exposed to that over and over again, whether they are from these shores or, you know--from these shores or elsewhere.  'Cause we have an issue with even how people view us coming here--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --to this country.
Speaker 2: As soon as they get here it's, "Nigger."  They know the word. And you're in a class that's different from other poor people because you also have this stigma, right.
Speaker 1: So how is that gonna be combatted?
Speaker 2: Well I think it's the same thing that I'm talking about.  I mean I think there have been changes of monumental proportions even in my short lifetime, or long lifetime whichever way you wanna look at it, you know, from the time when I was in elementary school [Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] and I didn't even see any white people.  And  then I remember one day I--we went downtown and we were doing Christmas shopping and I saw white people.  And I said, "Oh there they are," you know, and then somebody said, "Merry Christmas," a white person said merry Christmas to us, you know.  And I said, "Well they don't hate us."  It was just a childish thing to think, you know.  But what a difference between those years when there was this total kind of split in society.  And today it is not totally integrated.  And I don't think it's going to be totally integrated for a long time but what a difference.  I mean we can name all the different things that we have crossed as hurdles as people.  We can talk about the fact that there's such a huge number of people who are middle class from the black community who are a driving force in this economy.  And the fact is that people who don't recognize that and realize that we are sustaining a lot of businesses because of the consumption of goods that we partake of.  And I'm talking about the Mercedes [automobile] and the St. Johns [apparel] and the--you know.  We are in there buying, making this economy hum and people who don't recognize that are going to lose out because they are going to lose the customers that they think they are--that they think they have because they're ignoring the fact that some of those customers are people of color, and people of color wanna be courted just like anybody else.  They wanna be made to feel as if their dollar is welcomed.  If they're feeling that you some how are not interested in courting them, as you do other people, they're not going to continue to go to your market.  I mean we are savvy enough today about that.
Speaker 1: So you feel that there is a growing or increasing sense in the black community of collective self worth?
Speaker 2: Oh I do.  I do.  And I feel more optimistic about that.  The more I see--I mean when I go to Baltimore [Maryland] is an example.  Washington [D.C.] is an example.  Atlanta [Georgia] is an example.  Where you see black people surviving, thriving, in charge and doing wonderful work.  That to me is energizing and it makes me feel, this is only just a part of the beginning.
Story_ID: 6177
Speaker 1: And so, you know, it was fun.  I mean I was young, you know, so but to me it was--you know, I--the thing that disturbed me about it as I recall now as a child, or as a young person was that I lived in a neighborhood where it was dirty and people didn't have money.  And they didn't have clothes to dress right.  And I was wrestling with that issue myself about why is it that this is the case with these people, you know.  And I was mad at them because I thought, "Why are they doing this?  Why can't they get it together?"  And then I realized nobody, nobody wants to be poor and dirty and live in poverty.  If you're in that situation, it's because circumstances or your own lack of wherewithal have forced you into that.  And so there should be compassion rather than that feeling. But at the time that 'Carmen Jones' [motion picture, 1954] came out, being in a situation where I was seeing that around me, I felt oppressed by it.  That it was there too.  And it was like, you never escape it.  It's there all the time.  I liked movies where everything was clean and neat and people danced and sang and it was a happy time.  That's the naïveté of youth, you know.  But at the same time, I remember--I didn't use these words, of course, but it was a compelling story.  And I thought Dorothy Dandridge did a wonderful job and, of course, I liked Harry Belafonte.
Speaker 2: You know, they had an all-star cast there.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, I remember--I was thinking what--you know, 'cause a lot of black people didn't actually go to the opera and I was thinking maybe because they were--I'm not saying they didn't.  But--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about this--a lot of people went because it was our chance to see ourselves on the screen.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: And I think really to a large extent that black people in many ways have been so glad to see themselves. You know, that they're very forgiving.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, just happy.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) They're just--yeah, that's the word.
Speaker 2: Very forgiving.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Very forgiving because they do want to see themselves.  Now--and that's why they still flock to see all these stupid comedies on HB--on UPN [United Paramount Network] and WB [Warner Bros. television network], you know because at least they're on the air.  And some of them really--I mean they like Cedric the Entertainer.  They like him.  For some reason he resonates as a person who's sort of telling it like it is.  That's me.  If you don't like it fine, you know.  He's just that kind of guy and everybody knows that type in your community or in your family, you know, who sort of is that way.  And so you fall out laughing at him because, you know, some how he makes you hark back to something that's familiar.
Story_ID: 6178
Speaker 1: Did you see 'Barbershop' [motion picture, 2002] ?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have similar views about it?
Speaker 2: Well I thought that--first of all I think we have to lighten up a little bit you know.  I mean I--the thing is that the people got on him in the end and said, "You know, you shouldn't say this," and you know they gave him a hard time about it.  And, you know, although one of the things I've talked about is images and what are we saying with our images.  And I do have a concern that other groups do not take issue with their icons and sort of find ways to poke fun at their icons in the same way that we do sometimes.  And so that was the issue for me but the other side of it too was, in the barbershops, everything is game and people talk about everything and everybody.  But the one thing that struck me about that one is that most of what they talk about is the white man and whitey's still on top and all the other sorts of stories.  None of that was true in this barbershop.  It just never came up, not really.  And so I think that was a commercial decision. I think they thought if we, you know, do what really happens at barbershops, not a (laughs) lot of white folks are gonna come and see this movie so we're gonna just focus on one aspect of it.  And so they did.
Speaker 1: But when you say--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You can't do everything.
Speaker 1: When you say we should lighten up.  What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well I meant--if I were Rosa Parks I probably would not be all that happy about it.  But I think other people,  you know, just--okay. It was just a dumb joke, you know.  And if the rest of the movie was okay, this shouldn't take it over and tip into the throw it away basket totally, you know.
Story_ID: 6179
Speaker 1: Dean Dates, where are you at? At your--at this point in your life? You have the last, you know, since assuming the position of Dean [John H. Johnson School of Communications, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] you added another skill set or responsibility to your basket. And that was in the area of fundraising and the development that goes with--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You're right about that (laughs).
Speaker 1: --that goes with the position.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so I'm just wondering--.
Speaker 2: It didn't go with the position when I took the position,  let me tell you that. They changed it once I got in cause I was the academic.  I was supposed to be focused on how do we get this curriculum the way we want it to be?  And how do we--this, that and the other?  Anyway, but it's been a challenge.  But, you know what, I think about it and I think now what I've done is I've used both my mother's [Iantha Alexander Lake] skills and my father's [Moses Oliver Lake] skills cause my father was a salesman as I said.  And I did not live with him most of the time--long enough to understand what he was doing.  And go and see what he was doing to any great extent but I did go on occasion with him.  And I did get a chance to see some of what he did and maybe some of that sank in, I don't know.  But now not only am I doing the journalism and the teaching, but I'm also doing the fundraising.  All of which were things that my mother and my father were focused on.  My mother was like, "Be a teacher and be somebody substantive in the community and, you know, have a job and go there and work there for thirty, forty years."  And you know, that was her thing.  He was, "Be an entrepreneur.  Get out there learn how to handle your own canoe.  Have your own business--," you know, that sort of thing.  And, "Sell your ideas or sell your wares to people who want them."  And so now, you know, I'm sort of doing that.  And what I enjoy about fundraising, and I do enjoy it.  And that is that I think we've got such a wonderful product here.  And I know that other people are being supported for doing things that probably are not as substantive as what we're doing or at least we're on par with them.  And to me the challenge is to get people to understand that and to partner with us and to help us to do better what I think we're doing well. So for me I just love it when I tell a story and they get it and then they say,  I'm gonna help.  I just get a charge out of that.  So it's not as much of a chore as it might have been if I didn't have that kind of philosophy that's sort of pushing me to try to bring in everything I can to help make this the strongest possible place we can, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So really what makes you tick?  Because it seems like that has been your approach to everything in life.
Speaker 2: Which is, what?
Speaker 1: Well you've been in--and you say,  well I'm gonna do this.  And you sort of like go and do it (laughs).
Speaker 2: That's my philosophy, Let's just do it. Somebody asked me. Oh you asked me, let's just do it. Yeah that's right.  And that's my philosophy, you know.  It's--I think we're so fortunate to be in this country despite all of our problems, despite the craziness that occurs and all the issues that I've talked about that are bad.  I think we're just so lucky because when you look at other places in the world where you would not have had an opportunity to do any of what you're doing today, Jannette Dates.  And so you go in there and you do the best you can and enjoy it at the same time cause part of what I think is important and I say this to students all the time the best revenge is to have a good life.  There are people who do not want you to have a good life.  The best revenge is for you to enjoy what you do and to do it well because you get intense pleasure out of doing good for society and for yourself.  And so I don't want them to starve.  I don't want them to, you know, just be into sacrifice.  I want them to, yes do some sacrificing in order to have for tomorrow, putting off a little bit today.  But enjoy also.  And so that is the part of the joy of what I am doing--is, you know, because I'm so happy that I'm in a society where we have opportunities.  And sometimes it just take the courage to say, let's just do it.  Okay.  Let's just move on and do it.
Story_ID: 6180
Speaker 1: And what do you wanna still do with your life?
Speaker 2: Well I guess what I would like to do is, I'm enjoying doing the deanship [John H. Johnson School of Communications, Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I enjoy leadership roles.  I mean that's clear to me now.  I think at one point I had said, "No I don't wanna do a leadership.  You know, 'cause it's too hard."  But I realize now that, "Yeah, it's hard but I think the rewards are there."  And so I like leadership.  And I'll probably do something even higher in higher education somewhere.  I'd like to see my children get married and have children so I'll have some grandchildren at some point.  They're gonna laugh when they see this but I think that would be nice.  That experience too is good.  And I want them to do it when they're ready.  They're not ready yet but that's okay.  But when they're ready that's good.
Speaker 1: And you had talked earlier about the legacy that your mother [Iantha Alexander Lake] left you and that you wanted to leave your, you know, your children--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: Can you expound upon that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Sure, cause we [husband, Victor H. Dates] have four children and our oldest one is assistant superint--assistant to the executive--executive assistant to the superintendent of education in the state of Maryland and so she has, you know, a substantive role really in helping to shape the direction of education in the state of Maryland.  And she went to--she went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] and then the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism [Columbia University, New York, New York].  And was really focused on doing some things in advertising and PR [public relations].  And found that was not what she was interested in.  And then kind of segued into finding out that she really was interested in education.  And so she is doing the outreach kinds of things with the education, with the state superintendent, working on projects that have to do with lobbying and public relations and that sort of thing.  And so for me it was getting these children focused so they could make contributions, you know.  And to an extent my husband has that same philosophy which is why we, you know, connected.  And we always said we were gonna have seven children.  He teases me now, 'cause he says what happened to my other three children?  (Laughs) I said sorry about that. I reneged on the deal.  But I don't know how we came up with that before we got married.  We said,  you know, middle-class black people are not the ones who are having children and that's the problem.  We need to have more middle-class black people have children so we're gonna have seven.  Very naive, you know.  Anyway, so then with the three boys, our oldest son [Victor Dates, Jr.] was actually in radio sales for a long time and now has segued into sales with real estate and housing and that sort of thing and he's in Atlanta [Georgia], loves Atlanta.  We have a son [Matthew Dates] who is Assistant U.S. Attorney in Miami [Florida].  He went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and then George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.] and Chip [Victor Dates, Jr.] went to Hopkins [The John Hopkins University, Washington, D.C.] and got his degree.  He's the oldest boy.  And so Matt [Matthew Dates] is the one in Miami and loves doing it.  He's a ham cause I said to him--cause he's in court and he has to, you know, give his legal brief and opening arguments and you know he just really loves that sort of thing.  And then our youngest one [Craig Dates] is in emergency medicine in the Charlotte [North Carolina], Rock Hill [South Carolina] area, North Carolina, South Carolina.  And so I think that they are all focused and I've passed my mother's legacy on so that it didn't stop with me.  So that they in fact, were inspired to try to do something constructive and worthwhile with their lives.  And, you know, they're doing that.  And that makes me proud.  I'd like to see them round it out now with the other side but, you know, I think they're very focused, as their parents were, and are on their careers.
Speaker 1: And their names?
Speaker 2: Karen [Dates] is the oldest girl.  Chip, who is Victor H. [Dates] Jr., he's the second.  He's the oldest boy, and takes that role very seriously.  I call him the responsible oldest son.  I call her the responsible oldest daugh--oldest--child I say.  Matthew [Dates], of course, is the third--or middle son and Craig [Dates] is the youngest.
Story_ID: 6181
Speaker 1: When you look at the black community, what are your hopes and concerns about that community?  It's a community you spent your life really dedicated to.
Speaker 2: Right that's true.  I would really hope and pray that we would some how figure out how to hark back to some of those values that I recall having as I was growing up where, you know, people really worked in the community and worked hard for each other.  I really get upset when I see the kind of slovenly approach to jobs for example.  Where it's like, "Oh it doesn't matter," you know, "I get there when I can," you know, slipping and sliding.  To me that's a part of what's causing our problems.  If everybody takes their tasks seriously and really does a good job of what they are tasked to do, or what they've assigned themselves to do because you take on the role that you wanna have in--in a society today.  Everything would be so much better and stronger, you know.  I don't think we have to go back to a segregated world to have quality of what goes on in the black community.  And I say that because as I mentioned earlier, when you had--tell other teachers and the doctors and the lawyers and all the people around the community to be role models for people, you had a stronger community than we have today where people are off in their own little world.  Gated communities for the most part, and not models for the poorer people, who have as much to give--as many talented skills as anybody else.  But sometimes they just don't have the wherewithal within the family or the opportunities.  And we have to try to make those opportunities and give them those mentors.  That's part of what we do here too.  We have mentoring programs.  One of the things my daughter [Karen Dates] has in the state of Maryland is a mentoring program which is I think probably a model for what can be done across the country.  She's so passionate about mentoring young people and having other people, so she has a group of people that mentor young people.  And they have a manual that she's developed.  And, you know, all kinds of things to try, to tap into helping to enrich the black community in some ways that we haven't been doing.
Story_ID: 6182
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be, Dean Dates?
Speaker 2: (Pauses, crying) I thought we were finished with that.  I think--sorry--my legacy should be that,  we have really positioned this school [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to be able to get the kinds of support, the partnerships, the support that mainstream schools have.  So that we can in fact, continue to really turn out top flight young people, who are gonna go out there and truly lead where they--when they get out of here, prepared, competitive, sure of themselves.  I think we can only do that with the support.  With the kind of funding that allows you to have the programs, to have the facilities, you know, that have these young people ready when they get out of here.
Story_ID: 6183
Speaker 1: Well you [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] recently got a contribution--or commitment of four million dollars from John Johnson, Johnson Publishing [Company].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that is along the line, you know, that does speak to the issue you just talked about, in terms of institution--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --building.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you're bound and determined to--
Speaker 2: Continue.  Yep.  And, of course, we got the two million dollars from AOL [America On Line] Time Warner, which was wonderful.  And that has helped us to establish some, you know, really strong things going on in the department of radio, TV, film.  And now this John Johnson award is gonna help us so much, as we move to get that new building up, you know.
Speaker 1: And what are  your plans for the new building?
Speaker 2: Well we got this--the place located.  The president [H. Patrick Swygert] has identified that.  And now he has said that in a year we're gonna break ground.  So--and I've never seen him come up short on anything he's said he's going to do.  Everything he's said that he was going to do he has carried through on so it's really a great pleasure to be here at Howard under his leadership 'cause he's so visionary and strong, you know.  And we've all benefited.
