 Neurohr  Walsh  Today is October 15, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian at Oklahoma State University. I   m at the White Barn Estates  conducting interviews for the O-STATE Stories oral history project of  the OSU Library. We have a special group of women that we   ve been  interviewing today, the Women of Willard. I   m going to interview  Willene Walsh. Thank you for participating in our interview today, we  really appreciate it.  Okay.  Can you tell me a little bit about your early life, where you grew up, and  what your parents did?  Well, my parents were farmers and  the farm  was southeast of Hinton,  Oklahoma. I had two older sisters and I was the youngest. There were  three girls in the family. I have lost all of my family and my husband  I   ve lost. But I have two daughters, two son-in-laws, and two  grandchildren.  Were you the first person in your family to attend OSU?  No, I was the second one at OSU. My oldest sister came.  Is that what influenced you to come to OSU?  Probably. In my family, and especially my mother   s family, they almost  all came to OSU, which wasn   t OSU back then, but anyway. (Laughs)  What year did you start school at OSU?  Well, I finished high school in    54 and the very next year I started.  5  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  What year did you graduate?  Four years later. (Laughs)  So    58?     58.  What was your major?  Home Economics.  Had you been to the OSU campus before you started there as a student?  Oh, yes. My oldest sister was there and then different things that we had  in 4-H when I was growing up from nine years up to that stage. So yes,  I   d been around quite often. Also, my mother   s sisters and brothers had  gone to Stillwater and so that was another  reason  I wanted to go.  Family connections.  Yes.  What years did you live at Willard Hall?  I was there the three years instead of four because I had a friend that  wanted me really to go to Weatherford the first year. I had always  known that I was going to Stillwater the first time but I came up here my  sophomore year. It was those three.  Was Willard your choice of where you wanted to live?  Oh yes, because my oldest sister had lived there. And then a lot of my  friends lived there.  Did you think that Willard was better than the other halls?  I don   t know. There were some newer than that, but it was just right here  for the heart. A lot of 4-Hers that I knew were there in that place.  What was your room number?  Oh my goodness. It almost seems like it was 21, but I don   t know.  That   s been years ago.  Were you in the west part of the building with all of the other ladies that  6  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  are here?  Almost. Mine was kind of in the west middle but not around the corner,  but then it was one year.  Were you in one of those rooms that could look out on the front porch?  No, it was to the west. To the west.  To the west, to Monroe Street.  The first year, though, I could see to the pond.  Describe your room.  Oh, I tried to make it very nice and home-like. I remember my mother  made curtains and bedspreads and so forth. I had a girl that I did not  know as my first roommate. I think that was just one semester. I think  she dropped out. But then since I was a 4-Her I knew a lot of people  around so that was nice to be there.  Do you think there   s still that connection with 4-H and students coming  to OSU?  Probably not as strong as it was back in my years.  I   ve heard stories about the telephone. Do you have any stories about  the telephone? There was only one I guess on each floor.  And you had to wait in line to get it sometimes. That was about it.  I   ve also heard stories about the buzzer system, which is uncommon  today, of course.  Is that maybe if you came in late you had to push the buzzer to get in?  I   ve heard that and then also that if someone came to visit you they  would buzz you that there was somebody there.  Yes, that is right. I   d almost forgotten that, it   s been so many years. Yes,  they would buzz you and then you   d have someone down at the living  room, that   s probably what it was. We   re talking about over fifty-some  years. (Laughter)  Does anything in particular stand out to you about your three years at  Willard?  7  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  I loved it all. I had very good people that taught me. I was a home  economics major. It was all good. As time went on I was working  downstairs to watch the kids come and if they got locked out then they   d  have to come in and write their name down and so forth. I did that  probably a semester, maybe two semesters. It   s been so long I don   t  really remember but I do remember being there.  You must have been very responsible to have that position. (Laughter)  I hope so. I   m still alive.  Was there diversity in Willard as far as ethnic or international diversity  that you remember at all?  Not at that time.  What about in your home economics program?  That was so long ago that there was not a lot of other ethnic people at  that time.  What about the house mother?  That was interesting. I never had any problems with her and she would  check to make sure when I was working at the desk some. Some thought  that she was really hateful but she was very strict and we were young  people, we were supposed to do our work. That   s about as much as I can  remember.  Looking back now, what would have been her duties? Anything in  particular as far as keeping everyone in line or discipline issues, making  sure that the girls were in when they needed to be and that the rules  were followed, that kind of thing?  I remember that she made sure that the girls would have to write their  names down and why they were coming in late and how long they were  out. They had to know that time.  So she kept track of all that sort of thing?  Yes.  Do you remember anything about the Dean of Women for the whole  campus? Was it Dean  Zelma  Patchin when you were there?  Yes, it was. I had no problems with her whatsoever. I was a 4-Her that  8  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  had kind of known her before that. I do not remember anything that was  not as it should be.  I   ve heard about the cafeteria in the basement. What do you remember  about the cafeteria or the food?  Just going up and down those steps. I was raised on a farm and I just  never was one that fussed about it. If it wasn   t something that I could  eat, I wouldn   t eat it. But that was just part of me, I ate what I was  supposed to.  What do you remember about the residence hall hours?  I knew that they were very strict and if you didn   t get in on time, if you  were on a date or if you were at the library or whatever, you   d have to  ring that bell and then you   d have to go in and sign your name and so  forth. I really don   t think that I ever had to do that.  Do you remember if the library had the chimes that would ring then?  It might   ve been later on in my years, because I went to Southwestern  my first year, then I was up there. So the last three years I was there, I  remember the chimes. And the water that was in the middle part that you  could see that was really nice.  The fountain?  Yes.  Do you have any other library memories?  Libraries. Oh, sometimes you just couldn   t get everything done when  you needed to get it done. Now we have all the things that we can copy  them and then take it home and work on it. But I don   t have a lot of  memory about it.  So if you needed information from a book you had to copy it down by  hand?  Yes.  Not like being able to make a photocopy now?  I don   t remember having a photocopy because we only had so much  time to get things done and I remember doing a lot of handwork.  9  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  How did the young ladies dress on campus during that time?  I think most of the time they looked nice. There were a lot of girls that I  know that probably their dresses were made, their garments were made.  My mother was a very wonderful seamstress and that   s why one of the  things that I wanted to finish was that. I suppose that some would fuss  about it, but if you did what you were supposed to, you didn   t have any  problems. I loved it up here.  Did you have one of those fluffy  skirts ?  Yes, we had those. It was all that stuff that makes your skirts fluff out. I  know that mother made a lot of those for me. That   s probably one of the  reasons that I wanted to get my home economics degree is because my  two older sisters: my oldest sister got her degree up here and so forth,  but the second one didn   t. I looked up to what they were doing, maybe  because I was the youngest one at home by myself made a difference.  If you wanted to use the sewing machine on campus, were you able to do  that? Or was it just part of your course work?  We had to make sure that you could get in the home economics place  and I could go over and use them, even when it wasn   t class time.  Did you make any of your own clothes when you were a student there?  Oh yes. Because I had learned to do that before I even came to college.  Was that common for the young ladies to do that?  Probably more common than I can think about. But it   s the ones that  were really interested in home economics.  Was there a place in town where you could buy your fabric and  patterns?  Yes, downtown.  Do you remember the name of that place?  Oh, I don   t know why I can   t remember it.  Were you a frequent customer?  Yes. And then I would go home on some of the weekends and it wasn   t  as easy to go home as it is now. I   ve got a grandson up here now. But it  10  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  wasn   t home.  I   ve heard a few stories about the panty raid. Can you tell me any stories  about what you heard or did you experience that?  There was one time while I was at Stillwater, the only time I knew that  there was just one. It was,    Everybody get in your room and lock those  doors,    and if you were in a corner room you could kind of look out and  see what was going on out there. But I didn   t have any trouble because  we locked our doors so we didn   t lose anything.  Oh, so there was one that happened while you were there.  I do remember that happening.  Was it noisy?  Oh, yes. And we were told,    Get in your room and lock those doors.    I  didn   t know what else to do but do what I was supposed to. It was a little  frightening.  Was it?  Yes, because you don   t ever know if it   s some outsiders that   s trying to  break in or if it   s kids that   s doing it. But that wasn   t a big deal to me  after that was over, it calmed down and you knew what was what.  Do you know whatever happened with the things that were taken?  I don   t remember. I   ve taught forty years since then. (Laughter)  Do any Willard traditions stand out in your memory that you had there,  regarding holidays or special events or activities?  We had some parties, and it seems like there were some refreshments  down in the living room. I think that we had some things then.  What was Homecoming like then?  Nothing like it is now. But fun.  And oh, during that time I can remember that a bunch of fraternity boys  broke into one of the girl   s  rooms , somebody left a door open or  something and there were panties taken and different things like that, but  I didn   t know if there was anything that was really bad. But it seems like  we were told to get in our room and shut the doors. But that was the only  11  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  time I remember that.  What about Theta Pond? You all were so close to Theta Pond.  I liked to go down there and walk around it coming and going from  classes. There were ducks out around and so forth. It was a neat place.  And I can kind of remember someone was thrown in it because it was  their birthday or they were engaged or something like that.  Was there an area where the girls would sunbathe at Willard?  It seemed like there was something up close to the top story with the  building and there was a place that they could come to do that a little bit.  I didn   t do any of that.  When Willard was changed from a dormitory to the home of the College  of Education, was that controversial with some of the alumni?  I could say that probably just knowing people that there   s going to be  some that are going to do that.  What about the name change from A   M to Oklahoma State  University?  Well, as I remember, my oldest sister graduated from there and that was  A  M. And then I think that there was not anything that was bad, but  when you   ve been there and it   s called by a certain thing you want to  kind of carry through. But that   s alright.  The songs had to change, right?  Yes. So it   s just part of life.  Do you recall anything about Frank Eaton,    Pistol Pete   ?  I remember seeing him.  On campus?  I sure did. See, I   m old. (Laughter) Yes, that was kind of exciting.  Tell me about that.  This little old guy, here I am tall and he was a little guy and he had that  hat pulled down over, it was a cowboy hat and he had that around his  neck, the scarf. I can   t remember if there was a time that I heard him, he  12  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  shot at something. If there was something that we went to to hear it, but  yes, I remember.  Seeing him on campus?  Yes. Not a lot, but I did see him.  Was it kind of a thrill and exciting for students?  Yes, because he was just kind of like a monument or something setting  out there. That   s almost like you   d think.  A legend at that time even?  Yes.  Was the statue of President Bennett on campus when you were there?  It   s in front of Whitehurst.  I don   t think so. I have a grandson up here.  What   s he studying?  Something in agriculture. He moved around a little bit and he   s from  Hobart. He   s a junior this year.  A junior. So he   s found his place then.  Yes. And see, both of our girls graduated from here. And my husband.  Did you meet your husband in school?  I met him here, yes.  Did he propose to you while you were still a student?  No, we graduated before. And then a short time afterwards we got  married.  What is it about this group of women and the bond that you have?  To me it was   we were 4-Hers and we went a lot of places together, we  did a lot, we worked fairs and we were from different communities and  so forth, but probably 4-H was the thing that drew us together. Then we  were most of us out here at Stillwater, too and have always been friends.  13  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Have you been to the reunions?  We didn   t get up here in time for the first one, but yes, I   ve been to  almost everything else. And we   re here until we get it all done for the  next two days.  Do any of the reunions stand out in your mind in particular?  As we got married and had our children and met together, that was a real  fun time. And keeping in touch with them even now, we   re just like  sisters. It   s good.  Do any other campus traditions stand out to you in particular? How  about any special classes or professors?  I loved all of my home economics teachers, I really did. And some of  them   at that time, a lot of them were not married and a lot of people  thought that they were cranky and things like that, but if you did what  you were supposed to do, there was no problem. I didn   t have any  problems with any of them.  Did you have graduate students teaching your classes that you  remember? Or were the professors teaching the classes?  I don   t remember any.  Do you know if they were doing a lot of research at that time? Did you  hear anything about it?  I didn   t know that much about it, but I   m sure that there was a lot going  on. My mother didn   t go to college here, but both of her brothers and  both of her sisters were graduates from up here. And that was another   incentive , other than the one sister, too.  Was Willard Hall air-conditioned?  With the air with the windows up. (Laughter) It never was really hot or  really cold, but yes, we could open our windows so we could get better  air.  Were there buildings on campus that were air-conditioned?  There was bound to be some, where we had that like 200 in that one  class on the second floor. I would think there had to be some air there.  Was that common to have that large of a class or was that unusual?  14  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  Neurohr  Walsh  That was just depending on what it was. No, most of them weren   t that  much.  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your time at OSU  or your time in Willard?  I can   t say it   s my happiest time of the world, because I had to work.  (Laughs) I wasn   t working, but work at my     Studies?  Studies. I loved it because it was a heritage of my family that I wanted to  go there and I wanted to go into home economics. The only thing is that  my first year, one of my friends wanted me to go to Weatherford, but I  went on up here and I kind of hated that I did that, but that   s okay. I  think I just loved all of it. I wasn   t afraid. I didn   t have any problems  with anyone. I   m glad that this is where I came and that my girls have  been here. And my husband was here and I wouldn   t take anything for it.  Well, just keep the family tradition going.  Yes. I   ve got a grandson up here now. So, yes.  Well thank you for the interview today. I really do appreciate it. Thank  you so much.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
