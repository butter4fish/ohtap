Speaker 2: Gregory Ellis Mathis.  G-R-E-G-O-R-Y, E-L-L-I-S.
Speaker 1: Do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not that I want to mention today. Certainly, as a kid, I had a couple of nicknames: Scoie [ph.], which was short for Disco.
Speaker 1: That was a college nickname, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, prob- maybe a year before college, but Scoie.
Speaker 1: Any others?
Speaker 2: That's all I can think of, at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Four, five, sixty [April 5, 1960]. Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Now, I serve as a national television judge.
Speaker 1: You were a circuit court judge?
Speaker 2: I was a district court judge [for the 36th District Court], a state district court judge, in Michigan, and my jurisdiction was the City of Detroit.  I did that for nearly five years, from 1995 to 1999.
Speaker 1: You were the youngest circuit judge?
Speaker 2: The youngest elected in Michigan.
Speaker 1: Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date, if you don't mind me looking is February 25th, 19--February 25, 2005.
Speaker 1: Where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at the Judge Mathis show ['Judge Mathis'], in my office, in the NBC Tower, in Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 278346
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish questions that we always ask, as a warm-up, sort of.  The first one: sir, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Vegetable would be collard greens.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, black.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Florida.
Speaker 1: And, the last one: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Just to keep believing in yourself.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Let me further clarify that--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: It would be: believe in God, believe in yourself, and you can overcome any obstacle.
Story_ID: 278347
Speaker 1: I am going to ask you about your family history. I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Charles Mathis] side.  Let me start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Alice, A-L-I-C-E.  Lee, L-E-E. Mathis, M-A-T-H-I-S.
Speaker 1: Is Lee her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is her birth date and birth place?
Speaker 2: Amsterdam, Georgia, is her birthplace.  She died in 1978, at the age of forty-nine.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace your mother's side and what do you know about the ancestors on her side?
Speaker 2: Great-great-grandmother, Susie [ph.], was enslaved in South Carolina.  Moved from South Carolina--not sure--after the emancipation to Georgia, near and around Southern Georgia, near and around the Tallahassee [Florida] border.  And, she had, I believe it was, two sons and they were Lees and they had several children themselves.  One of which was Walter Lee--I might have put an extra great on that than was deserving of it.
Speaker 1: So, she might have been a great-great instead of a great-great-great.
Speaker 2: Correct, because her son--no, her grandson, Walter Lee was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: So, she is great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: What would that make her?
Speaker 1: Great-grandmother, I guess.
Speaker 2: Great-grandmother? Okay
Speaker 1: Walter Lee, that's a famous name from 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].  That was his own name.
Speaker 2: Are you sure it was Walter Lee?
Speaker 1: The character's name was Walter Lee [Younger], I think he had another last name, but the character, in the story, was Walter Lee.
Speaker 2: So, he had two sons and seven daughters.  One of those daughters was my mother, Alice Lee.
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories from that side of the family that are handed down about what life was like, in Florida, in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, they--Walter Lee--grew up as a child on a plantation where they were sharecroppers to--if, I thought about it long enough, I could give you the family name of the sharecropping family.
Speaker 1: Are they well-known?
Speaker 2: Seems like they were named after a coffee. Seems like they had the same name as a coffee.  Maxwell Plantation [ph.].  Yeah, that's where it was; the Maxwell Plantation in Amsterdam, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: If I'm not mistaken--I've visited it-
Speaker 1: You're right.  It's in the book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker].  It's in the book.
Speaker 2: And, so, I have heard some of the stories about my aunts and my mother being born not too long after they left sharecropping.  Well, my aunts--my oldest aunt, now, would be approximately 105, his oldest daughter.  He has a daughter still living who celebrated her ninety-fifth birthday, my aunt.  I spoke with her two days ago, calling her about her ninety-fifth birthday.
Speaker 1: Was that your Aunt Ethel [ph.]?
Speaker 2: No, she passed, unfortunately, two years ago. That's Aunt Edith, I'm sorry, Aunt Eva [Lee].  My Aunt Eva. Her ninety-fifth birthday was February 23rd, 2005.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  You can go back just three generations from slavery, basically, if you think about it.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 278348
Speaker 1: Did they talk about what life--I mean, any stories about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know a lot of stories about my grandfather. What happened with my grandfather--he had, he married the first wife--he married a woman whom he had my four oldest aunts by--three or four oldest by him by the first woman.  She passed and, then, he married her sister.  They were Griffins.  Amanda Griffin [Lee] was my mother's [Alice Lee Mathis] mother.  Walter Lee married Amanda Griffin after her sister, who had been his wife, died.  I'm told that was customary in the South, during those days, and they had three children together; my mother, being one of them, and then she died early.  I think my mother was an adolescent, if not a toddler, no more than eight or nine.  When Amanda died--from what they referred to all the time--all I knew was I would hear the dropsy's.  And, I've come to learn that the dropsy's is a form of high blood pressure and the inability to dispose of water, in your body, which is high blood pressure; meaning if they had blood pressure pills back then, she wouldn't have died.  Easy treated.  Easily treated.  And, we do have a history of high blood pressure in our family.
Speaker 1: A lot of black families, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 278349
Speaker 1: So that was interesting. Another interesting fact that I've learned is that Walter Lee [Mathis' maternal grandfather] raised those nine children alone, after losing his second wife, Amanda [Griffin Lee].  And, a couple of them were adults, by then, and they helped to raise the younger girls--the younger children--Amanda's children.  Her sister's children help to raise her children because they were older and Walter Lee, of course, was the authoritarian figure.  He moved from Amsterdam, Georgia, I guess, about thirty miles away to Tallahassee [Florida], because he was hired as the horse-keeper for President [J.R.E.] Lee, unrelated.  He was the president of Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida]. President Lee, the president of Florida A&M, hired my grandfather, Walter Lee, to be the horse-keeper and, I think, he ultimately also did custodian work around the campus.  So, he moved right outside the campus, like one--like five houses away from the campus.  My grandfather moved all of his daughters and sons, at the time.  Maybe a few of them, as I said, were out of the house, by then, I think a few of them were--he may have had four or five left in the house, the three youngest daughters, which included my mother [Alice Lee Mathis].  And, I think, one of the sons were still with him in that house outside of FAMU, maybe a couple more.
Speaker 2: Was President Lee white or black?
Speaker 1: Black.
Speaker 2: Was he?  I know, in those days, a lot of times the presidents of black colleges [HBCUs] would be white sometimes. But he was black, okay.
Speaker 1: He was black.  Interestingly enough, he had one of his grandsons, the son of Eva [Lee], who I told you just turned ninety-five; her son used to follow Walter Lee, my grandfather, around on campus in the '40s [1940s]--'30s [1930s] and/or '40s [1940s].  His name was Walter Lee Smith.  He, in 1977, would become the Seventh President of Florida A&M.  After having following Granddaddy [Walter] Lee around, as a child, caring for the horse and acting as custodian on campus.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: Interesting about Walter Lee Smith who became the seventh president, he was forced to flee the Tallahassee area, because at, age sixteen prior to graduation from high school, maybe fifteen, because he had gotten into a fight with a white kid and he won the fight.  And, it was such a big deal that a mob began roaming the area, looking to kill him. Came to my grandfather's porch, my grandfather had to bring his shotgun out and tell them that he wasn't there.  In fact, they had to put him on a Greyhound bus and ship him to New York [New York] where he went to stay with my grandfather's oldest daughter who was Alberta Lee [ph.], in New York.  She had moved to New York, by then. So, that is where Walter got his GED [General Educational Development] just as I later got a GED.  My cousin, first cousin, Walter, had obtained his GED, in New York, and then went on to college to obtain his Ph.D., and later become president of FAMU.
Story_ID: 278350
Speaker 1: Did your family, down in Tallahassee [Florida], have access to the educational opportunities of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?  You know, basically did your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] get a chance to go to high school there or--?
Speaker 2: My mother didn't.  What I'm told is that a couple of the daugh- the younger kids were a little fast: my mother included, and didn't--weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity that probably was available to them to go to Florida A&M.  I would imagine it was tough without a mother in the home; you know, just like today, it is tough raising boys, without a man in the home, I'm sure it was even more tough raising daughters without a woman--without a mother in the home and you working full time as a man, Walter Lee [Mathis' maternal grandfather], working full time, raising these girls by himself for the most part.  So, I imagine, it was tough trying to instill the right values into a girl, teaching girls womanhood; so, him being unable to teach womanhood to those girls may have--I'm told he was real strict to the guys coming by and all that, but sometimes that backfires.  I don't really know all the stories, but, suffice it to say, that as I recall my mother did not graduate from high school while in Florida.  In fact, I know for sure that because I can remember when, we were in Detroit [Michigan]; my mother was studying for and passed the GED [General Educational Development] while we were in Detroit, as I was a youngster.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you, when she left Florida, how she got to Detroit?
Speaker 2: I kind of knew.  Interestingly enough, I found that my mother and her aunts didn't like to talk a lot about the past.  And, I always have to pull it out of them.  I don't know how much of that you encountered or you have heard of in your other interviews.  I don't know if it is cultural or not, the fact that our older generation didn't like to tell us the stories.  Maybe, because it was painful; it's painful to recall.  I don't know.  It's like pulling teeth, getting stories out of them about the past.  But I did learn that what occurred was my mother married young and had my three older brothers by a gentleman named Maurice Gaines [ph.]. And she, also, had a son whom she gave up for adoption, Reginald Lee [ph.].  In any event, he took the name Reginald Lee.  She gave him up for adoption.  Now, those four were born there, in Tallahassee.  She, immediately upon breaking up with Maurice Gaines, in I believe, maybe 1959 or so; she moved to Detroit to join her sister, Ethel, who was in college or had completed college as a physical therapist, in Detroit.  And, she moved up north seeking help and a better life, and one year after arriving to Detroit, she married my father, Charles Mathis, and I was born.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: If it is, I don't know it.  Yes, let me back up.  I'm told my mother worked in a restaurant--kind of a greasy spoon.  Yes, and he worked in a factory, and he would come there to the factory.  I'm sorry, to the greasy spoon at some point during a break, lunch, before or after going to work, and she caught his eye there and they began dating.
Story_ID: 278351
Speaker 1: Let's move to your father's side of the family.  I know you don't know as much.  Well, you might not know as much.  I don't know, but can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Charles, I don't know if he had a middle name, Mathis [Charles Mathis].
Speaker 1: What was his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Don't know. Don't know much about him at all.  I believe his place of birth, or his- he grew up, I believe, in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you know much about--
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry that was my Uncle Jimmy [ph.].  I believe he grew up in Georgia.
Speaker 1: That was it?  What do you know about your ancestors on your father's side?  Do you know what his father did or what--?
Speaker 2: No.  I know absolutely nothing.  In fact, if we were to combine the amount of time I spent with my father, it would amount to less than thirty days.  I do know that he had other children whom I've recently met, in Detroit [Michigan].  And, that's all I know. Didn't know when he passed in Detroit.
Speaker 1: From what I read in the book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker], your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] and father split up when you were about two, before your memory really starts?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Correct.  I have no memory of them living together.
Speaker 1: But you did encounter him from time to time?  You did see him?
Speaker 2: As I said, cumulative less than thirty days over--
Speaker 1: I understand that you lived with him for a brief period of time.
Speaker 2: Yes, about two to three weeks.  And, whenever you would like to go in that direction, I can describe those things.
Speaker 1: Why don't we just wait until we get to that part--but you just don't know much about him or how he grew up?
Speaker 2: No, but I recall him being--I had an image of-well, I know, he was a hustler.  He worked in the factory, but he was a hustler.  Gambled a lot and that--things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Street-guy.
Story_ID: 278352
Speaker 1: Your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] was in the Seventh-day Adventist [SDA]. Can you--do you know how she got involved with SDA?
Speaker 2: Well, upon moving to Detroit [Michigan], one of our cousins who was there, in Detroit, was a Seventh-day Adventist; and her sister, back in Florida, had joined the Seventh-day Adventist church, in Florida.  So, I am assuming that that's one of the reasons she was encouraged to attend the Seventh-day Adventist church in Detroit.  I was practically born in the church--if not, from the time I was birthed, attended the church, City Temple Seventh-day Adventist Church [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: That meant, from what I was reading, it seems that it meant that there were certain restrictions and rules, associated with SDA that really are time consuming--
Speaker 2: Very stringent and take a lot of time.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Take a lot of time.
Speaker 2: And, we did all of that.  We attended church, probably three days a week and adhered to all of the edicts and all of the rules: including, that you must rest from sun- couldn't do anything but rest or praise God--or do something religious oriented from the time the sun sets on Friday until the sun sets on Saturday.  So, we attended church on Friday evenings and, again, on Saturday morning; the Sabbath, we attended church and then, another day, during the week for prayer meeting or bible study.  So, three days a week, we'd be in church, and if we couldn't--if my mother couldn't take us because of her work schedules, one of the deacons or someone would come and pick us up, me and my three brothers.
Story_ID: 278353
Speaker 1: Now you grew up on the west side of Detroit [Michigan] basically (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us, what--what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, being chased under the table on Prairie Street.  I must have been four or five years old, crawling under the table.  Yeah, that's my earliest memory.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you being chased because of something or did you--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I believe so.  Yes, I believe--yeah, I was being chased by my mother [Alice Lee Mathis].
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: In trouble.  My earliest memory: I started out running from trouble. Running because I was in trouble.
Story_ID: 278354
Speaker 1: Can you describe the Prairie Street neighborhood [in Detroit, Michigan] for us?
Speaker 2: Yes. Then, it was single family homes with most of the men in the homes.  Most of the peoples had fathers on the block and most of them worked at the factory.  Lot of children on the block and I can recall some of the more notorious people in the neighborhood were the heroin addicts and the drunks and--
Speaker 1: Were there that many of them?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  That's why, I say, it stood out.  If you go over there now, unfortunately, 70, 80 percent are heroin addicts or alcoholics, which I do go over there regularly.  In fact, I do over there--I am opening up a drug rehabilitation center converting my old home there--I just purchased it and we are converting it to a drug rehabilitation home, for the block, at least, try to salvage the block a little.  But, in any event, that's what I can recall was a big deal.  Those were the more notorious.  That was the gossips.  So-and-So is a heroin addict or So-and-So is a drunk and they were more or less, not outcasts, but they were notorious, if you will.  Everybody had to love for everybody, everybody loved everybody unconditionally, but if you were notorious, you were talked about.  You know, so, that's what kind of stands out, other than that it was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 278355
Speaker 1: What were some of sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I would say, kind of, if I try to put myself back in that place of sights and sounds--it would--industrial.  I can remember, you know, riding the freeway in the car.  We'd ride by a lot of smoke.  You know.  What do you call it?  Stacks?  Smoke stacks, or, even you see flames shooting from the smoke stacks, in addition, to smoke.  In addition to smoke, you see the actual flames and certain areas you could smell that stench of industrial, you know, different oily type of smell in some parts of town.  So, that's kind of what I can recall seeing and smelling in terms of the landscape of Detroit [Michigan].
Story_ID: 278356
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells [of Detroit, Michigan], now?  We were discussing some of them during break--
Speaker 2: Yeah, who can forget the Motown Sound?  I grew up under that and what you would find, even when I was five, seven years old--I can remember that you had all the teenagers and adults, on the corner, singing.  Everyone wanted to harmonize.  And, so, at night, particularly, we'd find guys on the corner, drinking their wine.  There'd be three or four of them, passing the wine back and forth, just harmonizing, coming up with songs, 'cause everybody thought they could be the next Temptations, or the next Four Tops, or the next Motown star.  So, that was a big deal.  I mean it was just song was in, almost in the air, everywhere.
Story_ID: 278357
Speaker 1: This is interesting, 'cause a lot of times, well, some towns are really proud of their artists, or, stars that come out and some people, you're not a star in your hometown, type of thing.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Oh, yeah.  A prophet is never honored in his own home, as the Bible tells you, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: People, in Detroit [Michigan], did really did love the Motown Sound, would you say, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh they did; and, on the other hand, you know, they loved them to the extent that they wanted to be like them, and wanted to get a break like them, but from what I'm told, I've had the fortune now--I've the privilege, if you will, to get to know many of those Motown artists. [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, of course, one of the key Motown artists.  I'm friends with all the Four Tops and Aretha [Franklin].  Unfortunately, what they shared with me is that they were, in many instances, marginalized, to put it politely, by the communities that they grew up in. And yeah, so I'll just leave it at that.
Speaker 1: It wasn't all like--
Speaker 2: They weren't honored.  They weren't treated (laughter) as famous singers, as they were by--.
Speaker 1: Did you know anybody--did anybody in your community that you grew up in become a famous recording artist or--
Speaker 2: Well, My friend, who was my best friend, at age-for a couple of years, Fred Hammond.  He and I were best friends and he became a famous gospel star.
Speaker 1: You say the Brewster[-Douglass Housing] Projects [Detroit, Michigan] were--you didn't live in Brewster but--
Speaker 2: I frequented the Brewsters, very often, to visit one of our family's best friends who went to church with us and went to the church-school, Richard Jones [ph.]. He lived in the Brewsters and, there, we would hear the tales about Diana Ross.  And, people would talk about her like a dog. You know that crabs in the barrel syndrome: that's what I kind of mean by they were marginalized by their own communities.  She was a big star--one of the best stars in the world--had come from the Brewster Projects.  I vividly remember hearing people criticize her while I was there.
Speaker 1: The '70s [1970s] were when you grew up. It was the age of funk. Motown was kind of faded as funk was coming along.  So, did you have--what was your favorite music growing up?
Speaker 2: As an adolescent, I loved that Motown Sound.  I was--The Temptations was my favorite group.  Then, when the Jacksons came out, of course, the Jackson 5, they immediately became my favorite group.  And, during the '70s [1970s], the Commodores and Parliament-Funkadelic, and then an assortment of groups: Stevie Wonder and Rick James, and the others.
Story_ID: 278358
Speaker 1: Who, all, was in your household growing up? It was you and your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] and your--
Speaker 2: And my three brothers.  We all grew up a few years there, on Prairie Street [Detroit, Michigan].  And, then, in 1965, we moved to this sparkling, beautiful, green housing projects on the west side of town, three miles from Prairie Street.  And, it was one of the most beautiful projects you could imagine.  It was hard to get in.  You know, the Brewsters [Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan] and, another housing project, the Jeffries [Housing Projects, Detroit, Michigan], were kinda older, by then, and crime and drug-ridden.  And, so, we thought we were somethin', being able to move into the newer, prettier housing projects.
Speaker 1: When you moved in, the pop- it wasn't even all-black then, right?
Speaker 2: In fact, it was overwhelming white.  It was probably 80 to 90 percent white, in 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, unfortunately, there was a lot of racial strife.  The whites, perhaps, felt threatened by that movement and, of course, with the racial tensions of the '60s [1960s].  All that just created a lot of racial strife there.   And, I can remember the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] being in the projects regularly calling themselves there to defend the blacks that might be under attack and, you know, recruiting the blacks who were there and being victimized.
Story_ID: 278359
Speaker 1: You're like six years younger than your youngest brother?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And, so, you're like--you've got three brothers that are almost--I mean, they're like authority figures I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you will.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about--what were you like growing up in this environment?  Your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] is hardworking.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother worked two jobs, for the most part: one, as a nurse's aid, at the hospital--Henry Ford Hospital [Detroit, Michigan]--midnights.  She would leave at ten P.M., every night for--and return the next morning, around seven or eight A.M.  And, she would get all four of us ready for school, make sure that we at breakfast, have prayer, and she'd--we'd go off to school, and that's when she'd take a few hours nap and then she would wake up and go and perform housekeeping duties for wealthy folks in, what is known as, Grosse Pointe, Michigan.  And she--
Speaker 1: That's a considerable way, away, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From the west side of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: (Nodding) Yes, long way.  Probably about forty minutes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).  Grosse Pointe, is like, you know, way past the east side of Detroit.
Speaker 2: She would help her friend, who had-- she had known on Prairie [Street], Miss Mattie Fears [ph.].  She would go with her and help her with her job there.  And, so, she would be home, however, by the time we got home from school. And, make sure that we did our homework; made sure we ate a good dinner, had prayer again; and then, she would take her nap around 6:30 so that she would be up by 9:30, preparing to work.  So, she got another three hours in; she had three hours in the earlier in morning and three hours in the evening.  So, no more than six, seven hours a day.  And, it was that window of opportunity, when she was taking a nap, at 6:30 everyday and after she left for work at 10 P.M., when me and my brothers kind of got in our devilment.
Speaker 1: So, there's nobody really around to--you've got three adolescents males--
Speaker 2: Four--
Speaker 1: And little kid--
Speaker 2: Right, and a teenager.    Yeah, right: three adolescents and a little kid.
Speaker 1: You're a little kid.
Speaker 2: A little kid, such as me--perhaps, five or six.  Correct.
Speaker 1: You're idolizing what your brothers are doing 'cause you're the littlest guy--
Speaker 2: No question about it.  Yep, and they were doing some of everything.
Speaker 1: So, what did you-- so you're learning that when your mother's around there's a real strict environment and, on the weekend, go to church.  In SDA [Seventh-day Adventist], you can't do a lot of things.
Speaker 2: Can't eat pork. Can't go to the movie theatre or, you couldn't back then.  Yes, like you say, nothing worldly--nothing that the regular world did.
Speaker 1: Could you dance?
Speaker 2: No, no dancing--none of that.  That was called--
Speaker 1: Listen to Motown music?
Speaker 2: You're not supposed to.  You weren't supposed to.
Speaker 1: But, you all figured out a way to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, of course, outside the house.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this--
Speaker 2: 'Cause everything was going on outside the house, particularly, as the years progressed.  Although, it was pretty and green when we moved in, I would suggest that within three or four years, it had begun to deteriorate.  And by, seven years later, by 1972, it was totally drug and crime-infested.
Story_ID: 278360
Speaker 1: There's a old canard that black folks living in the projects don't have any jobs and everybody's on welfare and that sort of thing, but this isn't the case, right?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Especially, in this situation, it wasn't the case.
Speaker 2: Well, many people had jobs.  I don't know if there were many--I recall--I distinctly remember that there weren't many fathers around--'cause I suspect that you couldn't live there--and, I pretty much know it's income-based.  So, if you had a father who worked in the factory.  Nah, I don't think they were allowed to live there.  So, it was income-based.  It was low-income because to live in a housing project, you have to be low-income.  And, many people were on welfare.  In fact, I think the majority of people, out there, were on welfare.  The majority of the whites were on welfare and the majority of blacks were on welfare, when we were out there.  And, there weren't many fathers in the households, as I recall.
Speaker 1: Now, you said, in your book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker] that you didn't really feel impoverished growing up.
Speaker 2: No.  You don't know what wealth is; so, you don't know what poor is until you start experiencing wealth or, until you see or you're around wealth.  I was isolated from wealth; so, all I knew was working-class and, later, impoverished conditions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right.  I didn't feel poor.  I didn't know what it was--what wealth was.
Speaker 1: So, it seems you've got a dynamic when you mother [Alice Lee Mathis] is around a lot of rules but when she's gone, there are no rules cause nobody's--just the rules she talked about but there's nobody around to enforce anything.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yeah.  Not much supervision.  Correct.  You know four boys without a lot of supervision allowed us to do a lot of things and once the projects became destructive, so did we--but, I must say that my mother believed so much in her faith that she invested in me to attend the Seventh-day Adventist church-school for the first six grades.  Well, actually, I think she had to put me in there because I was kicked out of first grade (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the housing project's school [Herman Gardens Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now how does this --you started out--
Speaker 2: Destructive or misc-
Speaker 1: Being a bad, little kid, early--real early.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I reflect back and read and learn more about mental disorders, I'm convinced that I suffered from undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD].  There's no question in my mind.
Speaker 1: Well, even--I don't know much about mental health, but, you know, little kids having to be so disciplined for periods--brief periods of time--
Speaker 2: You think it was rebellion, perhaps (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  No supervision.
Speaker 2: My other brothers didn't rebel that way.  They didn't rebel as strongly as I.  They were as destructive as I was--I was referred, as early as I can remember, as bad but smart.  Those are the two descriptions I can remember being labeled as, all of my life.  Well, all of my early part of my life, you're so bad, but you're so smart.
Speaker 1: You must have been paying some attention to get smart.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's a good point (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what kind of--how were they--how were you--
Speaker 2: Acting out?
Speaker 1: Yeah-well--how were you smart?  Let's start with that one.  Let's go with a positive first.
Speaker 2: In school, for example, I answered every question every time the teacher would ask and I'd be the first one to raise my hand and answer the question. Always got--I was always one of the--I always used to count, am I the third or the fourth smartest in the class?  I was always one of the top--one of the smartest of the top--the top three smartest in the class.  I would always make sure that I had, you know, have, at least, the top three grades in the early grades of my schooling.  And, on the other hand, I was always the baddest kid in the class.
Story_ID: 278361
Speaker 1: And the teachers always had trouble with me.  As I said, first grade, the teacher--I can remember--I was smacked.  That's why my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] took me out of the school, I wasn't kicked out.  I was smacked and my mother removed me from the school or they may have kicked me out be my mother smacked the teacher back (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, this is a three-hundred pound teacher--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Miss MacGivens [ph.]--I'll never forget it--I was in the first grade of at the Herman Gardens Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan].  That was the name of it, Herman Gardens Elementary School.  Herman Elementary School in the Herman Garden Projects [S. James Herman Gardens Housing Project, Detroit, Michigan].  First grade, and I went to school that day and, as usual, was disruptive and destructive in the classroom.  Every time, the teacher, Miss MacGivens, would turn her back, I would--I think I would throw little balls of paper at her.  You know, and--whatever the case might be and this particular time, she either caught me or someone told on me and she had me come up to her and she smacked in the face.  And, so when I went home that day, my mother saw the handprint in my face. She said, "What happened to you?" I said, "Miss MacGivens smacked me in my face." "Oh, we going back up there." So, we went back up to the school and Miss MacGivens was still there and she confronted Miss MacGivens and Miss MacGivens started talking about how bad I was. "You don't smack nobody in the face, though."  And, my mother proceeded to--she said, "I'm gonna show you how it feels." My mother lost her religion that day (laughter).  Mom lost her religion and smacked Miss MacGivens back and I, uh, don't think I went there any longer, after that.
Speaker 2: I think she realized that she should put you in another school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she sent me to the church-school and, what's so interesting about this is, our rent in the housing projects was about eighty dollars a month and the church-school tuition was about $120 a month.
Speaker 2: This is a tremendous sacrifice.
Speaker 1: Tremendous.  And, if you put the two monies together, you probably didn't have to live in the projects, very long.  Certainly not the nine years that we stayed there.  Yep.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: But that investment paid off because the church-school worked with me and, you know, I got paddling almost every day at the church-school.  I was known--
Speaker 2: You're still the baddest--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I was still known as the baddest kid in the school.  Yep.
Speaker 2: This is Peterson[-Warren Academy, Inkster, Michigan], right?
Speaker 1: Yep.  Peterson Academy.  Yeah, I was the baddest but still one of the smartest.
Speaker 2: Well, this is a spiraling (laughter) story of--just tell the story--just summarize--
Speaker 1: Of destructive activity.  Yeah.  Ultimately, Peterson kicked me out, I believe, in the fifth grade, and I went to another Seventh-day Adventist church-school called Southfield Academy [Southfield, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: What did you do to get kicked out of Peterson?
Speaker 1: The first time, I think, in the fifth grade, I was caught stealing from the lockers.  I used to--me and another buddy used to check everyone's lockers and steal from them.  One time, we stole an expensive--this time, it was an expensive watch.  So, the whole school was a big issue that the whole school thought some--Sandra [ph.], I remember her name, my buddy later married her.  Sandra's watch was stolen.  "Who can tell us who did it?" So, it was such a bid deal that--they gave us up, if you will [laughter] And so, for stealing the watch, I was kicked out and my mother then put me in Southfield Academy.  And, that was majority-white Seventh-day Adventist school, whereas, Peterson was all-black.  This one was about 95 percent white and living, not to far from there, in the Herman Garden Projects, we were going through the transition of racial strife in the projects, I was living there, as well--a lot of that embedded in me the belief that--well, not necessarily belief--the attitude of standing up against racism because I was such a victim, in the housing project, of racial attacks.  They used to have racial attacks out there where we'd have to run from the motorcycle gangs--the white motorcycle gangs, when we were a minority.  And then, when I'd go to the school, in the fifth grade and the sixth grade, I attended Southfield Academy.  I'd go there and feel like I was being discriminated against and, so, those years were pretty tough and filled with a lot of racial strife.  And, I was then kicked out Southfield for fighting.  I think, perhaps like, the third fight or something I had had.  I was kind of a violent kid.
Speaker 2: What were the fights about?  Were they racial, usually?
Speaker 1: A couple of them.
Story_ID: 278362
Speaker 1: Fifth grade, I suppose, I was twelve years old.  I was going for bad, by then.  By then, I had began stealing, drinking wine, smoking cigarettes--probably marijuana--while back in the projects.  By that time, the projects was about fifty-fifty.  A lot of drugs were coming in terms of black/white.  You know, a lot was going on.
Speaker 2: Did your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] suspect that you were doing any--I mean--I know that she got reports from school about the things that you were reprimanded for at school but did she know that you were smoking (unclear).
Speaker 1: I can't recall her finding that out until around fourteen.  Yeah, I think we--I think I was getting away with it for a couple of years.
Speaker 2: You had a big window of time when she wasn't around.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: The night time is the right time for doing all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Correct.  Correct.  Yep.  And, so, a lot of time what we'd do is--you know when she'd wake up from her nap at 9:30, 10:00.  I'd just be coming in and I'd make sure that I'm all fixed up: breath-spray, mint, wash your fingers, wash you hand to get the weed and the cigarette off of you.  We had the whole routine down pat.  So, we'd only see her for those ten minutes when she's preparing to walk out the door.  We had to walk her to the car, in the later years, when the projects had become so dangerous.  So, in any event, I believe I was kicked out of Southfield Academy [Southfield, Michigan], for fighting.  And, so, once again, she appealed to Peterson[-Warren Academy, Inkster, Michigan] and they allowed me to come back.  So, I went back to Peterson.  It must have been the second-half of the sixth and all of the seventh grade and, maybe, part of the eighth grade, as well, I think.
Speaker 2: You told a story--there's a story in the book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker], about your mother being attacked on her way to work.  When you mentioned walking her, I thought of this.  Now, I don't know where this fits in the chronology.  I guess around the period of time, right?
Speaker 1: Correct.  Correct.  In 1974, I believe it was our ninth year there.  By that time, the projects was pretty much all-black.  It was as if--I can remember, almost vividly, almost to the year, 1972, it appeared that guns and drugs almost, kind of, just dropped out of the sky. You know, it used to be--prior to that it was, you know--prior to that, it used to difficult to get drugs--difficult to get guns.  Suddenly, everyone was using heroin and smoking weed and everybody had guns.  And, a lot of it, I can remember the discussion was being attributed to Vietnam [War] veterans coming home who had heroin ad- they were heroin addicts.  And, so, the heroin dealers prayed on them and dumped the heroin in the projects, where the other poor people were who were looking for an escape from the pain of poverty, if you will.  And, then the guns, of course, goes with the drug activity, but it happened so fast and so dramatic.  It was dramatic. It was if--it was if someone gave them a pass to do it.  And, the police didn't care.  And, some of them was funneling the drugs and guns in there with a license, almost.
Story_ID: 278363
Speaker 1: That's when it really turned bad [in the housing projects].  It really turned dangerous.  A lot of break-ins, a lot of armed-robberies, a lot of killings.  All of that began to happen about '72 [1972].  So--
Speaker 2: And, before that, though--yeah, I know you wrote about the riots of '67 [1967] and the deteriorating condition of that whole area.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: Those four cops--
Speaker 1: The Big Four, we used to call them. Yeah, the Big Four was a police unit, a special police unit that came about, in 1967.  Either right before or right after the riots. And they patrolled the city streets of Detroit [Michigan]; and, they had a license, if you will, to enforce the law with a little more brute force than the regular beat cop.  They rode four-at-a-time in a police car and they had shot guns with them and they would regularly jump out and brutalize kids and adults for little or no suspicion of criminal activity.
Speaker 2: So you saw them in action?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  We'd see the Big Four all the time, ride by and they'd taunt us, you know, kind of let us know this was our territory.  This is our projects.  You'd better not do this; you'd better not do that.  And, ultimately, some of the guys would take potshots at them.  You know, that's probably--it's a very delicate balance.  You've got police who are acting hostile and so, when they act hostile and create a hostile situation, in the community, they have to defend themselves against hostility, but it's the hostility that you've created.  If you had come in here, under the concept of what was implemented later by Coleman Young, the first, black mayor--when he implemented police--community policing and when the police come in as your friend and, as your protector, then you wouldn't have created the hostility that you later have to defend yourself against, but when you come in, acting hostile and not as a friend, but as a--I don't know how to describe it--
Speaker 2: Occupying force--
Speaker 1: Occupying force, then, certainly, you're going to experience some hostility and no one's gonna like you.  And, those who have you know the courage or the most--well--are crazy, if you will, are going take action in some kind of way.  Some guys used to shoot at them when they were paroling and they'd get a couple of bullets coming through that police car and, of course, during the '67  [1967] riot, which was the worse riot in the history of America, I'm told--Detroit's '67 riot.  They paroled the area along with tanks and the National Guard.
Speaker 2: So, by 1972, the lid is blowing off of all of this now?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Drugs are pouring in and guns--
Speaker 1: Yep.  And, it's totally destructive, totally destructive.
Story_ID: 278364
Speaker 1: And, one night, by that time, I guess this probably three years now, my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] would have to be walked to her car--to the parking lot, from our unit, and it was like fifty, one hundred feet away.
Speaker 2: This is not to protect her from--against white racism because they're gone now, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, protect her from black--black criminals.  Right.  We never had to walk her to protect her from white racists; we had to work her to protect her from black criminals.  And so, it was probably the second or third year of having to do that and well, it's amazing when you look back at it, it was understandable then, it was like--common place.  And, it wasn't a big deal, then--but, now, when I look back, it wasn't even safe for her to walk fifty feet, at night?  So, every night, at 10 P.M., my brothers would have to walk her to the car.
Speaker 2: There was one particular time that she was attacked, right?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  This time, my brothers were late. So, she didn't want to be late for work, and she walked on her own; and, the one time she walked to the car on her own, she was attacked.  My brothers get in about fifteen minutes late. "Where's Mama?" "Mama's gone to work," 'cause I was in the house, me and another little, young guy.  This is probably '74 [1974], so I'm fourteen, and she made me, "Stay in the house, Gregory [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis],".  So, my brothers come in. "Where's Mama?" "Mama's gone to work." "Well, her car is still out there!" "Well, she left here, fifteen minutes ago." So, we wait around a minute, her car is still out there.  We think maybe she's at a neighbor.  No Mama. So, we then go and start knocking on neighbors' doors to see if, maybe, she went and stopped by the neighbor's house but we know Mama.  She ain't gonna to miss work; she ain't gonna be late for work.  So, finally we conclude that something has happened. And, a bunch of us, probably about fifteen or twenty people, began yelling for her all throughout the neighborhood: "Miss Mathis!  Miss Mathis!" yelling out. Suddenly, some guy steps out of the bushes, staggering. We come to find out later that he was high off heroin.  He aims a gun, at some of us, or whomever.  He tries to pull the trigger, we out later he--we found out that that the wrong bullets.  He had a German Lugar gun with 9 mm bullets in it; and, so, the gun didn't go off, but, my brothers had a rifle.  They had been out there paroling with a rifle; so, my brothers shoot him, hit him in the shoulder.  He runs and what happens is he then is caught by the mob, if you will.  And, we beat him into a coma.  When the police arrived, they say that we should have went ahead and killed him.  He was never able to testify.
Story_ID: 278365
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, and I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name for us?
Speaker 2: Greg Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis].
Speaker 1: And we're completing an interview that we started last spring, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And today's date is December 15, 2006.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We are in your offices at NBC in Chicago [Illinois] correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 278366
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  You were describing where you grew up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Detroit [Michigan], of course.  You always, at some point, would either see or smell the smoke stacks because it was such an industrial town, so vibrant with industry, and that was part of being in Detroit.  Then, of course, you also hear the Motown Sound, somewhere along the way; whether it was the brothers on the corner singing, doo-wopping, imitating The Temptations and the Four Tops, or whether you heard it blasting from someone's stereo or radio.  That was an ever present sound, also.
Story_ID: 278367
Speaker 1: Now you were raised by your mother [Alice Lee Mathis], you and your brother, believe?
Speaker 2: Yes, four of us: four boys, my mom raised alone.
Speaker 1: She was in--she was a nurse?  Or in hospital (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a nurse's aide, by night.  She worked midnights, as a nurse's aide; then, during the day after, getting two to three hours sleep, she worked as a housekeeper for many years, off and on, for the wealthy folks in the suburbs.  I'd like to say that she cleaned bed pans, for the sick, at night; and, when--would clean houses, for the rich, during the day, to take care of them four boys.
Speaker 1: Now, could you--now where do you fall in the order with--?
Speaker 2: I am the youngest; the youngest of four.
Speaker 1: What was your neighborhood?  What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Herman Gardens Housing Projects [S. James Herman Gardens Housing Project, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: That's on the west side of Detroit?
Speaker 2: West side.  It was formerly located west side of Detroit.  It was, perhaps, the toughest housing projects in town; demolished nearly ten years ago because no one wanted to live there any more.  It had about a fifteen percent occupancy in the entire projects.  And, about every week, there was a murder; so, they kind of demolished it since no one wanted to live there any more.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now I know from your book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker], I read that it was--you and were on your own a lot--you and your brothers were home a lot, by yourselves.  Was that typical of that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, no, quite frankly.  There were a lot of stay-at-home mothers who might have been receiving state or federal assistance, single mothers.  So, I believe, that my mother was one of the few that worked so much.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of poverty and distress and a lot of the mothers and fathers kind of escaped that pain through alcohol, drugs and other tools of self destruction.  My mother escaped through her strong faith, in Christianity, and kind of force-fed that on us, too.  So, even though she wasn't around, every day, at all times; she made sure we'd go to church; and, if she couldn't take us to church that three days a week, she'd have the deacons come and get us.  So, my mother was a little different and our household was ran a lot different than most of the households there; and, that probably was our saving grace that laid the foundation for us to be able to overcome many of the things we experienced during that time.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: City Temple Seventh-day Adventist Church [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: SDAs [Seventh-day Adventist], they're usually vegetarians?
Speaker 2: Yes, well they aren't required to be vegetarians; many of them choose to be vegetarians.  They are prohibited from eating pork and prohibited from eating shellfish.  And, so, we adhered to that diet, by force--once again-- until we kind of grew up.  Two of my brothers still adhere to the Adventism and I am a Protestant of a different denomination, however, with those values, it stuck with me.
Speaker 1: You went to church on Saturday instead of Sunday.
Speaker 2: Friday, Saturday and Wednesdays.
Speaker 1: Also, you write about being in a lot of trouble, but what kind of things did you like to do and--before we get you in trouble?  What did you look forward to doing?
Speaker 2: I always looked forward to, as a adolescent, bike riding and athletics.  On that court, you were the man if you could put that J [jump shot] in the hole, or drive through the hole, and dish it off.  I played a lot of sports in the projects: football--once again--as I said basketball, and then bike riding.  It was a pretty large projects and we also used to ride in the other neighborhoods, to kind of get away from the projects, if you will.  So, those were two or three things that I did.  Most--and swimming.  We were fortunate enough to have a recreation facility nearby that had a large swimming pool.  I learned to be an avid swimmer, at a young age, as well.  And chase girls, of course (laughter), try to sweet talk them and do our thing.  We all thought we were cool.  Then, as I grew up, I wanted to emulate some of the other brothers who were singing the Motown songs on the corner; so, I would grab a little wine with the rest of them and get out there and try to sing The Temptations, and do the Temptations walk.
Story_ID: 278368
Speaker 1: There is a story I know there's a story about school where your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] came to school and defended you, in some way.  Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a little more assertive than just defending me.  My first grade teacher [at Herman Gardens Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] and--I was a incorrigible kid.  In first-grade, I was doing stuff--actually, after reading so much about attention deficit hyperactivity [disorder (ADHD)], I think I might have had a slight touch of that, particularly after, later in life, recognizing, in college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan], that I was focusing and multi-tasking, and focused on many things at one time--that's a classic signs of someone who may have attention deficit, but it benefits you as a adult.  So, as a child, I couldn't stay still--always active and defiant.  And, in this case, it was the first-grade; I was doing something wrong, I think I might even have been throwing a spitball or something at the teacher when she turned her back.  I was just terrible.  So, she smacked me, in my face.  So, when I went home, my mother said, "What happened to your face?" Well, I remember this woman's name, like it was just yesterday: Miss MacGivens [ph.]. A big woman, about three-hundred pounds.
Speaker 1: She left a--her handprint on you--
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My mother said, "What happened to your face?" It had a handprint on it. I said, "Miss MacGivens smacked me." She said, "Let's go." She walked me right back up there; probably what--about quarter mile. And, that time we went in, she asked for Miss MacGivens. I think she was doing her lesson plans for the next day, whatever; she was still there. She said, "Did you do this to my son?"  She said, "Yes, becau--." Before she could get another word out, my mother her laid out with a smack of her own.  And, my mother was not a violent person, but I think this was just so reprehensible to her; it was such an affront to her dignity, my dignity.  My mother was, you know, a hard-working, dignified-woman, church-woman and this was just a little beyond what she could accept.  And, needless to say, I didn't return to that school.  And, in fact, that was how I began my tenure at the Seventh-day Adventist Church-School [Peterson-Warren Academy, Inkster, Michigan].
Story_ID: 278369
Speaker 1: You're like six years old, now, right? Still six in first grade.  Were things there [Peterson-Warren Academy, Inkster, Michigan] any better?
Speaker 2: Well, they were a little more tolerant of me because they had known me, all of my life.  And, you know, I was always told I was a smart kid, but bad.  That was the tagline for me, he's smart, but he's so bad or he's bad but he's so smart or one of the other and I began to believe that.  So, in the classroom, I was always the first one to try to answer all the questions and prove I was smart; but, at the same time, next minute, I was always trying to prove how tough and bad I was. Mischievous, if you will, at that age.  They were a little more tolerant because they knew me, but my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] would get those phone calls; but, for the most part, I'd get paddled because, there, they believed in corporal punishment.  I remember the principals putting that board to my behind prob- at least once a week.
Speaker 1: Did it cost you mother to send you to SDA [Seventh-day Adventist] school?
Speaker 2: The interesting thing about her commitment to her faith and to education is that it cost eighty dollars a month for us to live in the housing projects.  It cost $120, however, for me to attend the church school.  Paid more for my church-school education than she did for our housing.  And,  back then, in the '60s [1960s], if you put together that [$]120 for tuition, eighty dollars for the public housing rent, two hundred dollars a month could have gotten you a pretty decent bungalow in Detroit [Michigan], back then; but, instead, she was convinced that she was doing the right thing.  As it turned out, her investment in education and spirituality is the foundation, which I used to overcome my obstacles.  You know I tell folks that because people always question, "How were you able to do it, Judge [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis]?  How were you able to leave jail and become a judge fifteen years later?  So many brothers like you drop out of school, only get a GED [General Educational Development], if that.  They are not able to go to college." Well, I always say to folks that--in jail, whether you know it or not, everyone, at some point, in jail gets this wake up call; and whether it's the first day, the second week, or midway through their stay, they get this epiphany, oh, I'm not going to do it any more. I'm through.  Getting on the call, making them collect calls: "Mama, I'm done.  I'll never to it again. Please forgive me.  Please help me.  I want to do the right thing." Everybody gets that wake-up call when they go to jail and they want to change for some--at some point.  Well, the problem is that most of them, in jail, have been failed by the education system or they failed the education system, a combination thereof.  And, secondly, a lot of them don't have a moral compass, believe it or not.  They just weren't raised with an urgence to adhere to right or wrong.  I mean they might know what is right or wrong, but if you are not constantly programmed and conditioned to do the right thing, you know, doing the wrong thing is not a real big deal to you.  The difference with me is that I was programmed and conditioned, regularly, to do the right thing.  Do the right thing, adhere to these Christian principles; this is what's right, this is what's right.  Stop doing what's wrong.  And, even though it didn't set in then, when I had my wake up call, I knew what to do. I knew what was right.  I knew the foundation to rely on: the spiritual principles that I had been taught.  I had a quality education that had been given to me by the private church-school; and, so, that's what allowed me to overcome my obstacles and leave jail and become successful, and that's why so many others are unable to do so.
Story_ID: 278370
Speaker 1: I want to go back to when you were a kid, and I know that there are a couple of stories that we probably need to get and one is--well, what was--did you have a favorite subject in school?  Is there something you really--
Speaker 2: Yes, social studies.  And, social studies was my favorite subject and probably starting from the time they began with that class--I don't know what, third or fourth grade [at Peterson-Warren Academy, Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 1: What was the reason for that?  Why social studies?
Speaker 2: You know, as I reflect back on it, I think it might have been a natural attraction to the dynamics of world affairs and how the world operates.  In other words, I can recall my brothers being members of the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  And, they rode through the projects selling their papers, you know.  It was a militant thing.  I used to take pictures in front of the poster with Huey Newton.  I have a picture holding the rifle, in front of Huey Newton's poster where he's holding a rifle.  Although, I was such a young kid, the subjects that were being discussed in social studies--I think I had an attraction to them.  And, as it turned out, I kind of pursued that line of work, if you will: being a political operative and later, as a judge and civil rights activist; so, pretty interesting.
Speaker 1: So you're at SDA [Seventh-day Adventist] school.  Did--were there any favorite teachers?  Any teachers that really made a big impression on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I can remember Miss McGruder [ph.].  Miss McGruder was my fourth grade teacher, she would oof twist my ear.  I can remember that.  She would make me stoop under the table.  She had all sorts of punishment for me, but what I remember--aside from her being just tough, she showed me a lot of love, too.  The tough-love combination. Wasn't just tough, she showed love, too.  That love was--she allowed me to display the better part of me, as well; and that being my intelligence, if you will, my gifts.
Speaker 1: Did she give you responsibilities in class?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did she give you opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yep. Gave me the opportunity to lead, display my gifts, et cetera. Made me feel good about myself.
Speaker 1: I read that you took a lot of pride in being smarter than the older kids, smarter than your brothers' friends.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Will you tell a story about that--being smarter than your brothers' friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, they would always come over.  My brother, my closest brother, is six years older than me.  The oldest brother is ten years older than me.  So, there's quite a few years, so I would always hang with the brother closest to my age, and him and his buddies.  When mom [Alice Lee Mathis] would go, they'd come over to the house and be playing cards.  Initially, they wouldn't want me to play because I was the young chump of the family, you know. "Get your young brother out of here, man.  Let us do our thing." I would, occasionally, be allowed to participate in whatever they were doing whether it was shooting dice, playing Tonk for money, and whatever the case might be.  Once they allowed me to play, I whooped them all.  You know, I would do it with flavor, if you will.  You know, would kind of rub it in their face. "Yeah.  Y'all can't beat me; y'all supposed to be this and that; y'all all older than me; y'all let this young boy out-play, y'all; manipulate y'all." You know I kind of rub it in their face.  I got a sense of pride beating the older guys and everything we were doing.
Speaker 1: Was it ever dangerous to do that?  I mean to rub it in their face too much?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really because, you know, they were my brothers' good friends, and they knew I was harmless.  They'd take a little ribbing from me.
Story_ID: 278371
Speaker 1: Now there was a crises involving some stolen merchandise, I think, I mean.  I forget the sequence.  I know at one point, I don't know if this happened-- one point you moved to the east side [of Detroit, Michigan] with your father [Charles Mathis].  Was this after this crises--this merchandise crises--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure which merchandise crises.
Speaker 1: There was something that was taken, from someone across the street or something.  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That was one of the times had I broken into someone's house, the next door neighbor's house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that and several others, but if you are referring to something taken from someone, across the street, that's as the close as I think--
Speaker 1: That's the one.  That's the one.  There's a story in the book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker] about it.  The neighbors--you broke into a neighbor's place and took something.  It really broke your mother's [Alice Lee Mathis] heart to think that you--
Speaker 2: Yep.  In this instance, I was a full-fledged thug.
Speaker 1: About how old were you?
Speaker 2: I was fifteen and a full-fledged thug, doing everything under the sun.  And, in this instance, our next door neighbor had gone on vacation.  I knew they were on vacation; my mother knew they were on vacation.  And when they returned, their house had been broken into.  And, of course, they came to tell my mother and asking if she had seen anyone.  And, of course, she hadn't.  And then, maybe that day or the day after, she came downstairs where I would typically be watching tele- with my hangout downstairs in the basement. She came through my hangout.  She noticed that the big trunk-chest that folks used to keep back then and, I guess some folks still keep them--that the blankets that were usually stored inside, were sitting on top of the trunk-chest.  So, that made her suspicious: what the blankets--they are usually here for year round, inside.  Why're they suddenly on top?  So, she calls me down, having lifted up the trunk, and showed me when I got downstairs. "How did this get here?"
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: The next door neighbor's stereo, and, I think, like, a thirteen, fourteen-inch television.  I didn't say a word. I said, "I don't know." Or, something of that nature.  She began to cry.  Then, she went next-door to the neighbor, brought the neighbor over, and asked if that was their things. They said, "It was." So, my mother immediately called the police, one of her several instances where she called the police on me.  And, fortunately, the neighbor refused to prosecute but they got their things back.  And, that was one of my lowest moments in my teenage years.
Speaker 1: It seems where you are trying to balance--you've got your mother's instructions and the church [Seventh-day Adventist], on one hand; and, then stuff is going on, most of time, when no one is there with the neighborhood.  It was hard--it was really tough for you to balance that, at that time, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very tough to balance because there was so much peer pressure; as it is today, in impoverished drug and crime-infested environments, there is a lot of peer pressure.  And, it's almost like you are a predator or you're a victim; so, I didn't want to be a victim, so, I was part of the predator crowd, unfortunately.  That's the case today, you see these young guys saying, "Hey, I had to join the gang.  Otherwise, the gang was gon-- were going to victimize me."
Story_ID: 278372
Speaker 1: You were in a gang called the Errol Flynns, and we were discussing, before you came in, they said, Errol Flynns?  How in the world did they get--this is a gang in the '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I know, in my generation, I'm about ten years older than you; Errol Flynn was someone I saw in old movies.  He wasn't anybody that we thought of as active hero; he was died by the time I saw him.  So, how did they get a name the Errol Flynns?  Was it--
Speaker 2: You know, by that time, the Errol Flynn '[The Adventures of] Robin Hood' was coming on television pretty frequently.  As a, you know, in the black-and-white, or whatever, maybe even in color, by then, as it left movies were in reruns, on television.  So, that's where it came from.  Robin Hood: flashy, swashbuckling, robbed from the rich, give to the poor.  So, that's where we got the name.  We were flashy; we were swashbuckling; and we were robbing the rich.
Speaker 1: Was it an old gang when you got into it or had it--been-?
Speaker 2: No, when I joined up, it had only been around about three to five years.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Who formed it?
Speaker 2: As I recall, they said Big Keith.  I think Keith's last name was Parker.  Who was that?  A couple of others.  They all had slang names: so, Big Mike, Dirty Mike--Dirty Mike and Big Keith.
Speaker 1: There was always a lore behind the development of the gangs.  Who started them depending on what they were about?  Did you have to go through an initiation?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  In the '70s [1970s], in Detroit [Michigan], as we were involved in street violence, it didn't involve as much guns as they do today.  The guns just weren't available.  If you had a gun, you were lucky, it's because you broke into somebody's house and found their gun.  You had broken into a gun shop.  They were doing that, as well; or, brought it from a crooked police.  That was happening a lot; or, you made a gun--the zip gun.  And, so you might have, out of the ten people that might be with your crew, only one gun in the whole crew.  So, the violence we engaged in for the most part might involve knives.  I remember we had brass knuckles, billy clubs, things of that nature.  And, much of our activity though, involved theft, or, what we referred to as hit and run robberies.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't beating people up and that sort of thing--?
Speaker 2: Naw. And, it wasn't drug dealing gangs, as we see today.  It was more theft and reselling of the things you stole.  That was pretty much the gang activity of the day then.
Speaker 1: I'm surprised there was no initiation, 'cause most of the Chicago [Illinois] gangs--there was some kind of period of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, they have them where you have to shoot somebody or rob somebody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I've heard that but I didn't think that was the case, then, in those days; but, I thought that maybe there was some--
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't.
Speaker 1: --something you had to do--okay.
Speaker 2: Nope.  Just had to be willing to be down.
Story_ID: 278373
Speaker 1: Were the gangs geographically-based? Errol Flynn[s] represent a certain part of Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: It started on the east side of Detroit, primarily.  And, then you had guys who started their little crew, if you will, on another part of town--west side or what have you; but, for the most part; it started on the east side of Detroit.
Speaker 1: So, did you--were you introduced to it, on the east side, when you were staying with your father [Charles Mathis]?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yes.  I went to visit with my father, one summer, because my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] said she was through, wiping her hands of me, at least for the summer; and, wanted to give my father a shot at raising me, or helping to raise me.  I hadn't seen him.  As I recall, I hadn't seen him since age five or six.  So, I would say I was fourteen, I believe, at that time, when I went to stay the summer with him.  He owned this restaurant and above the little storefront--
Speaker 1: Do you remember where it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a storefront restaurant, in Detroit, on the east side, on Van Dyke [Avenue] and Harper [Avenue], which is heavily, at least it was at that time, heavily gang-populated with Errol Flynns.  Another gang, nearby, called the Black Killers, BKs.  And, my father had this storefront greasy-spoon.  Upstairs, from the storefront greasy-spoon, he had a second-hand, resale shop selling second-hand clothing, whatever, furniture, whatever, TVs.  And, then, he lived on the other side of the storefront.  So, it was one building he kind of operated; and, so when I got there, his first thing was: "Here, take this apron and go to work," or "Take this broom and go to work in the restaurant." So, as I begin working in restaurant, the first couple of days, I saw how the Errol Flynn members, you know they were very distinct; I always knew who they were.  They always had the big Barceloni hats [sic. Borsalino hat]; wear blazers, all black; dressed up, and if you could afford it, a three-piece-suit.
Speaker 1: Let me just pause a second.  Detroit is known as one of the centers of Italian clothes that are usually sold to black people; and, in the old days, it was usually about the Jewish merchants had the major stores that would sell Italian clothes.  Like when we'd buy the most expensive clothes, Detroit was definitely the center of the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Absolutely and we were part of that.  We were very much a part of that and that's different from today's gangs.  The Errol Flynns, at least, were very sharp.  A couple of other gangs, in Detroit, didn't wear suits either and the big Barcelona expensive hats and glass-heel shoes; but, that's what we wore.  That was our uniform; we'd used to even carry a briefcase.
Speaker 1: This was the early '70s [1970s].  Did you have the platform shoes?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Absolutely.  Yep.  Glass heels, platforms.
Speaker 1: And briefcases?
Speaker 2: Yep.  And, nothing in it unless it was something, you know, paraphernalia of some sort, and carry an umbrella when it wasn't raining.  Kind of this English gentleman-type look.
Speaker 1: What kind of colors?
Speaker 2: Black, all black.  And, so I'd see them coming in to my father's restaurant.  They'd come in with big bags; go in the back where he was, come out empty-handed.  So, I--it didn't take me long to figure out that Dad was a fence.
Speaker 1: So, the resale shop was a--
Speaker 2: No question, about it.  It was where he was selling stolen merchandise that he purchased from the Errol Flynn gang.
Story_ID: 278374
Speaker 1: So, we were taking about the Errol Flynns. That's a--was that considered the most effective gang, in town [Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were probably the most notorious, because they were so flashy and flamboyant, and that was the case there.  And, with my father [Charles Mathis], once again, once I noticed he was sell--buying hot items off the Errol Flynn gang when they were going in the back, and seeing them come out empty-handed after taking large bags of items back there.  I said, okay, well this ain't nothing but what I'm used to.  This is game.  I'm used to this.  I've been a part of this; so, Dad is a part of it.  Okay, I see what this is; so, it wasn't long until I start hanging with the guys who was feeding him the stolen merchandise, became Errol Flynn myself.  His words to me were, "Hey.  I ain't raising no babies.  You get caught, you on your own." So, "Okay, Dad.  Thank you."
Speaker 1: He didn't do any preaching (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  My father was a street hustler.  I didn't know it until then, but once I found out--I found out little more and more.  And, I found out that yeah, I think he ran numbers for a minute.
Speaker 1: Did that make things worse for you when you finally go back to your brother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I felt validated.  Okay, this is what my dad is about.  And, the images that I had saw or seen, of black men in the projects, pimps and hustlers, were the guys we looked up to.  They're the ones that had the material items, and flashy clothes, and the jewelry and the cars; so, my dad was one of them and these were the guys that we admired.  So, that's what I wanted to be like.
Speaker 1: So, all the while, you're still going to school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Still going to the church-school. Had been kicked out once or twice; and, bounced around to a couple of the different church-schools even.
Speaker 1: Did they have a high school?
Speaker 2: It went from grade one through twelve.
Speaker 1: So, you were at a SDA [Seventh-day Adventist] high school?
Speaker 2: Yep. No!  By then, I couldn't return there [Southfield Academy, Southfield, Michigan] after the seventh grade.  So, I was kicked out permanently. I think I went to three--I had attended two Seventh-day Adventist schools and then a public school for a short time, Cody High School [Detroit, Michigan], which is right near our home, the projects there; but, I didn't last there because I was kicked out permanently, I believe, for carrying a gun, or something.
Speaker 1: You had a gun by then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  By age fourteen, I believe I had a gun.
Speaker 1: That's serious. Now, you said not everybody had a gun, so you must have been--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was kind of--I was one of the most wild of the gang members, primarily because I was light-skinned and had to be.  You know, back then, and to a lesser-extent now, when you're living in those drug and crime-infested, impoverished communities, you know-you're light-skinned and they'd kind of look at you like you're soft, or like you're a punk, at least they did back then.  You're light-skinned.  You know, so, he must be soft; so, he must've had to be the craziest one out of the crew; otherwise, I would be victimized.  They would look at me like I was a punk.  I had to prove I wasn't no punk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd always try be the first one to get a gun.  As it was time to make a move, I was the first one to make a move; I had to show the most courage; so, I was kind of one of the wild--wilder of the bunch.
Speaker 1: What happened that finally--there's a lot of schools you're being kicked out of--
Speaker 2: Arrested several times going down to juvenile.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Alice Lee Mathis] doesn't like any of this and can't really--
Speaker 2: She's kind of written me off, at this point.  She put me in God's hands, as she said.  She would pray for us and pray for me, in particular; and, you know, refused any assistance, by that time. "I'm not buying you any more clothes.  I'm not providing any other monies for you."  I think she was cooking less frequently.  You know, she was like: "If you want to be a thug then I'm not going to have any more part in your life."
Speaker 1: What reaction did your brothers have? They were so much older
Speaker 2: A couple of them were struggling with their own challenges of the street.  And, the oldest brother, by that time, had--he was fortunate enough to go to college.  And, he went on to college.
Speaker 1: He was able to get out and go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was able to get out. Fortunately, he went to college in the '60s [1960s].  The projects didn't turn deadly, if you will, until about 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when all the real havoc began to reign.  Seems like it was around the time the soldiers started coming home from [the] Vietnam [War] and bringing heroin back.  So, you had a bunch of dope-fiends nodding out all through the projects, all the time.  Then, everybody was stealing and robbing, and that's when it turned bad; when the heroin came back from Vietnam.
Story_ID: 278375
Speaker 1: Things are escalating and escalating, and I know from reading the book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker], things continue to escalate, until you--eventually you're stopped.  You had to be stopped, basically, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, jail was the first barrier to staying in the street.
Speaker 1: What charge did they--?
Speaker 2: I had a gun charge with some dope.  I got caught with some dope and a gun.  I think it was pills.  I had some pills I was moving in the street, a   38 [mm]; so, I was caught and jailed for seven months, stayed in the county jail.  As I said, that was a wake-up call for me because that was the first time I had been in jail with adults.  All the other times, I was seventeen being tried as an adult.
Speaker 1: You had been in juvenile?
Speaker 2: Several times.  Just like overnight or two days because none of the charges had ever stuck, I had never been convicted as a delinquent juvenile.  So, in this instance, not only was it a wake-up call to be there with these veteran criminals who were much older than me, stronger than me, slicker and sicker than me.  That came as a wake-up call; and then, secondly, my mom [Alice Lee Mathis] came to visit me and told me she was dying of cancer.  She had been diagnosed with cancer.  Reminded me of all the turmoil I had caused, all the embarrassment and humiliation.  You know, kind of begged me to change before she died.  That was the biggest wake-up call; so, at my sentencing, which I pled guilty and plea-bargained to a reduced charge.  She asked the judge [Charles Kaufman] to be lenient on me, told him that I was smart, and asked the judge to make me go back to school to help change my life.  The judge ordered me to get a GED [General Educational Development], within six months, as a condition of my release. Gave me, I think, it was five-years or three-years probation; in addition, to getting my GED, and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was it easy to do that?  I hear you about your mother's speech and everything, but once you get out.  Today, one of the biggest problems in the community are people come out of jail and get back in the same environment and do the same thing again.  They almost always do.
Speaker 2: And, it happens probably within nine months, six to nine months; about that time, they start losing hope after six months. Try their best to find a job or achieve some level or measure of success and if they see no incremental success coming, yeah, you're right; they go right back to the street.  There's nothing and this mainstream society is not for me.
Story_ID: 278376
Speaker 1: --Was there anybody who stepped up as a mentor that you came in contact with that really gave you--?
Speaker 2: Two things: one, when I obtained my GED [General Educational Development] as ordered by the judge [Charles Kaufman] within six months, it gave me a sense of achievement and a sense of hope.  Made me feel, hey, I can do this because I hadn't been in school since tenth grade. So, now two, three years later, passing the GED.  I took a course--prep course, passed the test on the first go-around; so, that gave me a sense of hope.  I went and applied for the [U.S.] Army.  So, the motivation was to show my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] that I would be all right before she passed; and, somehow I felt that if I did right that God would spare her.  You know, so that was a big motivation for me; and, then once I applied for the Army, they rejected me.  They rejected me because I had this conviction; so, I had a cousin who was attending--working on either undergrad or master's degree--he ultimately got a master's degree from Eastern Michigan University [Ypsilanti, Michigan].  He, by the way, is the cousin that--named Addison Hines-that provided the avenue for us to move from the projects.  My mother was assaulted, in an attempted-rape, I think 1975 when we were in the projects by a heroin addict who held her at gunpoint.  He was unsuccessful.  We caught him, needless to say, whipped him up pretty good; he was unable to testify in court because of brain damage.  She had four boys; and, her four boys had a lot of friends, in those projects.  And, so vigilantism took over that night.  In any event, he helped us move out six months later to a townhouse/cooperative where he was a manager, this cousin of mine.  So, this same cousin reached out to me since we were living in that townhouse/cooperative.  He reached out to me and my mother would always go to him and say, "Can you help him?  Can you help him?" So, he reached out and said, "Hey, I can get you in college, up here, at Eastern."  I said, "Yeah, right.  Rich kids go to college.  I don't even know how my brother--he--the only way he went was 'cause he had a full scholarship.  I'm not getting a scholarship; we don't have any money.  So, how I'm going to college?  Number two: I don't even have a diploma, let alone good grades.  My oldest brother had B+ average; that's why he got a scholarship; he was a nerd; he was a square.  I've been a thug all my life.  Yeah, I can't get in."  He said, "Well, if I get you in, will you go?"  I said, "Yeah, fine, whatever." I humored him.  Sure enough, he took me and I went to the minority affairs admissions office that had this affirmative action program seeking to help disadvantaged, at-risk minorities.  So, after interviewing with the director of minority admissions, Clarence Light, who I would later have a relationship with when I began working at city hall that was beneficial to him.  He, after, receiving my GED scores and interviewing me, personally, he decided to recommend that the university take a risk on me.  So, I was admitted within six months after getting my GED to Eastern Michigan University.  So, the difference was: one, I had that ray of hope that came when I obtained my GED six months after leaving; two, motivation of my mother, doing right by her; three, my admission to a university that took me out of the environment.  A lot of this is environmental; a lot of the destructive life styles that we see many of us living--is a result of what's around of us.  As I said, it's the peer pressure and it's the environment; and, if that's what everybody is doing, it takes a whole lot of strength and courage to do something differently.  And, in college, I began to do what college students did.  When I was on the street and living in the projects, I did what the street thugs did.  When I was in college, I did what they did.
Story_ID: 278377
Speaker 1: College can be distracting, too, you know.  I've heard stories of people who leave the street-life and go to college and recreate it in college.  Sometimes that happens.
Speaker 2: Do what in college?
Speaker 1: Recreate the street life in college, with people from their hometown or neighborhood. Or others from--
Speaker 2: That's exactly what happened, let me tell you; I won't tell you anything different.  Indeed, when I was admitted to college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan], I was so proud and happy because my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] hadn't passed.  However, I wanted to keep doing right, but three months after I was admitted--three months into my education, she did pass.  So, I was on my own in college, very angry, quite frankly.  I had lost my mother; so, I kind of reverted back to the streets.  It was kind of a transition period.  You know I didn't go from being a thug to a square, college student overnight, it took a couple years, quite frankly, to get all of that street out of me.
Speaker 1: I can image that your mother was very proud of you: going to college.  She probably never thought that would happen.
Speaker 2: Correct.  You know, even though she knew I had some gifts that if I used them properly, I could be successful.  I don't know if she ever thought I would use them properly.  Yep, so, she was very proud to me turn my life around and go to college.  I'm glad that she was able to see that before passing on.
Speaker 1: Did you begin to slag when she--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went back sliding, a little; but just a little, light hustles.  You know, quite frankly, back in the street, in Detroit [Michigan], it was hardcore; it was about the gun; it was about going in folks' houses; it was about a lot of things that I would prefer not to even admit--fess up to.   But, you know, a little, lightweight stuff, at college; little weed [marijuana]; other little con games: a little fraud and deception and misrepresentation.  I'm using all the legal terms of it.
Speaker 1: The typical college student, in other words.
Speaker 2: Is that what they do?
Story_ID: 278378
Speaker 1: And then, I even was flipping Three-card Monte, at the student center.  That's how I met my wife [Linda Mathis], as a matter of fact, who was then my girlfriend.  I was flipping Three-card Monte, at college [at Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan]. She went and--saw me and my man; she peeped the game.  She said, "They working together!" And, she flipped over the red card and didn't have any money down; so, I cussed her out, so bad.   "You don't have any money down here.  Who do you think you are?" I didn't know who she was.  A couple of days later, she saw me on campus walking around, I tried to apologize.  I said, "Hey, baby," you know, fast "I'm sorry for going off on you like that" She said, "What you doing up here?  You a thug.  You don't need to be up here; this is for college students.  What you doing up here."  I said, "What you talking about, I go here in college; and, I'm doing pretty good, by the way." So she says now that that kind of intrigued her.  The fact that she thought I was just a straight thug, but indeed I was a successful college student, by that time.
Story_ID: 278379
Speaker 1: What were you majoring in, in college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I started out, doing what everybody else said I should do, and that is engineering or business administration, because that's where the jobs were.  My first semester, engineering.  I was reading up on it and hearing about the classes.  I don't think I like that.  So, next semester, business administration.
Speaker 1: You must have been a good math student.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  That was the (laughter) that was the problem.  When they started hitting me--those were my weakest courses.  And, when they started hitting me with them, I quickly determined that I wouldn't be in business nor engineering.  The fact is, my first year, perhaps year-and-a-half, I was on academic probation because those courses were killing me.  I had never went past algebra, in high school, and went to the tenth grade. Never had a chemistry course.  Don't even remember whether I had a biology course, in high school [Cody High School, Detroit, Michigan].  So, when they started hitting me with that; I was on the ropes, averaging Ds in all my math and science courses.  The only thing that saved me were the: English, political science; social studies, my favorite subject; psychology, those type of courses.  I did very well in, in college, the first two years. That kept me in. And, so, I decided I couldn't be in business nor could I be an engineer where everybody's saying the money and jobs fields they were going to be going to be the most successful in.  Well, I went to the library, and I tell young people this all the time. I actually went to the library and got this career handbook. I said I'm gonna look up something else. And the career handbook had a test that you could take to tell you what you're most skilled at and what careers your skills would allow you to be most successful in.  So, I took this battery, or this test, and, it gave me a list of things I'll be great at; a social worker, school teacher, lawyer, psychologist.  So, of course, I said well, I thought long about the sociologist or social worker, because you know, once again I was attracted to wanting to change conditions of my community and attracted to being involved in the outside world somehow (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, were you able to then--at that age--make a connection between--I mean it's one thing to hear you now, as [HistoryMaker] Judge [Gregory] Mathis, talk about the social conditions creating, you know, mayhem in people and that sort of thing, but at that age, had you begin, had you begun to put it together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because one: I used to read some of those Black Panther [Black Panther Party] papers that my brother used to bring home. Read 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], which was very eye-opening. [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson, Jesse Jackson, had come to speak to the jail facility I was in and spoke to us jailers while we were there, and, that kind of motivated me to want to get into the movement. And, so all those things kind of converged when I took that test.  I said social work, I can kind of help solve some of the problems in my community.  Then, I said, but I remember Malcolm [X] always wanted to be a lawyer, but by then I was feeling like, you know, that he was one of my role-models then.  Malcolm went to jail, he came out, and he became somebody.  And, he was able to make a difference in his community.  That's what I want to do.  I want to do what Malcolm did.  Not that I thought I was anything like him.  I certainly have never been that--had that strength of character, but he was a great role-model; and so, I recall, that he told the teacher he wanted to be a lawyer and the teacher told him he could never be a lawyer. So he said--
Speaker 1: He said more than that, I think, in the autobiography.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right.  So, I wanted to be a lawyer; and, I decided I wanted to be a lawyer.  And, this is the best way to achieve justice and social change.  So, from that point on, I switched my major to public administration which was the business of public policy meaning running non-profits, working for government agencies.  And the reason I chose that is because I had enough business courses to transfer those over to a new major.  And, so, I took those business courses I had taken enroute to a business administration degree, transferred over to a public administration degree and majored in that, in undergrad, with a desire to go to law school.

Speaker 1: And then, for the next two years, I became a campus leader.  Within two years, I had been the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]; president of the College Democrats; president of the public administration clubs.  I was leading anti-apartheid or, divestiture. Apartheid divestiture campaigns on campus, voter registration drives.  I mean I just became all-out political activist on campus.
Speaker 2: Did they have a black student organization?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Were you a part of that?
Speaker 1: No!  We didn't have a Black Student Union; we had the NAACP.  That was the activist arm.  I started out as a member; and, one year later, was president.
Speaker 2: Were you like mentored by the local NAACP, in Detroit [Michigan], or--
Speaker 1: No, we just had a campus chapter; and I don't recall--no, we didn't have any association with any adult groups.  We had a charter that we had to abide by that was given from the national headquarters.
Speaker 2: Eastern [Michigan University] is in Ypsilanti [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  One mile away [sic.] from University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: What were some of the issues on campus?
Speaker 1: One, apartheid.  I can remember they had this golf player, Gary Player, was his name.  He was coming for a tournament, or, to visit Eastern Michigan University; and, this was at the height of apartheid, '79 [1979], '80 [1980], and there was this anti-apartment [sic. apartheid] movement going on throughout the world and they were going to bring him to town; so, we met, the NAACP students union met and many other campus organizations came together and we determined that we were going to protest it.  So, I helped lead a big march on campus and we had the administration change their mind about bringing him to town; and, then a few months later, we had another march for divestiture to divest the investments that the university held from any companies that did business in South Africa, as did many other college campuses.  So, we were successful there.  Eastern Michigan removed any funding from any corporation or any investment banking companies that held stocks with companies doing business in South Africa.  So, those were two of the biggest achievements, I recall. And then, I can recall, as president of the College Democrats, I led a college campaign for the local--I'm sorry--for the state gubernatorial race, the Democratic candidate for the State of Michigan governorship; and he won, James Blanchard.  You know, I felt a little proud, of course.  I thought I did the whole thing.  It was my (laughter) no--I felt I played my little role as head of the campus campaign.
Story_ID: 278381
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating did you envision yourself going to law school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Once, I determined that I was going to be a lawyer, there was no question in my mind.  I was going to go to somebody's law school; and, I did not even worry about the fact that I had this felony on my record.  I was like, whatever, I'm doing this.  I'm not going to be stopped.
Speaker 1: I don't know if this is time but there's a story, in your book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker], that is profound when you go back to your old neighborhood and you actually get jumped on.  You're actually looking at all the mayhem going on, wondering how-so tell us that
Speaker 2: That was after my first year.  That was the first summer after my first year, in college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan].  I went back to the neighborhood to try to tell the brothers, "Hey, man. If y'all get a GED [General Educational Development], I can get you-all in college; get your financial aid--," try to sing the same song my cousin [Addison Hines] that who had gotten me in college had sang to me.  I said I going to take this good news back to the hood with some of my other partners.  Well, the same guys, I would--used to hang with and running the street with, pistol-whipped me and robbed me. Told me they didn't want anything to do with the white man's world and say matter-of-fact since you come in here talking about this, you're not one of us anymore.  Give up what you got.  Boom. Pistol-whipped me, took my clothes, my money, shoes, everything.  Yes, Sir.  Same guys I used to run with.  D'Angelo [ph.] is dead, now, of course.  He was dead probably within five years of that.
Speaker 1: It was a rough set to say the least.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now you're--?
Speaker 2: By this time, I'm a senior when I'm running campaigns; and, in terms, of law school, I'm getting my plan together.  And, by the same token, I'm have this B plan to work in Detroit [Michigan] politics, just in case I can't get into law school, or can't get into law school because of my record.  So I had the A plan and the B plan.  A plan, I want to as a lawyer, in a civil rights organization; so, I could make a difference for my people.  I wanted to work for social justice and social change.  B plan, I'll just work in politics as a political operative and try to make a difference there.
Story_ID: 278382
Speaker 1: We got you graduating from Eastern Michigan [University, Ypsilanti, Michigan]. Now who were some of the professors or--did you have any mentors there or off campus?  I mean, I know off campus you probably did, in [Operation] PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I really didn't have any mentors when graduating because most of my life was centered around the campus.  With the exception of my cousin [Addison Hines], who was still a part of my life, he would probably have been the only mentor that I had.  And, my oldest brother had, by that time, had allowed me to be a part of his life.  He was newly married and a professional, at that time, working for General Motors [GM], Ron [Mathis]. And, so, I was somewhat a part of his life, but you know everybody I knew and had grown-up with were street people.  So, I didn't abandon them; and, so, I still kind of hung with the street guys that I grew up with, and particularly the ones that weren't deep in the streets, in terms of the violence and the gun play.  Some of them would be involved in drug dealing; and, you know, they never brought that around me; we'd meet-up at the club, drink some champagne, talk some smack, chase some women, and that would be the end of it.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Eugene] Rivers, in Boston [Massachusetts], used to run a national ten-point plan coalition [National Ten Point Leadership Foundation] used to say that about one of ten thugs there's nothing that you can do for them.  Most of the rest of them, you find them jobs, or get them in school or find out what they're interested in and talk to them.  But, there's a tenth guy, usually, that's so beyond immediate redemption, anyway, that he's got to go to jail or something.
Speaker 2: He might be right.  And, I think it might be more than that need to be taken off the street, at some point, until their wake-up call comes.  I think it is more than one out of ten.  I think it is a very significant number who are not ready to change.  See, one of the things society attempts to do is--particularly family members and others--we want to change people before they are prepared to change.  You can't change somebody who, in their heart, just wants to be a thug; if that's the life they choose to live.  You've got to wait until they want to wake-up; otherwise, get them off the street, away them from you; protect yourself because if they want to be-if they want to keep smoking crack [crack cocaine], if they want to keep living with you, they want to keep ripping your off.  At some point, it is going to backfire: they going to take something very valuable from you to buy their crack; they are going to hurt you to get that crack; or, you're going to be hurt because they owe somebody for their crack habit.  And, as much as, you can beg and plead and cry for them to relinquish their habit, and to kick the crack habit, they're not going to do it until they're ready, until they say, "I need a wake-up call; I need to go to rehab." That's when you get change, that's when you step in.
Speaker 1: But from some of the things that you've told us today, I think that the efforts to turn youth around are not wasted, apparently.  You sited listening to [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson speak, your mother's [Alice Lee Mathis] presentation, the shock of being in jail, for the first time with grown men. Sometimes, you hear a lot of speeches, on TV, these days and people go to schools and talk.  I'm sure you've been to a lot of schools and told your story.  Probably, a lot of kids, "Ah, I've heard this story."
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Anybody can hear this stuff.  You can hear it on '[The] Oprah Winfrey Show.'
Speaker 2: And, later, it might settle in.  Later, those things settle in; however, at the moment, they're blowing it off.  It's not really changing their mind; unless, they're ready.  That's my point.  There are a lot of young people who are ready.  They do want to leave those streets and they don't see a way out.  So, when a Pastor Rivers or Father Rivers or others come, me when I go and speak, I connect with them.  Reverend Jackson came to the jailhouse, where I was at, and spoke, I connected because I was ready.  So, they still have to be ready. Otherwise, they going to get their money.  They're not listening to what you talking about; or, they're going to get their pipe.
Story_ID: 278383
Speaker 1: What'd you do immediately after you graduated?  Now you got married didn't you, shortly thereafter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I--not yet.
Speaker 1: Not yet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know it's close.
Speaker 2: Close.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I graduated in '83 [1983]; and, it was January '83.  I was supposed to have graduated in '82 [1982], but graduated instead in January of '83; so, there was a whole semester lapse and so I pursued additional classes so that I could maintain my financial aid.  I didn't have any money otherwise; and, obtained a volunteer internship with the Detroit City Council.  So, I commuted from Ypsilanti [Michigan] by Greyhound [Lines], forty-five minute ride, twice a week from Eastern Michigan [University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] to downtown Detroit [Michigan], where city hall was located.  And, was an intern for Council President Erma Henderson in Detroit.  Did that for six months.  During that six months, I had taken the law school admission test [LSAT].  I had volunteered for various campaigns, and then I applied to thirty different law schools around the country because I had decent grades, but I had to catch up.  So, my last two years my grades were great: A's, Bs.  But, you know, the first two years, transition period and choosing the wrong major, didn't do me well with my grade point average.  So, I applied to thirty different schools to make sure I would get in somewhere.  Thanks goodness I did.  I got into three schools.  One of which was the University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] in downtown Detroit. The other two were University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi], or something of that nature, and the University of Portland Law School [ph.], but I was prepared to go there. I said, "Well, I'm going to be in Mississippi; I'm going to be in Portland because I'm going to law school."  So, fortunately, I was accepted there [University of Detroit] under the affirmative action program again; and, at the same time, this was 1983, [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson launched his presidential campaign.  So, of course, I went to one of the organizing meetings, when he came to town.  Wanting to volunteer, get involved, hoping to get a chance to say something to him, as well, about my first encounter with him, and I did.  I was able--it was only about twenty people there; so, whatever opportunity I had, I took advantage to speak to him say, "Hey, I was a young man, you came to speak while I was in jail. You suggested I go to college and, I want to work with you."  He immediately, on site, appointed me as the youth director for the State of Michigan for his campaign, volunteer, of course; but that was my initiation into big-time politics, if you will.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to hang out with Jesse Jackson and his entourage?
Speaker 2: Yes, when he came to town; but you know, like when you say entourage, I'd probably be like twenty people down.  I was like the twentieth member in their entourage.
Speaker 1: But I'm sure they were watching you, though 'cause they like young people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The members of the entourage were.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they like young people to be involved.
Speaker 2: Yes, I had a mentor [Annette Rainwater]--
Speaker 1: I don't think young people really understand that older people really are watching them and really want them.
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.
Story_ID: 278384
Speaker 1: I had obtained a mentor, by that time, who was an employee for another councilperson, Councilman Clyde Cleveland.  And, her name is Annette Rainwater; to this day we still are very close.  And, she saw something in me. She saw an energy in me; she saw an ability to organize and relate to average grass-root people; and, she thought that was, you know, kind of skillful, knowing that a lot of these guys come from college not quite able to relate to street-people and grass-root people.  And, I had that ability because of where I came from; and, she had a long association with [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson going back to [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] days.  So, when he came to town, she's the one that told me about the organizing meeting.  I said, "Oh yeah, I met him when I was in jail."  She told me, "Well, I went to visit.  I went to those jails with him whenever he came to Detroit [Michigan].  I might have met you there."  Et cetera. And when we got to the meeting, he appointed me and he told Rainwater, and she was one of the primary organizers.  So, she took me under her wings and worked me to death. Worked me to death with tough love. Cursing me out every day, hollering at me.  That was her style and she beat me into shape, and mentored me.  After the campaign [1983-1984 presidential campaign], she had her boss to hire me for--the council president whom I volunteered for, didn't hire me;  but her boss, Councilman Cleveland, did hire me and I worked under her for the next five years.  The four years afterwards, after having served as Reverend Jackson's state youth coordinator, when he ran in '88 [1988], I was the state campaign manager-- the youngest in the country.  And, we had the biggest victory of his electoral career. Michigan was the only northern state, he has ever won during his presidential primaries and I was the manager of that election.
Speaker 2: That was big drama, in those days.  In 1983, and in the Internet-age, Jesse Jackson made quite a showing for himself.  He didn't--I don't think anybody else thought he was going to win, but he did win in Michigan.  Like you said, I don't think that anyone else thought he was going to win the nomination but his articulation at those debates was something.  Wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, a lot of people didn't recognize the gain and the opportunity to gain that was involved in his campaign.  One, like you say, we raised the issues not being addressed in presidential campaigns.  Issues relating to apartheid in South Africa; issues relating to poverty in the inner-cities, affirmative action.  Things of that nature that affected the minority communities:  whether it was Native American; whether it was Latino; whether it was African American; whether it was white women.  You know, those issues weren't being addressed in these campaigns.  So, that raised the bar on presidential elections and the issues that had to be addressed; secondly, when he ran, you had minorities in every city running for other offices:  they were running for school board; they were running for the state legislature; they were running for [Detroit] City Council. And, so, when he ran and his primary came to that state, and others were on the ballot, he drew people to the polls who had never voted and who never intended to vote, but because a black man who spoke to their issues was on the ballot, they were going to vote.  So, when they came to vote for Jesse Jackson, you know who else they had to choose?  Black legislator, Latino city council member, the white female school board member, and, all of them were elected on his coattails.  So, he may not have been elected president, but he elected so many others on his coattail and engaged millions of people who were disenfranchised and not a part of the electoral system that it affected the national policy--the public policies of our country.
Speaker 2: Is there any one aspect of when his campaign was the most difficult?
Speaker 1: Yes.  The hours: it was grueling, grueling hours.  Grueling, grueling hours and trying--I was in law school [at University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], and missing a lot of my classes.  It's just overwhelmed I was overwhelmed.  I had a young family, by that time, in '88 [1988], in particular.
Speaker 2: So when did you get married?
Speaker 1: I got married in '85 [1985] once I had a stable job with the city councilman, and my wife [Linda Mathis] graduated in '85 from Eastern Michigan [University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] where we had met.  She graduated two years after me; so, we were married then.
Story_ID: 278385
Speaker 1: So, when did you graduate from law school [at University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from law school in eighty--last of '88 [1988], maybe the beginning of '89 [1989].  It might have been the beginning of January of '89 [1989].  I'm always--I took a four-year program, part-time, night-school.  And, I might have done four and a half years 'cause as I said, I was so stressed out working full-time for the [Detroit] City Council, running campaigns, and going to law school at night.  Really stressed-out.
Speaker 1: In retrospect, when you look at of the City of Detroit [Michigan] is, at that time Coleman Young was the mayor and he's not now but--and these have changed in Detroit.  People lament the Coleman Young days.  Do you have any reflections on what the city council was like then and what it's like now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of the primary reasons I think Detroit has as many challenges as it does, economically and otherwise, is the division that existed and to a certain extent still exists: a division between black and white; a division between black and black; a division between poor and the middle class.  So many divisions.  And, that was a result, in my opinion, of much of the history of Detroit.  When you look at history of Detroit, you see a city that was one of the most vibrant, industrial cities in America, the leading industrial city in America in the earlier part of the 20th century with Henry Ford and the automobile.  And, then General Motors [GM] and Chrysler [Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan], all headquartered there, in Detroit. Which, then you had millions of African Americans coming from the South, for those factory jobs.  And, so, you had millions of black people coming from down south having, lived in segregation and in an oppressed environment. Coming to access jobs and opportunity in the North; and, in turn, that caused a lot of fear among whites who had never had to deal with such large numbers of African Americans.  In the North, because we know most African Americans were from the South lived in the South up until the mid-20th century; and so, we automatically we had a ball of confusion, if you will.  By the '40s [1940s], I think, Detroit had already had a race riot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right, '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: Then, again, some twenty years later, we had a race riot, so we just couldn't get along as Rodney King said, "Can't we all just get along?" No, we couldn't.  There was racism and then we had the unions.  There was economic fight for justice: racial justice, economic justice.  All that, in an industrial city, with wealthy industrial barons controlling the economy.
Story_ID: 278386
Speaker 1: So, all that created a lot of division; and, as a result, instead of working together towards a prosperous city, everybody was very territorial.  Mayor [Coleman] Young who had come out of the union movement was a very defiant man toward the power structure, which he felt was racist and exploitive.  And, for the most part, I believe he was right.  His approach to it was straight-up defiance. And, he let them know that he wasn't having any of it in his own unique way.  You know, those that know about Coleman Young knows he had a very colorful language, meaning he cursed a lot.  And when he was talking to his opponents, if you will, or for a lack of a better term, or, his distracters [sic. detractors]--it was with that colorful language, very brash.  And, of course, that didn't sit well with the wealthy, corporate establishment.  "Who is this black man talking like this?  He needs my money to keep the city going." Then, of course, you had people who felt fearful; white folks felt fearful living among a growing population of blacks.  And, when the heroin returned from [the] Vietnam [War]; and, of course, they target our communities with it.  As a result, the crime all the social ills that go along with rampant drug use.  The news media made sure everybody knew about that every night, every crime that was committed, every piece of dope used.  The news media, they, made sure everybody knew about it.  It scared white folks out of the city.  So, when people started leaving the city because of fear, because of division, because they had a strong defiant mayor who fought back against racism and economic exploitation, all of that division caused the city, quite frankly, to lose its luster and caused economic hardship.  The major auto companies moved their headquarters outside the city; all the other corporate offices began to move outside the city.  And, so the employees who were now working outside the city, they began to move outside the city into the suburbs.  And, so what was once a vibrant city of two million people as of, say 1960--certainly, by the late '50s [1950s]; by 1980, it is, was barely a million people.  In twenty, thirty years, we lost half our population and most of our economic base.
Speaker 2: I hear that the Detroit [Michigan] suburbs are the richest--among the richest in the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, they've got all the auto barons out there and everybody.  Yep.  Yep.  So, that's what happened and that was the sense that I had while working in Detroit politics for the mayor and others.  And it was just very divisive.
Story_ID: 278387
Speaker 1: Were you tempted to run for office, yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, I was preparing for a political run but I was becoming more and more attractive [sic. attracted] to fight for social justice and civil rights because politics was coming across as so corrupt.  It's like a corrupt game.  You know, I had come from a game.  I had come from the street.
Speaker 1: Quite a few politicians, in Detroit [Michigan], were going to jail for one thing or another.
Speaker 2: I'm not here for this.  I'm here to fight for the people.  This is what I got in this for.  If I want to be hustler, I'll go back to the street.  I know how to hustle.  I'm not going to make this a hustle.  That's what I was seeing.  A lot of those involved in politics were really there to serve themselves first and the people second.  And, they were making a hustle out of it.
Speaker 1: When you finished law school [at University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] did you go right to a firm?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, after finishing law school, I had a three-year struggle to get my law license, even after passing the bar exam.  In the State of Michigan, the law is that even if you have a felony, whatever type of felony you might have on your record--it is at the discretion of the state bar and their ethics committee as to whether you'll be allowed to practice law.  Meaning, if you have a felony, they decide.  If the ethics committee says, "We think he is all right.  We think he is rehabilitated.  Let him have his license." Well, with me, they denied me, three times: the ethics committee, the appeals committee, and the final committee, after that.  The final committee did not give me word back in time; they stretched me out for about nine months.  So, I had my lawyer appeal to the state supreme court [Michigan Supreme Court], which was the final decision-maker on who would be lawyers and they granted me my license, but that was a three-year struggle.
Story_ID: 278388
Speaker 1: During that time, I was working in politics; by that time, I was working for Mayor [Coleman] Young. You should know that after the '88 [sic. 1984] campaign where Coleman Young supported the more traditional Democratic candidate, Walter Mondale, over [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson when we won the state--even at the hands of the most powerful black politician, at that time, in the country, Coleman Young, we beat him.  We beat his machine, with me at the helm.  Quite naturally--and, this is how politics work, within three or four months of us--after Jesse Jackson winning the primary there. He was, "Who was that young guy who ran Jesse's campaign?  Well, see if he wants to talk with me about running mine." When he ran, he was running a year later.
Speaker 2: Those are good points.  I didn't realize that Coleman Young actually supported Mondale.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Your organization actually carried the state for Jesse Jackson.
Speaker 1: Yes.  His machine included all the labor unions, very powerful in Michigan and all the traditional politicians.  All of them supported Coleman Young and whomever he said support.  And, so, it was just a few of us who jumped out there for Reverend Jackson, and we were able to win.
Speaker 2: So what position did you take?
Speaker 1: Citywide campaign coordinator, which was like the third or fourth in charge of Mayor Young's 1989 and his final campaign for mayor, and we won.  And, then, he appointed me as the director of the neighborhood city hall, which is the city hall that was located in the community doing some of the same things for the residents that they did downtown.
Speaker 2: Where was that at?  On the west side?
Speaker 1: On the east side.  Not too far, probably two miles away from where my dad [Charles Mathis] used to hustle.  His son was over there hustling now.  I was hustling to make sure that folks had their lights on; make sure folks were getting their garbage picked up; make sure folks were involved in their community; make sure their community was being redeveloped.  I headed up some redevelopment efforts of new housing: of the building of the last factory that has been built in Detroit [Michigan].  That was in '90 [1990] the final factory that was built.  Yeah, it has been sixteen years since 1990.  I was the liaison for Mayor Young.
Speaker 2: There's a Coleman [A.] Young [Community] Center [Detroit, Michigan] on the east side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's on the east side.
Speaker 2: Is that part of the redevelopment effort?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Some of the houses where Black Bottom used to be?
Speaker 1: Yep.  No, that was already there when I came.  It was farther down, further down in that same area, Jefferson [sic.].  All the way down further, toward the east side, is the area that I'm referring to.  There were brand new houses that were built in the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: I know there was quite a struggle over real estate in Detroit, of late.   I think [Mike] Ilitch who owns the [Detroit] Tigers and the--
Speaker 1: Tigers, Red Wings, Little Ceasers Pizzas, stadiums.
Speaker 2: There's been quite a struggle over land, over there, from what I understand.
Speaker 1: You know, once again, that's a very a--people have conflicting emotions about that.  On the one hand, you'd think that African Americans should share more in the economic revitalization and the prosperity of the city; but on the other hand, we don't have the economic wherewithal or the resources.  It takes hundred of millions of dollars in financing to pull these major developments off.  What Coleman Young did, he would press upon the corporate leaders to take-in minority partners and thereby empower and empower them, economically, so they could do more for their community.  A lot of times they resented him forcing minorities on to their economic developments.  Mike Ilitch was one that Coleman Young found to be a fair man and found a man who was willing to invest in Detroit when everybody else was running out.  And, so, that's kind of why Mike Ilitch and Little Caesars' empire was able to prosper with some of the land deals, and stadiums and a couple of things that they were able to access during Coleman Young's deals and since that time.
Speaker 2: So, you worked for Coleman Young up until his death or did you work after--?
Speaker 1: Up until his retirement; he passed a couple years after his retirement.
Speaker 2: So, what did you do next?
Speaker 1: Well, by that time, I was a lawyer.  Perhaps my second year into working for Mayor Young, I finally got my law license; and, by the third year, we kind of knew he wasn't going to run again.  So, things became a little flexible for us.  I kind of had my staff running the office, on autopilot, if you will.  So, I'd moonlight a little at night, as a lawyer, primarily drafting contracts, something that didn't require court appearances.  And then, also helping to run other peoples' campaigns for them during election time.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your youth organization.
Speaker 2: Well, my youth agency, Young Adults Asserting Themselves [Detroit, Michigan], was an outgrowth of my desire to go back to the hood and help, but as I told you my first experience at that, returning to the hood after my first year in college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] resulted in me in being pistol-whipped and robbed.  So I decided, well, it might not be a good idea to recruit people off the streets who are not ready to leave the streets.  So, instead I came up with the idea that I found a youth agency that assists young adults with placement in job training, college, community college and with employment opportunity. By kind of bringing the opportunity to them, getting them signed up.  Because one of the things you find in impoverished communities is a sense of hopelessness and despair where they don't even want to look.  They don't think it exists.  They don't even want to get out of the hood.  They don't think that there's a job training program that they can get into or that they can afford college.  As I told you, I didn't think I could or that they can be admitted into college.  So, this sense of hopelessness and you kind of sit back and wait for what's going to happen to you next or you go out and hustle the best way you can out on the street.  So, I felt that if I came up with an agency that brought the opportunity to the people, brought them together, that I could benefit my community; and indeed, that's what we have done for twenty years now.  We hold community development workshops whereby we advertise in the local community the opportunities for jobs, training programs, college.  People come to a central location whether it's the church or the recreation center.  We would go to different places around, or community college, go to the hood, have folks pass out fliers. They come on a Saturday. We have professionals talking about what they do in society.  We have workshops on how to instruct- instructing people on how they can interview for a job and become successful, how to succeed in job-training and college programs, et cetera.  We are able now to help thousands of young people.  We have an expo every year where we bring about fifty to sixty agencies together.  We, on an average, get about two thousand people that come to access that, as well.  We have a chain of pre-schools, non-profit, because we found that a lot of the parents needed help with the kids before they can go to work; so, we came up with that.  So, we have been very blessed to be a benefit to the community and that's been since 1986 and we are now in our twentieth year.
Speaker 1: It's still going on and still going strong?
Speaker 2: Yep.  So, that's another thing I have been involved in while running campaigns, going to law school, working full-time, and running a youth agency.
Story_ID: 278390
Speaker 1: Well tell us about running for judge.  When did you get the idea to run for judge?
Speaker 2: Well, when [Mayor] Coleman Young retired, of course, I sought to practice law and make a difference.  I could then do court appearances, because I no longer had to be to that nine-to-five; so, I continued to do some contract law and work as a political operative, managing campaigns for others.  And, then practicing criminal defense law primarily for young people because, of course, I wanted to help some of these young folks.  That was my passion: help these young folks.  I knew I was a young street kid and I knew what could happen if someone would reach out and bring these kids off the street. So, that's what I was about.  I worked in juvenile defense for a couple of years. And I saw how the system was just criminal in and of itself.  The justice system was criminal and--
Speaker 1: I don't know what it's like, in Detroit [Michigan], but you think that you're going to a [Chicago] Bulls game in Chicago [Illinois] when you go to juvenile court.  There's so many cars--people packing into the juvenile court.
Speaker 2: And the approach--and the approach to the criminal justice system is so, quite frankly, negligent in rehabilitating and even deferring crime in our community.  It is really just about locking them up, throwing away the key and making money off of them.  It's really the latest hustle.
Speaker 1: Prevention is not on the agenda or rehabilitation?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, not.  Certainly rehabilitation is not, as well.  You're hearing it from a judge.  Our criminal justice system is not interested in rehabilitating criminals.
Speaker 1: How much discretion does a judge have in these situations? I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, in recent years, as a result of these tough drug laws that have been passed, judges have less and less discretion because they have guidelines now.  They have sentencing guidelines where the state legislatures and federal government, as it relates to the federal criminal system, restrict how many years a judge can and cannot give as it relates to crimes that have been committed.  And, so, the whole justice system, in my opinion, is in need of major reform.  So, I want to make a difference.  So, as I was representing these young people and saw the judges didn't care if they were rehabilitated or not, wasn't giving out second chances that I had gotten.  I said, well maybe I better run for judge.  That allowed me to have a little input in this process and make a difference in my own little way.  So, that's why I ran for judge and lo and behold, when I ran for judge, the same obstacle that had caused me to lose three years' worth of law practice when they denied me my license, came back to revisit me when I ran for judge. The--my opponents dug up my background, gave it to the news media, and the news media came after me, talking about my criminal background, attacking me and trying to destroy my campaign. But people in Detroit knew me by then.  They knew I had worked for Coleman Young; they knew I had been associated and had worked closely with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson; they knew I had a young agency [Young Adults Asserting Themselves, Detroit, Michigan] and was committed to the community; they knew I wasn't just wasn't some guy coming out of law school with a silver spoon deciding he wanted to be a judge, looking down on the community who were struggling.  So, they didn't care what the media said.  In fact they said, I can remember a radio show I was on and folks were just calling in "Yeah, Judge [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis].  We don't care what the media said.  You're the type we need; you been there; you know what these young folks need; you know justice; you know what justice should be like in our community.  You're one of us." And lo and behold they did support me.  I became the youngest judge in Michigan history beating a twenty-year incumbent judge, fifteen years after leaving jail.  So that's something to be said about Detroiters.
Story_ID: 278391
Speaker 1: What year is this? This is--?
Speaker 2: This is 1994.
Speaker 1: You were elected to the position of?
Speaker 2: 36th District Court.  It's a state district court.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what kind of cases did you--?
Speaker 2: Criminal, small claims, landlord/tenant and civil claims under twenty-five thousand [dollars].
Speaker 1: Very similar to the cases you try now.
Speaker 2: Small claims, but the civil and the criminal of course are a little different.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy serving--as judge--?  Was it what you expected?
Speaker 2: It was a mixed--it was a mixed experience.  On the one hand, I had a lot of obstacles again.  I had a lot of my colleagues there.  We had thirty judges, I believe it was, thirty-three, and many of them were resentful that I had defeated their colleague, an incumbent.  There is an unspoken rule that you don't run against incumbent judges.  If you do, they kind of alienate you--the other judges, if you win; and, that's what happened to me.  The other judges alienated me and I was such a community activist and I was kind of, if you will, showing them up, because they were playing golf every day after two P.M. and I was still down there at five, six P.M. coordinating programs for youth and working to uplift the community.  I had a radio show that came on once a week, a community-oriented radio show, and, oh they were saying I had [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson coming to town still putting things together with him.  I initiated a--through my youth agency [Young Adults Asserting Themselves, Detroit, Michigan] and through the court or, at least me, and a couple of other judges that participated--a church-based mentorship program where we referred first time, non-violent offenders between seventeen and twenty-four years old to churches that had recruited mentors from inside to try and steer these young people in the right direction.  So, we did all--I was doing all of that and I guess they felt I was showing them up, because they just wanted to come in at 9:30 and leave at two, and go play golf.  You know judges--a lot of them are at the end of their careers; so, they were trying to not work hard.  Well, I was just beginning my career and I really wanted to make a difference quickly-so that caused a lot of resentment.  I can recall the chief judge wrote me up to the [Michigan] Judicial Tenure Commission saying that I should not be on the radio while--during work hours.  I was taking my lunch hour, once a week, to do the radio show.  That didn't go anywhere.  The Judicial Tenure Commission didn't act on it.  Then I was just hearing in the street about how my colleagues were taking about me behind my back: "He didn't even practice law long enough."  So, that, was a little disheartening.
Speaker 1: Now these are black judges, mostly?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Detroit [Michigan]. These are mostly black judges.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, 90 percent.
Speaker 1: Older guys?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, sir.  That was disheartening.  On the other hand, the community really appreciated my outreach; and, I appreciated and was very fulfilled at being able to make a difference.  And so, those--that was very fulfilling for me.  I was there for five years and those five years were very fulfilling, because I really feel I--felt I made a difference.
Story_ID: 278392
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a story or case where you think that you made a really big difference [as a judge on the 36th District Court]?  Of course, you can't give us the names and that sort of thing but can you relate a story that stands out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  A young man who came before me, he had dropped out of school, and was before me for selling marijuana, I believe.  I kind of saw myself in him; so, I sentenced him to get a GED [General Educational Development] and either go to a community college, university, or skilled trades program.  Well, after my sentence, I didn't follow up.  You know I'm rarely able to follow up unless they come back to me.  So, about two years later, maybe three, he came back to me and not only had he gotten his GED, he had gotten skilled trades as a construction worker. He had went through my youth agency [Young Adults Asserting Themselves, Detroit, Michigan] to get the skilled trade and then he had his own construction company.  Three years after I had sentenced him, a home improvement company, three years after I had sentenced him to get his GED and a skilled trade or college education.  So, that was probably one of the most fulfilling moments.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a success story.  So did (unclear).
Speaker 2: And then more so than that I really got a lot of fulfillment out of helping my buddies.  Guys who I had grown-up with, who had went to prison, who had become drug addicts they would come to me regularly and say, "Man, I need some help." And I was able to help them and I could just watch them grow.  Watch them grow from the time they left prison all the way up the career ladder.  My best friend, for example, who had been in prison four years, had a ten-year crack [crack cocaine] habit.  When he came to me he said, "Man, I need your help."  I immediately assisted him.  He went voluntarily to drug-rehabilitation, started on Narcotics Anonymous meetings, three times a day.  I placed him with a position as a volunteer, first, with my youth agency, then as a part-time worker, then as a full-time worker, then I pulled him over into politics to help me coordinate my campaigns because he had that grass-root ability to organize people and he was successful there.  He obtained a job with a council person and became one of the top staff people down at [Detroit] City Council.  About ten years, his trial took about ten years, from drug-addiction to high-ranking council staff member.  So, I have a lot of those type of stories that give me a lot of fulfillment, helping the people that I know and that I grew up with.
Story_ID: 278393
Speaker 1: Did you ever want just want to throw the book at somebody because you were so disgusted?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  Of course.  Of course. But you know, my-- one of the things I learned, not only from my experience on the street, but as a judge--from both sides of the bench if you will, I really don't believe that anyone is beyond redemption or rehabilitation.  I believe that everyone can be rehabilitated, unless there is a psychological disorder, chemical imbalance, or otherwise: Bipolar disorder, I see a lot of that.  In fact I'm working with  Dr. Satcher, [HistoryMaker] Dr. David Satcher, a former [U.S.] surgeon general who now is president of Morehouse medical school [Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia].  We are working together and doing panel discussions around the country on the fact that one-third of the prison population have mental illnesses. Whether it is attention deficit, defiance--.  There is a defiance disorder; there is Bipolarism; there is schizophrenia.  There's many things that have never been addressed, neither in counseling or medication; so it comes out in criminal-behavior.  And, so that's why I say unless they are inflicted with a mental-disorder, I believe everyone has the capacity for rehabilitation and for redemption.  So, even though I would want to throw the book, you know I say there is something definitely wrong with this person.  You know when you cut somebody's bodies up, you know, because they smoke too much of their share of the crack [crack cocaine], something is wrong with you.  And that was a specific case I had, within six months of serving on the bench [of the 36th District Court], I had a guy come before me for murder for a preliminary exam to determine whether we were going to bind him over for trial, whether there was enough evidence.  That's what preliminary exams do, to determine if there is enough evidence to bind him over for a full-blown trial.  So, he admittedly cut the woman's head, her legs, and her arms.  Heinous! I had heard and seen everything, so I thought this guy is acting a little strange and I said "Why'd you do it?"  He said "She smoked too much of her share of the crack."  So, it then came out that his defense attorney tried to argue insanity because indeed the man was on medication and he was smoking crack while on psychotic medication.  So, even though he was functional in society with his medication, he was mixing that with crack, and he went to a whole new level of destruction, if you will.  So, that's my belief that redemption and rehabilitation is within anybody's grasp unless they have a psychological disorder.
Story_ID: 278394
Speaker 1: Communities are often whipped-up I think sometimes by political forces to call for drastic penalties or more strident levels of punishment, you know, because of emotional crimes that occur in the community like, in Chicago [Illinois], here, one of the community policing activists was shot down in his neighborhood.  Busloads went to Springfield [Illinois] to call for a higher penalty for shooting a policing activist.  I don't know what could be higher than shooting me or you. But where you faced with that kind of stuff, in Detroit [Michigan]? That kind of activism and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My observation is since the '70s [1970s], there's been this law and order approach to crime and to the challenges in our community.  And, that is to lock them up, throw away the key, tough on crime.  Everybody wants to get elected, that's what they come out with tough on crime, tough on crime. Tough on crime, but they're soft on education, because they're not fighting for that. Tough on crime, but soft on drug rehabilitation. Tough on crime, but soft on crime-convention [sic. prevention] monies. Tough on crime, but soft on job training opportunities.  So, this tough on crime approach that has been used primarily to play on the emotions and the fears of people, that's what this is about.  The politicians wanting to get elected.  So if you want to get elected to prosecutor, or the judge, or the state representative, or the congressman, or the city councilman or the mayor. "I'm coming down on criminals. I'm coming down--."  All right, what are you going to do with them when you get them?  When you catch them, then what?  Because what they've done is they have increased more in investment in incarcerating our young people, than in educating our young people.  They are not rehabilitating them, their education systems are failing them throughout the country.  Over half of inner-city youth drop out of school in the inner-cities.  Why?  Because they recognize that they are receiving a substandard education and it isn't working for them.  All around the country, every city--every inner-city school district, in America, the curriculum is sub-standard; the teachers are less-trained, and the schools are less funded.  So, they recognize the contradiction.  We think that these street kids are dumb.  No, they're smart.  They know that no one is really investing in them so they get out and hustle for themselves.  And as a result, they marginalize their educational experience and say this isn't doing me any good.  I'm not going to be able to compete against those privileged youth who are getting all of the money at their schools, who get the best teachers, who get the books and the curriculum, and this and that.  How can I compete with that?  I'd better do what I can in the streets.  So, my point is, we're investing more in incarcerating than educating our youth and education is the number one way to compete in mainstream society, as a productive citizen.  So, we are failing them and they have no place to go, but to the criminal justice system; and, the criminal justice system is not rehabilitating them.  We are really gone, heading down a dark road that we will never recover from unless we turn on our headlights and are able to see the real direction we need to go in because not only are we not rehabilitating them, we are putting them in prisons and they are coming back stronger and more criminally-sophisticated than they were when they went in when they are not being rehabilitated.  They have no job training skills because they are eliminating funding for job training when in past years people could go to prison and get a college degree.  All that's gone.  You can barely get a GED [General Educational Development].  Many states have cut funding for GEDs.  So they come back home, no skills, sicker and slicker than they were, and then prey on us again.  And, we send them back.  Each year, we are paying fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to house them in prison.  That's an entire four-year degree. An entire four-year degree.
Story_ID: 278395
Speaker 1: Let me break it down to you a little more because I am really passionate about this.  I'm gonna bring it home.  In 1977, I told you, I was in jail, seven months.  I was told it cost thirty-five thousand dollars to house me in jail, taxpayer money, right?  Well, one year later, I got my GED [General Educational Development] and went to college, didn't have any parents to finance my education.  I had to rely on tax-dollars again, right? Well, it only cost six thousand dollars for me to attend Eastern Michigan University [Ypsilanti, Michigan] for that year. Thirty thousand dollars for seven months in [Old] Wayne County Jail [Detroit, Michigan]. Six thousand dollars to educate me in college.  Indeed, my entire four year degree in Eastern Michigan University cost less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Less than seven months in the county jail.  I got a four-year degree for less than it cost to house me in Wayne County Jail.  Taxpayers paid for both.  I think it is more tax-efficient to have educated me that to contain and incarcerate me.  Not only am I not victimizing folks on the street anymore, but I am a pretty significant taxpayer now, myself, helping to relieve the tax burdens of others.  And so it's not even cost-efficient, this approach to law and order to lock them up and throw away the key--don't get me wrong, yes if they are causing havoc in the community and victimizing people get them off the street, yes, get them off the street.  But what do you do when you get them off the street?  Do you provide counseling?  Do you provide and diagnose mental illness and therefore medicate them?  Do you then give them a skilled trade?  Do you made sure before you release them that they have a skilled trade and they have a education of some sort because it makes no sense to release them back into society the same way or worse than they went in.  So, that's my concern with this criminal justice law and order campaigns that we've seen since the '70s [1970s].  It hasn't worked.  And, no, I don't care how many new laws you place on the books to deter crime, criminals don't think they are going to get caught.  (Laughter)  They're not thinking about the crime--about the criminal punishment, and the statutes that say, okay we're going increase the sentencing.  We've had the highest sentencing guidelines in the history of mankind since these drug laws have been implemented. One kilo of cocaine, life with no parole.  Well, what was the result?  They said life with no possibility of parole if you are caught with 360 grams of cocaine.  You know what happened?  That came about in the mid-'80s [1980s], we had an all-time high and incarceration of lifers caught with 360 grams of cocaine.  No one thinks they are going to get caught.
Speaker 2: What you're saying is what criminal justice experts have said for years: the severity of punishment does not deter crime, right?
Speaker 1: No correlation.
Story_ID: 278396
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about--how long did you serve on the bench [of the 36th District Court]?
Speaker 2: Five years in Detroit [Michigan], I served on the bench.
Speaker 1: Where did that idea for television-- where does that enter the discussion?
Speaker 2: Well, quite frankly, it started not as a television-opportunity, but a movie-opportunity.  When I was running for judge it became a closely watched campaign, because the media, in Detroit, were attacking me, and so when the campaign day came, when election day came, I was one of the stories they were watching.  "Is the former mayoral-assistant, is the former assistant to Mayor [Coleman] Young who we now know was a street thug, is he gonna win his judicial election or not?  We know him; we knew he ran [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson's campaign; we knew he worked for Mayor Young, but now we've found out that he had a criminal background and he's running for judge.  Stay tuned." (Laughter)  And, so, of course when the results came and I won, it became a major success story, not only in Detroit, but it was picked up by a couple of national news outlets.  BET did a story on me.  I think USA Toda' or CNN.  So, as a result, I began getting calls.
Speaker 1: Your media profile rose significantly.
Speaker 2: Correct. I had some Hollywood producers called me.  We want to do a movie on you.  We read or heard about this--what you've done, this something we would really like to do a movie about. And I'm like, "All right."  And, so over the course of about two years they were trying to develop a script and all of that, and working back and forth. So, about '97 [1997] or '98 [1998], they began shopping it.  They began shopping this movie-script trying to get a movie.  So, what was to be a movie began a television show because they were shopping this movie to Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.] and Warner Brothers said, "I don't know about a movie, but would this guy do a judge show?"  "Oh yeah, fine."  So, that's what happened.  What was meant to be a movie turned into the Judge Mathis show ['Judge Mathis'].
Speaker 1: I think you were the first, weren't you the first show after '[The] People's Court'?  Now, 'People's Court' was already on--
Speaker 2: No!  'Judge Judy' came on.
Speaker 1: 'Judge Judy' came on first.
Speaker 2: Then myself and [Judge] Mablean [Ephriam], 'Divorce Court' came out at the same time.  I think '[Judge] Joe Brown' was one year before us [sic.].  'People's Court' was always on.  Yes, and then 'Judy' and then 'Joe Brown'-
Speaker 1: It seems like your show was most--was yours the highest ranking?
Speaker 2: No, 'Judge Judy' is.
Speaker 1: 'Judy' is?
Speaker 2: Mine's very popular, but Judge Judy [Sheindlin] is in a category of her own.  She was the first to revive the genre; and secondly, you know, she's--the majority of the viewers are kind of older.  And she is the older, grandmotherly type and she's good!  I'm not taking nothing from her.
Story_ID: 278397
Speaker 1: Tell us about the show ['Judge Mathis'] now, how did--I mean, did you have any trepidations about the show, at all?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  Well, what was happening at that time is I was still working very closely with [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson.   Indeed, he had asked me to retire from the bench [of the 36th District Court], about my fourth year, to work with him and suggesting that perhaps, one day, I might succeed him, because he was considering running for president [of the United States].  And, he said he didn't want the organization to fall through the cracks while he was running his campaign, so he wanted me to keep the organization stable.  So, I began commuting from Detroit [Michigan] to Chicago [Illinois], Friday when I got off the bench and stay all throughout the weekend, be at [Operation] PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] every Saturday, working with him.  I would take all my vacation days, which was pretty liberal as a judge.  You get a lot of vacation time and sick days and the like.  I used it all, to work with him. And, one Saturday, I was at PUSH and I didn't know how to tell him I had this television offer and I said, "Reverend Jackson, they want--they want to give us some money for our story."  (Laughter) That's how I put it to him.  He said, "What are you talking about?"  "They want to do a television show and I've told them--." I did tell the studio [Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.] that one of the conditions, of which, I would require is that they show my story, at the beginning of the show, because my objective would--doing a movie or anything else--was to inspire other people--parents who were dealing with troubled youth and troubled youth themselves--letting them know they could come out those streets, as I did.  And since a judge show wouldn't necessarily do that, I said, "Well, you must put that at the prelude of my show, when it comes on--I want that introduction to be a part of it--showing where I came from." And, they agreed to do that.  So, when I let Reverend Jackson know that I was going to be part of the show and it would be inspiration, then I kind of showed him the offer, he looked at it. "Oh, yeah.  You got to do this for your family.  You can tithe with us.  You can help Rainbow PUSH."  And so, that was the case.  So, I had no real trepidation because I thought it would take my message to millions of people, not just the folks who came before me, in the Detroit courtroom.  And, so, I thought I would be able to make a bigger difference and stuck with Rainbow PUSH and now vice president and chairman of PUSH Excel and still working closely with Reverend Jackson and making a difference.
Story_ID: 278398
Speaker 1: How does this show ['Judge Mathis'] work? I mean, do people--do the producers find people who have cases of import-
Speaker 2: What we have--we have stringers in every region of the country and they go to courtrooms throughout the country and look up small claim cases that have already been filed.  And, those that look interesting, they call the people and ask if they want to remove it from their local court and bring it to our court, as an act of arbitration.  We are really arbitrators, bound by the Federal Arbitration Act.  And they must agree to abide by our decisions; that's how arbitration works.  So, we hear the case, once we come with our decision, they are bound by it.  And, some people call them. We vet the proc- we take it through a vetting process to make sure it's a legitimate case then we bring it on.
Speaker 1: I wondered about that--if people might not come up with a phony case that's sensational to try to get on the show--
Speaker 2: You know that's the most frequent question I get. Is, "Are these cases real?"  It is almost condescending sometimes when folks ask: "Are these crazy people?  Where do you get these crazy people from?  Are they real?" "Yeah, they're real."  "Where do you get them from?"  "I get them from your neighborhood.  I get them from your family."  Everyone that asks me that question, they have a family member that acts the fool like the people they see on my television show.  They have a neighbor, somebody in their neighborhood.  I don't care what social status, economic status, race, creed or color.  Everyone knows someone, like the people who come on my show.
Speaker 1: I think it's--I'd be inclined to--if people really--yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I can see what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The, what have been--so, they are obligated to abide by the decision that the court renders.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Suppose the case--a judgment is leveled against me and I don't want to pay.  Well, what happens?
Speaker 2: You are held in contempt, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
Speaker 1: So, I committed a federal crime if I don't pay?  Is that what it is?
Speaker 2: No, the Federal Arbitration Act allows for you to be then returned to your local court of jurisdiction, for the same case.
Speaker 1: I see. Okay. So, if you return to your local court, is--
Speaker 2: It's like this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).  The case is retried.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It's like this, if you are on probation or parole, and/or if you receive a suspended sentence, which is: okay, you did it, you admitted to doing it, we are going to suspend the sentence as a plea bargain, if you will, and see how you do for a year.  If you have no more convictions or encounters, with the law, within a year, then we'll dismiss this.  And, it will never be on your record; however, if you have another conviction, then we are able to then prosecute you for the original charge that we've suspended.  So, it is very similar to that.  We've allowed you to enter into arbitration.  Now, if you violate your arbitration, you can be sent back to your regular court of jurisdiction for the claim to be pursued.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  So, that compels--that makes it more real.  That makes it real.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

Speaker 1: Well, what have been--so many of these shows, every week there's something that's interesting.  What's been--is there one or two cases that are more--
Speaker 2: Yeah, believe it or not, it wouldn't be some of the more outrageous stuff that you see [on 'Judge Mathis'].  Folks often think that is what would be most impressionable to me, and it's not it is really matters of the heart that stand out with me the most.  For example, probably the most outstanding case, in my mind, was the young man who was suing his parents.  He was in his third year of college--I think maybe a senior in college, and he was suing his parents because they had a light bill in his name and they had failed to pay the light bill.  So, it's like: "I'm suing them.  They didn't pay this light bill and it's about to ruin my credit."  Hundred dollars or whatever it was. And he was in the right.  He had the right to sue and he was about to win his judgment and I asked the parents there's nothing I can do, but: "Why didn't you all pay this bill?  Why did you have to put it in his name?"  "Well, Your Honor, we had to put it in his name because our credit is ruined." "Why didn't you pay?"  "We can't afford it.  Your Honor, we in bad shape, financially, it's because all of his life, from K [kindergarten] through twelve, we sent him to a private school, paid for that.  And, we've paid for all his college.  That's why we can't pay this light bill. That's why we have bad credit." So, it was just amazing to me, that a young man would sue his parents for being in financial straits--when the reason they're in financial straits is because they provided him with a privileged education, that will forever allow him to be a successful, productive and prosperous citizen.  So, those are the type of cases that touch me.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a primer on how not to spoil a child or something--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And, it sounds like a issue of character, an issue of character.  That stands out the most, that case, in particular.  It must have four or five years ago, but that it still stands out.  Perhaps because I didn't have any parents to support, me, and perhaps because of the sacrifice my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] made sending me to church-school spending more on my church-school tuition than she did on our rent.  Maybe that weighs in, as well.
Speaker 1: You said there was another one?  Was there another one?
Speaker 2: Well, there were so many that resemble this scenario I'm going to give you, and that being a child or a parent suing a child for some destructive activity that the child may have caused the parent--maybe something in the household the child did or the child is a wayward child.  And, then it comes out that the parent was drug-addicted all of the child's formative years. And it's like: "Don't you see the connection?  You were negligent and perhaps abusive toward the child during your fifteen-year drug addiction, and then you are shocked that the child is living a destructive life.  You were negligent in raising the child; you caused some of these problems; you lived in poverty; you were negligent toward raising the child; you left the child in the crime and drug-infested household while you were off doing your thing and now you wonder?"

Speaker 1: What is your sense of the impact of your show on the community?
Speaker 2: Well, perhaps, the most fulfilling part of what I do is not so much on the television and being on the benches, when I am out in the community and speaking I'm on the lecture circuit regularly speaking to young people, speaking to adults, et cetera--giving inspirational lectures and addressing social issues of our time and trying to give some leadership in that area.  And, so when I'm out, I often am approached by young people and parents alike saying, "You've changed my life." Saying, "Your story and what you represent and what I've heard and read about you has giving me hope.  I went back to school.  I used to be in jail, now I'm going to school.  My son or daughter, I gave up on them.  I didn't think they could do it, but now I believe they can do it because of what you've have done.  And, now I tell them to read your book ['Inner City Miracle,' Judge Greg Mathis and Blair S. Walker]; I tell them to watch you; I tell them that you made it and they can make it." And that's the most fulfilling part of what I do.
Speaker 1: Do you think there is a crisis in the wisdom that's passed down, I guess, to people these days.  That the judge shows are so popular that people want to see a problem arbitrated by someone impartial person.  You know, there, do you think--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I really believe that one of the main reasons judge shows are so popular is because of the '[The] Jerry Springer [Show]'-type shows for lack of a better reference.  And, that is, for years we saw on these talk shows of people leading such destructive lives and not being held accountable for them.  They come on there and just flaunt their lives, not just 'Jerry Springer', but '[The] Ricki Lake [Show]' and all the other shows and Maury Povich they come on there and talk about, "Yeah, I got her pregnant and I ain't taking care of nobody.  Yeah, I jumped on her.  And, yeah, she's no good; and, yeah, he's no good." The show just goes off and you never see anyone held accountable for their destructive lifestyles.  Well, with the judge show, you see folks being held accountable for those destructive lifestyles and you see, yes, as you said a judge passing on some wisdom and passing on some justice.  And so, I believe that is one of the reasons they are so popular.  People want to see folks held accountable for their actions.  And, I think that does make a difference when folks watch and they know there is accountability out there and they see accountability occurring and justice, in action, and that causes interest in the judge shows, in my opinion.

Speaker 1: I know that I've asked you a lot about the community already and you've talked a lot about it--but we always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my primary concern is the plight of black men, because one of the biggest problems, or challenges, in our community is single family households.  Single family households, in many instances, lock families in poverty.  Poverty breeds hopelessness, despair, drug and crime, and alcohol addiction and abuse. And, as a result, parents are unable to properly raise their children in poverty, and drug and crime-infested neighborhoods.  So, it becomes a vicious cycle; and, as a result the young male who is born and raised by a single mother never really learns true manhood.  He learns this twisted.  You know, a mother does her best, but she can't teach true manhood.  They need a man to direct them to what true manhood is about.  It is about respecting women, not calling them Bs and hoes.  It is about taking responsibility for your own life and fighting back against obstacles that might destroy you, not giving in to those obstacles--not punking out, as I call it.  You know if you believe injustice and racism is holding you back, then fight back against it, don't fight back against it by robbing your neighborhood and selling dope to your community and giving up and standing on the corner.  Fight back against racism. Join the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], join Rainbow PUSH [Coalition], Nation of Islam.  There are a lot of folks fighting back.  So, join that war--not the war to kill your community.  So, that's how I challenge the brothers, as well.  And, so, if we had men teaching our young men that--instead teaching them how to abandon their families when the going gets tough because there is no job opportunity, because of failed education system and because there is guns and drugs in your community.  Yeah, that's a reality, but you don't embrace that; you fight against it.  You know there's a belief in some parts of our community there's a conspiracy.  They said, "They removed the jobs from our community and they replaced it with guns and drugs for us to kill ourselves with.  They give us this substandard education; they know we can't compete. So, all we have is the streets.  So we going to drop off into this subculture and destroy ourselves in effort to sustain ourselves." You're really destroying yourself. You say, "I'm just doing what I got to do." You're destroying yourself, and then they say, "Well, it was a trap, it was a conspiracy."  Well you know it's a conspiracy, then why in the devil are you stepping into the trap?  You know if it is a conspiracy the answer is the same.  If it's not a conspiracy--if it is a conspiracy or if it is not a conspiracy, the answer is the same: fight back against the destructive forces. Resist the drugs and crime, resist self-destruction.  Same answer.  "It's a conspiracy, Judge.  What do we do?" You fight back; you resist. "It's not a conspiracy, Judge.  It's just men don't want to do what they're supposed to do."  That's what conservatives will tell you. "There's opportunity--pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  That's what you need to do.  Judge, what do you say they need to do when these black men don't want to work--they don't want to get an education?" What they should do is empower themselves: in an education; resist crime; resist drug addiction.  That's what they must do.  "What do you do when there is a conspiracy, Judge?  There is a conspiracy, Judge.  What do we do out here?" Empower yourself with an education; you resist drugs, self-destructive behavior, and criminal-activity.  It's the same answer.  So, that's what I see as the challenge and the solution.  The challenge is strengthening the black male so that he can be a true father.  He can be a true leader in his community and, secondly, resist the temptations of self-destruction.

Speaker 1: In your active life, so far, is there any one thing that you wish you would have done differently today? You know, when you look back on it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely.  I wish I hadn't contributed to the destruction of my community and the hurt to my mother [Alice Lee Mathis] and the victimization of people.  All those things I regret.
Story_ID: 278403
Speaker 1: What today would you say, even though you're still young, what would you say today is your legacy?
Speaker 2: As one who provided hope and opportunity to those who come from impoverished, and crime and drug-infested communities.  I think I give them hope that they can fight their way out, I think I give them a road map, in fighting their way out, and to a limited extent, direct opportunity through the agencies and organizations that I've been affiliated with.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I have four children: two girls who are the oldest and two sons--and a wife [Linda Mathis], of course.
Speaker 1: Same one? That's quite an accomplishment
Speaker 2: Yes, same one that I met in college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] that met me when I was flipping Three-card Monte. We, as you know, married in '85 [1985] and have been married ever since.
Story_ID: 278405
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you would like to talk about before I ask my last question?  Anything I haven't mentioned or something we need to say before--
Speaker 2: Well, one of my challenges still to this day is how do I balance where I came from and where I'm at; particularly, as it relates to my associations.  People are often surprised because I maintain associations with people who are down-trodden, drug-addicted, involved in criminal behavior, et cetera, et cetera.  "Judge, why you associate--why you going back to So-and-So's house?  So-and-So's son sells crack [crack cocaine] in front of their house. So-and-So and So-and-So--."  Well, what do you want me to do?  Ninety percent of all my life-long relationships, those relationships prior to my college years and graduation from college [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan], 90 percent of them live in drug and crime-infested neighborhoods and they are part of that life.  So, what am I going to?  Turn my back?  Not go back--not go back and visit my aunt whose grandson sells, yes, crack outside the house.  Not go and bring gifts and opportunity and help to the children on the block who are yet to be corrupted? Not show them a good example?  And, when I'm there, the guys that grew up with me who are drug-addicted and involved in criminal behavior, not speak to them at all?  I might inspire one of them.  I might inspire them as I have, so many others, when I go back.  Every now and then, one of them will say, "Judge, I need help, man. I'm ready to stop."  "Okay, I got some help for you--if you are really ready." So, that's the kind of the balancing act that is really challenging for me, because some might suggest that, you know, I'm risking my safety--I'm risking my career.  And, who knows what else lies behind that door that I'm walking through, every now and then.
Speaker 1: I see how that could be a concern--people were raised.  Like professional athletes, I imagine that people come to you and claim to have associations with you that may not have any history with you but are needy in some way.
Speaker 2: Yeah and not only because of their needs, but because of the risk they pose in me associating with them.  I could be, like I just said over to my aunt's house, her grandson's got the stash upstairs; police come kick in the door. Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis] sitting up there with this half a kilo upstairs.  I wouldn't knowingly go there, but I'm not going to refuse to visit her because it's a drug and crime-ridden community.  Anytime you go into a drug and crime-ridden community there are a lot of risks associated with that, but I'm willing to take that risk because I want to make a difference in that community.
Story_ID: 278406
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who fought for social justice, on behalf of the people who were like him and were the people who were marginalized by society--by mainstream society, which is the community in which I come from.  I want to be known for fighting for social justice on their behalf.
