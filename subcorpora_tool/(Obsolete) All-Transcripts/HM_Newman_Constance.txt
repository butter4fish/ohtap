Story_ID: 11334
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother starting with your mother's name and where your mother was born and where your mother grew up as a girl?
Speaker 2: Ernestine Segars Berry was her name.  She was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She's no longer living.  She died in the 1980s. She was both a social worker and a nurse and was educated in Minnesota and in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: You were talking about your mother and you said she was both a nurse and a social worker?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right, and she worked in Chicago and then in Tuskegee [Alabama] and in Minnesota.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl growing up in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: She had--she was an only child and she had many aunts and cousins and it--a father [Noah Segars] who was an artist.  And it sounded as if she had a wonderful life even though she was an only child.  I think it resulted in her reading.  She read maybe a book a day.  She--so I think the fact that she was an only child there led to her finding ways to make her life interesting.
Speaker 1: And how was it, did she ever talk about how it was that the family came to Minnesota?
Speaker 2: No.  The--her, her father and mother were both second generation from Minnesota. So, but I don't know the, I don't know the details.  We keep saying we're going to spend some time and we never do.
Speaker 1: We all say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Very smart, caring, very logical without arrogance which she could have had given the situation that she was in, but she wasn't and insisted that we not be, very respectful of all people.  She volunteered a great deal.  She ran the Red Cross in Tuskegee so it's--you know both, both parents spent a lot of time and effort in community service and they taught us all the importance of that.
Story_ID: 11335
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit now about your father.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Once again starting with his name and where he was born and where he grew up as a child?
Speaker 2: Joseph Alonzo Berry [Sr.] and he was born in Charleston, South Carolina.  He went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and then to the University of Chicago Medical School [Chicago, Illinois].  It was Rush [Medical College] at the time.  And he became a surgeon and practiced in Chicago and then moved to Tuskegee, Alabama during the war to practice at the Veteran's Hospital there.
Speaker 1: And did he ever share any stories with you about what his childhood was like?
Speaker 2: Well his, his father--he had two sisters but his father [Joseph C. Berry] was the superintendent of schools in Charleston, South Carolina I mean so he came out of a very educated family.  His father understood and read Latin and Greek and passed that on, that interest in education on to my father.  And I think education, studying and service again became a part of his, of his life.  And so the stories from him about his father had to do with the way in which he was able to be the superintendent of schools in a segregated community and his grace and poise and ability to be successful no matter what environment he was operating in.
Speaker 1: And how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: My father was in--practicing at Provident Hospital in Chicago [Illinois] and my mother [Ernestine Segars Berry] was a nurse there and they met then.
Speaker 1: And why is it that your father wanted to go and work at, with the veterans in Tuskegee (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Well, it was his way of service during the war so the, the question was you know would his service be abroad or--and since he was a surgeon there was great call for surgeons in Veterans Administration and so that's how he happened to go to Tuskegee [Alabama] because Tuskegee had one of the few veterans hospitals for African Americans at, at the time.
Speaker 1: And how old, do you remember how old you were when the family moved to Alabama?
Speaker 2: Seven, I was seven.
Speaker 1: And what was the move like?  I'm sure it had to be somewhat of a transition to move from a, you know, urban environment.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, because we first, we didn't have a house in Tuskegee and we first moved to Auburn [Alabama] which is really rural.  And in Auburn I think we were there almost a year, little less than a year.  My mother taught us--there were two--I have a sister two years younger.  And it was quite different.  It was also segregated which we weren't accustomed to.  And we were and we were not shielded from that.  My father became the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there and also eventually went on the Board of the NAACP.  He took me to almost all of the NAACP meetings so we were brought to understand what segregation meant early and what we needed to do to bring about the change.
Story_ID: 11336
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: I, I have--my brother [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Jr.] started working on it.  My brother now just recently died.  He started working on it and I was talking to his daughter the other day and she's saying we need to pick that up.  But I, this isn't something I did.  I haven't done it.
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents.  Did you spend time with your grandparents and did you know them well?
Speaker 2: I, I did not know my mother's [Ernestine Segars Berry] mother because she died when I was very young.  I spent a great deal of time with my mother's father.  We would go up to Minnesota every summer and spend time with him.  He was just wonderful and he was--he carved, he sculptured and he carved wood.  When I said he was an artist, that's what he did.  I have in my bedroom now one of, one of his lamps that just reminds me of his--the beauty of his work.  I spent time with my father's [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr.] father--.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, could you tell us your maternal grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Noah Segars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my father's father remarried so I knew the stepmother.  I, I never met his mother.  But we would spend time visiting them in Charleston [South Carolina].  They would come visit us.  And so I got to know, I got to know both grandfathers and my step grandmother.
Speaker 1: And your paternal grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh that's right.  Joseph Berry.  Joseph C. Berry.
Story_ID: 11337
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what the summers were like in Minnesota and was it a big contrast from your life in Alabama and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well part of the reason we went every summer was to go to summer school.  So almost--I actually can't remember a summer that we didn't spend most of the time in school.  So the parents [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr. and Ernestine Segars Berry], our parents wanted us to cover any deficiencies which weren't that great because we were in Tuskegee [Alabama] and you had the high school even though the high school was a public high school you had the benefit of Tuskegee Institute [now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] there.  But we took courses in areas where maybe we weren't doing as well or they felt we needed to, to do more.  So the summers and the winters weren't all that different in terms of what we did during the week.  We would you know go to the symphony.  We'd go to museums so there wasn't a lot of play.  It was--but it was not all work either.  But the, the play was defined.
Speaker 1: And did you still have a lot of cousins there?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Not really so I didn't have, I didn't have relatives except aunts and my grandfather that we dealt with.  I didn't, I, I actually don't even remember spending time with young people except in, in school.
Speaker 1: And did you notice any difference in the schools in Minnesota and in Alabama at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  I, if you're saying did I at that time notice it?
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And, not really.  The difference was in Tuskegee they were all African Americans or in Minnesota except for my sister and myself they were almost all white.  I, I don't remember other African Americans in--I noticed that.  But it's interesting I guess I didn't pay that much attention to it.
Speaker 1: And tell us what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember great, my mother and father would go out of their way to do a lot of special things for us so I can, I can remember nice, interesting birthday parties in Chicago [Illinois].  I can remember the circus.  I think they--the circus walked down the street past my house and I'm not positive of that but I think I remember that.  I remember going to  [Julius] Rosenwald Nursery School and much of what I remember is, is tied to education, much of it.
Story_ID: 11338
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: My sister who is two years younger is Barbara Joanne Deveau (ph.) or it's Barbara Joanne Berry Deveau, she's two years younger.  My brother was Joseph A. [Alonzo] Berry, Jr., and he was ten years younger.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of give us an idea of what daily life was like in your house?  What was it like growing up in the younger years in Chicago [Illinois]?  You'd wake up in the morning and then what would happen next?
Speaker 2: Go to, get dressed and go to school, come home, do whatever.  Even, even then I can remember some sort of studying or homework or work during the week and that was all throughout my life.  We didn't go out to play during the week.  We would come home, do homework, have the family dinner, do the rest of the homework, go to bed.  We could go out on Friday nights and do something.  We could go out Saturday nights.  During the day on Saturday it was probably piano lessons or dancing lessons.  So the day was you know getting up, family breakfast, going to school, coming home, homework or studying or something or piano practice, having dinner with the whole family.  Or usually my father [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr.] would talk about public affairs or he'd talk a little bit about his work, not that much.  Or my mother [Ernestine Segars Berry] would talk about what was going on at the Red Cross.
Speaker 1: What were like holidays like in your house?
Speaker 2: The, the family spent a great deal of time and effort making them special and you know there would be ritual associated with all of the holidays.  So if you took Christmas for example, we wouldn't put the Christmas tree up until Christmas Eve and the lights would all be blue.  Christmas day we would get up, you had to have breakfast and everything cleaned up before you opened the gifts and then each person would get the gift individually and then there would be, you'd go out and you've give gifts to other people.  You would take baskets around the community where there was an indication people didn't have food.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: And come home and have a dinner.  But you'd do that every, every year.  You never put the Christmas tree up before Christmas Eve.  We always had blue lights.  But it was, you know Easter, thanksgiving there was always a ritual associated with the holidays.
Speaker 1: So do you remember some of the rituals associated with like Easter and Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Well Easter you would, you would, you would go through lent and you would, you would give up something for lent.  And then so Easter was the time that you would, you would go back to whatever it was that you gave up.  There would be probably the week before a going to the store and picking out the new shoes and the outfit for Easter.  You would go to church and then it would be a great dinner.  You usually invited people over for dinner.  You usually had people over for dinner for Easter and for Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: And did your mother prepare all of the food and--?
Speaker 2: She, she prepared all of the food, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were, were they usually pretty big gatherings?
Speaker 2: They, they weren't that large.  They weren't that large because it was just you know there were the four of us and then later my brother, five.  So we might have another six people or so because we didn't have--in Alabama we didn't have any relatives there so it wasn't a matter of bringing other relatives.
Story_ID: 11339
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about the community that you grew up in and if you can remember we can start with the, your Chicago [Illinois] community.  Can you kind of describe your block?
Speaker 2: Well, Chicago community was not far from University of Chicago.  It was mainly professional African Americans so there were doctors and lawyers and people who taught at the University or were professionals somewhere in, in Chicago.  And so the, the houses were all brick and fairly large yards and, and the people that we knew were people who worked with my father [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr.] or mother [Ernestine Segars Berry] mainly the, the friends were doctors or lawyers.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your street?
Speaker 2: Evans Avenue, yeah.
Speaker 1: And was there like a corner store or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Mainly residential?
Speaker 2: It's residential yeah.  Yeah, I didn't have the fun of going to a corner store that a lot of kids had.
Speaker 1: What about your--in Alabama?
Speaker 2: In Alabama we lived on the hospital grounds and there were houses there for the doctors and their families.  There were maybe about twenty cottages and then there was an apartment building and we lived in one of the--they called them cottages.  We lived in one of the cottages.  And the hospital had a bus that took us back and forth to school you know so we were kind of isolated actually which was why our parents got us into--I didn't last very long but got us into Girl Scouts and troops and activities so that we would have more dealings with the community than just the children in the, they called it the circle.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of other children--?
Speaker 2: On the circle?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: No, no.  There were some I mean we knew them all.  Ann Dibble Jordan was one who lived not too far from me.  There were just very few.
Speaker 1: And tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of your childhood and remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Magnolia just because in Alabama we--I forgot to mention we lived in Montgomery [Alabama] for a short period of time--this magnolia tree there.  But throughout--magnolia, that smell.  There's a bird, I don't know if it's a whippoorwill or what, that sound I, when I hear it I think of childhood.
Speaker 1: And what sights?
Speaker 2: Sights, well red clay reminds me of Alabama.  I, and I guess, I guess spruce trees remind me of Minnesota and I, I can't think--we traveled a, we traveled quite a bit.  We did have that gift too that our parents would take us--after we did the summer school we might go to Michigan or some time in the year I might go with my father if he had a meeting, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meeting in Atlantic City [New Jersey], he would take me.  So the sights are a, a variety.
Story_ID: 11340
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Chambliss Children's House?
Speaker 1: Chambliss?
Speaker 2: Chambliss Children's House.  It was on the grounds of Tuskegee Institute [later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  The grade school was a part of Tuskegee Institute.  The high school was a public high school, Tuskegee Institute High School.
Speaker 1: So were there like student teachers from Tuskegee at the school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: And were you all pretty well integrated within the, the campus at Tuskegee or--?
Speaker 2: What do you mean, the, the school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not really.  It was set off a little bit to the side.  The, there were student teachers but it, you--no, it really wasn't integrated.  Now what I did do when I was in high school is I worked and I worked on the campus at Tuskegee Institute, did clerical work for one of the professors.  And I, I worked, I worked every summer.  One summer I worked in Chicago [Illinois] with the American French Service and I worked near the [Jane Addams] Hull House so I went, lived with American French Service group.  That was the other thing that after the years of going to school then we moved from going to school to working which, which was good.
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers there and were there any who had a particular influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember history and math and as a matter of fact a teacher who taught me music, well she said she wasn't successful but she lives here now.  And she and I have become good friends and we, we get together often actually.  It's amazing.  And she looks ten years younger than I do.  She's younger looking than I am.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Ruth Ballard.
Speaker 1: And she taught you music?
Speaker 2: She--I went to her music classes.
Speaker 1: And during elementary school what were some of your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: History, I did, I liked mathematics also.  And I, I, anything that had to do with government or civics I liked those.
Story_ID: 11341
Speaker 1: During that time did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: In elementary school [Chambliss Children's House at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I started out because I was going to all of these meetings with my father [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr.] and listening about civil rights and you know participating at least as an observer in the discussions of segregation.  I just knew very early on that's what I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: So did you think you wanted to be a civil rights lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what I thought.
Speaker 1: And when you'd go to these meetings with your father can you kind of describe the atmosphere for us, what were they like?
Speaker 2: Well, they were usually fairly large groups.  This was even before, many of them before voting and in Tuskegee [Alabama] they were gerrymandering the city so that they would cut African Americans in and out of the voting pad.  And so there would be not emotional but analytical discussions of what strategies needed to take place in order to overcome segregation.  So I can remember just very serious orderly meetings and they, they were often in, in different buildings on the campus.  But some of them were in churches too.  Some of the meetings were in churches.  And I--we would go out of town when my father had to go to a state meeting or a national meeting.  Whenever Thurgood Marshall [ Supreme Court Justice] or Walter [F.] White  would come to Alabama they would come and spend time at our house.  My parents would always have a dinner for them.
Speaker 1: And do you remember like what your initial impressions of Thurgood Marshall were?
Speaker 2: Oh I was just, well I was in awe.  I was in awe.  And I mean I understood who he was at, at the time and I understood who the international--I mean the national NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders were and they would come to the house.  And our parents would let us be at the table when they had dinners for them so we were able to hear the discussions.
Speaker 1: And were most of the discussions on like strategic NAACP business, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And you still found it very intriguing even as a young girl?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I mean I think my parents thought I was an old woman when--and, and I came on earth as an old woman but they contributed to that by involving us which I think was wonderful involving us in, in all of that.  You know we had great opportunity to, to hear what was going on at the time.
Speaker 1: And at that time based on your recollection what was the membership of the NAACP like?  Was it mainly professional African Americans or was it--?
Speaker 2: No it was, it was a cross section of people in the community who wanted rights so no it wasn't--and it fact it was very interesting.  I think my father might have been the only person who lived in that circle that I talked about who was active in the NAACP and I know he was the only officer.  And so we were, we were a little odd with my father being in the NAACP and my mother [Ernestine Segars Berry] being in the Red Cross.  We were viewed in somewhat odd way by the other professionals who lived in the hospital grounds.
Speaker 1: Like a little radical?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right (laughs).  I mean when you think back it wasn't radical at all but that's how we were viewed.
Story_ID: 11342
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like?
Speaker 2: It was Methodist.  Well that's a very touchy subject because I went, but I never believed in Christianity per se.  I, I always believed in a supreme being, but I never even as a child, I can remember never accepting all of that.  But I went, I mean I went to Sunday school, I went to church and when I went away to college [Bates College, Lewiston, Maine] then I stopped going to organized religion and really had my own way of dealing with the supreme being.  And that started, it's very interesting that that started so young.  And I, I married a--the, a minister and presiding elder's son but I finally decided and you know agreed with God that, "You know I don't believe all this and so it's no need in us pretending.  So let's just work out this deal," (laughs) and that's the way I've been ever since.
Speaker 1: And did you ever share those thoughts with your parents?
Speaker 2: Not that much.  No, not that much.  I didn't see any reason to, to do it.  You know I think religion is personal anyway and it's just interesting that I came to that on my own so early.
Story_ID: 11343
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the junior high school years.  Did you actually attend a junior high school or--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was, it--you went all the way through to eighth grade [at Chambliss Children's House at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] and then you went ninth to twelfth [at Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you didn't, it really wasn't broken up.
Speaker 1: But let's talk about that time period like between like you know the "tween" years--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sixth grade through eighth grade.  What were some of the things that you enjoyed doing with your time during that--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: We--none of it changed.  We went to school, we came home, we did our homework, we didn't go out during the week.  It was all the way through.  We never dated.  We would go to school, events or parties but a parent, one parent or the other would go with us.  So it was a very structured upbringing which I have been grateful for in, you know in my years since because I think it contributed to what all I've been able to do with the discipline, the seriousness although I have fun.  But it's, it's also I can't have fun until after I work.  I mean I have, I have the same mentality I had.  And I'm guilty, I feel guilty if I do anything fun if I haven't earned it okay, so from childhood.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: So those years were the same.
Speaker 1: But did you enjoy like reading or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kinds of books did you like to read?
Speaker 2: History, biography, political science.  I, I never have cared for fiction and I don't read it.  I, I had to read fiction in college [Bates College, Lewiston, Maine] you know for courses but I, I don't read it now.
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about Africa when you were growing up?  Did you have any thoughts about Africa?
Speaker 2: There were conversations about Africa.  My parents [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr. and Ernestine Segars Berry] talked quite a bit about Liberia, it's interesting--and Ethiopia.  There were many conversations about Haile Selassie [emperor of Ethiopia] so my thoughts about Africa were all, this is where we came from.  There's a great history, we can be proud of it.  So I think that's why Liberia and, and Ethiopia were talked about because of the, the history and you know both places in those days were not dominated as other parts of Africa were by the British and the French.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think that as a child that it would be some place that you'd go someday?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I always thought I'd go around the world, yeah.
Speaker 1: And during your junior high school years, did you still have the same dreams and aspirations of becoming a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 11344
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends during that time?
Speaker 2: My friends? Well I, you know I, I knew the people who lived in the, in the area on the circle and you know on Friday nights and, and Saturdays we would play.  You know I got to know people in high school [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama] and some of the people who, some of the people who were involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  But I, the reason I'm hesitating is that you know so much of my life was with my parents [Joseph A. Berry, Sr. and Ernestine Segars Berry] and in structured settings that I didn't pal around you know.  And I, and I think that has you know a lot to do with that, what kind of relationships I have with people now.  And I, and I was perfectly happy.  I wasn't unhappy with that.
Speaker 1: And you had said earlier that your brother [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Jr.] was ten years young.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship did you have with your brother?
Speaker 2: He and I were the closest, yeah.  And in fact, that's the saddest thing that's happened that he died because we would talk two and three times a week and even--and he moved here, he and his family moved here about two years ago so we even got to see each other more often. So--in fact he and I were closer than, than I am to my sister [Barbara Joanne Berry Deveau] and I think that had to do with personalities, interests, humor.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And the age difference didn't make a big difference?
Speaker 2: No. Humor, interests, personality.
Speaker 1: During the junior high school years [Chambliss Children's House at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: My parents.  I think maybe a history teacher about this nation and what should be happening for all people in this nation so it reinforced what I was getting from my, from my parents.  And, and the kind of people that we had a chance to meet who would come to the house like, like Thurgood Marshall.
Story_ID: 11345
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee Institute High School [Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: I was--worked hard all the time to be on the honor roll.  I wasn't, you know, one of the 'Miss Tuskegee' types.  I did get to be Miss Honor Roll once, so I rode in a float once.  But I, I was you know in the government club.  Again it was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Any sports?
Speaker 2: --We'd take a bus--no, I was terrible in sports.  I think that they let me be the, the timer--timekeeper for the track team.  Yeah I did that kind of stuff, but I wasn't in sports, no.
Speaker 1: Now was the high school on campus?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't on campus it was separate and it really wasn't a part of Tuskegee Institute [now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] even though it was called Tuskegee Institute High School.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: Government, history, I still liked math, chemistry.
Speaker 1: And what about your dreams and aspirations, still--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Still, I didn't change.  I didn't change until I got into law school [University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and then I thought, "What am I doing here?" (laughs)
Speaker 1: And so during high school years what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well I knew I was going to go and I was pretty certain it wouldn't be Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Why were you certain?
Speaker 2: Because I was going to go away and so (pauses) I, it wouldn't, I wouldn't stay home for college.  And--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Was that your--like you really wanted to go away--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and have that experience?
Speaker 2: And, and my parents [Joseph A. Berry, Sr. and Ernestine Segars Berry] were expecting me to go away.  And so it was important for my grades to be good grades so that I could go away and go to almost any school I wanted to?
Speaker 1: And you said you didn't do any dating during high school?
Speaker 2: No.  No I didn't.  You know we would go to some of the high school parties but again either my mother or father went.

Speaker 1: So where were some of the places where you thought you might be interested in going to college?  What were some of the schools you were interested in?
Speaker 2: Well I went, my last year of high school [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama], my father and I went and visited about five, six schools in New England cause I was going to go to New England.  So--.
Speaker 1: How did you decide on New England?
Speaker 2: Just because I thought the schools were good there.  So I went, we went to schools in Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New York.  I didn't visit schools in the Midwest but I did apply, did apply to one school in the Midwest but most all the others were in New England.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I, I graduated from high school in 1952.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So where did you decide that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: When did I decide?
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Oh where?  I went to Bates College in, in Lewiston, Maine.
Speaker 1: And how did you come to that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, I was accepted in all of the schools I, where I applied and my parents were willing to pay for whatever school.  But I knew I had a sister [Barbara Joanne Berry Deveau] two years behind and so it--I was accepted at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York] and Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York], Swarthmore [College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania], Bates and one other.  Those--the women schools are all much more expensive and, and I liked what I saw when I went to Bates because we visited all of them.  And so it was a combination I was comfortable with Bates but I also didn't want to pick the most expensive school.  So, and my parents let me to decide--let me decide.
Story_ID: 11347
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Bates [College, Lewiston, Maine]?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time I was at Bates until my sister [Barbara Joanne Berry Deveau] came I was the only African American there.  Now I wasn't the first African American.  Benjamin Mays [former president of Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] had preceded me you know, Dr. [Charles] Drew [sic, Dr. Drew attended Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] had preceded me so it wasn't as if you know I was breaking any barriers, but at the time I was the only African American.
Speaker 1: Were you well accepted?
Speaker 2: It was a small school.  Yeah, I didn't you know--it was too cold for anybody to be discriminating against anybody.  And I lived, the first couple of years I lived in a small house.  I was in a single room which I wanted.  I didn't want a roommate.  And finally my senior year, I think it wasn't until my senior year I had a roommate but my, my preference was to control my space.
Speaker 1: So you lived in a small house off campus?
Speaker 2: No, it's on campus.  These were all campus houses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, were all part of the campus.  They just had both large dormitories and small houses on the campus.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things you became interested in when you were at Bates?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the debate team and that--I spent quite a bit of time.  Bates College had one of the best in the country so we would debate schools all over the world actually, debated  Oxford [University, Oxford, England].  And, and you know each, I think this is still the same now but there'd be a major debate topic selected each year and then you would go and debate.  I spent a great deal of time on that.  I spent time on the pre-law club.  Again I wasn't in sports in fact sports almost did me in because I had to pass sports, physical ed [education] and they took you through everything, skiing and horseback riding, badminton.  That was, badminton was the only one I halfway did well in.  Skiing it used to take me the full hour of the course to try to get my skis fastened and the--they were just so disgusted with me.  But I had to pass in order to graduate so that was always a, that was always a challenge.
Speaker 1: And what--so the time you were at Bates were you still thinking and planning to go to law school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Still want to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what year did you earn your degree at Bates?
Speaker 2: 1956.
Speaker 1: And it was in political science?
Speaker 2: Political--it was called government.
Speaker 1: So why did you decide to study government?
Speaker 2: Because that, that was a pre-law you know.  It--at the time most of the law schools wanted you to have come from a Government or a Political science.  You know now it doesn't matter, but it did at the time.  So I was pre-law and it was, government was the pre-law major.
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of your professors at Bates?  Were there any particular ones who had a particular influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Donovan who was the head of the Government [department] and so my major advisor.  I also--there was Cultural Heritage and there were a series of professors in that.  And that, that was also a very favored course because it took you through the arts, the sciences.  It was you know the, I think it was a smorgasbord of courses.  So you, and you had to take it and you took, you took four years of cultural heritage.  So it introduced you to every discipline and I, I really did enjoy that.
Speaker 1: And what was your social life like at Bates?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't, I didn't date again.  I had my, the minister's son--my ex-husband come up once to Winter Carnival.
Speaker 1: And was he--?
Speaker 2: He was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the time, wait a minute, at the time he was at Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  He hadn't gotten into Harvard yet.
Speaker 1: You all met at--Tus--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: We grew up together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We grew up together, but other than that I didn't, I didn't date in college.
Speaker 1: But like what kinds of things would you do for fun when you were at Bates?  What did you enjoy doing in your spare time whenever you did have spare time?
Speaker 2: Well I was, I was working with the pre-law group and the, the debate group.  I would go to concerts 'cause they'd have you know programs on the campus.  I'd go downtown to a movie with some of the folks in the dormitory.
Story_ID: 11348
Speaker 1: So when you graduate from Bates [College, Lewiston, Maine] where were some of the places you were thinking about?  What law schools were you considering?
Speaker 2: I, I was accepted at [Case] Western Reserve [Cleveland, Ohio] and then my father [Joseph A. Berry, Sr.] died.  He, in fact he died on the way leaving my graduation going back home. And so that changed my plans because then we had to move out of Tuskegee [Alabama] cause we were living on the hospital ground.  So we moved back to my mother's [Ernestine Segars Berry] home in Minnesota and luckily even though I hadn't applied, I got into the University of Minnesota Law School [Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: And what was happening at home when your father died cause your brother [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Jr.] was still considerably for younger and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your sister [Barbara Joanne Berry Deveau] was already in college at this particular time?
Speaker 2: Right, right--what do you mean what was happening?
Speaker 1: Well, just like what impact did it have on the family, the move and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was, it was very hard on the family.  But my mother was so strong and she and I, you know, did a lot of the planning on what we needed to do and when we needed to move.  We were fortunate because we had the house in Minnesota.  My grandfather [Noah Segars] had died, but we still had the house and we would still go up there in the summer so we just moved into the house.
Speaker 1: And so was that transition a little bit easier because you all did spend a lot of time in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  I think that's true.
Story_ID: 11349
Speaker 1: And so what were your experiences like in law school [University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to law school at a time where the faculty really didn't like women to be in law school.  And there were three women at the time in the law school you know out of, it must have been out of about three hundred students.  And a couple of the professors would call on the women.  We weren't in the same class, every class where they wouldn't do that, but we always felt that was to make us uncomfortable, show that we weren't equal to the others.  But actually they--it strengthened us.  I stayed friends with one woman who was a class ahead of me and she became a judge in Minnesota.  She still lives in Minnesota, but we see each other maybe once a year.  I think we grew close because it was tough.  It was tough.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite courses in law school?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the problem.  I, actually I got into law school at--at the time law schools hadn't really figured out how to make the course work relate to the real life.  So you were studying contracts and property and all this old law that was not interesting.  So at the time--after I got into law school I really didn't like it but I was convinced that I was going to finish just because I started it.  And courses like constitutional law were my favorite courses.  There were no courses like civil rights in those days so you were--property and contracts and agency and a lot of boring stuff.  Moot court was interesting.
Speaker 1: What about your professors, were there any particular professors who really tried to nurture you and--?
Speaker 2: One did.  One, Davis who was in Administrative law and who was well known in Administrative law.  But he was much more sensitive about what was happening to the women and he went out of his way in his courses and afterwards to be supportive.
Speaker 1: And so when you're in law school when do you have--are you still thinking I really still want to be a civil rights attorney?
Speaker 2: I, I'm still thinking I want to do something about civil rights.  I'm not sure about being an attorney but I, I still have great interest in civil rights and know that in some way I, I want to do something about it.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from law school?
Speaker 2: 1959.
Story_ID: 11350
Speaker 1: When you graduated from law school [University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] what were you thinking you were going to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I got married and I moved to France.
Speaker 1: In 1959?
Speaker 2: And--1959, yeah moved to France and my ex-husband was in the [U.S.] Air Force as a lawyer.  And then I took a job on the base with the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and also taught servicemen who were trying to pass the GED [General Educational Development].  So I was a different kind of officer's wife because I was the only one who was working.  But then I didn't have to go to all the social stuff.
Speaker 1: And that was fine by you, huh?
Speaker 2: That was what I wanted, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy France?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  And we lived, we didn't live on the base we lived downtown in, in Loire and so we benefited from being in France.  And we didn't really spend that much time on the base or with the other officers and their families except you know during the working hours.  And I, I did love it.
Speaker 1: And how long did you live in France?
Speaker 2: Let's see, we were there almost three years.
Speaker 1: So like 1962 or so?
Speaker 2: 1962 yeah.
Speaker 1: And so when you were in France it was, you know somewhat of the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, what were some of your thoughts, someone who had grew up learning and, and knowing so much about civil rights about being in another country during this particular time?
Speaker 2: Well I, the only thing I noticed there was there was almost no segregation.  Now later as I've found out in every country somebody is a lesser being and you know at the time it was the Algerians.  There weren't that many Africans in France.
Speaker 1: Was that your first time meeting Africans?
Speaker 2: I would meet Africans who came to the United States.  You know the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] often hosted Africans so I met Africans that way.  But I didn't meet Africans in France.  There weren't that many in France at the time.  You'd see some--we would go to Paris often.  You'd see some but not, you know I wouldn't--we didn't socialize.
Speaker 1: And so were you anxious to get back to the states to become part of this movement?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not, not really at the time--because I really kind of moved into trying to settle into a marriage and it was just a timeout.
Story_ID: 11351
Speaker 1: When you come back to the states you worked for the Interior Department [U.S. Department of the Interior].
Speaker 2: Well that was, when I came back I tried to get jobs and here I had this law degree and it turned out the only job I could get was as a clerk typist.  Then I took, at that time they had the federal service entrance exam and I took that which then allowed me to be a personnel assistant but I couldn't get much else.  And you know that was still at the time when women and minorities weren't doing all that well no matter how educated and so I worked my way up.  And each year I would get promoted and so you know I started out as a clerk typist and then moved my way up in the personnel system.
Speaker 1: And what was the climate of the federal government at that particular--actually I'm sorry, secretary.  Can we back up a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How was it that you all ended up coming to Washington, D.C.--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because my ex-husband was going to be a lawyer in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice because he also was very much involved in civil rights.
Speaker 1: And so he got a position?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he, he got a position--see it wasn't that--he got a position but he was a guy.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you were at the Interior Department I think until 1967?
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I--that's why I brought--I don't remember all--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you went from clerk typist to personnel assistant?
Speaker 2: And then I moved up.  I was in classification, personnel manager.  I mean I moved up the line and every, every year that I, at the time that I was eligible for a promotion I got a promotion.  And then I started move, then I started moving out and I moved into commissions and I was on the [Otto] Kerner Commission staff.
Speaker 1: Oh what did you do on the Commission?
Speaker 2: That--yeah, I, I was the research, did a lot of the major research for the Kerner Commission which was when--starting to get me into what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And tell us what the Kerner Commission is.
Speaker 2: Kerner Commission studied--after the riots, it was the commission that put together the report for President [Lyndon B.] Johnson on, on the riots.  And, and I was not on the teams that went out.  I was in the research unit and we were gathering information for the report or for teams that went out and--.
Speaker 1: What were you learning?
Speaker 2: You know that it was a divided society and that poverty contributed a great deal to the frustration.  And the story was the same no matter where you went.  It was very, very worthwhile.  I met a lot of people that I still, our paths cross and it was--I was very pleased to have been able to have gotten on the commission staff.
Speaker 1: And how was it that you were able to (unclear) a position?
Speaker 2: I just went and applied.  I, I--no one opened the door I went and applied.
Speaker 1: And were you surprised by some of the things you were learning?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: But glad that it was being documented?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  I wasn't surprised cause you know it just took me all back to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] because NAACP didn't just deal with the South and so I mean I knew that there was inequality.
Story_ID: 11352
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about your work with the [Otto] Kerner Commission [on urban riots] and your work at the Interior Department [U.S. Department of the Interior].  But one of the things I wanted to ask you was when you were at the interior department in the '60s [1960s] were you thinking I'm going to make a career in the federal government?  Were you thinking that?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't think--I've never thought about what a career would be.  And in fact I haven't really, if you look at what I've done it doesn't all seem to fit together.  And it, and it's cause I wasn't really planning a career.  It was I look at opportunities to make a difference.  And also I don't like staying any one place for long periods of time.  I start losing interest.  And so I move around quite a bit.  So, no I haven't thought about, I hadn't thought about a career.  What I always wanted to be, to do was be someplace where I could make a difference and I wanted it all, almost always to have something to do with poverty.  Not every job I've had, Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] was kind of outside of that.  But most of the other jobs even if that wasn't the theme it, I turned it to the theme cause when I was commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission then I insisted that they look at the impact of safety on, on the poor.
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit and talk about when you went to the Office of Economic Development in 1967.
Speaker 2: Equal Opportunity.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--(unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Office of--.
Speaker 2: It was OEO.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, which is now known as the Office of Economic Opportunity?
Speaker 2: It doesn't really exist, per se, now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't exist.  It was taken down let's see what years, I, I'd have to look that up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But just tell us a little bit about how that opportunity came about?
Speaker 2: Well I went and applied for it and the office, it, it took me directly into dealing with the poor.  I was working with migrant farm workers.  I started out working with, in Washington [D.C.] but I spent quite a bit of time working with migrant farm workers in Florida and then I became the chief of the Midwest Division of Migrant Workers.  So I was dealing with migrant workers that went from Texas up through the Midwest and back so they would travel every year and back.  And you know we were concerned about providing education and health, job development.  I, I would go into many of the farms to try to deal with the owners to get them to provide better services because the housing and all was absolutely unacceptable.  Very--you know civil rights issue was highly ignored.  Civil rights of migrant workers ignored because they, they didn't live any one place so there were very few places that took them on as their responsibility.
Story_ID: 11353
Speaker 1: And during this time, were you becoming active in civil rights in the Washington, D.C. area?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  My civil rights activity was through my, through my work.  No I, I didn't.  I joined, paid dues.  I've been active through the years with the United Negro Women that--with Dr. [Dorothy] Height and in fact I have done most of my work in the civil rights community through United Negro Women [sic, National Council of Negro Women].
Speaker 1: So after you left the Office of Economic Opportunity you went on in 1969 to work for Health Education and Welfare?
Speaker 2: Right, then I started moving into political positions and I went and I worked for Elliott Richardson there.
Speaker 1: How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think if somebody introduced me.  I don't remember actually.
Speaker 1: But Secretary, during this time, the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s] was the federal government starting to shift and change a little bit in terms of its acceptance of women--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the opportunities for women?
Speaker 2: Well they were still slow on women but there were more opportunities for African Americans.  There was much more a concentration on giving African Americans opportunity.  You know the opportunities for women came later really.  But Elliott Richardson was a different kind of person and, and Bob Petrocelli (ph.) and Jack Vinneman (ph.), these were three men--Petrocelli was from Connecticut, Vinneman from California and then Richardson from Massachusetts.  And they--the three of them who were in charge at the time felt that Health and Human Services would not be at all relevant if it didn't have women and minorities.  And so they went out of their way and I, I have to think about--I don't really remember how I got to them but I know I was employed in the end in part because of their belief that there needed to be greater diversity in, in their part of the department.
Speaker 1: And what did you do at HHS?
Speaker 2: I was a special assistant to Elliott Richardson and I had responsibility for the children, Office of Child Development and the welfare issues.  So the issues having to do with welfare and all of the issues having to do with child development would go through, go through me.  Also I had some responsibility for the poverty programs that were, the small poverty programs that were within the department.
Story_ID: 11354
Speaker 1: In 1971, you went to work for VISTA [Volunteers In Service To America].
Speaker 2: And I was the director of VISTA.  And then you know VISTA--
Speaker 1: What is VISTA?  Can you tell us what--?
Speaker 2: VISTA was, it was the domestic Peace Corps, so it was volunteers who would work in poor communities in the United States.  At the time--I started changing it but at the time that I went in VISTA volunteers were primarily college and graduate students.  But then I started making a portion of them people from the community so it was a combination of college graduates but then welfare mothers.
Speaker 1: Who would work within their own communities?
Speaker 2: Work within their own communities.  Well some of them would even work in other communities, would work outside of their community and--because you know the VISTA volunteers weren't paid but they were given a stipend and the program paid for their travel and all of that and their housing and so that was offered to whomever was selected whether they were from the community or not.
Speaker 1: And was it also changing the face of the organization as well because--.
Speaker 2: Changed--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: --was it primarily white as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it changed the composition, the racial composition, it started changing the age because it was more of a, a mix of ages when we started opening it up to the community.
Speaker 1: And why did you think that that was important?
Speaker 2: Because I felt that generally speaking the people who lived in the community probably had more to offer in terms of attacking some of the problems than people coming from the outside.  So I felt that VISTA should do two things.  It should prepare people young people to have an effective life of service and so they needed the experience.  But at the same time the program ought to make a difference in the communities in which they served.  So you needed some combination of the people who knew the communities and lived in the communities and then the young people with the new ideas but also would carry with them afterwards a commitment to service.
Speaker 1: Was the merge successful?
Speaker 2: Most places, yes.  Some places not.  Some of it had to do with you know it often comes down to people so sometimes it came down to who, to who were the program directors because they would be assigned to particular programs.  And you know some people can't manage volunteers anyway of any kind.  And I started going through every one of the programs throughout the nation and shutting down some of them where I felt they weren't managing the volunteers.  They didn't have the right program for managing volunteers of any kind and opening up new programs where I felt they were developing good opportunities for volunteers and would be committed to this diversity and the volunteer mix.
Story_ID: 11355
Speaker 1: So from VISTA [Volunteers In Service To America] you went to CPSC and--the Consumer Product Safety Commission--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 1973.  Can you tell us how that opportunity came about?
Speaker 2: That, by that time I was known more--see I was appointed by [U.S. President Richard M.] Nixon to be the head of VISTA and by that time I was known more by the political types.  And so the White House called me about this new commission to see if I wanted to be a commissioner.  And in this Consumer Product Safety Commission was Presidential with [U.S.] Senate confirmation.  That would have been my first senate confirmed job.  And so I took it and actually it, it was one of the jobs that I didn't find all that exciting and actually I left before my term was up.  I had a six year term.  I think I left after four years.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you find it all that exciting?
Speaker 2: Because it was about products.  I mean I tried to turn it, as I said I tried to bring into it having them concentrate on more of what the safety problems of the poor.  I convinced them to bring the head of Welfare Rights Organization onto the board to, advisory board.  But you couldn't make it but so interesting.  It was you know what are the, what are the products that cause the greatest safety issues?  Which products should be banned?  You know we were looking at a lot of research on fire, fire retardant products.  A lot of studies of what stairs, problem stairs, bicycles and toys and all and it just, it just bored me.
Speaker 1: Let's pause for one second.  (pause).  What was the Senate confirmation process like?
Speaker 2: Well, it gets worse every time.  I've been confirmed five times now.  You know our whole society has changed so much and in every one of them they started back in you know in your grade school, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigating.  But each time they're investigating more.  (pause).
Speaker 1: We were talking about the Senate confirmation process.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, what happens is you know the FBI does it check.  You have now more forms that you fill out.  I mean you have to fill out the forms.  You have to tell all your neighbors and everybody are interviewed.  And then what also happens now is nobody trusts anybody else so the senate staff will go behind the FBI and do another investigation.  And the--so that part is unpleasant.  Then the very legitimate part is for you to have to testify on who you are, why you should have the job, what you would like to do if you were in the job, all that's very legitimate.  It's the other intrusive part that doesn't give you, it really doesn't give information as to whether or not you're going to abuse the power once you get in there.  That's the problem with it.
Story_ID: 11356
Speaker 1: In 1976, you became assistant secretary of HUD, [Department of] Housing and Urban Development.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences at HUD like?
Speaker 2: Well there I, I set up the consumer unit.  I managed the Indian, some of the Indian housing, some of the elderly housing.  The, you know it was a bureaucracy where I was setting up a new unit and pulling together units so I had all of the regulatory programs.  And so the programs that regulated real estate settlement, I put that in place, that regulated the--well they, they, they used to call it the, well I guess they still do, the motor vehicle, the whole, the vans, the housing, manufactured housing is what they called it.  It was--bureaucracies don't bother me.  They bother a lot of people but I just figure you go in, you figure out what you have to do, who you have to do it with and you don't get too distracted by all of the static.  And then you, you can make a difference.
Speaker 1: And so at this particular time, this is in, we're now like mid to late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What's the federal government--what are opportunities like for women?  Is it starting to open up a little bit?
Speaker 2: It's starting to open up.  I was elected for that job by Carla Hills who was the secretary at the time and so there were some women in Cabinet posts.  Now she may have been the only one at the time but it wasn't as if it had never been.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There have been women in Cabinet posts.
Speaker 1: Right, but were opportunities for educated women, were they starting to open up in terms of being able to get jobs other than clerical or administrative?
Speaker 2: Slowly and, and it was much better in the government, federal government than in the private sector.  And in the universities, universities came late, but it was much easier.  There were many more opportunities opening up for women at that time in government, yes.
Speaker 1: And so from 1977 until 1982, you were with a think--a consulting group, Newman and Hermanson, I think?
Speaker 2: Right, I started a company with six--[Judith A.] Hermanson and I owned fifty percent and then we had four other partners who had worked with us in Department of Housing and Urban Development.  And what we were doing was mainly advising companies on the regulatory approach, how they deal with regulatory agencies.  And we did, we did some international work, mainly my partner did who had been in the Peace Corps.  We did some work on--I did some work with Bremer and Company on the District of Columbia.  But it was we, we would bid on work and we--you know it was hard the first three years.  You weren't making any money and then you start--and no bank would talk to you, not until you made money.  You know how that works.
Speaker 1: And so after that I believe from '82 [1982] to '84 [1984] you were at the Institute of American Business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was a, a non-profit that helped minorities get primarily franchises and auto dealerships.  And it was funded by General Motors [Corporation] and you know the idea was to not just to educate people on how to do it but to make the contacts for that.  So I set that up for, for the institute.
Speaker 1: And then you went back to consulting again for a couple of years?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.

Speaker 1: This is where you started doing some work on Africa and projects with Africa.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think with the African Development Foundation?
Speaker 2: Right.  right--right.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well that, that was a non--it was partially governmental organization concerned with development in Africa.  And, and building U.S. interests in Africa.  So that--Leonard Robinson and I don't know if you know some of these people, were part of it at the time.  It didn't have that much money but it had small grant money that we would approve for projects in Africa.
Speaker 1: And were you enjoying that work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I had always had an interest in Africa so it was allowing me to begin to be more directly involved.
Speaker 1: And so from 1987 to 1988 you were a consultant on a World Bank project?
Speaker 2: Right.  I lived in Lesotho [South Africa].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's when I started really being directly involved.  I went by myself to work with the Minister of Interior in Lesotho to help them merge two--they, they're called parastatals, but two you know non-governmental or quasi-governmental, quasi-governmental organizations, housing organizations to merge them so that there would be a strong organization that then would allow the world bank to come in and fund housing in Lesotho.  So it was, it was a great experience because I was there by myself.  I took a computer and a printer and I worked, lived in a hotel room--in kind of a seedy hotel actually.  I didn't really deal with Americans until I was about ready to leave because--.
Speaker 1: How were you received by the African community?
Speaker 2: Fine, you know it took people a while but they could see I was--didn't think they were different and we were working together.  I had worked closely with a couple of people on the staff in the Minister of Interior and I think the fact that I would take all the notes and then given them copies of the notes for every meeting meant that we were partners in this.  And so I went to their weddings and their parties I mean that, that was my social life it was with the Africans.  And as I say I really didn't get hooked up with the U.S. community until I was about to leave.  Well they didn't look me up and I didn't look them up.
Speaker 1: And was that your first time going to Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was Africa all that you had dreamed about and read about?  Or what were your first initial impressions?
Speaker 2: I guess I wasn't surprised I mean cause I had read so much. You know I wasn't surprised about it.
Speaker 1: Did you think while you were there that you had somewhat found your niche that--?
Speaker 2: I knew I'd always want to work in and around Africa.  I think anybody whose spent any time in Africa you just get attached.  And even though you know I went away I knew somehow, someday I would come back and work in and around, on African issues.
Story_ID: 11358
Speaker 1: You did leave in 1988 and so from '89 [1989] to '92 [1992] you were at OPM, the Office of Personnel Management.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: What happened, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well that was a political position and I had known, had met President [George H. W.] Bush and, and his people and he asked me if I would run the civil service system, I mean Office of Personnel Management.  And so that came about you know through ties.
Speaker 1: Did you want to do that or did you still want to do something connected with Africa?
Speaker 2: No, I was interested in running the civil service system.  I thought that that you know would, was a good job, a good opportunity to make a difference.  And now I, I spent quite a bit of time concentrating on bringing about greater diversity in the civil service system.  I knew that job was powerful enough that I, I could make a difference so I was--I didn't resist it.
Speaker 1: And what was happening you know we're late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s] in terms of opportunities for women in the federal government?  Are we--is the playing field getting to be level?
Speaker 2: It's not, it's get ,you know, not at the top.  It's still not at the top.  There were, there was a much more heavy effort to recruit entry level but not at the top which also meant there wasn't that much available in the, in the pipeline.  There was a big gap between entry level and there was a great reluctance to go outside to bring people in at the top if they hadn't worked their way up which was something I was trying to change.  And I also thought there was a lackluster relationship with the historically black college and universities to get people interested and part of that was people didn't believe that you were serious about having more people in.  And so I built more programs, recruitment programs in historically black colleges and in the Hispanic universities.
Speaker 1: Were the opportunities for African Americans still within the federal government, were those still better opportunities for women?
Speaker 2: What, what are you saying are they--?
Speaker 1: In terms of advancement in the federal government for African Americans and also jobs that were not administrative or clerical?
Speaker 2: The bulk of the jobs if you looked at the statistics which I would do on a regular basis, the bulk of the jobs for African Americans and for Hispanics were the support jobs, the bulk of them were.  You were starting to see some increase in the professional jobs but even then there was still--you could still look at the numbers and know that there was a ways to go.
Speaker 1: And in 1992 you were appointed as Under Secretary for the Smithsonian [Institution].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: President Bush again.
Speaker 2: No the, the administration doesn't have anything to do with the Smithsonian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They don't--there's a board made up of the Chief Justice [of the Supreme Court], the [U.S] Vice President and three [U.S.] Senators and three [U.S.] Congressman, nine citizens and they appoint the Secretary.  The Secretary then appoints the Under Secretary whose name goes before the board so that's not political.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's not political.  And the, let's see, a friend recommended me to the secretary to talk to me about coming to run it because by this time I had a reputation of being a strong manager and they needed a strong manager because the Smithsonian is this huge operation, a billion dollar operation and there were some management issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were your experiences at the Smithsonian like?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a beautiful place.  It's fascinating, lot of fascinating people.  But I say to people I don't care whether you're at a pretty place or not personnel is still, you know you have to deal with people.  People fuss about parking, you still have the same issues and they behave in the very same way.  But it's, you know there--it's a lot of very interesting things going on there.
Speaker 1: But you stayed there for a long time?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  I, I had--because I was, I ran it.  I was the chief operating officer and I had opportunity to, to deal with a variety of issues that were interesting.  And it, it's a great place.
Story_ID: 11359
Speaker 1: And so when you left the Smithsonian in 2000, what did you do before you went to U.S.--?
Speaker 2: AID?  I started a business, the idea of the business with, with another person--.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the business?
Speaker 2: It was--I have to think of it in a minute.  It was Upstart.  Upstart.  Well our idea was to help companies that were beginning to fail--work out of that by getting technical assistance to them, but we were too late.  We were, we were maybe two years too late because my partner was on the board of many of these start up companies.  See, that's what we did, we switched 'start up' to 'Upstart'.  Wasn't that cute? (laughs) We were going, so we were going to take these start up companies that were maybe three years old and say, "Now you have to get serious about management."  You, you were entrepreneurs and you got them started, but the same kind of mentality doesn't work.
Story_ID: 11360
Speaker 1: So you were telling us a little bit about how Upstart worked.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, the idea was to help the business, start up companies when they had past the first two, three years and they were starting to move into having to manage, not just to come up with new ideas.  But the problem was we started this maybe two years late because by that time a lot of these start up companies were gone.  And the ones that were still around weren't able to pay--what we were willing to do was go onto the boards of these companies and take stock in lieu of their giving cash.  Weren't looking for cash from them.  We wanted some cash but we weren't--but see that wouldn't have been smart for these, for us even.  So it didn't, it didn't quite work.
Story_ID: 11361
Speaker 1: But after that you did get another opportunity--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to work on African issues with them, USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development]--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 2001.  You were the assistant administrator for African Affairs?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us a little bit about how that opportunity came about and also what you did at USAID?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well again it was, I knew the President [George W. Bush] and his team because I had worked you know with him, for him on his father's [former President George H.W. Bush] first campaign and so I knew people around him.  And they called about my coming into the administration and I told them I would only come, into the administration on a job that had to do with Africa.  Other than that I didn't have any interest.  And so there weren't that many jobs but that was one of them.  And then I was interviewed by the administrator of USAID and, and selected.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of issues did you work on at USAID?
Speaker 2: Well, these were all development and so you know the, the, the programs are quite large in many of the countries.  I selected the directors of the missions.  I would work out the budget for USAID Africa.  I would evaluate the programs and decide which ones should--I, when I mean I would, through the staff we would work together on it.
Speaker 1: And can you just talk a little bit about what was happening in Africa at this particular time and like what were some of the challenges that you faced in terms of doing the things that you needed to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know there's a lot of good news about Africa and then there are challenges.  The good news then and now that I deal with is, is the fact that the African leaders are taking more responsibility and are insisting that the rest of the world become more a partner and listen to them and, and what it is that they believe should happen.  And that's the best news yet of Africa, which also means that there are less conflicts.  The conflicts that are there are being managed better by, by the Africans.  Education, health, trade, all--the numbers are getting better in a lot of the countries but what the bad news is that the general public, because of the media doesn't understand this that only the bad news of Africa is communicated.  And that's a big problem because then it's harder to get resources because everybody says why you keep putting resources in there and nothing is changing?  The bad news of Africa is there's still corruption.  There's still conflict and Africa is behind every other continent in meeting the millennium development goals.  It's still--the percentage of people living on less than a dollar a day and the HIV/AIDS pandemic is affecting everything, everything.  And it's the professionals who are going first which is the saddest part.  So Africa's ability--and I say Africa because it varies.  There are many countries below 3 percent with HIV/AIDS.  But then there are countries in Southern Africa with thirty percent HIV/AIDS and it's some of the strongest countries like Botswana and Namibia, South Africa with some of the worst HIV/AIDS.  That's the really bad news of Africa.
Speaker 1: You know in a speech that you gave in 2002 you said that the future of Africa was very bright.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Do you still believe that today?
Speaker 2: I do, I still believe that and it's because of what I said.  I believe what will turn Africa around is the role of the leaders and the people participating in their government.  So it isn't just smart leaders but smart leaders who got there because the citizens put them there and the citizens will take them out when they are no longer doing the right job, a stronger civil society that is insisting that they reduce the conflict and reduce the corruption.  That's why I think the future is bright.  And then things are turning around.  The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act is, is bringing about greater trade with the U.S., that's good.  There is much more investment in Africa and you know the people are amazing, the, the spirit of the people.  And that's, you know there are a lot of bad actors there but the--they are not the majority and it's amazing what people do with little and how much people value life and their families and are forgiving of what the circumstance that they're in.  There's so much the world learned from people of Africa in that regard.
Story_ID: 11362
Speaker 1: Do you think that there's a disconnect between African Americans and Africa?
Speaker 2: I think that, that that's less now than it was at one point.  There, at one point there was a feeling on the part of some Africans that African Americans were subjects and didn't really have power and therefore couldn't tell them anything.  There were African Americans who did travel to Africa who were arrogant, just as arrogant as a lot of the non-African Americans which was more offensive to Africans.  But now there are so many Africans who studied in this country and have met African Americans that they respect and so many African Americans that have traveled and worked in Africa who know what they're doing that I, I don't notice the, as much of tension that maybe was even true when I was back there in, in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Do you think that most African Americans identify with Africa?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I think they talk it and I think people buy clothes that look African but you know when you start really delving into it and you say well when is the last time you've been you know or given to Ethiopia you know what do you really know about Africa, you know?  You--no I don't think--I think you can go into organizations like Africare.  I think you can go into many of the universities.  I think the historically black colleges do have African studies that have people genuinely know Africa.  But I think a lot of African Americans have some of the same biases because they don't really know Africa and they don't, don't really relate to Africa.
Speaker 1: How do you think we bridge the gap?
Speaker 2: More people speaking out who know Africa, more people traveling and working, not just taking trips but working in Africa, more Africans coming here and being a part of universities and organizations and better, better media.  You know I think that BET [Black Entertainment Television] could do a better job.  You know not just, not just--(unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: In it's portrayal of Africa?
Speaker 2: --Not just (unclear) to NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  Yeah, .  Not just to NBC and CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System], but I think BET could do a better job and I don't know why they don't.
Speaker 1: Do you think that your perception and devotion to Africa was shaped mainly when you lived in Lesotho?
Speaker 2: No, I think it started before then.  I think it started back with my parents and the, you know the conversations we would have about Africa generally and their interest in Liberia and in Ethiopia.  I just think it started back then and we have--even though they didn't travel to Africa we'd have African objects in the house.  We'd have books about Africa so I, I think it went back.
Speaker 1: And do you think that the current administration, the [George W.] Bush administration is as committed to Africa--.
Speaker 2: It's more so.
Speaker 1: --as it should be?
Speaker 2: More, more committed to Africa--the republican administration never get credit for doing things that people don't expect them to do.  And as a matter of fact more money has gone to Africa in the last four years than ever before.  There, more African leaders have visited the White House and met with the president than ever before.  So much, there were so many assumptions that the president wouldn't even know where African was but even after, in the face of showing that that's not the case, people don't, don't believe it.
Speaker 1: Well do you think people don't believe it because we, we do see the HIV/AIDS  epidemic taking, you know we hear about that in Africa famine, civil war, conflicts so do you think that that's why people don't believe it?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's because people don't want to believe that people that they don't like might do something right.  I think that the African Americans have such strong feelings against republicans that they can't give credit even in areas that they care about.  And the, and the Africans will say that they fare better under Bush than they did under Clinton.  That the rhetoric may have been better but the actual resources, I mean fifteen billion dollars going to HIV/AIDS and more of the development money going to Africa than ever before.
Story_ID: 11363
Speaker 1: What about intervening in some of the civil conflicts that are taking place, more of intervention like we see in the Middle East?
Speaker 2: Well I don't, I don't know what else unless we're going to send soldiers.  I, I spend so much time every day on Sudan so for people to say we're not working on Sudan, I've been in and out of Sudan three or four times as, as have the secretary.  So short of you know I, I don't really agree that the only way to show a commitment and a concern is to send troops, I don't agree with that.  I think you need to send resources and technical assistance which we are doing in Liberia to help Liberia through the transition.  We're spending a great deal of time and resources in the Congo and Sudan is the largest funded development program.  I was somewhat opposed to that because we had to take from some other places but I'm, I don't think that the only way you measure whether or not an administration is doing enough is whether or not they send troops.  We have, we lifted troops.  We used our planes to take troops into Darfur.  We took Rwandans and Nigerians into Darfur.  We are doing, building all of the camps in Darfur.  We are providing the support to the troops who will be coming in from Gambia and Senegal.  So we're, we're helping but it's just not our troops are not going in.
Speaker 1: And do you think that that's often times that's where people get confused because they don't understand, well why can we send troops to the Middle East but--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and, and it--people opposed to you know what we did in Iraq but then some of the same people who are opposed to that think that we ought to do the same thing in the Congo.  And I think that you need to be consistent.  If you're opposed to going in you ought to be opposed to going in.  I think that it, it--you know the, the role that the rest of the world, the British and the French less so the Belgians played historically in the continent, on the continent makes our, our own role one where we have to be, you have to negotiate because the French still have major interests.  The British still have major interests.  So when we intervene I will tell you we either intervene with them on their agenda or we have to negotiate with them.  You can't pretend that they don't have a role there because the Africans themselves are related to these other countries.  So my only point is that I, I think the Iraq experience is one that should not be duplicated which is we go in it alone.  I think we have to work with the other players.  And I've been a strong believer that we need to work through the African union and that's been our approach in Sudan, it's our approach in Cote d'Ivoire and our approach in the Congo.  And they need to make the call as to how we can be helpful to us and that's what we're doing.  But it's slow.  It's slow.
Speaker 1: Is it too slow?  Are you concerned at all?  You talked a little bit about the numbers turning around in Africa.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But are they turning around--?
Speaker 2: No, it's too slow.
Speaker 1: --too slowly?
Speaker 2: It's too slow.
Speaker 1: What can we do--?
Speaker 2: Everybody needs to put the time and attention-- it isn't all resources.  Put more time and attention to Africa.  I believe that.
Story_ID: 11364
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for Africa?
Speaker 2: Well, the hope is that the leaders continue to own the problems and the solutions.  The--and I have little concern about that now just because of the strong people leading many of these countries.  The, the--but the concern is that the help needs to come to them in the right way and enough of it and they need to be willing to accept it.  And I say that because I'm the one that has been dealing with the African union on getting help into Darfur and there's reluctance which I understand but it also means things move slow.  And I understand the reluctance because they don't want the developed world to take over and they don't want their African union building with a whole bunch of Americans and French and British in there calling the shots.  But we have to work out a mid point because the other side of it is it's moving too slow.  It's moving too slow.  My concern is that the, there are not enough resources coming fast enough to solve the largest issues there, health, education--.
Speaker 1: What do you think is the largest issue?  Is it the health issue?
Speaker 2: Right now in Africa, I have to say HIV/AIDS  although I don't want to have all of our resources there because even after you've addressed HIV/AIDS you have poverty which is part of--[South African president Thabo] Mbeki point.  Now I'm very unhappy with how he's handled HIV/AIDS, but part of his point was I don't want you to move away from addressing the poverty issue because you're addressing HIV/AIDS.  That was part of his point and I think that's a legitimate point that we, we need to be operating on many fronts.  But, but we cannot, we cannot ignore the fact that HIV-AIDS has a major negative impact on the continent.  The next is we still have to deal with conflict because there's too much negative that happens as a result of conflict and it doesn't stay within the borders of the country of the conflict.  It goes way outside and very innocent people are affected by conflict and then corruption has to be addressed.  And we can't pretend, tiptoe around the fact that there is corruption because it takes away from the resources available to improve the lives of people and it's in some of the major countries.
Speaker 1: And would you also like to see more involvement on behalf of African Americans and African issues?
Speaker 2: Yes, but you know I think it is the responsibility of Americans.  Africa is important to the United States.  It's important because Africans have power in international organizations.  Africa has the potential of being a major trading partner.  Africa has resources and we have a responsibility as a strong nation to assist parts of the world that do not have equality of resources.  And so yes I think it's important for African Americans but I, I don't think it's solely their responsibility.  I think United States citizens have a responsibility to turn around the fate of Africans.
Story_ID: 11365
Speaker 1: And in your current position as the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, what are you hoping to accomplish in this current position?
Speaker 2: Well, this is the policy position.  It does not--there are some resources here but it's not development position.  That means that I have the responsibility working with the White House and the other agencies of deciding what should be our approach to Sudan both in terms of political solutions, in terms of diplomatic solutions and, and influencing what the development resource solutions ought to be.  How do we make available our military and our police expertise to help address some of the conflict issues?  What is the right policy for us in terms of working with other nations or working with African institutions?  So the responsibility here is to understand what the major issues are in Africa, to understand what is the proper role of a major power in addressing those and then helping to galvanize the resources that we have to follow through on whatever policy directions that we take.
Speaker 1: And can you just tell us a little bit about how the African Union works?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Just how it works--?
Speaker 2: The African Union does have both, both sub-Saharan and the North African members.  They have councils, they have a very strong peace and security council but they're divided up by subject matter.  They elect a president, [Nigerian] president [Olusegun] Obasanjo is the president now with president [H.E. Joaquim] Chissanó having been the previous president.  They have as a chairman who runs the day to day operation former president Mali, [Alpha Oumar] Konare.  They are, they do have consultations with their members to decide what their directions ought to be.  On peace and security for example they went to their members to have their members approve the plan for Sudan which is what slowed us down because we couldn't go into Sudan until they took their plan to their members.  But they did have buy-in because their members have participated in the process.  The New Partnership for Development, NEPAD, was, is run out of South Africa now, will be run more directly by the African Union and the African Union will have connection with the major regional organizations.  So it is becoming the EU [European Union] of Africa.
Story_ID: 11366
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well I, I think the, the influence of my parents [Joseph A. Berry Sr., Ernestine Segars Berry], what they thought was important, what they valued, teaching us the importance of service, the importance of valuing each human being, of working hard and that you--we have gifts in life.  We were given the gifts of our life but we also had gifts that were given to us over which we had no control and we should give back.  And I think you know that is a part of what I think of everyday and I, and that was the greatest influence.
Speaker 1: And is there anything that you haven't done yet that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I, I just hope in, in the end I will have made a dent in improving the lives of people particularly the poor in this country and, and around the world but in particular in Africa.  And I, I haven't done that yet.  I've tried.  I haven't done that yet.
Speaker 1: And any regrets, are there any things that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: You know I really don't look back.  I really don't.  You know I was married for twenty years and divorced.  Well I don't look back on should I have not gotten married or should I have not gotten divorced, it just, it just happened.  I really don't have, I really don't have regrets.  I kind of take the lesson of whatever it is and move on.  I think that helps me that I don't do a lot of looking back.
Story_ID: 11367
Speaker 1: What do you think your legacy will be?  What do you think when you are no longer here you will leave behind?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I hope it will be that I made you know, made a difference and the difference primarily in, in terms of finding ways to improve the opportunity for people who have not had the resources to have an adequate life for themselves and their children.
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, for having done that and you know for being a decent human being that lived up to what I was taught by my parents [Joseph Alonzo Berry, Sr. and Ernestine Segars Berry] 'cause I don't want to run into them later and have them say, "Now you didn't do what we said was important to do."  I don't--that worries me.  I don't want to--and I think of that often.  I don't want to have them looking at me and saying, "You didn't really follow through on what we told you was important."
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to add that perhaps we didn't cover?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I'm just so impressed with you and how, your homework and how, the quality of the questions 'cause I will tell you I hate talking about myself and I've never done it actually before.  I refuse to do profiles.  And I was very not looking forward to this and I kept putting it off and hoping that it would go away.  But I've really appreciated it.
