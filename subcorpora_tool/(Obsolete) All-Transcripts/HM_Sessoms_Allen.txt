Speaker 2: Allen Lee Sessoms, A-L-L-E-N L-E-E S-E-S-S-O-M as in Mary, S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 17th, 1946 in New York City, the Bronx.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm the President of the University of District of Columbia.  My occupation now-a-days would be educator.  I'm a physicist by training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is, if I have it correctly, September 13th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at the University of District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 21964
Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a warm up I guess.  They only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it?  That's the second question.
Speaker 2: If I had to characterize it, favorite food would be lobster, fresh lobster, cooked, boiled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: It used to be blue.  It's migrated towards magenta with age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.  Any time of the year I can experience is one of my favorites.  Yeah, I don't really differentiate.  I enjoy the four seasons.  I think the summer can be stressful but really very nice and the winter can be the same thing.  So I like them all, all four are good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, since I almost never get a vacation.  But I spent time a lot skiing in Switzerland and then--when I lived there and in France.  So it's, if I had to pick places, Paris is my favorite city in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I were--but it's better to live there than to go on a vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay. The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I adlib a lot in this job.  I don't really collect phrases, I just use them.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 21965
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll separate them and keep them separate until we put them together so we don't get them mixed up. So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Lottie, L-O-T-T-I-E Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E Leff, L-E-F-F, that's her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I think it was September 1914, Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Charleston, South Carolina.  Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace your mother's side and what were some of the personalities in the family doing?
Speaker 2: Well actually we can't trace it back very far.  My mother moved to New York when she was young and went to nursing school. I met a number of relatives on her side, sisters and nephews and nieces and my maternal grandmother and grandfather when I visited them a couple of times in South Carolina, but we really didn't keep very close touch.  Many of the people on my mother's side moved up to New York too and we grew up in proximity either in Brooklyn or Queens, some lived in the Bronx.  So, some lived in the same apartment building for a while, which is interesting.  So we sort of grew up together but there was no real family tree generated or any connectivity.  We just knew that there was Uncle Nelson and Aunt Essie and these other folks but that was basically the connection.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No stories from South Carolina or--?
Speaker 2: Well my parents--well I speak to my mother.  When she left South Carolina, she left with the intention of never going back.  A lot of people migrated north for that reason and there was a major frustration there.  My brother and I actually visited some of those folks--I have a twin brother--visited some of those folks when we were in middle school.  Then it was junior high school, and we understood why she left and would not go back.  But we got to know some of the sisters and brothers pretty well, my aunts.  And uncles and some of them were pretty good people.  They were up north and some of them migrated back to the south in recent times, just for economic environment.  I mean it's relatively inexpensive down there and they're all retired but that's that connection.  It wasn't a very strong family connection to the past.  Everything was going forward.
Speaker 1: I hear you.  But because this is history it's good to let people know who are going to be watching this years and years in the future, you know to know why somebody wouldn't want to go back to South Carolina in those days.  If you--
Speaker 2: Well in those days South Carolina was totally segregated.  And a lot of--there was this huge, black Diaspora out of the south and people moved to the north for economic and educational opportunities cause you couldn't get anything down there, especially in a place like Charleston which was completely segregated.  And they would bypass the District of Columbia because it was also segregated.  So you end up in a place like New York or Philadelphia or even Albany, Albany, New York because those are the places that were relatively unbiased.  You could go to school, you get good jobs.  It was basically more or less a meritocracy, not all completely, obviously but more or less.  But in the south it was just, you were just limited.  And so the, I think there was a sufficient number of social and other kind of insults that there was a lot of the migration of young people.  When I say young, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, just out of high school just getting out and not understanding why their forbearers put up with that stuff you know.  My mother in particular was never negative about it but she felt that it didn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense and we almost never went back to visit the family back there.  We would visit the family when they would come up to New York, visit with them.  But it was an interesting environment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21966
Speaker 1: Any stories, I always ask this, any stories about emancipation, the end of slavery that are passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: None to speak about.  The stories I got from my mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff] were more on the social side, the understanding that if you weren't educated you weren't going to be anything.  My mother was, ended up being a practical nurse.  She came up when she was relatively young, I think 17, 18 up to New York.  That's actually where my parents met.  She went to a, one of the hospitals for the nursing school.  She got her practical nursing degree from the State of New York and she worked as a nurse for thirty-five years or something like that.  And that was where she was and she didn't really migrate a lot beyond that cultural sphere.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she, now did she grow up in South Carolina or New York basically?
Speaker 2: She grew up in South Carolina and left and moved to New York when she got out of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was it, didn't look back.
Speaker 1: All right.  Any stories about growing up from your mother or about her impressions of New York when she first got there in opposed to South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well her stories were interestingly intertwined with her mother and her father who I got to know a little bit.  And they had some Native American blood in them and they grew up in a, in an interesting time.  They were almost sharecroppers, I mean they were farmers and we would go, a couple of times we'd visit them on their farm.  These were people who were incredibly resilient.  I mean they would put up with a lot of stuff that we would never consider putting up with now--a-days.  Not particularly well educated but determined to have their kids educated.  So there was a determination on my mother's side that everybody who could be educated would be educated and I think they encouraged her to leave cause they didn't see any significant opportunities around Charleston in those days.  I mean we're talking you know the 20s [1920s], 1920, I think '25 [1925], 1930.  These are, this, these are interesting times.  They were economically difficult times certainly, right after the World War I.  There was always some significant divide between the haves and have-nots, mostly--there were a lot of poor whites down there too but they were most of the black poor.  And they were limited in their educational opportunities.  Most of them if they were lucky you got a high school education.  Not all of them did.  And I think the rule was if you could go somewhere and be better off, you should go.  And significant numbers of my relatives on my mother's side did that, they just left.
Story_ID: 21967
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they all settle in--now you were born in Bronx [New York], but where did the, where did your mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff] initially settle when she came?
Speaker 2: She initially settled in Harlem [New York] and then moved to the Bronx.  Well I was born there so she moved to the Bronx after she met my father and got married.  He settled in Harlem as well.  I mean that's where they, my--the--in New York that's where the significant piece of the migration was from the south.  Eventually a lot of people settled in Brooklyn [New York], but Brooklyn was kind of the Wild West in some ways than the Wild East if you take a look at the geography.  But it was a place where you could go and grow up and it was sort of suburban in a significant way then.  But Harlem was the cultural center so folks who got to New York first went to Harlem cause it was a welcoming place and then they saw where else they could move and they would move around the area.  So I had relatives in Brooklyn, in Queens, significant concentration in the Bronx, nobody in Staten Island [New York], but that's not surprising.  And a lot of people are still in Harlem and the Harlem area, but Harlem is getting a little pricey so we--people had families, they would move elsewhere which was somewhat less expensive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21968
Speaker 1: The story about my mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff], she worked in this hospital called Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for thirty five years roughly.  And I was a kid in high school.  She got me a job as a nurse's aide in this hospital and I was working with physicians.  Here's this kid, I'm a kid, doing almost surgical procedures on some of these patients and dealing with doctors who were not particularly conversant as far as I could tell in medicine.  And I was wondering how bad this place could be?  Well my mother when I was sick, took me in once to see one of the doctors and she said, after he examines you, you are going home cause if you stay in this hospital you will be sicker than when I brought you in here.  And that was an interesting object lesson.  And then significantly after that, George C. Scott made a movie called 'The Hospital' about the worst hospital in America.  It was Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.  That's where my mother worked all those years.  And I concluded when I was doing that for that summer that at that point medicine was voodoo science and I went into something else cause I was thinking about going into medical school.  There's no chance I'm going to do this.  It made no sense.  These folks, very nice, very sympathetic people and from my perspective had no idea what they were doing and that was a municipal hospital in the city.  It's gotten a lot better.  Lincoln Hospital is one of the better hospitals now but then as they would say, back in the day, you wouldn't go there when you were really sick.  You'd try to find someplace else.
Speaker 2: Well they say most hospitals now are not good environments to get well in actually.
Speaker 1: Oh they're just getting more dangerous.  But these hospitals in the inner city I mean they dealt with gunshot wounds all this other kind of stuff.  They would--they did triage before triage was fashionable.  But then they also had everybody who didn't have any health insurance in this environment.  So these folks got interesting care, I think it's fair to say.  And that convinced me that medicine was not exactly something to do at that point, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 21969
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T Earl, E-A-R-L Sessoms, S-E-S-S-O-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And maybe a good time to ask, like what, do you know the origin of the name Sessoms?
Speaker 2: Yes that I do know.  It was a slave owner, French slave owner, Cajun down in Louisiana and all of this property was given that name and then he moved from Louisiana up to North Carolina, the Raleigh area, Ahoskie in particular and it had plantations around there and everybody who were his property had this name Sessoms [pronounced Ses-sohn], which is a French name.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause I've heard of some black people named Sessions too.
Speaker 2: S-E-S-S-I-O-N-S.  One of the things--that's a different name.  I don't know quite what the origin of that is but everybody with the name of S-E-S-S-O-M-S has got to be a relative of mine.  That's what I've concluded.  I bump into them all over the place and they are relatives, I mean distant or close but relatives.  Yeah, interesting on my, from my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 1914, same time around with my mother.
Speaker 1: And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Ahoskie, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-H-O-S-K-I-E, I think.  It's in the Raleigh/Durham area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now once again, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well I only met my grandfather on my father's side and my grandmother once and then some relatives going down to the south a couple of times when we visited them in the Raleigh/Durham area.  My father was not close to his family at all and he left for the same reasons as my mother left.  He just wanted to get out of there.  And one of the stories he would tell was he couldn't understand or have any respect for people who would put up with that stuff.  I mean he grew up in a totally segregated environment where people were treated fairly poorly and he didn't understand why people would put up with it so he left.  And when he left he was done.  He said, (gesturing with hands), end of that.  But we went and visited, my brother and I when we were younger visited a couple of times but that was it.  And the last time we visited, there was an interesting story.  We were twelve years old and we went down and visited I think it was his cousin or brother or something like that.  I can't remember now.  And we went to these sharecropping farms and we were learning how to do some of the picking tobacco, picking cotton, hot, nasty North Carolina summer.  And then we wanted to go to the movie theater.  And my brother and I when we went to the movies in the, in New York would always go to the balcony.  That was the best viewing area you know you could sit in the balcony, you throw popcorn on people, something like that.  But there, we had to sit in the balcony.  We bought the tickets in the front and then the guy told us you got to go around the side.  And on the side there was a sign called colored people's entrance.  It was just colored people's entrance and they made you go up to the balcony.  We don't like the balcony anymore after that.  And we also said okay, did this once.  Called our father up and said okay if you don't come and pick us up in the next twenty four hours, we're going to go home on our own cause we have had enough of this place, and he came and got us.  That was the last time we went to North Carolina to visit his relatives.  That was it.  He said now you understand why I left.
Speaker 1: Okay. So was your grandfather down there a farmer or were they--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were all sharecroppers in some respects, never got to know them particularly well.
Speaker 1: You knew it's some place that neither parent wanted to go back to?
Speaker 2: They did not want to go back, certainly not--my father never had any interest in going back.  My mother went back near the end to be cared for by her sister, my Aunt Florence who I actually visited a couple of times out in Charleston and she recently passed away but she was 104 when she did.  So they had some pretty strong genes on both sides of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a--I didn't ask you, your mother was a high school graduate from South, from Charleston.  Do you know the school that she went to?
Speaker 2: I have--I don't know the school she went to.
Speaker 1: Some of these schools are historical you know in a lot of ways so I just wondered.  And did your dad get a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: My dad finished high school in Ahoskie and came up North as soon as he got out of high school and never looked back.
Story_ID: 21970
Speaker 1: Now your father [Albert Earl Sessoms] kind of--did he serve in World War II?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were a lot of interesting stories about that.  He moved up to North Harlem and I have some photographs of him.  He was a very, very handsome guy and he met my mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff] there and they got married.  Four days after they got married he got drafted and he was gone for some five years in the Navy.  And he served in the Pacific Theater.  He had to confront some fairly interesting times in the Navy which was segregated then but he was a gunner's mate on a ship and he got blown overboard half a dozen times with these airplanes flying into the gun torrents, had some interesting stories.  He saw--he was at Guadalcanal.  He saw what the Japanese did to some of the U.S. servicemen they had captured, some of the tortures that were going on.  He would tell us interesting stories about some of the retaliations that the U.S. soldiers would meet out on the Japanese prisoners they actually came across.  He told us some interesting stories about being in the segregated Navy where he would be called sort of unreasonable names and he was court marshaled several times, a couple of times for picking up an officer, throwing him overboard and about to throw a gun casing, I mean a shell casing on top of the officer in the water and being restrained from doing that.  It was an interesting time.  He was always acquitted but the court marshals were pretty serious.  But he ended up with an honorable discharge but one of the things he told me in the end was, when I first went to a scientific meeting in Japan, he couldn't understand how I could possibly go and deal with the Japanese cause the stuff that he had seen during World War II absolutely, absolutely shocked him.  He was sort of telling stories that it, in some sense it was difficult to repeat and they were all perpetrated by the Japanese against the U.S. military and he just couldn't understand why anybody then could find the Japanese even vaguely civilized.  It was interesting.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Interesting times.  But he also didn't think the navy was all right either because of the segregation he experienced there.
Speaker 1: So this is, yeah this is a story we often hear you know World War II vets talk about how they were treated in the army as being a war in a sense too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  The army was probably a little better.  I mean the navy was much more segregated.  They got away with a lot.  You were sitting on these boats.  In some sense the army needed everybody.  I mean they were doing some very difficult things, certainly in Europe and in the Pacific.  The navy was much more isolated.  And it was one of the last bastions I think in the military of segregation which is interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right.  We interviewed a man named Augustine Davis and, that was at Pearl Harbor that had a story about--I mean, just about all yeah the black navy veterans have one--they all say it was worse.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They have a sense that it was worse anyway and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, from what I understand you take a look at the progression of folks in the flag rank and clearly the army was much more embracing once they figured out that there was no choice, okay.  I think now it has something to do with that, you know just sort of forcing the issue.  And then you ended up with a guy like Colin Powell [Colin Luther Powell, American statesman and retired four star general from the U.S. Army] you know coming through and running it.  You--the Navy, I don't you'd come close to seeing that even now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21971
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Lottie Beatrice Leff and Albert Earl Sessoms] met?
Speaker 2: There must be, but I don't remember it.  But they met in New York.  I mean if you--I've got some photographs of my dad.  I mean he was incredible--he was a dashing guy.  You know he was a Mason and he recorded a couple of albums with his Masonic singing group.  He actually had another signing group outside.  He was quite a dandy and I guess he you know did okay.
Speaker 1: You know the name of his group, any of his groups?
Speaker 2: I can find--I couldn't find anything.  I thought I had a couple of the old albums but they were pressings on these big, you know heavy, single sided--
Speaker 1: Those big 78s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I have some of them somewhere but I didn't resurrect them.  I think they're in storage but I had stacks of these things.  And he was a really good tenor, I mean very--I sang with him when I was a kid but he could sing some songs.  He really knew how to do that well.  So he got around that circuit and I--they met and--
Speaker 1: So did he sing jazz or gospel or what--?
Speaker 2: He sang ballads, he sang gospel to some extent but not really.  Most of it was kind of Basie [William "Count" Basie, jazz pianist], Ellington [Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington, composer, pianist, big band leader], Armstrong [Louis "Satchmo" "Pops" Armstrong, jazz trumpeter and singer] kind of stuff, maybe some Cole Porter [composer and songwriter].  You know this was, in these groups, Harlem at that time was you know the mix of everybody and it was epicenter of all sorts of kinds of music and he was a part of that scene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he dressed for it you know white hat, tie, it was just, it was interesting.  And the Masons were clearly a--oh, my mother was also in the Order of the Eastern Star.  It was clearly a network of African Americans who found mostly from the south actually, that this was a way of navigating some of the complications of the North, interesting, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well was he involved in the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] movement at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No he wasn't.  He--when my father got back from serving in the Navy, I think my mother got pregnant instantaneously, maybe the next day when he got back.  So he was then occupied with his family and things like that and I don't think he got--he didn't get involved in politics, he didn't get, as far as I'm aware in any sort of radical movements of any kind, none whatsoever.  He was always just working, became a small businessman tried to, trying to make things work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your parents got married before the war, right?  You said right before the war?
Speaker 2: I think they were married probably in '39 [1939] and my dad didn't get back until '45 [1945], you know.  It was just in--and he was gone the entire time.  He didn't come back.  He just went in and that was it, must have been interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21972
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were, you've got a twin brother, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were born in November of '46 [1946].  Since my father [Albert Earl Sessoms], that's how I get the timing.  He came back really at the end of '45 [1945] at the end of the war in the pacific.  You know they took time to get out so my guess is he probably didn't get to see my mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff] until the end of '45 [1945], beginning of '46 [1946].  We were born in November of '46 [1946] so there it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Instant contact, he got out and he went to you know had a family, started a family.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any other brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I've got a sister yeah, she's somewhat younger.  She was born in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In September of '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Now is your brother an identical twin or--?
Speaker 2: No, fraternal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although we got away with murder when we were in high school.  I mean we used to swap girlfriends and stuff.  They claimed they couldn't tell us apart.  I find that really hard to believe.  It was an interesting time.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Are you the same height or--?
Speaker 2: He was always slightly bigger than me.  Now we, the clothes are interchangeable.  Actually when he went to, into the military, he would walk away with my suits and I was wondering where these things were and he just absconded them and gone off and done his thing. But he was always a bigger twin.  I was born fifty nine minutes after he was born and so back in the old days--I was a little kid.  I was, when I was born I was less than two pounds certainly and he was maybe four, four and a half.  So I was you know a term baby, I wasn't premature, but I was teeny tiny and so I was probably in an incubator for a while, my guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would think, yeah.  That's--
Speaker 2: We're talking '46 [1946].  This is back in the old days, yeah.  My mother was a nurse and she knew the, you know the system so it came out all right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21973
Speaker 1: Now when you're thinking about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their mentality, their interest, their hobbies, habits, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father [Albert Earl Sessoms].  Yeah, if I had to make some determinations, I mean he was this guy who was relatively no nonsense, an incredibly hard worker but a soft touch.  I mean he was just, you could wrap him around your finger without a whole heck of a lot of effort.  But he was pretty gruff and he was a tough guy, a tough business guy.  I mean he had stores in the South Bronx [New York] when it was a free fire zone.  I mean you know it was just, so you had to be a pretty strong personality and he built his business on his own.  My mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff] on the other hand was just a very positive and warm person and she, there was--it, as far as I could tell it was hard to find any hard edges on her at all.  I mean she was just my--so it was an interesting complement my parents.  I think my sister takes more after my mother although she's got a few hard edges and my brother and I probably take more after my father.
Story_ID: 21974
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a few of them.  The first one was when my brother and I went on The 'Merry Mailman Show.'  This was back in the old days with this--
Speaker 1: The, what is it now?
Speaker 2: 'The Merry Mailman Show'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a kid show and they have these kids you know four, five, six, seven watching cartoons in the studio and it was an educational program and he asked the kids what they were interested in, much like this kind of interview and what they want to be when they grow up.  And he asked my brother, we were both four.  I remember this, a four year old, he asked my brother what he wanted to be and my brother said a fireman.  My brother was always interested in wearing uniforms and he was into uniforms.  Fireman, policeman, whatever it was he was always--thought that was kind of cool.  And the guy asked me and I said I want to be a scientist.  And the origin of that belief was that my mother being a nurse always allowed us to fiddle around the house even when we were babies.  You know you do these little experiments with vinegar and bicarbonate soda, you know you make a mess, that kind of stuff.  And she was really sort of allowing us to do those kind of things.  And she'd talk when she would come home about sort of nursing and some of the interesting things that would happen on the biological side.  So I said well that seems kind of cool so I always, my first memory of anything I ever wanted to be was to be a scientist.  I announced it on that show and I didn't change my mind, ever, four year old decided to be a scientist and that was the end of the story.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a little wavering of purpose in high school when you were thinking about being a doctor?
Speaker 2: Well I mean I thought medicine was science.  I got cured really fast when I went and worked at Lincoln Hospital.  I didn't know what kind of scientist I wanted to be, I just knew I wanted to be a scientist.  But I never wavered, I never thought about doing anything else.  At least initially until I became a scientist and then there were other opportunities.  But I never imagined not being able to do something that was just creative and I was not much of an artist.  And I played the clarinet and trumpet and all this other kind of stuff but sufficiently badly so I knew that that was not going to be a career.  But the science was always something I was fascinated with and I just pursued it, I mean throughout.
Speaker 1: And you said your introduction was really through your mother, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and she insisted that education was paramount.  My father insisted that--well even though he never got education beyond high school, it was the most important thing to him.  He said they can take a lot of stuff away from you.  You can make a lot of money, they can take it away.  You have property, they can take it away.  There are things that they can't take away from you that are absolutely crucial.  One is your education and the other is your character and you got to hold onto both.  Everything else belongs to somebody else basically.  You know if you don't like it the tax man can come and get it, you know.  If you got a car, somebody can repossess it.  You can--somebody can smash it up, somebody can burn your house down but they can never take you down unless you let them and the education is a pillar to that.  That was one of the two things.  He says education and character, you had to maintain both.

Speaker 1: All right, now was church important growing up?
Speaker 2: Let me see if I can characterize the church in my life.  My parents would send us off to Wednesday bible study and Sunday church service and choir practice to get us out of the house.  They would just get us out of the house.  Because they had--we had three kids running around, very close in age.  They did--in a small apartment in the South Bronx.  They wouldn't--didn't have privacy so they would, on Sundays we'd have a good reason to go to church and they would always say well we'll see you there.  They would never show up.  And then the choir practice was a way of keep, making sure the kids were off the streets and we did athletics and all these things, but all this stuff was to keep kids off the streets.  It was very successful cause we didn't have a chance to be on the streets.  We were always doing something.  And the church at that point was a very useful way of organizing society.  That's what churches were then I mean especially the black churches.  It was an opportunity to organize the environment in which we were embedded.  We knew for example that some of the ministers were rogues.  I mean some of these guys, you got folks walking into church and they come in there in big Cadillacs and we figured that one out really fast.  But that wasn't the point.  It was a very youthful, social organism.  But my parents used it to get us out of the house into a safe environment so they could have peace with each other and it--that was pretty worth it.  Well I, I mean I thought church was you know it had some utility but being fairly analytical, some of the stuff that they were preaching just was nonsensical.  And when you confront somebody who believes something or they make it a business really, I don't know whether these guys believe what they were talking about or not.  And you know it was a Baptist church, a Catholic church, a Presbyterian church all in the same neighborhood.  My girlfriend at the time--I was a little kid.  You know how can you have a girlfriend?  But her father was the head of the Presbyterian of the United States.  They were very intelligent people.  They weren't--you know they knew that Jonah didn't spend time in a whale's stomach.  Give us a break, it didn't make any sense but they used it as a vehicle for social and upward mobility.  And it was a very useful thing, and basically keeping the kids safe and keeping them off the streets.  And in that environment it was necessary and it worked to that--that was how I viewed and still view the role of the church as a very, to the extent it can be useful mechanism for organizing the communities in which these kids are embedded but you got to take it with a big box of Morton salt.  I mean it's just, some of the stuff is just crazy and that's a problem because people believe it and then if somebody believes something slightly different it becomes an issue and then the issue can become a violent confrontation.  That's the kind of stuff that just drives me crazy cause everybody speaks to God, God speaks to everybody.  Everybody is hearing it whether it's Osama Bin Laden who spoke directly to God or George Bush, I mean you know it's the same kind of nonsense and we don't need that.  But as an organizing mechanism in the community,  I think the churches have been invaluable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21976
Speaker 1: Now let's see, can you describe--now did you grow up in the same place the whole time, I mean--?
Speaker 2: 1130 Union Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bronx, New York.  I can't remember it was, I try--I can't remember.  They didn't have zip codes then but I can't remember whether--from the time I was born until the time I went to college it was in the same place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same apartment building, fourth floor walk up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how many rooms did you have in your apartment?
Speaker 2: See, my brother and I, this is still a bone of contention between my sister, my brother and I.  My brother and I had this little room on the end in bunk beds.  There was a kitchen, there was a living room that my parents shared cause that was always, also their bedroom, a fairly long which seemed like then a very long hallway.  There was a large, what you would call now a master bedroom on the side that my sister got because she was a girl.  So we had two boys living in this little place, my sister had her own room and then there was a bathroom on the end, so two bedrooms, two bedrooms, a living room, a small kitchen and a small bathroom.
Speaker 1: Okay, small place then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a small place.  It didn't seem small growing up cause that's what we knew, but it was small.
Story_ID: 21977
Speaker 1: We always ask people this, what were--can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The South Bronx, that neighborhood where I grew up is called Fort Apache.  And Paul Newman made a movie about my neighborhood called 'Fort Apache, The Bronx.'  And the opening scene was a bloody arm coming out of a police car riddled with bullets.  Okay, that was around the corner from where I grew up.  So that was my neighborhood.  That was Fort Apache.  It was probably the toughest place in New York, just extraordinary.  One of the things that was prevalent then was heroin but what was also true was that nobody ever messed with the kids because if somebody messed with anybody's kids, everybody's parent would go and find out who did it and take care of the person who messed with the kid.  So the neighborhood was relatively safe for kids.  There was a little bodega, called bodega, now we call it candy store, when I was growing up across the street run by a guy in the--who was a very positive influence I mean on the kids in the neighborhood.  And we would hang out at that store.  He was also one of the folks who helped organize a Cub Scout troop.  There was a Cub Scout troop run by a guy who was, actually lived in my building and we were a member of the Cub Scouts troop in that building.  It was really kind of an interesting excursion.  You walked two floors down and you were at your Cub Scout meeting.  You didn't have to go outside the building.  But there, it was a tough neighborhood.  Every now and then somebody would get hit with a bullet in their head sitting on the street.  I lost a couple of friends when I was growing up.  One guy I remember named Larry Buford, nice guy, going to school together and nobody had seen him for about a week.  And somebody saw--this car was sitting in front of the house.  Somebody popped the trunk and it was Larry with a couple of bullets in his head.  Couldn't have been more than thirteen years old, fourteen year old.  So it was a, an interesting place where overtly the kids were safe.  We would grow up and there was no air conditioning right in New York back in those days interesting that there was no ventilation at all.  Even though we were on the fourth floor you know it was just hot in the summer so we'd hang out on the stoop.  And you had these families with their kids on the stoop at two or three in the morning, it was fine.  I mean nobody messed with the families.  Every now and then you'd get a kid who'd do something stupid like Larry must have done and you know get's popped but it was a drug infested neighborhood where the kids were actually relatively safe.  It was extraordinary.  There was very few gangs.  There were a lot of numbers being run.  You know the organized crime guys were there you know so folks would brag about hitting the numbers and all this other kind of nonsense.  But the parents, certainly my parents at least were incredibly meticulous in ensuring that we were insulated from most of that nonsense.  And--
Speaker 1: Now was the violence mostly due to drug stuff or--?
Speaker 2: My guess since I was not really encapsulated in it was mostly drugs and other stupid stuff you know people shooting each other over women you know that kind of nonsense.  But my guess is that in general it didn't affect the kids because if anybody sold drugs to kids they were dead.  I mean somebody was going to get them, it was just done.  And it didn't happen to be your parent if you were--the kid was being affected, it was somebody.  Somebody was going to take care of that person.  And when I was growing up there if there was a body in the street nobody called the cops because in general there was a concern that the cops were actually involved in it.  I mean just, it was--if you remember the movie, the 'Fort Apache, The Bronx', it was really like that.  It was extraordinary.  I think because of that there was a sense that the family unit was more important than anything else.  I mean the church was a part of that but it wasn't a significant part.  It was a family unit and the extended family unit.  So we would go to junior high school and if we did something wrong in junior high school, everybody in the neighborhood would know it before we got home.  And there was no excuse, you come home, my parents would know about it, the neighbors would talk about it and you're walking back from the school and the teacher was always right. So there was a discipline there that was sort of a community based discipline where you went to school, the teacher was always right and even if the teacher wasn't always right you didn't ever confront the teacher, you come back and talk to your parents.  And if you screwed up, people knew about it before you got home and they would discipline you if your parents weren't going to discipline you.  I mean it was really kind of a communal exercise and that made the kids a lot safer till there weren't any gangs to speak up.  I didn't and I still don't recall any gang kind of activity when I was in, through high school.  I mean just none in the neighborhood, interesting.  But it was a place that was you know people hang out in.  We played stick balls.  The Bill Cosby [William Henry "Bill" Cosby, American comedian, actor, author, television producer] stories about playing stick ball in the street in Philadelphia it's exactly like playing handball on the streets, playing marbles.  I mean it was just always kids doing stuff you know during the summers, during the winters, playing basketball.  I remember in some summers 95 degrees playing basketball for five hours you know and then wondering why you had to go home, you know.  Everything drenched, your socks were drenched, your shoes were drenched, didn't make a difference.  You were out there playing ball and it was okay.  It was just a fairly safe environment for kids to be able to be kids, interesting.
Story_ID: 21978
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: PS99 in the Bronx, maybe four blocks from my house, five blocks.  You walked to school.  I walked to school throughout my career until I went to high school.
Speaker 1: All right.  So I take it you probably liked school?  I would--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I mean it just, why not?  There isn't anything else?  And school was fine.  I mean I found it to be fascinating.  I found the teachers--I even remember my kindergarten teacher, Ms. Euro, who was a great inspiration just because she liked the kids and she was excited about what she did.  And back in the day everybody was educated who was in the classroom and everybody was an expert in the field they taught and they were almost all women because there was this really impenetrable class.  You know like so you had these professional women teaching math and if they liked kids, they were teaching math to fourth graders and third graders and second graders.  So we actually had people who knew what they were doing in the classroom and it was fabulous.  It was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the racial make up of PS99?
Speaker 2: Oh it was totally integrated.  When I grew up, when I was born it was a Jewish neighborhood, then it became a Cuban neighborhood, then it became a Puerto Rican neighborhood then it became a Haitian neighborhood then it sort of migrated back.  I mean it was sort of a, in some sense when I grew up an extension of the grand concourse.  We went, when we went shopping on Saturday we went to the Jewish market.  You walked to the Jewish market and you went there and you went shopping.  When I wanted to get a banana split, I walked to the five and dime up on the concourse you know it was all that kind of neighborhood.  It was a very integrated neighborhood.  There weren't any barriers in my--I can't even recall any.  Everybody was just everybody and it was a--from the photographs I have, I got some photographs that I looked at of my elementary school and high school class, it was totally integrated back in the day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about the teachers, did you have any black teachers?
Speaker 2: A few.  One of the most beautiful women in the world was my first grade teacher, Ms. Jones, I remember her.  She was an African American woman.  I don't know what happened to her but she was absolutely gorgeous you know.  I mean how old was I, six?  And she was in her early twenties, but yeah there were some black teachers.  It was, did--I think the teachers sort of reflected the student body and vice versa.  I think they were all sort of from the neighborhood but I don't know that for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: My favorite subjects were always math and science, always.  I mean didn't really matter what they were, they were math and science.  I would go to the library on the weekends and one of my favorite places was the Donnelly library downtown when I was old enough to take a subway myself, I would be there every Saturday sitting in the library reading books.  Folks thought I was strange, but so I was there.  It was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you read science related books or did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, almost exclusively.  I didn't read a whole heck of a lot of fiction.  And the fiction I read were just science reads, the kind of Buck Rogers stuff that was out there.  But I tended to and I still do gravitate towards non-fiction.  What I discovered early on is that there's so much to know and the world is so complicated and so unexplained in some ways.  I mean mysterious is the wrong word.  There's nothing mysterious it's just we don't understand.  It's so complicated that there's no need to look at fiction cause the facts are so weird that you should spend your time trying to find out what's really going on.  And the best science fiction writers for example Ray Bradbury who did 'The Martian Chronicles' was a scientist in some sense.  He really understood what was going on.  Arthur C. Clark, another one who was one of the great science fiction writers certainly then, probably now, wrote these books that were based in science and if you really wanted to get a sense of what was going on you had to understand the science.  So that was, even the, these fanciful things would drive if you were curious, the kids towards the science and it was interesting.  I mean I read some fiction cause you had to in school but it was the science that was the stuff that I read on my own.
Speaker 1: Now was--
Speaker 2: Under the covers at night with flashlights and all.  I'm supposed to be in bed, it's midnight and I'm reading a book.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 21979
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were about ten I guess when Sputnik [first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union] was launched [in 1957] or something like that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and I took advantage of the National Defense Student Loan Program and it was great.  Actually there were four things, probably three things I would say actually I aspired to be when I was growing up.  The first one was a scientist, second was an astronaut and third was a diplomat and I got to sort of look at all three.  And the space program was great.  I remember when President Kennedy, and I was gees, I guess in junior high school so to proclaim they were going to send in a man to the moon, that was a big deal.  And it sort of coupled a lot of the interest I had in science and the fact that you know one of the things that the kids did when they were reading the science and I would read astronomy.  You'd sort of read about the universe to the extent we actually knew what it was.  Now it turns out those books were really antique and quaint because it was cutting edge then.  It's almost completely wrong now.  Those things were just fascinating because you see them or you could get a telescope.  You could get a telescope for ten bucks and you could see that stuff, it's amazing.  You--entomology was another one.  You could actually go and walk around, you could see the leaves, you could--that's the kind of stuff that connected through reality in a major, major way.  You could try to figure out why when you jumped into a pool things splashed.  Very complicated it turns out and even now.  But it--that's the kind of stuff that sort of drove my interest cause it was real.  It was the kind of stuff you could do everyday and do yourself and then you want to learn about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any particular teachers in grade school that you know peaked your interest about science or helped you out?
Speaker 2: The, I would have to say the most influential teacher I had in grade school was my mother.  She would let me do all sorts of stuff.  I would go and this was New York back in the day.  So you get on a subway and it would cost five cents and I would go down to areas around Greenwich Village and they would be the chemical supply houses okay.  So I would be able to go and having read a book on rockets where you get potassium permanganate and some sulfur and some other stuff and build these little rockets.  And I would shoot them off from the fire escape in the building which was (unclear) shooting fire as a--that's a detail.  And my mother would facilitate that.  I mean she thought it was really kind of cool.  She would help me sort of read some of the things I didn't really understand, understand what the formulas were.  I mean that was the real catalyst of--in school, not so much cause how much time do the kids spend in school?  I mean I don't think kids spent a lot of time in the school then.  We didn't spend a lot of time in school.  We spent much more time at home and with our peers and the idea was to integrate family into the schools and not the other way around.  So the teachers, I had some wonderful teachers.  I don't really remember them.  I just remember the stuff that I did and the influence that my family had on helping me do that stuff.
Speaker 1: Now what about the media, were you influenced, did you watch science programs on televisions and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well back in the old days they had these little boxes that were black and white, right?  And there was some science stuff but given the way I grew up, we got to watch TV on Saturday mornings only.  I mean there was no TV during the week at all.  You came home, you did your homework, that was it.  You might, during the nice days go out and play ball or something like that you know in the street or play marbles, but you didn't spend any time in front of a TV.  I mean you were--the TV treat in this little black and white tube was Saturday mornings, period.  So we saw some, but not very many.  I mean maybe the Buck Rogers stuff and they weren't--you know there weren't many science programs on the TV then.  The most interesting science program I remember was not a science program but a news program which was televising the hurricane that hit New York, I think it was in 1957.  You know it was an incredible hurricane and that was showing the waves splashing up.  We got to watch that cause it was a big deal.  But school was closed and nobody was going anywhere.  But other than that I don't remember much about watching TV cause we hardly watched TV at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21980
Speaker 1: Well and you said in the summers you'd go down south and you did a--
Speaker 2: Only a couple of summers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, only a couple?
Speaker 2: Couple of summers yeah, because it was--we didn't want to do that anymore.  So, one of the things that we started doing, my father had these small, they were called candy stores now they're little grocery stores, bodegas and we would work for my father during the summer and play ball.  And I would run track.  I did some AU track and things like that and that's what we did during the summers in general.  We were in a drum and bugle corps, my brother and I, Order of the Feather, a little fraternity would help keep kids off the street that was organized not very far from Yankee Stadium through a church group.  Actually it was one of these things that you know kept the kids off the street so we didn't--and there was a chorus, the Order of the Feather Chorus.  We actually recorded a couple of albums.  It was that kind of stuff during the summer that really kept us occupied, but hanging out in my father's store.
Story_ID: 21981
Speaker 1: Now how did your, now he came back from the war and he had not established a store yet I suppose right till he came back?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And how did he get started with the store?
Speaker 2: I saw my birth certificate and my father's occupation on the birth certificate was an unemployed presser.  He was unemployed and he was working in Chinese laundries that were around the corner just pressing shirts and stuff like that cause he only had a high school degree.  But he had a lot of entrepreneurial interests so he saved up money and he bought a store half a block from where we were living, just on the other side of the street on Union Avenue.  And he was in a partnership with a guy and they did okay.  I mean it wasn't great business but he learned the business then and I think he probably started working there and bought a piece of the business and then finally owned the business and then he moved the business through a bigger store on Prospect Avenue, actually not very far from where we went to junior high school, Walter J. Damrosch Junior High School and that's where he spent most of his time.  Then he also was able to open a restaurant across the street from that store but it was organic.  I mean he started saving up a couple of bucks.  He wanted to do this.  He had an opportunity to help this guy in the neighborhood store, took that opportunity, bought the business and then you know went on from there.  Never a big business, he never had more than two or three people working for him but you know it was his business and he worked.  He worked.  He'd get there and open it up at five o'clock in the morning and wouldn't close it till midnight, seven days a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's work.  That's work.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So we were welcome hands even though you know we were basically screw ups, we were still--we could still stack boxes and do that kind of stuff and that's what we did.  That was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you mentioned about Yankee Stadium and I know the Yankees played in the Bronx.  Were you close to Yankee Stadium?
Speaker 2: Close.  It was a half an hour walk from the house so we'd walk to Yankee Stadium.  I remember being able to sneak in to see some games every now and then.  But also the Order of the Feather was organized in a church.  I can't, I was trying to remember the name of the church.  I can't remember it but very close to Yankee Stadium.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we did drum and bugle corps there and the chorus there and the sort of fraternal groups there.  It was interesting growing up but it was really stuff to keep the kids off the streets.
Story_ID: 21982
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you went to middle school right or junior high school?
Speaker 2: It was junior high school.
Speaker 1: Junior high school, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, before they invented middle school.  This is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, I think junior high school was 7th, 8th and 9th grades, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was that?
Speaker 2: It was in the Bronx.  I could walk to it from the house.  It was a new junior high school, Walter j. Damrosch Junior High School.  They had just opened it up the year I went in.
Speaker 1: Walter J.--
Speaker 2: J. Damrosch.  Damrosch was a--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Damrosch?
Speaker 2: D-A-M-R-O-S-C-H, I think.  He was a major American composer so it was a music oriented middle school.  It seemed like a natural fit, we all played in bands.  Everybody who played a musical instrument we went there and it was a music emphasis at that junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were playing a clarinet you said and a--?
Speaker 2: Played clarinet, played trumpet, the soprano horn which is a single valve horn.  That was sort of drum and bugle corps kind of stuff.  I played the clarinet a lot.  I thought I was good.
Story_ID: 21983
Speaker 1: All right, Walter J. Damrosch Junior High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now were there any special teachers there that you remember that are kind of like a mentor or guide or something?
Speaker 2: I'd like to say that I stopped learning when I was in fourth grade and didn't learn anything until I was in graduate school.  I mean it's not, it's a huge exaggeration but really the teachers that I had significant interaction with tended not to be teachers, they were track coaches, okay, I ran track.  They tended to be sort of a band director.  Some names I can't even remember.  I mean I, if some--their faces stick but the names didn't.  Where I learned the passion for learning and where I kept the passing for learning was through myself.  I learned as I said going to the Donnelly library in the city, learning at home, doing the experiments.  But the teachers that I had were good teachers but they didn't make enormous impressions on me.  My classmates on the other hand, I mean they were sort of great.  I remember a lot of them.  Rory Jones who really worked with me on some science fair projects, things like that.  But the teachers were guides.  They weren't mentors in that sense.  I mean it's just, it was a different kind of thing.
Story_ID: 21984
Speaker 1: So you ran track in junior high school too?
Speaker 2: I ran track when I was, from the time I was a little kid through college.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your specialty?
Speaker 2: I ran everything that they would let me run.  I ran from the 40 yard dash up into cross country.  My best was probably, was 440 then, 400 meter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there was a guy that you might have heard of who I ran against from the time I was basically in fourth grade through college, that was John Carlos.  John Carlos and I grew up in the same neighborhood and John won the bronze medal in 200 meters in--no silver medal in 200 meters in the '68 [1968] Olympics.  And he was one of the two guys did the Black Power salute--
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: --left hand, hand glove.  John and I go back to when we were babies and he had an influence on me just because we were, we ran together mostly every week almost from the time we were little kids until we went off to college.  And that was an interesting interaction.  That was an important interaction cause John was an incredibly sensible guy who really just lived well.  You know he went to, he actually went to Brooklyn Automotive Trades when he went to high school and I went to Theodore Roosevelt.  But we would see each other in this AAU meets and on the weekends and stuff and those kind of interactions were incredibly important to me when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: And we've interviewed John Carlos and he was out in Palm Springs I think.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah he's, when he got out of the Olympics he actually couldn't get a job you know cause it was a, they wouldn't hire him.  But he, I think he played a little bit for the Eagles.  I guess he was a wide receiver for the Eagles.  He was fast but he had rotten hands (unclear) but talk about a wonderful guy.  I saw him last, at Delaware State, he came and talked to, at one of our athletics banquets.  It just--but those are the kind of people that really made an impression on me.  It wasn't, there wasn't so much the school but it was all the things around the school.
Speaker 1: Well who else, any other students?  You said Roy Jones was a, went to school with you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm trying to think of other folks that really stuck who did things.  My brother of course, he and I were really super close, went to school together.  We separated out in different classes in junior high school--
Story_ID: 21985
Speaker 1: What's your brother's name?  I don't think we asked you.
Speaker 2: Albert.
Speaker 1: Albert.
Speaker 2: Albert Earl Sessoms, Jr.  He came out first.  He got the junior and they, what could I do?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what was your, you said your brother was drawn to uniforms.  He wanted to be in, a fireman or in the military?
Speaker 2: Policeman, yeah the military yeah.  He ended up actually going to the military and that's an interesting story.  My father was a, shall we say, he--when it was his house, it was his house.  He made the rules.  So my brother and I were graduating high school and we went to a party.  I think we went to a party in Brooklyn.  And my father said you got to be home at midnight.  So at about 11 o'clock we're taking the subway, I said now I'm leaving.  We got to get back by midnight and my brother said well you know I think I'm going to hang out a little longer.  I said you know daddy said we got to be home by midnight.  You really want to get out of here and be home by midnight.  He said, well I'll see you.  So I got home, got there, I guess maybe quarter or 12 or something like that, and that was fine you know went in and my brother got in about 12:30.  Well my father was actually waiting for him.  My--when I described the apartment, the bathroom was at the end near the door, at the end of the long corridor and then there was the front door.  My father was sitting in the bathtub, all soaped up waiting for my brother to come in.  So my brother opens the door and my father leaps out of the bathtub and takes off after my brother.  My brother sees this completely naked, soapy guy coming at him and he takes off down the stairs.  He just four story walk up, he just bolted out of this place.  And my father then chased him out of the apartment building and then when he got to he street he heard somebody shriek cause he was, everybody was out, he realized that he was naked.  So went back up to the apartment.  It was hysterical.  Anyway, that night my brother stayed with a neighbor on the third floor.  The next day he enrolled in the air force, next day.
Speaker 1: Didn't come back.
Speaker 2: He enrolled in the air force and spent twenty plus years in the air force, loved it.  I mean he had a ball.  But that was an interesting story.  That's the way my brother got his real uniform.  But he went to Aviation Trades High School and he was in the, I can't remember what the high school equivalent of the National Guard, Air National Guard.  So he was always into that and he really had a good time doing it in high school as well and you know then he went into the military by accident and he never looked back.  It was an interesting time.
Speaker 1: Now did your brother run track too?  Did he--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he ran track.  That's why he got away but he wasn't quite as consistent as I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21986
Speaker 1: Now in high school, now what was the name of your high school?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Theodore Roosevelt High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, Theodore Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, up in the northern part of the Bronx not very far from the Bronx Zoon on Fordham Road across from Fordham University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Theodore Roosevelt High School, now did it have a science orientation at all or--?
Speaker 2: It was a strong academic orientation.  It was one of these schools that was sort of a typical New York High School and the strong academic high school as it had strong science, strong arts you know the band and all this kind of stuff, strong athletics which is one of the things that was interesting about it, very integrated.  I mean most of the students most of the kids in my class were Jewish kids.  They had what was then the equivalent of advanced placement courses but they didn't, there were no AP courses then.  So we just--you know I took calculus in high school back in the day so--
Speaker 1: That's significant because there are many people we've interviewed that went on to become physicists that didn't get it until they left high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I got it in high school and the classes were outstanding, taught by people who were mathematicians and that was very positive.  I mean proximity to Fordham University helped.  I mean literally it was across the street and it was a really good experience, academic experience that I really found very positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you ran track in high school too?
Speaker 2: Yep, I ran track in high school.
Speaker 1: Now did you play ball at all or any basketball, baseball?
Speaker 2: No I didn't play basketball again.  I--studying science, being a crazed science kid outside and running track was about all I could do.  And I was in the drum and bugle corps at the Order of Feather, so we did that drum and bugle corps on the weekends and some during the summer so that was enough.  I played ball but I didn't play on an organized team.  Everybody played ball in the Bronx but you know I wasn't going to be Sam Jones. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Very few of us can be Sam Jones.
Speaker 2: That's for sure.
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever saw him miss a shot.
Speaker 2: And so I knew that you know as long as there were Sam Joneses around, I should run track.
Speaker 1: Now was he from your, from the Bronx?
Speaker 2: No, no he was from around here.
Speaker 1: He's--okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was one of these guys who everybody knew about.  You know there were some folks who just were--Kareem Abdul Jabbar [born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor, Jr., retired American professional basketball player] was another one, these guys went to Power (unclear) high school in the Bronx.  I mean when you take a look at those folks, you know you pick what you do?  You know you don't want to waste too much time.  I mean it's nice to play but you want to have some significance, success.  And there were some, in the Bronx in those days and probably still now, there were some incredibly athletes you know coming out in basketball and track.  You know John Carlos is one, there were some others.  Chamberlain [Wilton Norman "Wilt" Chamberlain, former American basketball player] was playing then.  I can't remember where he was playing.  He went to Kansas.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then, but you had these other guys coming around New York which was extraordinary.  I mean just, so yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you took, so you had physics in high school too I imagine?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, I took physics the entire time.  I can't, in fact I don't think there was any year that I didn't take physics.
Speaker 1: So four years of physics.
Speaker 2: Well it was only three years in high school.
Speaker 1: Three, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah 10th, 11th and 12th.
Speaker 1: Three, that is something because that--
Speaker 2: Yeah they had those programs and when I graduated high school there were four thousand students in my high school in Theodore Roosevelt High School.  In my graduating class I think the number was around 850, 900, something like that and 85 percent had regent scholarships.  You know the highest level you got a regent's diploma and a regent scholarship to go to college in New York.  When I went back, when I was president of the (unclear) College I went back and I was the graduation speaker at Theodore Roosevelt High School.  It must have been around 1997, '98 [1998].  There were still 4,000 kids in the class in the school, there were 114 in the graduating class and three got regents scholarships and they thought that was a major success.  It just, the way urban education went it just plummeted.  But the school is the same size.  What's surprising is that the, some of the folks, my track coach was still there, you know and some of the others.  The assistant principals were still there and the school just failed.  It was just of extraordinary.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: But it was a, when I went there it was an exceptional high school with a very diverse population.  You know I mean just Jewish, Latinos, African-Americans, it just--and everybody--it was just sort of a magnet school. Everybody just got on the subway and went there.  We had bus passes and subway passes and we just went.  It was an hour each way and you just did it.
Story_ID: 21987
Speaker 1: Does it have the same student mix now, I mean population?
Speaker 2: The student mix now from what I remember when I was there was mostly Latino and that was a shift in the demographic of the neighborhood around there and some African American and Caribbean.  But I--the Jewish students, the white students weren't there which surprised me but I don't know what happened.  But I know, there was an ethos change and also New York City's schools were going down.  They're coming back up, I mean there's significant changes now but still the same 4,000 kids in the same building and have 15 percent the number of graduates didn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense.  Sorry about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you think it's, has more to do with the neighborhood than it does with the school itself or what?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a neighborhood school it was a city wide school.  In New York, you can go to any school you want.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know what it is.  But when I talked to them, the folks who were running the school they were saying well you should have seen it before.  This is an improvement.  So I don't know, I think something happened.  Something happened after Vietnam that sort of changed all the schools in the city.  So you have some spectacular schools like Bronx Science and Stiverson, Brooklyn Tech and a few others that maintained very strong academic standards.  I think what happened was they just sort of tried to get kids out of school, trying not to hold them back, just get them out.  There was all sorts of social promotions and that's what happened.  That's what happened.  And also you get a very different language mix.  You have a significant immigrant population with a, they speak a different language at home and the teachers can't handle that cause they're not trained to it.  So you go to a school with 20 different languages spoken and you have these teachers in the schools, they don't quite know how to manage.  So they spend more of time with crowd control than teaching.  And when I went to school it was English.  I mean nobody else spoke--so you spoke English, that was it.  Everybody spoke English at home that was the end of the story.  And so even when we had some Russian kids in the schools, Russian immigrant families, they were, the Russian-Jewish immigrant families, they spoke English at home.  You know that's what they, that's what the parents did, they spoke English at home.  They wanted to assimilate very quickly and so everybody managed it so they didn't have to focus on this other kind of stuff.  They focused really on the education of the kids not on the social issues surrounding that.  And there was a very broad spectrum of economic backgrounds in the school but everybody wore a jacket and tie to school.  I never went from the time I was in elementary school till the time I was in college went to class without a jacket and tie on which is interesting.  That's not true anymore.  There was a discipline there that was really quite interesting.  I think that's one of the things that hanged since the discipline changed.  Everybody started making excuses.  I wouldn't be able to go out of the house without basically a white tie--white shirt on and a tie and a jacket going to school, period.  Didn't matter what the weather was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a difference.
Speaker 1: Was that a required outfit in the school?
Speaker 2: It was a required outfit in the schools and everybody wore it.  But it was not a uniform.  You could wear whatever you want.  It was, had to be a clean shirt and tie and a jacket.
Speaker 1: And a jacket?
Speaker 2: And a jacket.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 21988
Speaker 1: So are there any special teachers or counselors at Theodore Roosevelt [High School]?
Speaker 2: There was a guy who, gees, I'm trying to remember his name.  It was like, I was trying to resurrect his name cause he was actually a very--graduated from Union College which is why I went to Union College.  I couldn't find his name.  I might be able to resurrect it but I've been laboring over this for about a week and I haven't been able to pull his name up.  He, when I was thinking about going to college he said well you know you really should apply to Union College.  I never heard of Union College.  I mean it's in Schenectady, New York.  It's a science and tech school, private, been around since 1791 but it was all white, never heard of it.  So he said well you know you should apply, it's a good school.  He said I went to Union College and I said okay.  So I applied.  That's why I applied to Union College.  I applied to a bunch of other places, why not apply to Union College and that worked out pretty well.  They offered me a bunch of money.  I got--there was a National Defense Student Loan opportunity there cause after Sputnik you know there was lots of federal money flowing around going to science and technology, and that's what I did.  I just can't remember his name.  I remember his face like yesterday but I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: That's decent counseling.  We've heard so many bad counseling stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was extraordinary.  He said this is what you should do.  It's an exceptional school.  So when I went there, he was right.  I had a great time at Union.  It was an exceptional science and tech school, there were four blacks in a class.  Now it wasn't--but it was such a welcoming environment it really didn't make much difference.  I mean it just worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Worked very well.
Speaker 1: So now did you--how were your grades in high school?  Did you graduate with honors or anything or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean I did all right.  I don't have a report card but yeah, I graduated being the top of the class.  You know I had a regents diploma, regents scholarship.  You know it's just, it was standard stuff.  If you didn't, people wondered about you.  I mean 85 percent of your class had this.  What is wrong with you if you didn't have one?  So yeah, I got some academic money, academic scholarships to go like--I was the salutatorian of the graduating class.  So yeah, so I, you know I did okay.  And I remember even the speech I gave but what's interesting is that they had a valedictorian and salutatorian and they're you know the top couple of kids.  Then you flip the coin to figure out who is going to be one or the other and that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was almost before time actually.
Speaker 1: Theodore Roosevelt High School.
Speaker 2: 1964.
Story_ID: 21989
Speaker 1: You told me what you did over the summer but I forgot now.  Between the summer and Union [College, Schenectady, New York]?
Speaker 2: Between the summer and Union actually I worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory doing science.
Speaker 1: Now how did you arrange that?  Now how was that arranged?
Speaker 2: The Department of Energy ran Brookhaven National Laboratory for--this is back in (unclear) for high achieving kids and the schools had these programs.  And they would bring them out during the summer and you could work on science projects at the National Laboratories.  They had them all over the country so Brookhaven was out on Long Island so I said well that's pretty good.  So I applied for it and got it.  And they gave you a stipend you know and you took care of the room and board and all this other kind of stuff.  And I worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory for a guy named Bob Adair [Robert Kemp Adair] and another guy named Larry Leipuner [Lawrence B. Leipuner].  Bob Adair was a senior professor at Yale, A-D-A-I-R, and he's the guy who wrote, he wrote the first book called 'The Physics of Baseball'.  I mean he's a fabulous guy.  And the guy was Larry Leipuner, L-E-I-P-U-N-E-R, who was a Brookhaven guy who sort of ran the Brookhaven end of the experiment.  So I went and worked with these guys over the summer, between my senior year and going to college.
Story_ID: 21990
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now how did you like Union [College], up in Schenectady, New York?  That's upstate New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in the snow belt.  It snowed every year on Mother's Day.  I thought Union was fabulous.  I really enjoyed it enormously, enormous.  I had a very, very, very good time at Union.  I found the education to be exceptional.  I found the people to be really gracious and accepting.  It was a three hour bus ride from New York so it was no big deal, but the weather was awful.  The weather was absolutely rotten.  But what--it's a national university and liberal arts college now.  But it also included the Albany College of Pharmacy, Albany Medical School and the Dudley and Fitz Observatory so it was actually a pretty broadly based university called Union University.  And it had a significant history in the sciences, especially in physics.  So they were well equipped to deal with these kids who came in, bright kids came in from all over the country to study in science and engineering.  It was an all male college then.  It's gotten a lot better since they let women in.  The quality of the student body has increased enormously but when I was there it was all male.  And there was a lot of camaraderie.  I found places, fraternity called Beta Theta Pi.  I de-pledged cause it was getting in the way of athletics cause I was running track at the same time but it was an experience, it was very positive.  I didn't have any negative experiences at all actually doing it.  And what was interesting, I mean it was an all white school basically, I had grown up in the South Bronx at Fort Apache.  I had never, although I saw it around me, never seen or experienced particularly close up, people using drugs.  The first time I actually smelled marijuana was in my senior year at Union, came in with the freshman class when I graduated.  So I mean it was a clean space, it was a clean environment.  There was a lot of this kind of fraternity drinking and stuff but I was a jock, I didn't, I'd never--I had one beer the entire time I was in college.  So it was a non--environment that was very positive and reinforcing.  I had some great faculty members.  There I remember some like Walter Pilcher, P-I-L-C-H-E-R.  He was a physics professor, recently passed actually who was just an extraordinary scientist and a, just a welcoming person.  He really just opened his arms to everybody.
Speaker 1: McPherson you said?
Speaker 2: No, Pilcher, Walter Pilcher, P-I-L--
Speaker 1: Pilcher, Walter Pilcher.
Speaker 2: P-I-L-C-H-E-R.
Speaker 1: Two Walters oh yeah well Walter Pilcher--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I got him and then I thought you named another one.
Speaker 2: No, he was the only one I named, but he was one of these guys who just was exceptionally positive and very, very kind of gracious and welcoming.  There were lots of others around there who were exceptional in their fields and I was able to take courses in Russian history and art and in music and in engineering that were just the best, I mean tops.  And when I graduated from Union I could go anywhere in the country.  So it was good.
Speaker 1: What did you take languages?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took German.  In the sciences back in the day you needed to know German to read cause you know a lot of the original papers were published in German.  So I took German just to take it and it was useful.  I mean I found German useful.  I still use it actually but I also lived in Vienna and I mean, so yeah.
Story_ID: 21991
Speaker 1: Now did you--there very many other black students at Union [College, Schenectady, New York]?
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: There were four of you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Four, okay.
Speaker 2: And I bumped into one guy just on the street a few weeks ago, hadn't seen him since we graduated 1968, it was very funny.  But yeah, there were just four of us in the entering class.  When we entered, there was nobody else. There was a guy named Jim Jones.  Jim Jones, he was a football player, Jim Jones.  He was a football player.  He got into Cornell and Cornell since he was a football player said well you got to go to the College of Agriculture.  He said what are you talking about?  Because Cornell was a land grant university and everything.  So he said I'm not going to study agriculture, I want to study physics so they wouldn't let him so he said later for you and came to Union.  So he was one of the stars of the Division 3 football team.  He was really a great guy.  That, I mean the environment was just like that.  I ran track four years, did pretty well, couple of letters, made some records I mean it was a good environment.  It was all male though so we spent time at Skidmore College and Vassar College, sneaked down to Boston you know get to Radcliffe every now and then cause you had to have something besides these funny looking guys (unclear).  But it was--and Russell Sage over in Troy.  But it was--as a collegiate environment it was really kind of reinforcing and positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you're majoring in physics at Union, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now I neglected to ask you why you picked physics as a major?
Speaker 2: When I was a freshman I, they had gave me an introductory for this course and the introductory physics course, I can't remember what it was.  It was some course that everybody was supposed to be taking, but I didn't think it was particularly interesting and the teacher was not particularly great so I didn't pay much attention to it.  So, first exam that came up, I was thinking about being a five year biomedical engineer there.  They--you'll end up with a masters degree.  So I took this exam, this multiple choice exam and I read it and I hadn't studied.  I didn't know what the heck was going on.  I did not, I didn't even know how to understand the questions so it was a multiple choice exam, so I would go and guess one number then take the average of another number and put that number down.  And I would just--it didn't, I finished the exam in probably twenty minutes.  I just went through, didn't even read the questions, just made up the numbers.  I shouldn't admit this in public, made up the numbers, handed in the paper and walked out.  The faculty member (unclear) you sure you finished?  I said, yeah you know I did the exam and I'm out.  I got an A minus on the exam.  That's when I decided to be a physics major.  I just flipped.  I said if I can do this I can do anything.  So I flipped.  I flipped to physics.  Yeah that's, that was it.  It was funny.  (Laughter).  I still remember that, I mean an A minus?  I hadn't even read the questions.  It was great.  So don't ever give multiple choice exams.  Yeah that's a, the story behind that one.  But it was a positive choice.  I mean I knew the physics.  I just, I thought the course was boring.  What--the science wasn't hard.
Story_ID: 21992
Speaker 1: Now did you have any heroes in physics or science at that time, people you really thought had made a major contribution to you know world knowledge?
Speaker 2: I had read a bunch of books in physics.  They were all dealing with theoretical physics.  That's what people extol the virtues of, you know Niels Bohr [Niels Henrik David Bohr, Danish physicist], Walter Schrodinger [ph.], Albert Einstein [German physicist, I mean those are the biggies.  I don't, didn't do heroes.  I mean I would say that in my life I've had one hero and that's my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just cause he had the guts to do what he did.  Even now I don't do heroes.  I mean folks are okay, they're doing stuff but never anybody who does anything on their own.  Every hero has a army in back of them, you know it's just having done stuff, nobody does anything on their own.  So I don't sort of do the hero thing.  I don't really want to emulate anybody.  So no, but I--there were--the circle of intellect around the physics that I was doing was so incredibly exciting that that's what fascinated me.  It wasn't any particular person it was the intellectual energy around then.  It was the excitement around it.  It was a kind of getting to understand something that nobody thought was possible to understand and coming out with stuff even if it didn't make any sense that seems to work.  I mean the quantum theory for example doesn't make any sense.  If you take a look at it, you can do all these calculations but nobody really gets why this stuff is in fact the case.  But when you measure it, it's there.  I mean it seems to be consistent with reality.  Nobody has any idea why so that's part of the excitement.  It's the ability to take a look at something that nobody thought anybody could understand and as humans understand it.  It's amazing.  It's just amazing.  And that's, that was the excitement of physics.
Story_ID: 21993
Speaker 1: All right, so Union College [Schenectady, New York], now you were at Union College when, in '68 [1968] when Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr., born Michael Luther King, Jr., American clergyman, activist and civil rights leader] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what--how did that particularly--do you remember what you were doing when you heard about it or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I was walking across campus and it was, I mean it was stunning.  What I remember was a feeling of bewilderment basically.  We're trying to figure out--cause there were only, you know there were very few of us on campus.  We're trying to figure out what the hell was going on.  And my roommate was a guy from Maryland who I still insist was a redneck who didn't think it was a big deal at all.  He said well you know this guy was just a rabble rouser, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I looked at him straight in the face and I said yeah, but he was your rabble rouser, he was my rabble rouser and if it wasn't for him you probably would be able to be successful even though you're a redneck from Maryland.  And certainly I mean he transformed the landscape for a lot of people.  So I, we were just sitting there trying to figure out what the hell to do, I mean just kind of like what is it this about?  Why would somebody do this?  It was an interesting time.  But '68 [1968] was such a turbulent time you know cause we lost Bobby Kennedy [Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy, former American politician, civil rights activist] in '68 [1968]. We lost Jack Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the United States] in '63 [1963].  People were just saying what the hell is going on here?  I mean there was Vietnam [war] and people got killed at Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] and we were just saying, this doesn't make any damn sense.  When people talk about the 60s [1960s], I remember that day when King got killed as sort of the pinnacle of the reason why nobody should ever want to be in the 60s [1960s] again.  I think the 60s [1960s] were the worst time in America, worst time in America.  You had this damn war.  You lost a president that was extraordinary.  You lost Bobby Kennedy who was one of the champions of civil rights and human rights and then they killed Martin Luther King and you were saying what the hell is going on?  That was, it was almost like that, like what the hell is going on here?  Can't you trust anybody?  It was awful.  It was awful.
Speaker 1: Was there anything special done on campus to commemorate Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean we had a memorial service but that was basically it.  It was a small, low key thing cause, it was '68 [1968] and to be perfectly frank, nobody knew what the hell was going on.  There was a feeling everybody had a draft number you know.  There was a feeling that you know even the guys who wanted to make sense of this damn war in Vietnam was getting shot up.  My draft number was at the point that I could have gotten sucked into this damn thing instantaneously cause it was a, one of these low numbers.  And you just wondered you know does this make any sense?  Should we all just blow this place?  I mean does it--are we losing the strands of society that were making us care about this place again?  I mean it was hard.  It was just very confused.  Nothing happened of significance in Schenectady you know, but you know you had the riots in D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] and the riots in Watts [Watts Riots; six-day riots in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in August 1965].  Those ended up being catastrophic events, catastrophic events.  What we saw was an unraveling of society and we just didn't know what the hell to do about it.  I mean we just--what do you do?  You're twenty, twenty-one years old, you don't know what the hell to do but you knew you had to do something.  It just wasn't clear what.  There was, it was awful.  That was an awful, awful time.
Story_ID: 21994
Speaker 1: So did you graduate [from Union College, Schenectady, New York] in, was it May of that year [1968] or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--well the graduating ceremony was in May, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a degree in physics with honors and yeah, and my experience--I found Schenectady [New York] to be a wonderful place and found the Union College [Schenectady] to be fabulous.  I mean I just--the price was right then.  You know it was a private school.  It was three thousand bucks a year.  Now it's 56,000 dollars a year.  It's kind of crazy.  But it was a place that prepared me for what I was going to do next and what I was going to do next was get off the east coast.  It snowed every single year on Mother's Day.  Now Mother's Day is in May, not--I said there's no way I'm going to stay in Schenectady or anywhere around here.  I'm going to get as far away as possible from the east coast so I went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] for graduate school.  I mean I got into a lot of places but I said okay this is the farthest I can get away in the contiguous United States.  I'm done.  I'm gone.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a connection you know through Union [College, Schenectady, New York] you know to University of Washington or was it recommended by someone?
Speaker 2: It was recommended by Pilcher.  He thought it was a great school.  I was interested in nuclear physics.  I did, I--with Walter Pilcher I wrote a senior thesis which was theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and there was a guy at the University of Washington named Ernie Henley, Ernest Henley, E-R-N-E-S-T H-E-N-L-E-Y, who was one of the best theoretical nuclear physicists in the world actually.  I think Ernie was Austrian, spoke with a just wonderful accent and there was another guy out there named Lowell Brown, L-O-W-E-L-L Brown.  He was at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and just didn't get tenure there so he went out to the University of Washington.  He became a pillar in that place, ended up doing some interesting theoretical physics.  So Pilcher knew those guys, wrote a strong letter and they said yeah and they gave me this gigantic graduate fellowship and it was not Schenectady, New York, it was a big city, a wonderful city.  I mean Seattle is just a wonderful city.  And I just went, yeah I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21995
Speaker 1: All right, well University of Washington in Seattle, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A different climate and you liked it better than snow I guess right?
Speaker 2: It never snows in Seattle or hardly ever.  It was drizzling all the time except in the summer it was just glorious.  But the rain comes in all directions, right and so you don't wear, carry an umbrella cause it's useless and you have your picnics in the rain but you just wear dry, you know rubberized clothes.  It was fun, I had a good time.  It's a beautiful place and University of Washington is one of the, the great unsung universities in the world.  It's an extraordinary place.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: So you were concentrating on theoretical nuclear physics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went out there to study theoretical nuclear physics.  When I got there and I was able to work with Ernie Henley [Ernest Henley] actually right away which was an enormous amount of fun.  And I did okay.  I mean I actually got a masters degree in a year, wrote a thesis.
Story_ID: 21996
Speaker 1: One year (simultaneous) [Sessoms earned has mater's degree in theoretical nuclear physics in one year from the University of Washington], that's pretty fast isn't it?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I had to 'cause I was talking to a couple of folks at the department and there was a guy named McDermott whose name I can't remember, the first name I can't remember but he was chair of the department.  And I said, I was migrating towards particle physics, you know on the big machines because nuclear physics--yeah, if I said you know I was doing impact approximations, I said if I can do this stuff then it can't be very hard.  I want to do something that's really hard or more interesting.  And he said well if you want to do physics you should got to the east coast cause that's where the action is cause that's where Brookhaven National Laboratory [Upton, New York] was.  They were thinking about, actually in the process of building Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory] in the, in Chicago [Illinois].  Big schools were on the east coast.  He said you know if you really want to--and Seattle is in the middle of you know the west but it's just not close to anything.  So he said if you want to really do this kind of physics, you really should head back to the east coast.  So that's when I picked up the phone and talked to Bob Adair who I had met and he never understood why--he said why didn't you apply to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?  I said because I wanted to get away from the east coast.  He said well that doesn't make any sense.  Why don't you just come back here?  So I went back to Yale and they gave me a bunch of money.
Story_ID: 21997
Speaker 1: These folks [at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] were extraordinarily supportive and solicitous.  They didn't know me from a poster on, in the metro you know but they understood you got this young black kid who's smart and wants to do this stuff and he's really focused on it.  Why not?  And they were all some of the best scientists in the world and it didn't matter what you looked like.  They were just going for the talent and it was just an interesting environment.  Same thing at Union [College, Schenectady, New York], they didn't really care.  I mean they liked the demographic from New York but four of us was not exactly going to change the complexion of the place.  But when we got there, it didn't matter.  It really didn't matter.  So it--my experience has been maybe different than a lot of folks.  I have found in the environment, whatever environment in which I was embedded, incredibly supportive people who insisted that the only thing that mattered was merit and they stopped looking at what you look like.  And I learned that from my parents [Lottie Beatrice Leff and Albert Earl Sessoms] which is why when I come to a place in the South for example, when I saw people being treated differently because of the way they look, the color of their skin, I just find it absurd.  You know I don't need to put up with this crap, nobody needs to.  That's when I understood my father.  Nobody needs to put up with that crap.  If you want it, you can keep it.  I'm out of here.  And it's not important enough to change either.  You got to go change it by what you do, not by marching, not by fighting.  I mean Martin Luther King did some extraordinary things but he changed it by what he did.  He changed it by who he was cause a lot of folks that led marches, they wouldn't have got anywhere.  I mean what--he changed it by who he was.  He changed it by the, by bringing a message that people could understand.  He changed it by being Martin Luther King, Jr.  I mean that's what he did and that's the way you change things.  So--but you can't--he didn't do any of that alone.  How many people did he have behind him, tens of thousands, okay?  And there was a lot of money there but a lot of it was white money, a lot of it's Jewish money, Quaker money, Presbyterian, Protestant money.  They were there.  They saw what was right and they saw a guy who could help them achieve their goals.  And that's where the mutually supportive piece comes in.  So when I look at this whole business of race in America and race in society, I don't really get it because none of us are going to succeed without everybody else.  And if you could find folks who are supportive or they find you which has been my good fortune, doesn't matter what you look like, comes out okay.
Story_ID: 21998
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], 1969--
Speaker 2: Nine, got there in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Nine?  Seven--'69 [1969], fall of '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Got there in fall of '69 [1969] and when I got there Bobby Seale [Robert George "Bobby" Seale", activist, co-founder of the Black Panther Party] was on trial.  My first day in New Haven, Bobby Seale goes on trial.  And I'm saying, wait a minute here.  So I show up, this tear gas wafting through the street and they asked me whether I could go and help calm the crowds?  I said look, okay I'm a graduate student, I've been here one day.  I don't even know how to get around New Haven.  They gave me a flashlight.  They gave me a bullet proof vest.  We walked around.  It was an interesting introduction to New Haven.  That was a fascinating time. But that was also an aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King.  I mean that was just, there was turbulence everywhere.  It was just, it was extraordinary.  It was just--
Speaker 1: Now when you went to Yale cause this is right after the riots of '68 [1968].  When Dr. King is killed there are riots all over in the urban--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --neighborhoods, D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] especially, Chicago [Illinois], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There was changes, there were changes in policy in corporations and universities and they brought in more blacks than ever before.  Was that true at Yale in terms of the students?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Did they bring in more than they ever had before or was it a--?
Speaker 2: Nope.  It didn't make any difference I mean from what I could see.  I got to Yale because of Bob Adair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that was it.  When I got to Yale as I recall, at Yale College was still all male actually.  I don't think it went co-ed until the next year.  I'm not sure of that but it's something like--it was around there.
Speaker 1: Around that time, right the same with Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so they were more interested in gender equity than anything else.  The racial equity, well if you can get in it's fine but then they weren't going to go and bend over backwards and let you in, especially in the graduate school.  I mean the graduate school is complete meritocracy.  They don't, they're not going to let you in unless they think you're going to succeed.  It's just not going to happen.  So color didn't have anything to do with it and I didn't see any significant color thing.  I mean there may have been one other African American graduate student when I was there in physics but that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was it.  The emphasis was really on getting more women in.
Story_ID: 21999
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this.  I have a note here, a curious thing and I even looked it up online and I wasn't satisfied with what I found.  But now did you pursue an M. Philosophy degree, a Masters of Philosophy degree (unclear) physics?
Speaker 2: Okay, what happens at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] is that you go and you take your courses, then you pass the, take the qualifying exam.  When you pass the qualifying exam you can ask them to give you a Masters of Philosophy degree which is evidence that you pass the qualifying exam.  So I asked them and they gave me the degree, okay, and then you go on to get your Ph.D. [degree].  If you don't pass your qualifying exam, you can't continue then you get a Masters of Science degree.  So a Masters of Philosophy degree says you did all the stuff, you passed the qualifying examination and if you go and get married and run off or do something like that you know you got something to show for it.  But it's like you've done everything except the real work which is you know the Ph.D. piece.  So that's what that was.  And you petition for it and they give it to you automatically once you pass the qualifying examination.  So I have four degrees all in physics.  I got a Bachelors degree, a Master's degree from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], a Master's of Philosophy from Yale and a Ph.D. from Yale.  That's how that works, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  All right, so you were, you came in--I heard about people going to school and they have to catch up with where Yale is.  But you sound like you're coming in, you're right up to speed you know when you arrive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I was.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: That's a--thanks to Union [College, Schenectady, New York] and to University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] which is where I had gone and I was clearly doing well there.  The education was there.  I mean it's not like--nobody gave you any slack.  You either did it or you didn't.  When I was in my senior year I took, the last semester, something like twenty-four credits all in physics just to finish up.  I wanted to--and I just packed it all in and you just did it.  I mean you just did it.  And there was no excuses and the courses were at the highest level.  So yeah, I was totally prepared when I walked into Yale didn't miss a beat.  I walked in--the first guy I worked for actually wasn't Bob Adair, was a guy named D. Alan Bromley, Alan Bromley, D. [David] is just initial and A-L-L--A-L-A-N Bromley, B-R-O-M-L-E-Y who is the director of the [A.W.] Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory.  I did theoretical nuclear physics and experimental nuclear physics.  I could go in and I knew what was going on.  And Alan Bromley just sort of gave me a job.  I walked there, walked in, needed some money for the summer.  I said, you got a place for me and he said sure?  That was it.  He went on to be the president's [President George H.W. Bush] National Science Advisor.  Bromley, a fabulous guy, Canadian but just absolutely wonderful you know just a gentle, sensible guy.  And these are the people who just sort of welcome you in but when I walked in, I was ready.  I was ready.  The preparation was exactly what it needed to be.  Now that's not the case for a lot of folks.
Story_ID: 22000
Speaker 1: And one of the gripes I have with some of these institutions who are good otherwise is they don't prepare their students for graduate school.  Some of the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], some of which are really good in other areas, fail miserably in the sciences, absolutely fail miserably in the sciences.  I had a student when I was at--you can edit this out if you want to--out of Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], graduated top of his class at Hampton when I was in the faculty at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he had to take his senior year over again.  When he got to Harvard he realized he didn't know anything.  He didn't know anything.  His whole senior year he had to take over cause he just didn't understand anything that was going on in the classroom.  And you know a couple of colleagues and I just helped shepherd him through but it was tough for this young man, top of his class, inexcusable, absolutely inexcusable.  I graduated from Union [College, Schenectady, New York], it wasn't even an issue cause there were no excuses.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've had discussions from physicists from the HCBUs that talk about the absence of research tradition like kind of dragging the programs back a little bit and them trying to bring them back up to speed.
Speaker 1: If the faculty members aren't learning at the same time the students are learning, they're not, the students are not going to succeed.  The faculty members have got to be engaged in the research or the students are not going to be well educated.  That's just the way it is.  It's just--cause you--people who are not engaged in research and some of the stuff is really hard, are not going to be on top of their game.  They're not going to be at the cutting edge and they're not going to be able to teach the stuff at the cutting edge and the students therefore won't know it.  And they'll get to these places like Harvard or Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and get blown away just--because the students who come from other places are well prepared.  It's just the way it is.  So that's a real problem.
Story_ID: 22001
Speaker 1: Okay, now was Bob Adair your advisor?
Speaker 2: Yep.  He ended up being my thesis advisor and I couldn't have been more fortunate. World War II veteran, a disabled vet, got machine gunned in the arm in, somewhere in Europe I can't remember where.  Guy, he was Wisconsin, from Wisconsin, came back, got his Ph.D., relatively conservative politically, the, one of the nicest people I have ever met, ever.  I mean very positive, supportive, sympathetic and a brilliant physicist.  I mean he almost got the Nobel Prize for a [charge] parity violation but he just missed it.  You know he got the data, interpreted it a different way and a couple of guys from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] got it instead.  Said, that's all right, life is short.  They recognized him in the Nobel Prize speech.  But Adair is one of these guys who is just a polymath.  I mean he, he's interested in lots of things.  He was the official physicist for the American League with Bart Giomanni who left Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] to become commissioner of the American League.  He asked Bob to be the official physicist of the American League so he wrote the first book, 'The Physics of Baseball' which became a roaring success.  He starts a charter of the physics of this, the physics of that.  He was this guy, just, he was just wonderful, just a really, really good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22002
Speaker 1: So what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: I did some work at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York] on Kmu3 decays looking for the structure-functions.
Speaker 1: Now what is it?
Speaker 2: K meson, looking at the structure-function of the K meson.  An experimental thesis, I mean it came out okay.  Then we went and did some other stuff.  So--
Speaker 1: Can you explain that maybe in layman's terms if possible and you know, in the simplest terms as possible so that people watching this will know what it was about?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  So there are a bunch of elementary particles that we've discovered over time.  One of the more exotic elementary particles is called the K meson.  It's a K meson class, they're positive, negative and neutral K mesons and that just is the electric charge of the three different particles.  And they have the distinction of being the first elementary particle discovered that had a strange quark in it.  It's one of those quantum numbers that looks, to characterize a particle in a different way.  What you do when you study these particles is--some of them, in fact almost all of them decay and the way they decay tells you something about how they're put together.  Tells you how the quarks interact inside the particle themselves.  So this experiment was looking at the disintegration of the K meson into a muon and a neutrino and electron.  And what you did was you studied the spin polarization of the particles, the way they moved left to right cause there's something called quantum spin.  If you take your hands, how does the particle move?  Spin, it's in that direction when it spins this way and it's in the other direction when it spins this way.  It's one of those artifacts of nature.  From the spin you can tell something about the way the K meson itself is constructed with the quarks.  And the experiment was to just understand what the structure of this particle was and that's called a quark structure function of the K meson.  And that's the way we take a look at all the particles.  For example if you take a look at this big experiment just happened at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Switzerland], nobody--we're not sure it's a Higgs [boson] yet, but whatever was discovered was studied by it's decay products.  You reconstructed it, it came out with a certain mass, it had certain characteristics but it was not the particle itself, it's what the particle transformed into that you studied, that you measured and then you went back.  This is the same thing.  What this thing transformed into allowed us to understand what it was before disintegrated and this is the strange meson called the K meson is the thing I studied.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were referring to the discovery--I thought they had really (unclear).
Speaker 2: The Large Hadron Collider [LHC] in Geneva, Switzerland at CERN.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Higgs boson.
Speaker 2: The Higgs boson.  We're not sure it's a Higgs yet but it's Higgs like.  It looks like it could be but you got to do all the other kind of studies like this K meson study I was talking about to know that it has the right properties.  It could be something else.  It just could be, happens to be in that space at that mass, but you don't know that it's a Higgs until you study it much more carefully.  And so the K meson study that I did was like the studies they're going to have to do on this particle, whatever it is to figure out whether it's a Higgs or something else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22003
Speaker 1: And you spent a lot of time at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York] working on this [properties of the K meson particle]?
Speaker 2: Brookhaven National Laboratory is on Long Island, about halfway out, sixty miles from New York City, from the outer ridges of Queens, near Shirley, New York, not very far from Ronkonkoma, another famous name in story and song, in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  They built it there because they wanted it to be absolutely in the middle of nowhere.  They were doing some interesting research during World War II and they put these laboratories like they did in Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico] in the middle of nowhere so you can't find them by accident.  Brookhaven Laboratory was put out there so it wouldn't be contaminating.  Out there back in the old days, it was nothing there on Long Island.  There wasn't even, there was no Long Island Expressway.  There were corn fields, it was potato farms, there were some sheep and that was it.  So that was a perfectly safe place to put it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was out there in the middle of nowhere again.  It didn't last very long.
Speaker 1: All right.  Anything else about Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] before we (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I would say this about Yale, that it in some real sense prepared me for the world because it--you show up at a place like Yale and you either do it or you don't.  There is no slack and nobody cares what you look like and they'll help you, they're going to be mentoring and tutoring but nobody really cares and that's the way the world is.  So at Yale, you have ups and downs, it's tough, you're competing against some of the smartest people in the world and if you don't make it, well you know that's all right.  That's why they invented these degrees.  If you don't pass the qualifying exam, they give you a master of science.  You can say you got a master of science from Yale, but you're not going to get a Ph.D.  And if you pass it and you don't go further, you can get a master of philosophy degree but everybody knows that you got that far.  But they're not going to give you anything and in life that's what's essential.  Nobody should be given anything they haven't earned because it will come back to bite them because they'll think other things are going to be given to them and nothing is going to be given to you.  The things I learned at Yale was easily the best ever.  I mean I just, it's extraordinary.  I found it more intellectually satisfying than the work I did at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But you had people like Tom [Thomas] Appelquist, who is still at Yale who was a theoretical physicist who just helped you understand impossible things.  Phezer Gerse (ph.) was a Turkish faculty member who was teaching quantum fuel theory, another guy who just--he could hold your hand and help you to the line, then he'd let you go and you're on your own.  You had to really get it.  So that environment, that's still the environment at Yale, is one of the most intellectually challenging I think anywhere but it's also one of the most supportive.  This is a place that will help you get there but it's not going to give you anything.  You got to get there on your own.  You have to have the intellectual capacity.  You have to know this stuff but it will help you get it, very different than other places.  It's, I think Yale is one of the most inclusive and best universities in the world because of that.  Just because it takes you for, if you get in, you know that's a measure, it will do everything it can to help you succeed but you got to succeed on your own.
Story_ID: 22004
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now you did post-doctoral studies at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I spent nine months at Brookhaven National Laboratory and I was working at that time with Bob Adair.
Speaker 1: This is '72, 1972?
Speaker 2: '72 [1972] and '73 [1973].  And I said well I want to go to Geneva, Switzerland to work at the, at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research], this European laboratory for particle physics.  And I said, but I don't have any money to get there.  So I said I'm going to write a letter to the Ford Foundation to ask them for money out of the blue.  And Adair said, what you're just going to write a letter out of the blue?  I said sure.  If I get it, I get it.  If I don't, I don't.  So I wrote them a letter.  A week and a half later I get this phone call from the guy at the Ford Foundation and his only question was, how much do you need?  It's another one of those things.  I just--I said well I would like to have this much money and he said well we can do this, and I said done.  And that's what happened.  So Brookhaven with Adair, I said I'll just write a letter to Ford.  He said, okay.  He thought I was crazy but I'll send you a supporting letter.  A week and a half later I was on my way to Geneva, Switzerland.  It was amazing and it was that quick.  It was that quick.  That was back in the day when there was money for science, where it was tremendous--, you know it was all the post-Sputnik [first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957] thing.  There was tremendous energy in the whole science and technology enterprise.  There were significant efforts to get everybody who wanted to go into science, into science, didn't matter who you were.  So they embraced women, embraced minorities.  I mean the vast majority were white males, nobody really cared.  I mean anybody who was competent could have written a letter to Ford, probably gotten the same response.  They didn't know who I was.  They had no idea who I was.  It didn't matter.  And I don't know what Adair wrote in his letter but it must have worked, you know.  And that's, my time at Brookhaven was very positive doing research but this was sort of the peak, like whoa.
Story_ID: 22005
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research] now out in the suburbs of Geneva, Switzerland.  So that's the nuclear, the European Nuclear facility--?
Speaker 2: European Center for Particle Physics, they changed the name.  It was, it used to be CERN was the European Center for Nuclear Research it as the French acronym, but now they just, they don't care it that anymore.  They call it--
Speaker 1: Just call it CERN.
Speaker 2: CERN yeah and it's particle physics.  They do some nuclear physics, but particle physics.  And when I got there, this is another thing that was (unclear).  I got there and you have to register you know to get your ID and the guy who was head of the scientific associates, I was a scientific associate at the time, asked me well how I was going to support myself.  I told him I got the Ford Foundation Grant and he asked me how much money you have?  And I said well this what I got.  He looked at me and said you can't do that here, that's not enough.  And he gave me twice as much in Swiss francs, and said here that's what your stipend is.  So I had this Ford Foundation Grant, a salary from the Swiss from an international organization in Swiss francs which was fabulous because I mean just, it made life a lot better and easier.  And I was able to stay at CERN for two and a half years and again I mean they don't know Americans.  This was a French guy who was running the scientific research associate program there and another one of those things that just happens.  You know you tell them what the story is and folks will, if they want to they'll help you.
Story_ID: 22006
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you learn at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland] and you know what did you work on?
Speaker 2: I worked on the first really big time particle collider called the Intersecting Storage Ring collider, the ISR.  And we did some experiments looking at proton-proton collisions trying to understand what I'll call the structure of the proton, the same thing we were doing, I was doing with K mesons but not looking at decay.  It's smashing these protons together seeing what came out and trying to understand from the super stuff that came out what the nature of these particles are.  It was a pretty heady time.  I mean it would turn, the machine would just come on, all sorts of fantastic things were happening and it turns out that the experiment I was on just missed one of the greatest discoveries of the twentieth century.  That was the J/psi meson which was discovered by Sam Ting [Samuel Chao Chung Ting] at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York], by Burt [Burton] Richter at SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Palo Alto, California] at exactly the same time and we missed it.  We missed it cause we--and we went back and looked in the data we collected and it was sitting there like a sore thumb.  We just missed it.  And Burt and Sam got the Nobel Prize [in Physics, 1976] and we got to watch.  I learned a lot of experimental physics.  I learned how to measure things, I learned how to build things.  I learned how to do complex data analysis.  I learned how to ski because I volunteered for the night shift and the weekend shifts and I went skiing three days a week in the Swiss and French Alps.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It was a great time.  But when you worked I mean I was putting in seventy hours a week but when I wasn't working I was skiing and it was really just fabulous.  I lived in the old town of Geneva, met some extraordinary people from the UN [United Nations] and other places and it was broad international community there in Geneva and it was just, it was fun.  But I learned how to be a scientist there in a real sense.  I mean that was just, it was a lot of work but it was a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: And my friends got pretty good.
Story_ID: 22007
Speaker 1: Seemed like I had a note about a French class that you were taking in college or something but is that--?
Speaker 2: Well I--
Speaker 1: You took German, I know that.
Speaker 2: I took German when I was in college.  I taught myself French when I was in graduate school because in order to get a Ph.D., actually you had to, in order to be qualified to take a qualifying exam you know you had to be fluent in a second language, more or less fluent and you had to be able to read a third language.  So I had English, my German was pretty good, I could read and write in German and I taught myself French so I could read in French.  And that allowed me to pass the language qualifying exams so I could actually take the physics qualifying exam so I had the three languages.  Nowadays you get by with computer programming or something which is kind of ridiculous but that preparation really was fantastic cause then I went to Geneva and I could speak French.  And in two and a half years my French got pretty darn good and it was very helpful to me later on cause then when I joined the foreign service I went to the U.S. embassy in Paris [France], I didn't have to learn French, I knew French. But those things, that's a part of the scientific intellectual environment that I think that's somewhat missing in a lot of places.  I mean the language piece is crucial.  Science is international by definition.  There's nothing that happens here that doesn't happen somewhere else and our collaborators are global.  I mean when I was working in Geneva [Switzerland] for example, we had collaborators from thirty countries.  When I was working at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], we had collaborators from maybe twp.  Now if you're working at the LHC [Large Hadron Collider, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland] you had collaborators from fifty!  You know it's just the way it is.  If you don't have the language facility and you don't sort of appreciate some of the different cultures you're not going to be successful in those environments because science now is such a global enterprise, certainly the big science of particle physics is that it's really a social enterprise.  It's not the scientific enterprise where somebody back in the old days sits at a table with two or three graduate students and does something and those days have been long gone in physics.  And you have to be in some sense the social sciences as well you have to understand social dynamics and being broadly cultural allows you to do that.
Story_ID: 22008
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 1974, now you teach physics at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Now how did this happen?  I mean did you just, you decide to come back and apply and--?
Speaker 2: Well I was a scientific associate at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland] and you know they have term appointments.  They gave me another year.  But I was working with a guy named Richard Wilson who was at CERN.  I had met him and he's a (unclear) professor of physics at Harvard.  He's a Brit [British], nice guy.  He's retired, he's emeritus now but we still stay in touch.  And I got to know Burt [Burton] Richter who is, I just mentioned got the Nobel Prize [in Physics, 1976] for discovering the psi meson [J/psi meson].  And I had actually known Sam [Samuel] Ting [shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Richter, in 1976] for when he was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was working at CERN and MIT through Bob Adair [Sessoms' doctoral and post-doctoral advisor at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut and Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York].  So I knew these, this network of guys so I let folks know that I was interested in going back to the [United] States cause you know I finished my, was finishing my term with CERN.  So I applied to jobs at four places, University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Harvard [University], Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] at SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center] and Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].  And I got interviewed at those four places so I came back and went through all four in a circuit and decided to go to Harvard.  I mean it's, what the heck?
Story_ID: 22009
Speaker 1: But the best interview [for faculty postions] I had was at Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].  I made a presentation on some of the work we were doing at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland, where Sessoms was a scientific associate] and in the audience was Richard Feynman [Richard Phillips Feynman, theoretical physicist].  This, yeah I got to tell you about Feynman, just an extraordinary guy.  And he and I then went to lunch after the seminar and that was just amazing.  Feynman was fabulous, I mean just an amazing human being.  It was the kind--if I were to point to anybody who could be inspirational in science, it would be Dick Feynman just because he was an extraordinary scientist but more so a human being.  You now he, if you read some of his books and some of his autobiographical stuff, you realize that he was a man.  I mean he's a guy from New York, I mean we had a lot in common.  He still spoke with a crazy Queens [New York] accent you know it was just--but he was just himself.  And if you could be Dick Feynman and be yourself then you know you could do anything.  So that was a guy that I just found exceptional.  But not because he was a scientist, because he was himself, you know sort of different.  So I picked Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] just because we went out you know I was still on the east coast.  It's a pretty cool place to be from.  Why not?  And Dick was a nice guy, is a nice guy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah we just heard about Richard Feynman yesterday from another physicist who you know they decided to drive up to Caltech and knock on his door to see if he would come over and lecture to them and he actually did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he does.
Speaker 2: And they had dinner with him.
Speaker 1: I mean he would--when Feynman was alive he was accessible.  He just, he didn't put on airs.  You know he liked to teach undergraduates.  He liked to teach high school students. He's one of those guys.
Speaker 2: And they were listening to his tapes, the Feynman Lectures [on Physics].
Speaker 1: Feynman Lectures, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they said well let's try to get him, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah and he would say yes.  I mean he's one of these guys who just tended to want to sort of educate and entertain and embrace people at the same time.  And his personal history sort of reflects that.  I mean he had, you know he lost his first wife through cancer.  It's a tough story and he was at Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico] at the time during the war and he just, he became much more of a humanist I think through that experience.
Story_ID: 22010
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you were at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] from '74 [1974] to '81 [1981].  Now what was it like at Harvard in those days?
Speaker 2: I always seemed to have good times.  Harvard was fun.  I mean I got to do some interesting research.  I was working at Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois].  I was working at Geneva [Switzerland] at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research], going back and forth, met some really interesting characters like Carlo Rubbia [Italian physicist; received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984].  Carlo Rubbia was then a professor at Harvard and also at CERN.  He was flying back and forth every week.  He would give his lectures on Saturdays and Sundays, the classes would be full, then he'd go back to Geneva.  Carlo won the Nobel Prize for discovering the intermediate vector boson at CERN along with Simon van de Meer [Dutch particle physicist] who just recently passed away too, another one of these really neat guys that I got to know at CERN.  The experience at Harvard was good.  The best thing about the experience at Harvard was the younger faculty that I interacted with.  There were some people like [Hugh] David Politzer who is now at Caltech who got the Nobel Prize [in Physics, 2004] a few years ago for something he did when he was at Harvard on (unclear).  Howard Georgi [Howard Mason Georgi, III] who is still at Harvard who was a graduate student when I was a graduate student at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and he was a junior fellow in the Society of Fellows and Howard was chair of the physics department at Harvard for a bunch of years and now I think he's a master at the Leverett House [residential house at Harvard College].  But that intellectual environment was extraordinary and while I was there, there was this group that was just getting together trying to form a program for science and international affairs to understand how the program, how science and international affairs can be made to be positively reinforcing.  And the guy who was driving by, the force behind that was a guy named Paul Doty who actually also recently passed away which is unfortunate, who was a dean of engineering and applied sciences.  But then you also had guys like Michael Knott who went to the University of Maryland, Al [Albert] Carnesale who subsequently was dean of the Kennedy School [of Government, Harvard University] and then provost at Harvard and then chancellor at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] for a bunch of years.  These guys and I would sit down once a week in a brown bag lunch and just talk about stuff.  You know just talk about, the concern primarily was nuclear weapons but it was also biological and chemical weapons.  And one of the things I always wanted to do was understand how we could not destroy ourselves using science I mean the, cause nuclear weapons were a big deal then.  I mean the Cold War was at its peak and that was an interesting way to learn international affairs because we had Israeli experts coming in, we had Egyptian experts coming in, we had then Soviet experts coming in cause it was a neutral alignment.  Harvard was Harvard, you know (unclear) people showed up, it was just fine so it was an interesting place.  And that, I did physics, I did a lot of physics research but I did a lot of stuff on the international side just learning about it.  I mean I didn't even do anything, just spent time with folks who knew a lot and learned about it in a significant way.
Story_ID: 22011
Speaker 1: When I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] there was an opportunity to go and use some of the international affairs stuff down in Washington [District of Columbia] which is how I first got to Washington cause I got an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship which was one of these big deals you get when you were supposed to be a hot shot young scientist.  And some of them are hot shots, some of them not so hot shot but it's a bunch of money and it was really you do whatever you want with it.  And I was able to use some of that and I got a sabbatical leave from Harvard to go and work at the [U.S.] Arms Control and Disarmament [Agency, ACDA] which is now a part of the [U.S.] State Department.
Speaker 2: So where did you work?  I'm sorry you said--
Speaker 1: At the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: US ACDA, A-C-D-A.  And I worked--
Speaker 2: ACDA?
Speaker 1: ACDA, during the [President Jimmy] Carter administration on something called the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation [INFCE].  Anyway that was neither here nor there but it was an interesting opportunity to take science that I was doing at Harvard and the international affairs that I was learning at Harvard and meld them into an operational role in the State Department which was something I did and you know I was going back and forth between Cambridge and Washington but it was a very interesting time.  And the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship let me do that.  You know it gave me all the facility and flexibility to spend the money on going back and forth between Cambridge and Washington and that kind of thing.  It was fabulous.  It was really very nice.
Speaker 2: This is 1977 right, when you started that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: '77 [1997]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you had, from what I understand the Sloan fellowship lasted until 1981?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they let me stay there cause I didn't spend all the money cause I was down in Washington a lot of the time.  So I said can I take a little longer to spend the money and they said sure.  One of the things about Sloan, the Sloan, I mean they used it as a filter for the, you know if you're a smart kid you get a Sloan, maybe you'll get the Nobel Prize.  It was kind of like that.  But what it also gives you is tremendous flexibility.  If you're a junior faculty member, they send you this money, you're a Sloan Foundation Fellow you can spend it any way you want, period.  I mean it's incredible.  (Unclear) the MacArthur award and the Waterman Award that the Department of--National Science Foundation gives.  I mean it's just, it's a big deal.  They still give it, they still, the Sloan Foundation Fellows it was huge.  That was tremendously helpful.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that program ended in '80 [1980] or '81 [1981]?
Speaker 1: Well I was there in the State Department going back and forth and I was going to go back to Harvard and I was invited to stay in the State Department.  They wanted, they needed somebody--this is before they had a science advisor in the State Department.  They needed somebody who knew physics to deal with the whole nuclear weapons piece.  So I was invited to stay and take over the nuclear portfolio in the State Department, working with a guy named John Boright and I said sure.  And he's a name that will pop up a couple of times cause I followed him around a little bit.
Speaker 2: John?
Speaker 1: John, J-O-H-N Boright, B-O-R-I-G-H-T.  I think John is now the international secretary for the National Academy of Sciences [NAS] or the National Research Council [NRC], one of the two.  He's in Washington.
Story_ID: 22012
Speaker 1: Now is this when you started working with the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental Affairs [OES]?
Speaker 2: Scientific, yes that's when I went over to--from ACDA [U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency] to OES.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell us about, now you played several roles I guess over a number of years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the [U.S.] State Department?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let me give, there's an interesting anecdotal story on the State Department in that's sense.  I had a wonderful time.  I always have good times.  I don't do anything that's not fun cause if it's not fun what's the point of doing it?  So I was going to a meeting, I guess it was maybe with the Pentagon and I went downstairs and they had a car for me to take me over to this meeting cause I was chairing the meeting.  And there's this guy named Paul [Dundes] Wolfowitz who was also in the State Department at the time.
Speaker 1: The same Paul Wolfowitz who we know from the Bush administration?
Speaker 2: Same Paul, yeah same Paul Wolfowitz yeah, but this is before he was such a heavyweight.  So we're both standing downstairs and he's waiting for a car too and he looks at me and says, I'll never forget, he looked at me straight in the face and said, okay I'm here, will you go and get my car?  And I looked at Wolfowitz and I know him. He knew me from meetings.  I looked at him and said well I don't know where your car is but mine's over there.  I walked over to the car, got in and away and left him standing there.  I could not believe it, could not believe it.  I just, what are you kidding me?
Speaker 1: So he just walks out of context and then you're just--join the rank and file, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yep.  Another incident when I was in the State Department that was overseas, I was with a guy named Richard Kennedy, Ambassador Richard Kennedy.  Kennedy was the special advisor to the secretary of state for nonproliferation and ambassador at large and Dick Kennedy and I got along famously.  He was a wonderful guy.  We were over in Brussels [Belgium] negotiating with the Europeans on some nuclear arrangement.  It was between the U.S. and the European atomic energy (unclear) year round.  So we were being hosted by the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], ambassador to NATO and we're going through his house and I'm walking in first and Kennedy is behind me and I won't name this guy but he looks at me and says okay you got them in now you can wait outside in the car.  And Dick Kennedy looks at them and he says, this guy is a number two in the delegation.  What are you talking about?  He looked at me and assumed that I was the driver.  I mean it was unbelievable.  And he apologized to me for about eight years.  I mean it was--but I just couldn't believe it.  I mean Kennedy was just like what is wrong with these people cause he didn't see it either you know.  He just, folks who don't see it, don't see it.  And this guy simply assumed that I was the driver.  I mean Jesse Jackson [civil rights leader] tells the story about when he was running for president and he was out in front of the Washington [District of Columbia] Hilton and he was waiting for, you know he's used to being in these big stretch limousines.  He was waiting for his stretch limousine and it was kind of drizzling.  And this lady walks up to him and hands her the keys, hands him the key to her car, a Mercedes she left out in front and she said would you please put this away for me?  And he looked at this lady and said yes ma'am, I'll--no problem.  Got into his stretch limousine when it pulled up, took off, kept her keys.  He says I still don't know how the lady got home that night.  He just took the keys and left.  I mean these, this--the impression people have still now that you are who you look like is I think stunning.  I was just, but I hadn't confronted it as dramatically as I had in the State Department.  This piece with Wolfowitz which is outrageous and in Brussels, it was just crazy.  It just, you might want to check first you know.  Another experience in the same--I'm chairing a meeting dealing with a country of some difficulty to us in the nuclear weapons area.  I'm chairing the meeting, folks know I'm chairing the meeting.  I walk into the meeting and the room falls deafening silent.  Nobody, who the hell is this guy?  You know some of them knew who I was and they were just looking around kind of hiding their eyes.  You know look at all these generals in the company.  They were just like, what the hell are you doing here?  So I didn't say anything.  I let them be quiet and in shock and I went and introduced myself at the beginning of the meeting and I asked them to introduce themselves as well.  But they just had never seen somebody like me chairing a meeting over there at that level.  And I just--interesting.  It's very interesting, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Speaker 1: It is, these are the stories, so.
Story_ID: 22013
Speaker 1: Well, now you were, now you start, I guess you started around the tail end of the Carter administration--
Speaker 2: Tail end of the [President Jimmy] Carter administration.
Speaker 1: --going into the [President Ronald] Reagan administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, so did your work change in, as administrations changed policies and--?
Speaker 2: Got a little harder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the Reagan administration there tended to be, independent of urban legend, a lack of concern about the proliferations of weapons of mass destruction, I think it's fair to say.  And when Al Haig [Alexander Meigs Haig, Jr.] was secretary of state I think he blew it in a couple of major ways and I'm not going to say anymore.  I think he just blew it.  And the president wasn't really that interested.  You know he had opportunities to stop some of the weapons programs in countries that we're worrying about now and he didn't want to do it cause you know it was too much work and you know I don't have to worry about that.  That's going to be somebody else's problem kind of thing.  Carter never would have thought of something like that.  I mean he would have addressed the issue. He didn't do as well as one would have hoped but he was in this area pretty strong and I think the Reagan administration just wasn't, although I met some extraordinary people in the Reagan administration.  One is John [Dimitri] Negroponte.  Now John was assistant secretary of state for oceans, environment and science in the agency in the [U.S.] State Department.  And I was one of the first guys who taught John what a nuclear weapon looked like and he and I had become fast friends ever since.  And he was one of the guys who leaned on me to sort of do something in the foreign service so I left Washington [District of Columbia] to go to Paris [France] as a counselor for science and technology sort of at John's behest which was interesting.  But I was following John Boright, the guy I mentioned before.  John was the counselor of science and technology in the [U.S.] embassy in Paris.  He was leaving and I went and took his job and that was a fantastic experience, I mean it was just amazing.  That was the opportunity to see how we can integrate science, technology and foreign policy.  The State Department on the nuclear weapons side was pretty good.  I mean even though we didn't necessarily get the kind of hearing that he wanted at the most senior levels, we controlled a lot of the action.  We did some interesting things, we actually cut off some nuclear weapons programs.  We were able to influence things in a significant way globally.  It was a big deal.  But there was no way of integrating, seeing how science and technology could be integrated into foreign policy.  We see the problems now in global warming for example.  We see the problems in just dealing with chemical waste.  We see the problems in trying to figure out how to deal with issues related to the law of the sea.  These are basically science issues.  I mean if you take a look at the objective science, some of the answers are pretty clear.  The politics gets in the way.  The politics gets in the way in surprisingly complicated ways cause they tend to be very shortsighted.  That's not true in other places.  The United States is sort of peculiar in that regard.  We tend to be driven by economics more than idealism.  Even though we say we're promoting democracy and all this other thing, what we're really promoting is U.S. interests, period and U.S. interests tends to be jobs and money.  I mean it just--I don't mean to be a grouch but that's really the way it is.
Story_ID: 22014
Speaker 1: I know when you were talking about the [President Jimmy] Carter admin--Carter was a nuclear physicist.  You think that level of education made him a little more sensitive to what was going on?
Speaker 2: Well Jimmy Carter claimed he was a nuclear physicist.  He actually claimed he had a degree from Union College [Schenectady, New York].  I won't go further.  He worked (unclear) laboratory in, just outside of Schenectady.  A smart guy but I think that certainly had something to do with it.  He also was a--, he really cared about the details of things and how things worked maybe way too much for a president but he cared about them and knew and understood them.  I think he made some wrong choices but he understood them.  I think on the other side [President] Ronald Reagan didn't have any interest in this stuff and didn't know about the detail at all.  So if you didn't know about them you didn't care about them.  You know he was really a very big picture person.  I think he had interests which are not exactly (unclear).  I got a picture of myself and Ronald Reagan on the wall over there.  I mean nice guy but I think in the policy side he and Carter were night and day and it's probably because Carter was such a detail oriented president that he was not as successful as he might have been and Ronald Reagan from the view of many people was a very successful president.  The difference is that he had a very different global view and Carter in fact didn't have a global view, he had a detail view and he wanted to do everything at the detail level and the President of the United States can't do that.  That was a huge difference between the administrations.  But Ronald Reagan picked some really smart people and [John] Negroponte was one of them, I mean just an incredibly smart guy and just a delight.  He went on, and John's a very friend of mine.  I'm the godfather of his youngest kid.  I mean he went on to be ambassador to Mexico.  He said when I get to Mexico he coached, cajoled me into going, Director of National Intelligence, ambassador to Iraq, I mean ambassador to the UN [United Nations], deputy secretary of state.  These guys recognized talent and John was one of these--
Speaker 1: You said you showed him what a nuclear weapon looked like.
Speaker 2: I helped, I gave him--I designed it.  Yeah I designed it, I drew--got a piece of paper, this is what a nuclear weapon looked like.  He didn't want to know anymore.  He said that's enough.  I don't really want to know anymore about this.  We're talking about the Israeli program and how they might have done it but John is a smart guy so I showed him how to design nuclear weapons.
Speaker 1: Cause this is, I mean to put this in a kind of historical context, this is a time when well everybody's afraid of a nuclear holocaust and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --that some country is going to get a weapon, especially in those days we were afraid that somebody was going to get hold of one of these--
Speaker 2: And use it on us.
Speaker 1: And use it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Or the Soviet Union was going to break out and use it on us so we had mutually assured destruction where we built those gigantic stockpiles of nuclear weapons and then the Chinese were coming up with their nuclear weapons and we were worried about some countries in South America getting nuclear weapons and another country or two in Asia getting nuclear weapons and some countries in the middle east getting nuclear weapons.  And anybody using a nuclear weapon anywhere is going to pull us in.  I mean that's a big deal and we'd be stuck and that was the problem.  It was a huge issue.
Speaker 1: And there's a, at the time that you're talking I mean a certain--I guess what's made John Negroponte afraid if I can speculate on this is the portability of a nuclear weapon I mean the size and the--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be a gigantic thing, right to--?
Speaker 2: It doesn't have to be a gigantic thing.  And some of them we were able to develop are so small to be embarrassing.  I mean it's some stuff we won't talk about because it's embarrass--why would anybody design a nuclear weapon that small you know?  It's--but we did. We have a very advanced technology in nuclear weaponry but you have to remember the technology of nuclear weapons even then you know we're talking in the 80s [1980s], was fifty years old, you know.  It's old stuff.  I mean we knew how to design and make nuclear weapons work in the 1940s.  The weapon we dropped on Hiroshima [Japan; World War II] was never tested.  It worked the first time.  So we knew to do this in 1943, trivial.  That's scary and now the people who designed the first nuclear weapon, [Richard] Feynman [physicist] and these other folks, did it in their heads, pencil and paper.  Then we went to supercomputers and all this other kind of stuff.  There's more computing power in your iPhone than there is, than there was in all the super computers in the 1960s, in your iPhone.
Speaker 1: You mean that whole wall of giant, refrigerator looking machines with lights blinking and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The iPhone would blow them away.  Your little Mac [Macintosh computer; product of Apple, Inc.] or your Dell PC, wipe them out.  It wouldn't even be close.  It wouldn't even be close.  To design a nuclear weapon the way they designed a nuclear weapon in the 40s [1940s], high school students do it now.  It's not complicated, just got to know a little physics and some design hydrodynamics.
Speaker 1: Scary in some ways.
Speaker 2: It's a reality.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why people worry.  So the idea is, what we were focusing on was securing the material.  You can't build a weapon if you don't have the stuff to build it.  So the idea--and even now with the Iranians, keep it from getting the material cause the design is trivial.  If you got the material, you got the weapon, period.  That was one of the big deals in the Carter administration and in the Reagan administration although the Reagan administration was not quite as concerned.
Story_ID: 22015
Speaker 1: Okay, from '82 [1982] to '87 [1987] you were Director of the Office of Nuclear and Technical Safeguards for the Bureau of Oceans and International Environment of Scientific Affairs, right?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: And I'm just trying to get some of the titles out here, in '87 [1987], Counselor for Scientific and Technological Affairs for the U.S. Embassy in Paris [France].
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me talk a little bit about the, oh yes the Oceans Environmental Science, Director of Science and Technology and Nuclear Weapons, Nuclear Safety.  That was primarily an effort to mobilize the international community around what we were talking about before, keeping the material out of peoples' hands.  So it's working primarily with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna [Austria] which is why the German came in very handy and I spent a lot of time in Vienna.  I was commuting in fact between Washington [District of Columbia] and Vienna for a while.  I met a beautiful woman, got married, had a couple of kids.  But it was, in Vienna where the hub of the action was and still is, it's around the way of safeguarding nuclear material so that it can't be diverted from peaceful to non-peaceful uses.  That's why there's so much effort now to get the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA into Iran again to verify that their material is not being misused or being diverted.  That's a big deal with the North Koreans to make sure the (unclear)--because if you've got the material, you got the bomb.  It's just no question about it cause this is not hard to do anymore.  So the idea is to safeguard the material and we spent enormous amounts of time trying to do that.  And the International Atomic Energy Agency is stronger for it but there's a big, there was a big glitch in there.  That was when the Arabs and I guess it was the Soviets conspired to kick the Israelis out of the IAEA and it was a mess because when that happened, this is when Ronald Reagan was president, we had to walk out of the agency and we were out for two years.  Along with all the money and all the influence, it was a fiasco.  It was just a fiasco.  It was almost as, and I will say this, as stupid as [President] Jimmy Carter boycotting the Olympics in Moscow [Russia].  Just stupid you know.  Who do you penalize?  You penalize U.S. athletes.  This was penalizing our efforts to control nuclear weapons.  I think it was just a huge mistake.  We shouldn't be doing something like that.  The United States shouldn't be walking out of anything you know.  If we're going to be the big fish, we got to play the game and some things happen you don't like.  We do a lot of things that folks don't like you know, it's just the way it is.  But we think that our way is the right way and that's one of these religious things that drives me crazy cause you know you, that's when you go to war and we have to be very careful about that.  Anyway that was the International Atomic Energy Agency.  I think it's an incredibly important organization.
Story_ID: 22016
Speaker 1: Then I went to Paris [France].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, following in the footsteps of my friend John Boright.  And that was another wonderful posting.  So I got the, I use the German in Vienna [Austria] which was very helpful including with the in-laws and I used the French in Paris and in Geneva [Switzerland] which was equally important.  Because the transactional language may be English but the social language is French and in order to really understand what's going on in any environment you have to know the language.  And I had a really, really very productive and useful time in France.  We did a lot of good things.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The best story however--I got to tell you some of these anecdotes cause--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --I'm sitting here for five hours I got to tell you something.  So the, one of our major U.S. companies built a satellite for Luxembourg, a communications satellite and the French were going to launch it on a rocket called Ariane and this is when Francois Mitterrand was president.  And since I was the counselor for science and technology they invited me to the launch.  Well the launch happened to be in French Guiana so the French government chartered the Concord to fly us to French Guiana.  So they flew from Paris to Dakar [Senegal], was a three-hour flight and then from Dakar to French Guiana to Kuru [French Guiana] just to watch a rocket go up.  So we flew down, it was--
Speaker 2: So you went to, from Paris to Africa to the Caribbean?
Speaker 1: Paris to Dakar--with champagne and caviar flowing and then across the Atlantic Ocean with caviar and champagne flowing and then it was a cloudy day for the launch so we had to spend another couple of days there and Mitterrand was there for part of it.  It was absolutely brilliant.  But one of the things that I saw there and when I was in France, Paris was one of the most connected cities and France was one of the most connected countries in the world.  They had this minitel which is a, the first kind of interconnected computer system around the country.  You could order your theater tickets through minitel.  You could pay your bills through minitel.  This is before the internet was a big deal.  In fact it was before the internet was there and they were really totally wired.  Their French space port in Kuru it was like walking into Star Wars.  I mean it was a spectacular space.  You come to the jungle and there's nothing in French Guiana.  I mean you come to the jungle with snakes and all these other things.  So you walk into a place it looks like it came out of a Star Wars set.  I mean it was amazing.  It was just absolutely spectacular.  And they lost the edge because the French are no longer the most connected country in the world by any means.  They don't drive the technology environment at all.  In fact, we do in the United States and the Chinese are catching up and the Koreans are catching up and the French are not on the map.  But when I was in Paris, they were "the" number one connected country in the world.  There's a lesson on that one.  I mean they lost the edge.  They took their--you have to continuously invest in science and technology to stay on the edge and if the nation doesn't do it, you fall behind and we're falling behind.  We'll fall behind in education, we'll fall behind in the technology.  These folks are nipping at our heels because we're not paying attention.  We think that somebody's going to do it for us and nobody's going to do it for us.

Speaker 1: Now see I was thinking before when you were talking about the Carter and Reagan administrations that STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education now seems that people are calling for it on the one end but the lack of it seems to handicap the--
Speaker 2: They're not doing it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --politicians that should be calling for it.
Speaker 2: One of the biggest problems they have in STEM education, this is just you know my humble opinion, is the teachers can't teach it cause they don't know it.  If you want somebody to teach math the way I was taught math, they'd better be a mathematician.  Every teacher I had even in elementary school were math majors.  Now they think you can get somebody to teach math who is an education major.  The answer is you can't and kids know it.  I mean my older kids when they were in elementary school, one came home in tears cause she asked, she was in, it was first grade.  She asked her teacher what it meant to divide by zero and the teacher gave her a nonsense answer and she knew it was nonsense.  She knew this lady doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.  So she came home--I explained what infinity was and how you can divide in certain ways and when you divide by zero it doesn't work because you have nothing into something and you get, it gives, it blows up on you.  Her teacher couldn't explain that or even draw pictures of it.  And this kid she was six, she knew nonsense when she saw it.  That's what's happening in our schools.  The kids ask questions cause all kids are scientists, all kids are scientists.  They ask questions, they get stupid answers, the tune out, that's the end of it.  And you're not going to get them back.  And we have teachers in the classroom who don't know this stuff.  You shouldn't be able to teach even elementary school science without knowing science.  And you don't know science if you haven't studied science.  And most of the teachers who teach math to be perfectly honest are afraid of math.  They all have math phobias.  They never studied math.  They don't understand it's just another language.  You can learn it as you learn anything else and the kids pick up on it and, it ain't happening.  They just tune out.  Why are some schools really successful?  Because the parents are engaged and the parents know the stuff and they get, they bring their kids to these special charter schools or public schools and through say specialty high schools.  But what happens to the other 90 percent of the kids?  And they don't realize you got to fund it.  You got to pay the teachers cause these are educated people.  They're not going to work for free.  They can do something else.  It's complicated.  So instead of being number one in the world where we used to be in STEM education what are we number twenty-nine, and dropping?  And one of the things they also have to realize if you don't bring everybody into this boat, the boat's going to sink.  You got to have all the Black kids, you got to have all the Latino kids, you got to have all the women studying these things cause they're half the population folks, more than half if you count the women.  The women are 51 percent already.  If you don't educate everybody you're not going to survive as an economy and you can't be discriminatory and say okay well these kids are not smart enough.  Everybody is smart enough.  Everybody can be educated to a significant level and we're just, we're graduating kids from high schools that can't read at the third grade level.  I mean, how can you graduate? How can you get into the sixth grade without knowing how to read?  It's just--that's my diatribe.  And what bothers me more is it's hurting the minority kids more cause they're from the backgrounds where the parents are least able to intervene in the schools, least able to intervene in their own education at home, it's a crisis in some real sense.  And if we don't fix this one, twenty-nine is going to look good.  We may end up being sixty-nine.  I mean if--it's not (unclear) anyway.
Speaker 1: I hear you.
Story_ID: 22018
Speaker 1: So, now when we had you in Paris [France] here and so you worked with, in Paris you worked with a number of different agencies and concerns of, counselor of Europe, the European Space Agency, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, International Organization for Legal Metrology and so--
Speaker 2: The European Science Foundation, these are all organizations that sort of began the integration of Europe in science and technology.  The beauty of being in Paris is that I had the whole country and the European Parliament in Strasbourg which is also in France so I got to kind of the European parliament as well and there were a lot of international organizations in France as there are in the United States.  Actually a higher concentration there cause this was a neutral territory.  And so what we have then is an opportunity to take a look at the whole overlay of science and technology and how its playing in development, not just in the international affairs.  And that was an interesting experience.  We got to build some very strong partnerships.  The most interesting piece that I had to broker was this fight between Bob Gallo [Robert C. Gallo] and Luc Montagnier and who discovered the AIDS virus [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)] and I was the guy in the embassy to try to help broker this one and it was a very, very interesting experience.  That was fascinating.
Speaker 1: Now I'm not even aware that there was a struggle about that but--
Speaker 2: Huge struggle because there was a--Bob Gallo, I'm trying to remember where Gallo was.  I don't think he was at NIH [National Institutes of Health] then.  He may have been.  He was studying the AIDS virus and a guy named Luc Montagnier who was at the French Medical Research Institute in Paris studying it the same time. Gallo made the discovery about some certain kind of properties of this virus but he couldn't really connect it exactly to the fact it was a causal agent, causal viral agent for AIDS and Montagnier was able to just get over that hump.  But they did it sort of at the same time.  So there was this huge dispute because it came down to who could get the patent for the AIDS test kit?  It was really driven by money and we were, the U.S. were saying that Gallo put in a patent for the AIDS test kit.  The French put in a patent for the AIDS test kit.  They were fighting over who was going to get the rights to the AIDS test kit which was going to be big money.  I mean that's really what it was all about.  So we had to fight to resolve this but it all came down to who then gets the scientific credit for discovering the interaction between this virus and the disease itself, huge deal.
Speaker 1: Was Gallo at the Center for Disease Control [CDC, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Is that what it--?
Speaker 2: He may have been at the Center for Disease Control connected to NIH in some case.  I just can't remember now.  He may have even been at the University of Maryland for a part of the time.  I just don't remember where Bob was.  But just recently the scientific verdict came out and Luc Montagnier what, three years ago got the Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine; 2008] for the AIDS work and Gallo was not recognized.  I mean it's--but it was a fascinating time.  I got to know these guys pretty well.  We had some very nice meals in Paris and it was because of that, that I was able to connect to Montagnier and recruit him to come to Queens [New York] when I went to Queens.  But I mean this was a very interesting time and the French were involved in the center of all this stuff.  It was good.
Story_ID: 22019
Speaker 1: In 1989 you became the Minister and Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, there's a connection.  Now why did that happen?  I mean here's this physicist becoming a political counselor.  John Negroponte, the guy I talked to about nuclear weapons [at the U.S. Stare Department], John got assigned to Mexico as ambassador and he called me up and said I want you to come and help me run the embassy.  I want you to become the political counselor.  And I said John I got another year in Paris [France].  Why would I want to leave Paris early to come to Mexico City [Mexico]?  You have to be kidding me.  He said because you have no reason to stay in Paris and I need you in Mexico.  John's a friend.  I left and went to Mexico.  Fantastic tour, I mean we did some very interesting things.  The biggest deal I think we did in Mexico and actually I also became then John's deputy when the other deputy chief of mission left I became the deputy ambassador.  We negotiated the international agreement that's now called NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement.  We had the opportunity, and this was under [President] George H.W. Bush, to take U.S./Mexican relations to the highest level they had ever been since Franklin Roosevelt was president.  It was amazing.  It was--we were able after a lot of struggle to keep the borders open.  We were able after a lot of struggles to force the drug war into the Caribbean and out of the center of Mexico.  We were able to ensure that there was easy flow across the border.  We made sure they weren't going to build any fences.  I mean Bush 41 [President George H.W. Bush] was under a lot of pressure to reinforce the border.  We convinced them not to do it, just don't do it because it will blow up in your face and it worked.  We got NAFTA going with the Canadians.  I had the pleasure of chairing the working group to develop the Environmental Site Agreement to NAFTA but it was spectacular.  The cooperation was simply extraordinary.  And Carlos Salinas was president of Mexico [Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexican economist and politician; President of Mexico from 1988 to 1994] and for all you can say about Carlos Salinas, he got the job done.  I mean really, he really did get the job done.  But it was an extraordinary time in U.S./Mexican relations and I was just delighted to be a part of that.  And John was just a fabulous ambassador.  I mean he would just simply one of these people who really got it, understood the folks, is incredibly congenial, they wanted to be around him.  He could pick up where Jim Baker was the secretary of state, we were driving the car once down the road.  We got this crazy (unclear) series of instructions from the [U.S.] State Department.  John and I looked at each other and said we're not going to do that.  He picked up the phone from the car, this is when the cell phones were this big right?
Speaker 1: A brick, yeah.
Speaker 2: Big things you had to carry in a back pack, picked it up, called Jim Baker who was on Air Force One or something like that and counted him in the order over the telephone.  I mean so that was extraordinary.  I mean that kind of connectivity with Negroponte and the senior levels of the [President Ronald] Reagan administration and the [President] H.W. Bush administration were just spectacular.  I mean he just knew how to do it.  That's when it matters who the ambassador is.  It really, really does matter.  And I had the good fortune of working with this guy and I had benefitted from it ever since.
Story_ID: 22020
Speaker 1: And the experience in Mexico--Mexico is the most important country in the world to the United States and I say that for a lot of reasons.  One is what happens in Mexico happens here.  I mean you take a look at what happened with the drug war.  I think that reinforcing the border was one of the stupidest things we've done.  But worst than that, creating this drug war where you--we do so well with interdicting and freezing assets that these guys who are doing the trafficking can't pay the porters who go through Mexico in cash.  So what do they do?  Pay them in drugs.  And what do they do?  They sell the drugs to the kids in Mexico.  The whole thing just blows up.  It just blew up and that's what we have now.  We have this incredible mess on our hands cause nobody thought through the dynamics.  What's also true is that if there's a catastrophe in Mexico which is now less and less likely than it used to be, you got 50 million Mexicans crossing the border all at once.  What are you going to do about it?  Nothing.  They're just going to be over there.  They're going to cross and that's going to be it.  It is in our interest to make Mexico in every way we can a stable, prosperous country, period, cause nobody can affect us like Mexico can affect us, nobody.  It's a country of 110 million people.  Half the Mexicans, at least when I was there, half of them had U.S. passports or green cards.  I mean they have families on both sides of the border.  So the idea is to integrate, not to block and we're doing an incredibly bad job of that now.  It's just a fiasco and you get this mess.  You get--El Paso [Texas] being one of the most murderous places in the world.  You got these other places on the border just like Durango [Colorado] and other places.  You can't go out at night.  You know you got, it's just horrible.  It's horrible and that's what we're doing to ourselves.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You'd never do that in the Canadian border.  Why do you think?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  So, any other stories from Mexico?  Now, a lot--, I know there are massive protests concerning NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] back in '93 [1993], '94 [1994] I guess.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of protests, I mean I remember when a certain congressman would sneak across the border and try to--with a camera crew show, all the bad stuff that was happening along the border in (unclear) and all the pollution, it's just kind of crazy stuff, and how it was going to take and (unclear) U.S. jobs.  Well it turns out that it's produced 2 million jobs in the United States.  It's been so successful the cost of labor in Mexico has gone up because of the standard of living going up.  So the U.S. companies that were exporting jobs to Mexico are bringing those jobs back to the United States because Mexico is more prosperous and most of the costs of manufacturing a refrigerator for example is in the transportation so if you can manufacture the stuff close to the home and the wages are the same, you save more money.  So NAFTA has worked, I mean it just had worked enormously well on the trade side.  We need to try to do it more on the social side with--the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] for example for the first time we have, at Division II, agreed to have the Canadian and Mexican universities participate in U.S. intercollegiate athletics.  It would have been unthinkable without having some significant integration.  But still this is one place.  North America is Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, that's North America.  I mean it's geographically and culturally the same.  Remember the, Mexico used to be Texas too and California, you know New Mexico and we don't seem to appreciate that as much as we should and I think it may have something to do with you know the language and the fact that a lot of these folks are dark skinned.  I mean you know just, I don't mean to be pejorative but it's almost always something like that, something stupid.  We need to embrace the Mexicans.  When I was there we were doing interesting research in the Gulf of Baja, California looking at the--they just discovered these really hot vents at the bottom of the Baja.  They would go down and they would find these animals, this fish life, this plant life that lived without sun, period.  You know and it was just on the sulfur vents, then we found new kinds of metabolisms just by doing a collaborative research with the Mexicans, volcanic research when you know the Popocatepetl [volcano, Central Mexico] used to pop its cork.  The collaborations between us and the Mexicans have been extraordinary and we got to really reinforce that.  But it's, we'll see.  I mean it's all politics.  It's all driven by in some sense a lack of understanding of each other.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22021
Speaker 1: In 1993, you became executive vice president for the University of Massachusetts system [UMass].  Now how did that--?
Speaker 2: How do I go from politics to higher education?  I never planned these things.  That's how it happens.  So [William] Bill Weld, when he was governor of Massachusetts came down to Mexico on a trade mission and he brought with him a guy named Michael Hooker.  Michael Hooker had been just named president of the University of Massachusetts system and I had known Michael in previous incarnations.  He was president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County [UMBC] and he's the one who brought Freeman Hrabowski [Freeman A. Hrabowski, III] in as his number two.  Freeman has been now president of UMBC for what, thirteen years, fourteen years, something like that.  I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a long time.  So Michael was the guy who brought Freeman in and got the ball rolling up there.  So he came down and with--Bill Weld asked me on this trade mission whether I'd be interested in helping build a great, bigger, stronger University of Massachusetts system?  And I said you know I don't know anything about this stuff.  I've been a faculty member at one place [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I've never been anywhere else in the faculty then I've been doing this other stuff. He said well look, you know the politics, you know these guys.  You spent time at Harvard.  I can't guarantee you anything but if you can get resources from the state legislature, I'll make sure you keep them.  I just want to build a great university.  I'm a Republican.  I can't be throwing money at this but you know--I said okay, sounded like a good deal, Michael was a good friend so I just moved.  I mean gave the department a couple of weeks' notice and went back and became executive vice president of the UMass system.  That was an interesting experience too.  That's how I got into, that's how without planning, I got into higher education administration.  I had absolutely no interest in it, no inkling that it was really something I wanted to do, so you go and you do it.  And if it's interesting, you continue to do it.  So I did it and it's, it was interesting.  We did some interesting things at UMass.
Story_ID: 22022
Speaker 1: Now at this time do you have family to consider and that sort of thing in terms of moving?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, in Mexico, wife and two little kids, this Austrian I told you about [Sessoms' wife], and yeah I moved and they moved and we moved into Cambridge and then we bought a house in Chestnut Hill and yeah, it was fun, it was interesting.  But you know kids--people exaggerate how hard it is to move.  I've moved fifteen times and the best thing about moving is you get to throw stuff out.  You know if you move you get to clean out, you get to throw stuff out, you decide whether you really need to keep this carton of beeswax you know that's been sitting there getting dusty for a year cause you thought you wanted to use it to can something.  I mean you just get rid of stuff.  And also it un-clutters your life in interesting ways and that is one of the advantages of being in the Foreign Service for example.  You just, you clean stuff out, you get rid of stuff.  You always need a home base.  Well not always but it's useful to have a home base but you don't keep stuff, you just get rid of stuff.  But you collect the things that go with you like these paintings.  I mean I've been collecting paintings since I went to Geneva [Switzerland] as a matter of fact the first time.  And I have a collection which I think is really pretty special but it reflects all the places I've spent time in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, the Middle East.  I mean it's just--that allows me to understand what they are like better than I could otherwise so it's interesting.  So I--at UMass [University of Massachusetts system], we were able to do some interesting things as far as when John Calipari was the coach at UMass Amherst [Amherst, Massachusetts] and went to the Final Four, I mean you know and, even though John was an interesting character--
Speaker 1: What was the year that Calipari goes to the Final Four?  Calipari--?
Speaker 2: He was, when did John go to the Final Four?  I'm thinking, was it--?
Speaker 1: Who was on that team?
Speaker 2: Larry--Camby--
Speaker 1: Cause Marcus Camby was the star, that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was '90 [1990], was it '90 [1990]--when the heck was it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably--
Speaker 2: '91 [1991], '90 [1990]--I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: Could be, cause he's been in the league now for ten years.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Camby's been a long time yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a vet now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So yeah, real--
Speaker 2: But it was, Camby was a guy you know, his--
Speaker 1: He's about forty years old now so that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was controversy about Camby getting paid you know by agents and stuff like that, getting some gold chain.  It was kind of ridiculous.  Anyway that was a bit of a mess, but they went to the Final Four and it didn't, nothing stuck to John Calipari.  And we were able to really reformulate the system, get it, got more money, really bolstered UMass Lowell, UMass Dartmouth with Southwest Massachusetts State College or something, now it's the University of Massachusetts Lowell--I mean Dartmouth, got a beautiful campus now, has a law school.  So it's, things started rolling in the right direction when I was at UMass.
Story_ID: 22023
Speaker 1: I was only there [at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) system, as executive vice president] for a couple of years and the way I left was the following.  Michael Hooker [president of UMass when Sessoms was there] is a graduate of [University of] North Carolina, Chapel Hill and that was his favorite place in the world.  He always wanted to be chancellor of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  So one day I'm coming in to work and he was married to this wonderful state senator named Carmen Buell.  And so I'm coming in to work one day and I hear on the radio that Michael is a finalist for the chancellorship at Chapel Hill.  I said what the hell is going on here?  That didn't make any sense.  So I called up Carmen and I asked Carmen whether she knew anything about it and she said what are you talking about?  I don't know what--I had never heard of this.  And I said uh-oh.  So I called Michael and he was not in town.  He may have been in Washington [District of Columbia].  I said Michael what's going on here?  He said I'll tell you when I get back to town.  And I said oh boy.  I knew the dye was cast.  He--nobody knew anything about it.  So I went to see the governor and I said governor, my understanding is Michael is leaving.  He said he won't be able to come back and wash--shine shoes in Massachusetts anymore.  I said, that takes care of Michael cause he didn't know about it either.  So I said what are you thinking about for the next presidency of the University?  He said well look you know you're the inside candidate and Billy Bulger is the outside candidate.  So that was pretty clear the writing was on the wall because Weld wanted to run for the U.S. Senate against Carey and Bulger was "the" big democrat in the State of Massachusetts and he didn't want this guy in the senate as head of the state senate when he was running against Carey.  So he wanted to give him a nice sweet job somewhere else and that UMass pays very well.  So that being clear, unbeknownst to me, Michael had farmed my name around to a bunch of places for presidencies of the university, different universities.  When he announced formally that he had accepted a chancellorship at North Carolina, Chapel Hill, I had received a phone call from Ann Reynolds who was chancellor of the City University of New York [CUNY].  The same day she offered me the presidency at Queens College [Queens, New York].  So I said, why not, I'm out of here and that was that, very simple transitions.
Story_ID: 22024
Speaker 1: Queens College and the City University of New York, 1995 to 1999.  Okay, so you're the president--
Speaker 2: 1995 to 2000 basically.
Speaker 1: 2000 okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm the president and that was serendipitous as well.  I mean now you know how I got into higher education administration, it's like slipping on a banana peel.
Speaker 1: Now did you miss physics research through all this, now--?
Speaker 2: I had been connected to physics research through all of it.  I had been on advisory boards.  You miss it--I will say this gently, the physics I was doing is a young man's game.  I was up working twenty hour days you know and you were--Christmas didn't matter cause I was doing stuff in the laboratory.  You know just none of that stuff made any difference.  It's, you got to be able to devote the time to it if you're going to be successful and after a while you migrate into administration anyway and you administer the big grants and you get the grants from the various agencies and you organize the groups but you didn't--, you tend to organize the physics not do the physics.  It just, it's just a lot of work but I keep up with it.  I'm on advisory boards, I review papers, I dabble in conferences, I mean that kind of stuff so I know what's going on but I don't do it. It's hard.  It's fun but it's hard.  I remember when I was a--at Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois]  when I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] the most interesting moments of my existence was when we had set up a type of measurement device called a calorimeter to measure the difference between electrons and, well leptons and hadrons but, say electrons and protons.  And there was a measurement done before by a guy named Bill Willis who was one of the great physics and it was kind of a confusing answer.  But I built this thing, I designed it, I built it with a graduate--undergraduate student, a graduate student and a couple of engineers at Harvard, we spent a bunch of money on it like, couple hundred thousand dollars anyway.  So I was sitting there in Fermilab trying to get this thing to work cause it wasn't working, it wasn't working, it wasn't working.  It was starting to tick everybody off.  So the engineer threw up his hands and went back to Cambridge.  He said, we'll never get this thing to work.  So I'm sitting there at two o'clock in the morning fiddling with this sucker and all of a sudden it just lit up.  It just went "bing," and came on and I was able to do a measurement that night by myself that showed how to get Bill Willis' answer and the right answer.  And I was only person in the world who knew that at that point.  It was the amazing.  It was freezing night in the middle of the Illinois prairie but it was the seminal experience that I've had in physics.  And that paper that I published with an undergraduate and a couple of engineers was considered one of the most important papers in nuclear experimentation in the 70s [1970s] and it's in a book on calorimetry that I have.  I mean just, it was amazing.  That's the kind of stuff that you got to be able to do but it's two o'clock in the morning you know.  And I don't mean to be nasty but when you're your age like forty-five, at two o'clock in the morning, man you're going to be in bed.  You're not going to be out there fiddling with some stupid box on the prairie.  That's not--so science unless it's small laboratory science like biology and chemistry, it's a young person's game and the big physics experiments like we mentioned at the large hadron collider now, they had 2,000 people on that experiment, 2,000.  I did it with five!  2,000 people from forty universities around the world.  I mean it's just, it's a different kind of thing and there's no you know body your age or my age or sensible will be able to do physics.  That's a young person's game, that really is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22025
Speaker 1: All right.  So Queens College [Queens, New York], this is the home of the Louis Armstrong Collection and--
Speaker 2: It is, Louis Armstrong House and Archives.  And I got a picture of myself with Hillary Clinton when she was first lady, celebrating a check from the [President Bill Clinton] administration, for the Louis Armstrong House and Archives.  That was an interesting place, it still is.  It's sitting there in, is it in Corona?  Corona or Flushing [neighborhoods in Queens], I can't remember.  It must be Corona yeah, where Louis spent his final days.  It was interesting.  Yeah, he lived there for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what are the stories from Queens College?
Speaker 2: Well the City University of New York [CUNY] is a strange place and I think it's still trying to get its act together after about 150 years.  But they're trying to centralize everything.  Two things I really pushed for at Queens.  One, very successful in the end, after I left, of course.  And one, I think focus of attention, but lost a little momentum are these:  I decided and I talked to a lot of people about this, I said you need dormitories.  You need dormitories in every place.  I mean at Queens we had incredibly bright students okay.  The average SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] score was probably you know 1100 or something like that, but it was a hundred percent commuter school.  And a lot of these kids from Queens or any place else they want to go to college but they want to get away from home.  I mean they may want to be able to go home on the weekends, but they want to get away from home for all sorts of reasons.  They got siblings, they got noise, they got distractions, they got all this other kind of stuff, they got parents who get in their way so they want to get away from home.  They want a collegiate experience.  So I said you got to have dormitories here.  I got (unclear) of stuff about you know how can you do this?  It's going to become elitist, blah, blah, blah, it's a commuter school, you know we're traditional.  I said come on, if you want to educate these kids well you have to change the learning environment.  For a lot of them it doesn't matter but for many of them it does and you got to educate everybody.  So we pushed very hard for that.  And they gave me so much grief, I said okay fine.  Now Queens College has some of the best dormitories in the country and it has transformed the environment for everybody cause when you have residence halls on the campus you have to have programs that you know are 24/7 and what happens is it affects everybody cause it changes the way the whole campus works.  So the students who are just commuters still participate in those programs and it changes the way the business is.
Speaker 1: And it enhances student life.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So Queens College two years ago was rated in the top five schools in the country for dealing with kids from low income backgrounds first time to college because of dormitories.  I mean that was--but it was a pain in the butt to get that done.

Speaker 1: Second was trying to build a research enterprise at Queens College because it's, as I say if the faculty members are not participating in research they don't know what's going on in the field.  I don't care what anybody says.  You can't read the journals and know, not if you're teaching it.  You got to really have your hands on experience.  So I was, I got--Bernie Selleck [ph.] who was a graduate of the university, of Queens College, big time cancer doc out in California in LA [Los Angeles] said he wanted to do something for the university.  He said why don't we do a cancer center, cancer research institute and I said that's a great idea.  And he said I'll give you 5 million dollars to start it.  Great, so we talked and (unclear) about who we should recruit.  And I said well I know this guy, Luc Montagnier you know he did a lot of work on the AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] virus [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], he and I--and AIDS is very similar to cancer--and he and I got to know each other when I was in Paris [France].  So I said why don't we recruit Montagnier?  He said great.  So instead of focusing just on cancer we were focused on AIDS okay, and we were focused on the AIDS vaccine.  So Bernie was tremendously happy, we got it going. The folks in the central office at the City University of New York said no, we don't want it at Queens.  Queens is not the mother ship.  The mother ship is City College and it turns out that most of the folks in the central office graduated from City College.  So they went to Bernie Selleck privately and said Bernie, if you put this at City College we'll give you all the support you need.  If you don't, we're going to try to kill it.  I got enormous crap, enormous crap from these guys because I said no.  Bernie went to Queens, he wants to do it at Queens, I recruited Montagnier to Queens, this is where we have to do it. In the end they said this guy is a has-been, Montagnier doesn't know what he's doing.  They trashed him, they trashed me, Bernie Selleck said forget about it, took his 5 million dollars back.  They closed the AIDS center.  Four years later, five years later, Montagnier gets the Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine in 2008].  Okay, so I mean we got that one right too.  I mean just absolutely ridiculous.  But there's this bureaucracy there which is kind of ridiculous and that was independent of substance.  It was really for whatever political purpose they were trying to manufacture.  I think it's going to change, I think it has to change but there are few colleges in the country as good as Queens.  I mean Brooklyn is good, Hunter, Baruch [colleges in the City University of New York system], I mean some of the other schools like [University of] Illinois, Chicago and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] is better, but you know some of the less research intensive places.
Story_ID: 22027
Speaker 1: This is an extraordinary place [Queens College, New York] and we're able to do extraordinary things and we have 17,000 students.  I mean you know, but it was a place that attracted extraordinary kids.  We're in the middle of a conservative Jewish community.  Queens College [Queens, New York] had more Jewish students than Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts] has students, period, I mean that's an intense draw.  Especially true cause it's from the conservative Jewish families, the kids can't go away to school.  So, but the young women would come you know and they just work on campus and go back.  They couldn't go away.  We had a lot of immigrants at Queens.  Queens is a melting pot.  I mean there must be fifty different languages spoken in Queens.  They all would come to Queens College.  You go to community college you come to Queens College.  It was an extraordinary place.
Speaker 2: It was a strong Caribbean connection.
Speaker 1: Huge Caribbean connection.  A huge Latino connection, you know.  You know there were--Central American connection.  It's really kind of an interesting place and it has some of the best restaurants in the world.  You can't beat it, it's just, it's an amazing place and it's got two million people in it, two million people in Queens.  It's an amazing place.  So Queens College we were able to do some interesting things.  New York's my home.  I mean what do you say?  It was a, an interesting time, not easy, not easy, but it was really fascinating.
Story_ID: 22028
Speaker 1: And I finally just sort of got fed up [at Queens College, New York] and went back to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Not a huge (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Now that's funny.  A lot of administrators say that I mean that people make, that Gordon G. at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --maybe some people will stay like a president forever but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Gordon got, they pay him 1.72 million dollars a year.  I mean come on now.  What?  I'd stay a president for life too if they paid me that kind of money.
Speaker 2: Well but you know, but I've heard people say that you know you, there's almost a ceiling on how long you can stay you know or you should stay before it's time you should, to move on to something else.
Speaker 1: Friend of mine--
Speaker 2: Do you feel like that?  Is that philosophically?
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the case.  I think at private universities they can stay a lot longer because there's not much political turbulence.  At public universities it's much more difficult.  But in order to really have a significant impact you know it--eight to ten years is probably about right, I mean it's something like that, less than that it's complicated.  Earl Richardson was at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] for twenty-five years or something like that.  He said the first five years people were trying to get rid of him, you know.  The alma mater were trying to get rid of him, the board was trying to get rid of him, the faculty was trying to get rid of him and he didn't own the place until like the sixth year when he could move it around.  Now Morgan's booming, it's thriving, Earl did a great job there even though he didn't get a lot of money from the state.  You know the lawsuits helped.  Greg Williams, good friend of mine at the University of Cincinnati [Ohio], he's been there three years.  He announced three weeks ago that he's quitting that day.  He said I've had enough of this, that day, no excuse, personal reasons, I am out of here.  So it just depends.  I mean it just, it depends a little bit on the environment, a lot on the personality but you can't stay anyplace forever.  I mean change is good.  Change is good for the person and for the institution.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it's a--but going back to Harvard was not a huge penalty.  I mean I've got good friends here, Derek Bok, the former president, he was at the Kennedy [School of Government, Harvard University].  And I talked to Derek, he said yeah why don't you come back, you know makes sense.  I said sure and that was very interesting.
Story_ID: 22029
Speaker 1: Okay, it's 2001 and you're at the Belford Center for Science and International Affairs, part of the John F. Kennedy School of Government [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I was back in some sense to where I was when I was first on the faculty at Harvard [University] because the Belford Center was the scion of the program, this little program for Science and International Affairs that we were doing and brown bag lunches.  Somebody as usual gave Harvard a bunch of money you know they built a fantastic building, got a huge endowment and got some great people to run it.  The Belford Center just took off and now it's one of the premiere academic centers for the whole issue of science and international affairs.  And John [Paul] Holdren who is now the, President [Barack] Obama's science advisor is a professor at the Belford Center at the Kennedy School [of Government].  Oh these guys really do a lot of interesting stuff.  And I had honor of going back and working with them.  I mean they're friends of mine.  John's a friend of mine.  We got him to come over and give an honorary degree commencement for example just because--and he flew back from China early just to do it, just because there's that connection.  These--the Belford Center, the folks at Harvard do some interesting things.  I was teaching U.S./Mexican relations, how to do it, how not to do it.  I was looking at U.S. energy policy and also being interested in continuing the interest in the whole nuclear weapons business and weapons of mass destruction and safeguards working with a guy named Matt Bond who's still there.  I mean it was a, it's a good place.  It's not a good place, a great place and it was an opportunity to refresh after dealing with UMass [University of Massachusetts system] and Queens [College, New York] which was politically interesting.
Speaker 1: And New York's New York, what can you say?  The seminal event when I was there was 9/11 [September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, New York City].  I mean I was walking to the lobby of the Kennedy Center--not Kennedy--the Kennedy School, the Belford Center and we look up at the TV cause they have it on the news channel all the time and you see the first tower blazing at the World Trade Center.  What the hell is going on?  And we were watching it and then the plane hit the second tower then we knew what was going on.  I mean then folks were trying to call Washington [District of Columbia] cause you couldn't get through.  Nobody, none of the phones worked because we had figured out that this was clearly a terrorist attack.  We weren't sure who but we knew that it had to be and some of us connected immediately to what happened to the World Trade Center before when this guy came on with a car and tried to do damage, tried to blow up a car in the garage.  But that was an interesting time.  It sort of set the tone for what was happening when I was there, tough time, fascinating but tough time, tough time for the nation.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Delaware State let's--anything else from the Kennedy School?
Speaker 1: No, except that Cambridge is a great place and it snows in the winter there too.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 22030
Speaker 1: Okay Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware], this is 2003, you become the president now.  Was there a connection there?  I mean what kind of connection--?
Speaker 2: I actually never heard of Delaware State [University] and I didn't apply for the job.  Somebody called me and asked me whether I was interested and I said I have no idea.  They invited me out, I drove through--I flew into Washington [District of Columbia] cause you can't, there's no airport in Delaware.  That should have been a hint. Flew into Washington, rented a car and drove out Route 50.  You're going Route 50 and then you go down into Delaware and I'm driving and I'm driving going through corn fields and cow farms and big farms and I'm saying what is going on here?  And I ended up driving and then all of a sudden there's Dover, Delaware, the capital of the first state [Delaware] and Delaware State University's an interesting place.  I mean it's a small school in the state capital, it's an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities], it's been around since 1891, needed some work.  Declining enrollment, there were some issues with facilities and it was kind of in the middle of nowhere.  But they advertise it as being close to Washington close to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] close to Baltimore [Maryland].  Come on, you don't go from Dover, Delaware commute to Baltimore and Philadelphia although I spent a lot of time in Philadelphia cause there was nothing in Dover.  Lot of intellectual resources just through Dover Air Force Base though, that's a pretty fantastic place.  But the state university of Delaware is the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] period.  Founded by DuPont family you know got over a billion dollars endowment and then there's Delaware State.  And Delaware is an interesting state.  The Mason Dixon line runs through Delaware. Totally segregated.  It was on the wrong side of the Brown v. Board of Education [1954].  They lost you know so it stayed segregated.  It's a very strange place.  And the state is also bifurcated by a canal that runs south of Wilmington [Delaware] and when you're north of the canal, people act like they're in Connecticut.  If you're south of the canal you might as well be in Mississippi.  It's just a different world you know (unclear)--
Speaker 1: It was divided during the Civil War too I think, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's just a strange place.  So Delaware State was trying to figure out how to get its act together and what we were able to do is to change the visibility.  I brought in Al Lavan as a football coach, I improved the facilities for athletics.  We built a fantastic new athletic complex.  We built new residence halls so started--part of the campus looked like University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] made really very nice.  Organized and did the first borrowing the university had ever done and financed the construction of a new student center.  They had a student center from the 1960s which was just pathetic and a wellness center for the campus and it has transformed the place.  We also had no doctoral programs.  I got the first five doctoral programs going, the first in applied mathematics and mathematical physics and in biology and some other areas and we also did one sort of in a traditional mode which was this education and leadership.  But I made sure it was rigorous enough so it is the best program in that area in the East.  I mean it just, it blows everybody else away and it's a real doctoral program.  And it's gotten huge cache.  I mean nobody else, the University of Delaware can't compete with it for example.  It just, it doesn't come close.  So the programs are vibrant and new and at the doctoral level and the enrollment is up. I mean if you build it they will come.  The governor, Jack Markell, great guy, put in scholarships, need-based scholarships.  And the current president was able to take advantage of that and they were able to grow the enrollment so Delaware State is doing very well.  It's an interesting place.  I mean it's--the best thing I think we did was change the tone of the state.  As I said the University of Delaware is a state university of Delaware and nobody even knew Delaware State was there, so I said we got to play some ball you know.  That's what happens, you got to play ball.
Story_ID: 22031
Speaker 1: So I was able to get [Al] Lavan [football coach for the Delaware State Hornets, Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] to come.  He was at, when I got him he was at Central [Eastern] Michigan [University, Ypsilanti, Michigan]  but he was an assistant for the Dallas Cowboys [football team, Dallas, Texas] and the San Francisco 49ers [football team, San Francisco, California] and had a Super Bowl ring from the 49ers, lots of pro connections so was able to recruit players.  And for the first time in twenty-five years, Delaware State [University] won the conference championship and went to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament.  And the first team they played was the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware].  We got more publicity and more cheers out of that state than the place had gotten in fifty years because of that rivalry and it continues to go.  I mean they still play the University of Delaware now, not just in the NCAA tournament but regularly.  The basketball program we invested in pretty heavily, won the MIAC [Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference] championship for the first time in, ever basically, men's and women's.  Got into the tournament, in the sixteenth seed, the first team they played was Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], number one seed.  Six million dollars worth of advertisement in 'USA Today', on NBC, Inside [Outside] the Lines, I mean it just, it was amazing.  In that week before the tournament because they were playing Duke, it was absolutely extraordinary, changed the face of the place.  So that kind of stuff has been able to generate a lot of excitement and all of a sudden now people forget that this place ever was this kind of dingy little place on the side.  They always thought it had these programs, they always thought it had these facilities and that's what you want.  I mean that's what you want.  I mean that's the kind of legacy a president wants to leave.  It wasn't me, it was a lot of other people doing it but we got it done.  It was interesting.  Delaware State is a, it's an interesting place.  It still in Dover, Delaware but it's still you know it's an interesting place.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22032
Speaker 1: So yeah, it says here that you grew sponsored programs from 8 million dollars to an estimated 40 million dollars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: That was the Ph.D. programs, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Ph.D. programs made a huge difference and we got credibility and we're producing some really strong graduates.  One of the fun things about Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware] was I bump into people all the time from [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] whose kids went to Delaware State when I was president and I bump into some of the graduates.  They said you know we were there when you were president.  We loved it, blah, blah, blah.  I said yeah well good, that's what it's all about cause you got to get your money's worth.  Nobody's going to give it back to you.
Story_ID: 22033
Speaker 1: Now there was a, when you were there, it says here there was a campus shooting [at Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: That was one of the huge tragedies when I was there.  The precursor was in Newark, New Jersey there were four kids who were hanging out in their old elementary school and they caught up in some stupid gang violence and they were murdered.  Three of them were murdered and one was injured badly and two were students at Delaware State and one was a potential student planning to come in.  So that was just a disaster.  And there was some gang that said you know they just in wrong place, wrong time.  It was really horrible.  That was in Newark.  A couple of months later there's a shooting on campus.  A young woman was killed.  It seemed to--and it was a student that did the shooting and the first thing that popped in everybody's mind was, was it connected to Newark?  Was it gang related?  Was it this kind of stuff?  Well fortunately for us when the shooting happened there was a NASCAR race taking place at Dover Downs that very same weekend and since they were expecting a pretty high level guest, I think it was [President] George H.W. Bush, the secret service was there, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was there, everybody was there.  As soon as the shooting happened we had all these federal agencies across the street, literally it's across the street, on campus doing forensics for us, doing the investigations, helping us out including the Dover P.D. [police department] and our police department.  It was an extraordinary time I mean huge collaboration.  We learned a lot of lessons.  But it was a gigantic tragedy.  I mean this guy, this kid, this freshman just got ticked off and shot and it seemed to be a random shooting killed this girl, it was just awful right in the middle of campus, right in the middle of campus.  That was a lock-down weekend.  That was one of the more unpleasant times I've ever had.  But we learned a lot and we're still talking about the lessons we learned and sharing them with other colleges and universities around the country.  But that was a very, very difficult time.  I try to blot that one out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22034
Speaker 1: And there was some concern I think, some people concerned, were concerned that the status of the school [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] as an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] was being threatened somehow by your, by--what's that about?
Speaker 2: Well we talked about HBCUs before and some folks don't really seem to understand that historic doesn't mean present you know.  Everybody loves their roots.  I love my roots.  I mean I know what most of them are, it doesn't really make a difference.  You are who you are but you're not who you're going to be.  You're going to be something else.  And if these colleges and universities, doesn't matter who they are, don't embrace everybody and don't embrace academic excellence they're going to be irrelevant, okay?  So when we put these programs at Delaware State University, people were color blind.  When I grew the faculty it's absolutely color blind.  I don't care who you are, if you're not good you're not going to get hired.  We recruit staff just like here it's absolutely color blind.  If you're not any good don't apply.  And if we attract outstanding Asian, Latino, Caucasian folks who are better than the African American folks, they're going to get the jobs, that's just the way it is.  They were worried that we were also recruiting a more diverse student body.  The answer is yes.  That's exactly what we're doing.  We were recruiting international students, Chinese students.  I had a delegation of students over there working in the Beijing [China] Olympics, broadcasting it back to the campus so we can recruit Chinese students.  I mean now they got, must have a hundred Chinese students on campus.  That's what it's about.  It's about inclusion.  The HBCU history allows us to be inclusive, allows us to accept everybody but it ain't who we are.  We're not a color.  The only color that matters is green.  I mean that was my mantra.  And folks say well you know you're not, it's not a black school anymore?  I say no it's a school and if it's not a great school it's an irrelevant school.  Just listen to the President of the United States now [in 2012, President Barack Obama], if you can't deliver quality education and people with credentials who can compete on the world stage, you don't need to be in business.  Doesn't make any difference what you call yourself.  That bothers some people.  Sorry, doesn't bother me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't see that there's a, was there a strong alumni group at all or--?
Speaker 2: It was, no.  There were a lot of noisy alumni but wasn't very strong.  And when you say strong I mean you--we're talking about people who give to the campus?  No, there maybe was hardly any ability to fundraise from the alumni.  Most of them didn't even live in Delaware.  There were some loudmouths and there still are but they didn't really contribute to the conversation.  They just wanted to say well we don't want to change and the answer is, you don't have a choice.  If this is going to be university to compete for funding and private giving, you got to be good.  You got--people have got to want to give to you.  And if you alumni loved it so much, why didn't you give money before?  Why aren't you giving money now?  If you want to preserve something give money to it.  Very difficult so I must admit I don't take any of that very seriously.
Story_ID: 22035
Speaker 1: All right, so in 2008 you went to UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  Now what happened, what was that transition like?
Speaker 2: As the law school dean says to me all the time, Dover, Delaware, Washington, D.C., it's night and day.  I mean this is in some sense the capital of the world.  I mean this is an extraordinary place.  The University of the District of Columbia was a "fix it or close it" circumstance.  I mean this place got, it's been around since 1851 in one form or another.  It got shafted in the 80s [1980s] and 90s [1990s]. The budgets were cut in half.  When the city went bankrupt and the congress took over they put in something called the control board and they basically gutted the place.  And then they were trying to mess with it ever since, not really getting its act together not giving it the facilities.  The campus was a mess when I got here.  The academic standards were not credible.  I mean it was open enrollment.  How can you be a land grant university and be open enrollment.  The research enterprise was small so I was asked by folks to come in and fix it or close it.  And that's how I got here.  I figured what--you know I didn't ask for this but challenges are fun.  Besides, Washington is a great city.
Story_ID: 22036
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, UDC all right, 2008.
Speaker 2: The University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I got recruited here.  I had no intention of coming but a guy who was here asked me whether I was interested and I said no, not particularly and he put my name in anyway.  So I came and talked to the folks and I was inspired by the fact that it was really, "fix it or close it," but they have a law school which is one of the best in the country.  The David Clarke School of Law is simply one of the best in the country and this year it was ranked as one of the twenty most innovative law schools in the nation.  And there was a time when this law school was rejected by the university.  They didn't want it.  There was the old Antioch School Law [Washington, D.C.] and the D.C. School of Law.  They just didn't want it.  And I talked to the deans and the previous deans.  They were just, they said this is how you do it here.  You just got to knuckle, just take them out and just do it even though the people are resisting.  So it's possible to build a great institution here and D.C. desperately needs it. It's the only public university in this town.  Everybody else is 50,000 dollars a year and they were charging no money, it was 3,800 dollars or something like that.  And the enrollment had gone from 17,000 to 4,700 or something like that.  So I said well okay you walk around the facilities, it was just a disaster.  So I made a pact with the then chairman of the council, Vince [Vincent] Gray who is now mayor that you know we'll try to do this thing together.  The mayor Adrian [Malik] Fenty didn't want to have anything to do with it.  He said I didn't pick you.  I want nothing to do with you.  I don't want to meet with you.  It took six months to get a meeting with him, it lasted a half an hour and then he sort of threw me out.  He said you--what you get from the counselors is what you get.  Don't ask me for anything.  I said fine, sounds like a pretty good deal.  So that's where it started, it was really kind of ridiculous.  Vince Gray was true to his word, we were able to get some resources.  I had been hustling to build some significant private funding capabilities which is working, we're investing 220 million dollars in renovation and new construction on the campus.  We have redone the plaza in collaboration with some D.C. agencies and the federal government.  We had the largest [unclear] in the District of Columbia, the neighbors now love us because we're changing their quality of life in a very positive way.  We're going to be the most sustainable college in the country, building one of the first leading platinum student centers in the nation right out in the front.  We're embracing the international community.  The biggest deal intellectually was separating out the community college.  I said you can't have a land grant university and be open admissions.  But the charter requires us to have access and open admissions.  So I said we'll separate out community college as an academic arm of the university.  It will be open admissions.  We're going to put admission standards in the University and I'm going to double the tuition.  I lowered the tuition at the community college to 3,000 dollars a year, I doubled it at the university and I put in admission standards.  Shock, it's going to kill the place, can't possibly work.  You're killing your clientele.  The admission standards had a significant impact I mean two-thirds of the students roughly who graduate from the D.C. public schools can't get into the university, they have to go to the community college.  But it changed the complexion of the place intellectually.  When I got here at the first hearing people were calling UDC the university for dumb children.  They don't say that anymore cause their kids can't get in.  Their kids can't get in.  They have to go to the community college.  Now it's prestigious to go to the flagship and not to the community college cause the community college is where you need remediation.  94 percent of the students who go to the community college from D.C. need remediation.  They can't do college level work and these are people with high school diplomas, it makes no sense, ninety four percent?  It means it's--that's a hundred percent in effect.  I mean it's--the ones who don't need it are international students.  It means the system is failing.  But the university is now the capstone and we're building it to be the capstone.  Enrollment, the applications are through the roof, enrollment is up in both places.  Folks said it would never happen.  It's already in--up this year in both places.  The quality of the faculty we were able to recruit has been extraordinary.  I mean it's just extraordinary.  The quality of the deans I've been able to bring in some of the best.  We have a provost here, Ken Bane who started in January who is internationally renowned, probably the most internationally renowned person on teaching learning in the world.  I mean and he is now the provost of this university.  He came because we have a vision of transformation and we're doing it.  We're just pulling the trigger on all sorts of stuff.  The students are beginning to love it.  When I got here this place looked derelict.  It doesn't look derelict anymore.  We're getting significant political support to get it done because we're doing it.  I mean in D.C., they're used to folks talking as you can imagine like in congress and nothing happens.  Well we said we're going to do it and we're doing it.  It's working.  It's a difficult environment because of the politics.  Congress owns D.C., you know it just, it's little flexibility.  It's a very small political class that feels they can do almost anything they want and sometimes they mess up in significant ways.  So we have a political crisis on our hands now where two members of the council, including the chair of the council are going to jail.  One's in jail, the council's chair is probably going to jail.  He's been convicted of a couple of felonies.  The mayor is under siege probably unreasonably so but you know you still have the environment there.  It's a mess.  It's just a mess and we don't have a vote in congress but congress controls the place.  But I've been able to use that to my advantage cause everybody understands higher education.  Everybody understands land grants.  And I talked to folks from Kansas and I talked to folks from New York and I talked to folks from Wyoming, they got the land grant piece in there. Every state should have a state university (unclear) so it's been an opportunity that's been interesting but you know it's tight and nobody understands the purpose of public higher education so we have to redefine it which is what we're doing now and it's an interesting exercise.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now I was surprised to read in some of our research here that UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] is an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].  How did that take place, happen or--?
Speaker 2: Well UDC, it's not really an HBCU in fact.  It was founded in 1851 as a school for colored girls.  That was a predecessor institution by an abolitionist, Matilda Miner.  It was, you all come, anybody could come.  But Washington [D.C.] was totally segregated in the 1850s and they founded another school called Wilson Teachers College for white girls in the 1880s, 1890s.  And when desegregation happened they merged so you had this black school and this white school merging in 1954 and that became D.C. Teachers College.  And then they founded another college called Federal City College which is a liberal arts undergraduate college and then there was Wentworth Technological Institute.  In 1976, they were all brought together into the University of the District of Columbia.  It is an 1862 land grant university and there was no HBCU, anything associated with it.  Eleanor Holmes Norton, when the funding was really tight in 90s [1990s], late 90s [1990s], '97 [1997], '98 [1998], was able to cut a deal with congress to give the university access to Title III funds, which is money that goes to minority serving institutions, certainly black colleges and universities and that's where that come from.  We were able to get some of the money but in fact it's not a, an HBCU.  It's just a state university.
Speaker 1: What are the demographics of the student body at present?
Speaker 2: 20 percent of the students are international students which is a significantly larger portion.  Probably 60 percent come from D.C., but most of the D.C. students even though their D.C. residents, are international students, a lot of them are from the Caribbean, a lot of them are from Asia.  The largest population of students, international students here are Nepalese, I don't know why they're Nepalese.  It's looking like the demographic of D.C. if you walk around the law school is probably the most diverse law school in the country.  It's probably 40 percent minority and the campus is trending in that direction as well.  I mean D.C. is no longer a majority minority and the university is becoming less majority minority.  So it's looking probably 60 percent African American now trending down.  That's my guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was--
Speaker 2: As it grows it's going to change.
Speaker 1: Just walking by here every evening for a half of the summer I see that there are quite a number of African students on the sidewalk in the front talking and moving in and out.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of African students here, yep.  And that's interesting.  I don't quite know why but there, a lot of them are Caribbean as well.  But I was surprised that the largest number, largest single contingent of international students are the Nepalese and a lot of the African students are D.C. residents.  So they, they're citizens of the District of Columbia but they're not D.C. residents.  It turns out you only have to be here a year and become a D.C. resident so they come here, they're here for a year and then they go and pay state tuition so that's why we have a lot of them cause it's the only place in town you can do that and they want to be in D.C.  So that's probably the origin of a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I talked to a couple of engineers who are cab drivers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going to school here.
Speaker 2: Oh we have a lot of them, yeah have a lot of them.  That's because this is an upwardly mobile place.  There is no other place you can go.  They're not going to go to Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.].  They're not going to go to American University [Washington, D.C.] (unclear) 55,000 dollars a year.  I mean it's ridiculous.  So this is the only place and we will embrace you, it doesn't matter who you are.  If you got a high school diploma, you can get into the community college.  If you have the academic credentials, you can get here, it's 7,000 dollars a year for a full time student.  If you want to go part time it's a lot less than that.  You can't do that anywhere else in this town.
Story_ID: 22038
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wonder too about you know do you have like a STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education model?  I mean I know Freeman Hrabowski [president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)] has been so successful over at University of Maryland, Baltimore with the STEM message and programs.
Speaker 2: We have a STEM initiative and it's really kicking off with the new guys we brought and the new dean, engineering, the new provost, bringing a new dean of arts and sciences, that's where the STEM stuff basically sits.  We have a new dean of the college of agriculture, urban sustainability environmental sciences.  We're looking at agriculture as a STEM discipline as well cause it's really pretty high tech, especially urban agriculture.  So we're building that into a transformative approach to STEM where it's going to be hands on.  I mean the way you're going to learn engineering here is you do engineering.  You don't have to go into engineering courses first.  You do engineering and then you go to the courses.  The same thing is true for agriculture and urban sustainability.  You go and understand--or in architecture.  You go and do architecture first.  You figure out how to design something before you actually understand, have to worry about the details of the engineering architecture because it turns out when students actually do stuff they then understand better why they're learning it and they'll learn it better.  So we, we're using a model that was pioneered at Northwestern [University, Chicago/Evanston, Illinois] to bring the students into the disciplines early, let them practice it and then begin to learn about why they're doing it and that's something that's catching on, seems to be working.
Story_ID: 22039
Speaker 1: Now I wondered just thinking about your background and the student population and being here in the city of Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], if international studies and African and Caribbean studies especially might be you know something you would focus on?
Speaker 2: We're focusing on international studies but in all disciplines cause our belief, it's certainly my belief is that if you're going to get an MBA [Master's in Business Administration] or a bachelors [degree] of accounting or you're going to get an engineering degree you got to compete internationally.  So you need to know international affairs.  You need to know entrepreneurship.  You need to know the way other cultures and other businesses work internationally.  You need to be able to, if you're going to go into computer engineering, you need to know what happens in India so we have collaborations with IIE, the International--Indian Institute of Engineering just to understand how that plays.  So we're getting faculty exchanges.  We have a campus in Egypt.  Most people don't know we have a campus outside of Cairo [Egypt] called, in a place called Mati.  It's been an engineering and business school for some time which we're revitalizing cause after the revolution all sorts of things changed.  So we're dealing with that in a special way and I want to send somebody full time over there to manage that campus but we have the ability to be very international across the board.  Our students should be going over there, their students should be coming here.  We should be the international model and not just in the Caribbean but globally cause the competition in this town is global.  I mean we got every international organization and multi-lateral organization in the world in this town.  That's where the jobs are.  The government can hire anybody they want, the engineering firms, Lockheed, Boeing, these other folks who are just in suburban [Washington,] D.C., that's where the jobs are.  50 percent at least in the federal work force is going to turn over in the next ten years if not sooner, 5-0 percent.  What is that, a million and a half people?  We got to be training people all the technical people for those jobs from the water resource experts to the office managers.  I mean we should be there.  We got to do the business management.  We got to deal with the folks who are working for OMB [Office of Management and Budget].  We got to deal with the people in the Department of Defense [DOD].  That's what we should be doing and we need to be able to train people who can compete with anybody anywhere in the world and they got to understand who those people are.  So the international piece should be embedded in everything we do and that's what we're doing.  That's what we're trying to do.
Story_ID: 22040
Speaker 1: Now do you have a timetable for your presidency [at the University of the District of Columbia, (UDC)] in terms of what you--and what stage would you be satisfied with before you retire?
Speaker 2: The best thing about timetables is you never believe them and the best thing about plans is they don't happen.  So I don't do either.  But when I told these folks when I was coming in 2008, it's a ten-year project I mean it's really a ten-year turnaround.  I don't know if I want to be here that long but it's a ten-year turnaround.  We have turned it, but not around yet.  You know we've turned it and it's moving and people are feeling really good about it.  I got people who are very wealthy coming up to me saying we'll help you raise some money.  The place never raised significant dollars before.  That's changing.  But it's going to take a while.  For me you know I got opportunities, two little kids.  Maybe I want to go and sit on the beach and sip margaritas for a while, I don't know.  But the idea of turning this place around is something that galvanized me.  I wouldn't be here otherwise and it's a tremendous opportunity.  It just, it is and if we can make it work people are just going to be stunned because nobody believed we could.  Nobody believed we could.  I mean four years ago they thought I was crazy.  Nobody is saying that now.  It is no longer the university for dumb children.
Story_ID: 22041
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now sir when you look back at everything you've done till this point in life, is there anything that you would do differently if you could and change?
Speaker 2: Probably ten million things I would do differently but I don't know--I thought about that question cause I knew you would ask it.  You don't know whether you would do things differently until you see the results of the things you would have done differently and you can't possibly know that.  So I mean the objective answer is there are things that I could have done differently but I have no idea whether it would have been better or worse.  I could have done things differently that would have made me feel better.  Whether it would have been a better outcome I have absolutely no idea.  So in retrospect I don't even worry about that stuff because you never can know.  I told you how I got to all these places that I've gotten to.  None of them have been planned, you know.  In some sense had I done something differently early on, those opportunities wouldn't have availed themselves so I wouldn't have had the opportunities.  So it would have been different.  I don't know whether it would have been better.  I don't know if I would have done it differently.  I could have, but I don't know.  I just don't think I can answer that credibly cause I just don't know what the outcome would have been.  No idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22042
Speaker 1: And likewise when you look back at everything now that you've done till this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Surviving.  What we've, and I say we cause you know nobody does anything, there are no heroes, there are no single heroes.  You know it's just, there's no Homer you know in the Iliad it's just nonsense.  What I've been able to do with a lot of people is change the playing field for other folks.  In the sciences we were able to change the play field. In diplomacy, you know people realized that it's okay to have black guys walking around cause they might know something that you don't know.  In education we've made it clear and there's a lot of people making this clear that you got to educate everybody and it's got to be at the highest level possible or nobody is going to succeed.  Doesn't matter where you're coming from, if you think you had riots in the 60s [1960s] you ain't seen nothing until you--to have a bunch of uneducated people who have nowhere to go in a failing economy and in 2012, you got--you ain't seen nothing yet.  Everybody has got to have a shot.  You got to make sure that there is nobody out there who never had a shot to have a shot.  I mean that's what this is all about.  I don't know that I hold myself up as an example for anybody.  I just do stuff you know.  And when you're successful you're nice.  I get awards and I keep on telling folks you live long enough people will send you a piece of paper, you know.  But it's not something I would consider sort of a, all that important.  What's my legacy?  I let other people write my obituaries cause I won't know what it says.  It's whatever they say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22043
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question, what--and you've addressed it somewhat already--but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The biggest concern I have is one that Bill Cosby and I shared.  I mean how do you get these kids from not--not to screw up?  You got these kids in middle school with raging hormones and these stupid little black boys talking to these naive and foolish black girls saying I want you to have my baby and they go and get pregnant and they're fourteen, fifteen years old.  That's just so fundamentally stupid it's unbelievable but you can't change it.  It's been going on forever.  What do we have to do?  You can't change it by saying it's stupid, you got to do something differently.  How do we engage these kids so we don't lose another generation?  How do we fix the public school so we don't have kids graduating as we do in the District of Columbia [D.C.] from high school with third grade reading levels?  It's criminal.  Those are mostly minority kids cause the other parents in middle and upper income brackets would never let that happen to their kids.  You got fourteen year olds raising babies.  You got babies raising babies.  What the hell do they know?  They can't read themselves so how are you going to read to your kid if you can't read yourself?  Those things really concern me.  The black male issue is an issue.  But that's, it's a different kind.  Whether it's global, I think you attack it early.  I mean Vince Gray is pushing hard for early childhood education.  You educate people early but you got to educate the parents first.  If you don't educate the parents along with the kids you're not going to educate the kids.  How much time do kids stay in school?  So I think we have a collective problem of educating our kids up to national if not global standards and if we don't do that, there's nothing else we can do that's going to matter.  I mean if they're not educated, there's nothing else we can do that's going to matter.  These are bright kids, many of them are entrepreneurial.  You see what they do in the street.  You know they (unclear) these are not stupid people but they don't understand what they can in fact do.  They don't understand what the world allows them to do.  What they see is this little pocket of places that they've never been out of.  For example there are folks just across the river in Anacostia in D.C. who have never been to the [national] mall.  They don't know the Smithsonian [museums] is for them.  They don't know they can go in for free.  They have no idea cause nobody's told them and nobody's taking them.  That's not just here, that's globally.  I mean it's globally for African Americans in this country.  How do you deal with that is a huge issue?  The education issue is a, it's the next civil right.  We got to deal with this.  It's a human right it's more than a civil right.  How we grasp that is a complicated issue.  But we can't blame anybody else.  And this is us.  I mean every--other folks have figured it out.  I mean you got people saying stupid things and defaming other minority communities like the Asian American communities.  Well how come they can stick together and how come they get all these grants?  Because they do it, you know.  Get off your ass and do it!  You can't blame them for your not doing it.  The only person you can blame for your not doing it is you.  We got to get rid of the slave mentality, we got to get rid of the fact that somebody owes us anything cause nobody owes us anything.  The folks in India don't care if you're a crack baby.  The folks in Bangkok [Thailand] could care less if you're growing up in poverty.  I mean the folks in Dublin [Ireland], why would they care?  The game is to game you and if you can't get your act together it's on you, it's not on them.  You can't blame them for their success.  And that's one of the things we have to change.  We have to stop blaming others for their success.  They're supposed to be successful.  We've got to educate ourselves to be successful and I don't see that happening.  I just--that bothers me.  So we're trying to do it in a little way here.  We're trying to affect the school system.  Michael Bloomberg [mayor of New York City] was here yesterday and talked about what they're doing in New York but we as a community, as a group, as a nation have got to embrace that.  Without doing that we're going to fail collectively.  This is not just a black problem, this is everybody's problem and there are no excuses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22044
Speaker 1: Well tell us something about your family.
Speaker 2: The current one?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah not the family history but the current family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've got two daughters from a previous marriage.  One's a senior at the University of Rhode Island [Kingston, Rhode Island] studying fashion merchandising and fabric chemistry and is doing spectacularly well.  She's going to be graduating into a paid job in the fashion industry.  She had a paid internship this summer which is amazing, a second daughter who is a junior at Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire].  She's studying mathematics and physics but she probably won't go into physics cause she finds it a little too strange.  But she might go into medical school, we'll see.  And then I've got a five and a half year old in kindergarten and a four year old boy in, the only son, in pre-k [pre-kindergarten] and it's a hoot actually.  And it's a lot of fun.  It keeps me jumping but it keeps me grounded too.  When I come into a place like this and see all the craziness and look at the politics, then I go home and see the kids, it's fine.  You don't take any of this stuff personally cause it's not about you.  It's the stuff at home that matters.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your wife is from Europe, is that correct?
Speaker 2: My wife is from Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My first wife was Austrian.  This wife, my current wife is from Ohio and Wisconsin and she went to Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] which just beat Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania] in football.  And she has a master's degree from the Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] in public policy.  And at the moment she's been trying to get these kids off her back so now that they're both in school she's looking at what else to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how is your brother [Albert Sessoms] doing?
Speaker 2: Oh my brother.  My brother lives in Florida and he's a small business guy.  He, after he ran downstairs from my father [Albert Earl Sessoms] chasing him and went into the [U.S.] Air Force he actually got a bachelors degree and two masters degrees from the University of Maryland, University College.  He taught high school.  He spent twenty-one years in the military, retired and taught high school for a couple of years.  Now he's got a business, a security business in Florida.  He has four sons, two of them living in Germany and one is a colonel in the [U.S.] Army and I can't remember quite what the other one does.  My sister is a physician.  She graduated from Hunter College in New York got her M.D. [Doctor of Medicine] from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] cause I leaned on her.  She wanted to go to another place where the doctors were cuter and I said you--don't even ask.  And she actually was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in medical school so they paid for everything.  So she went to school--she had a lot of cash.  She has been a very successful physician.  She had a string of alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinics in the, in Connecticut, made a lot of money.  She was running emergency medicine in Northern Virginia during 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks in New York City] and she decided that was not something that she wanted to continue to do so she now has a farm in Oregon outside of Portland and she's doing whatever she does.  She's working, I think she's working for the Air Force now doing some classified work but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your dad and your mother [Lottie Beatrice Leff]?
Speaker 2: They both passed away.  My dad passed away when he was fifty-seven and my mother passed away when she was about sixty-seven.  It was a while ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22045
Speaker 1: But the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: The answer objectively is that I don't really care cause I won't know how people remember me.  So in some sense to me it doesn't matter.  What matters is what you do and if people remember what you do and it's positive that's fine.  People ask me you know what do you think it will--I said my obituary has already been written.  I've been doing enough stuff so people can write a book on this and maybe I'll write my own book like Henry Kissinger [politician and diplomat] has written three books to write his own obituary.  He's smart, you know that's what he's done, brilliantly done.  I mean his books are great.  But I, what I want people to think of me is I really don't care.  I want people to think of me whatever they want.  I mean we are doing things that are important.  Nobody is going to love you, nobody is going to hate you unnecessarily.  Well maybe I don't know about that.  But it's whatever it is.  But to me, I won't be here.  I don't care.  The folks who should care are the folks who are going to be following me, trying to see what they can do and what matters is what they think of me when they're doing what they're doing and whether they find what I have done useful for them.  And I won't know that, but they will.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Pleasure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
