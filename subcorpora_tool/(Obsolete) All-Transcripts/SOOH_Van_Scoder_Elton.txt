 L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  Today is February 27, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. I am in Tipton, Oklahoma, at the home of Elton and  Lura Fay VanScoder. I will be interviewing Elton today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series. Thank you for having me  today.  Thank you.  Let   s start out by having you tell me a little bit about your childhood and  about your time growing up.  Well, I was born over in the other side of Tillman County, east side on  the Chattanooga mail route on what my grandparents VanScoder, Silas  VanScoder, owned. The folks moved up north of there, north of the  Pleasant Valley Schoolhouse, and my brother was born there. Then we  moved to a school lease after that, one that my grandfather had had. He  had four married children and he gave each a quarter of  the section .  We went to school at Pleasant Valley, a little one-room school. We had  no lunches, of course, no buses. Didn   t even have a well. The teacher  would bring in a ten gallon can of water and that was our drinking water  through the day. There would usually be about forty students.  Oh wow.  In the wintertime we had one stove over on one side, close to the back. It  had a great big round cover around it, so we wouldn   t get up close and  get burned. And also, it was supposed to circulate the heat a little bit. I  went through the fifth grade there, and then my folks moved to  Chickasha, and Dad got a good job there. Chickasha Oil Company was  building a big cotton compress and he got on as a carpenter, good wages.  5  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  In fact, he was making fifty cents an hour, which we considered good  wages. Ten hours a day, six days a week. So he had thirty dollars a  week. Everything was going great and then the worldwide depression  hit, and things went bad right fast. No work, nothing being built and  over the next few years we had it pretty rough. We moved out east of  Chickasha onto a farm and then moved back three years later, back into  Chickasha. I graduated from high school there.  What year was that?  1936.  How many siblings did you have growing up?  I have one brother,  Lauren Roy VanScoder . He is dead now, but he  was born just north of where I was born, just north of Pleasant Valley  School on my Grandpa and Grandma Wade   s place. One thing I really  enjoyed growing up, Pony Creek ran into Horse Creek. Right below that  was a good place to fish, and the Wade family would get together for a  fish fry. We   d take one of these big cast iron kettles, like Mother always  boiled her clothes in in the summertime. You fill that partly full of  grease, and you take a seine and in about thirty minutes, you have all the  fish you wanted for a fish fry.  Quanah Parker, with his braves, used to come along there and he and my  Granddad  Henry Wade  got to be very good friends, because that was a  good place to fish and hunt. He would come up to their house and visit a  while every time they came over there. He was living over back toward  Indiahoma at that time.  Then we moved to Michigan in 1927 Dad got a good job up there, a real  good job, good paying job. Everything went great until the cold weather  started and we went back home and we had to stay in Frederick until  Dad could get the place back. He had rented until the first of the year.  One thing as a youngster I can remember we liked to do, it would come  a big rain and we had a lot of prairie dogs in the pasture. Of course, Dad  tried everything he could think of to kill out the prairie dogs. He   d  poison them and it didn   t do any good. They kept multiplying faster than  we could kill them. But, I remember my cousins William and Alton  Gray lived up north of us and would come down after a big rain. We   d  take the little coaster wagons and buckets and everything we could get  hold of and we   d go down and fill everything up with water, dig  trenches from the waterholes over to the prairie dog holes. When I was  standing there by the hole with a stick, we   d beat them over a head when  it came out. (Laughs)  6  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  Would people eat prairie dogs?  No, not that I know of. We never did, but anyway that wasn   t a very  practical thing to do because we really needed the water on the grass  better than we needed the prairie dog hole, but we thought that was fun.  (Laughs)  What were some of your chores growing up?  Well, first thing I remember having a chore was doing dishes because  we had several cows, milk cows, and Mother would go out and help Dad  milk the cows. We were too small to milk the cows, but we could do the  dishes. I don   t know how practical that was, but anyway, later in a  psychology class at Southwestern, I liked to argue with the teacher, and  he seemed to like it, too. And one day he was talking about phobias and  he said,    Some people even after they get through washing the dishes,  they   ll wash the glass out before they get a drink, before they fill it with  water to get a drink.    He said,    Now that   s a phobia.    And I said,    No,  you   re wrong. I do that all the time. The reason I do it, we have two  preschool daughters that do the dishes.    (Laughs) Anyway, he thought  that was all right. I guess he liked me arguing with him because he did  give me an A in the class. (Laughs)  But, at this schoolhouse   always there is a big long switch. We were  right close to the creek. The first day of school, teacher would go down  there and cut a long stick. (Laughs) And had two nails and hung it up  there and we could all look at that all the time. The teachers were pretty  good at using that. In fact, they were pretty good using several things.  The last whipping I got in school was in the fifth grade with U.N.  Hooker (that   s J.T.   s uncle). We were getting into it pretty well, and the  teacher got us both and gave us both a whippin   . You know those big old  belts that you used on the thrashing machine? Pull the belts? Or the  flywheel on a tractor? Well, I think that   s what she had. (Laughs) She  was a big woman and she could really raise us up, but I guess we needed  it anyway. We weren   t supposed to be fighting.  Then we moved to Chickasha in    29. Everything was going great. Went  to school there one year, and out east of there three years, and back into  Chickasha and graduated in    36. Then right after that we moved to  Arkansas, and I mean, we were primitive farmers. I had planted corn  with a one row walking planter with one horse (Laughs) and we had  double shovels. Everything we had was walking tools and there wasn   t  any way you could make money like that. Of course, a lot of other  people weren   t making a whole lot of money. But anyway, my dad and  brother and I worked at the saw mill for part of the time we were down  there, and we were lucky to have that job. In fact, the saw mill was set  7  R. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  up on my granddad   s place. It had a lot of timber on it and the place we  were farming was right there where the saw mill was. Then when they  got through cutting there, they cut the pine trees down to an eight inch  stump. I went with them over east of Mena,  Arkansas,  and I worked  over there for several weeks. Slept on the ground, drank out of a stream,  did my own cooking and kind of learned to rough it, which might have  been handy a little later when I went to the service.  What kind of work was that?  At the saw mill?  At Mena. Was that logging?  Oh, well yeah. They were cutting logs, cutting pine timber and you  might remember Lum and Abner on the radio? Okay, Lum   s dad had a  planing mill there in Mena and he bought the lumber from the mill  where I worked. I knew a lot of those people that Lum and Abner had  talked about. In fact, they just talked about people in the community.  They knew a lot of people at our post office, Potter, and they knew a lot  of people around there. So, I knew a lot of people they talked about on  the radio. In fact, they were having a contest there in Mena and they had  decided there would be two black guys put on the skit there, and the  three guys right in front of them did the same thing. So, they decided to  just throw everything out. They just started talking about people in the  neighborhood and kept it up for years.  Then we moved to west Texas looking for   as I say, we were not  making much money in Arkansas and didn   t look like we ever were. But  anyway, we moved to west Texas. Again, my grandparents sold out and  they moved to Tipton. I don   t know why, but anyway they moved to  Tipton. My Grandpa had a stroke and the children were taking care of  him. He was at home. He was paralyzed from his waist down, and  Mother thought she had to take her turn. It was too far to drive back and  forth from Lubbock. My dad was doing carpenter work and my brother  and I, we were all doing carpenter work and we got here to Tipton.  Nothing going on except WPA. In fact, they were working on the block  where he lived, and that must have been three-hundred people working  in that one block with shovels. Tipton had had a problem with water  flooding and the WPA came in and they ran a line on Davis Street all the  way from the east end clear to the west.  A drainage pipe?  It wasn   t a pipe. It was just an open ditch, and they lined it with brick  and cement. You never saw a prettier piece of work. I mean, there were  8  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  no dips or anything. Everything was just smooth as it could be, clear  from one end all the way across town. And that took care of the drainage  problem. A few years later, the town board decided they didn   t like that.  So they filled in that drainage ditch and started having flooding in  Tipton again, and we still have it. In fact, I   ve seen water running from  one side of the street down Main Street going into the buildings from  rain.  So did you work on the WPA projects?  No, no. Well, in fact, I was a little bit young. I think you had to have a  family to get on that, but I don   t know. In fact, we never were on that,  but most people were.  Did your family raise gardens?  Yes. When I was a youngster we raised gardens. Our main crop was  probably cotton and we didn   t see much of my dad during cotton pulling  time. The closest gin was Chattanooga, but he had to cross the creek and  there was a steep bank on the east side going up toward Chattanooga. A  team couldn   t pull the bale of cotton up that bank. So, he   d bring his  cotton to Frederick and he only had one wagon. He had two teams, but  he only had one wagon and he   d try to leave about four o   clock to load  the cotton and come to Frederick, where everybody had to line up and  wait. You had to stay with your wagon because if you went to town or  someplace and just left it, people behind you pulled in front and got  ahead of you. He   d usually be around midnight getting back home and  since he didn   t have but the one wagon, he   d put a tarp or something on  the ground. People put the cotton on the ground and then he   d have to  scoop, fill the wagon, tromp it down, go back the next day.  Wheat was probably our next crop, and then we had several herd of  cows that we milked. We sold cream part of the time and butter part of  the time, and next one was probably turkeys. We had quite a heard of  turkeys every year. My mother took care of the hatching of the turkeys.  We had an incubator down in the cellar. They had built a storm cellar,  just dug it out of the dirt and put a top on it. That was the best place to  keep the incubator because the temperature would stay just about the  same down there without much trouble, and he had also built a cellar. He  and Mother, besides a cellar they had built a cistern. Dad would get  down with a shovel, dig the dirt up and put it in a bucket. Mother would  pull it up and empty it. When I was a youngster, he built a pond. We  were living on the north side of the quarter and the pond was way down  on the south side of the quarter and a little bit to the west, which was a  little over a half a mile. Dad came in from work at noon. Even before I  started to school, I would take the team to water. The team would go to  9  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  water, but they wouldn   t come back. (Laughter) So I   d hold the harness  and take them down to water and bring them back.  Talking about the turkeys, would you all butcher them?  No, we sold them, but then they had produce houses in all the towns.  They   d buy them and butcher them or else sell them to someone else.  So if your family wanted to eat turkey, you   d butcher your own?  Yes, we ate turkeys.  What are some things you remember your mom cooking? Some favorite  dishes?  Well, I remember one time my birthday was coming up and Mother  asked me what kind of cake I wanted for my birthday. I said I wanted  some of those muffins with some of that stuff she put on top of it. I don   t  remember what kind of muffins they were (Laughs), but anyway they  had a lot of icing on top and I liked those. I said I   d like to have that for  my birthday. But, she did a lot of cooking. In fact, nearly 100 percent of  our bread was baked by Mother and she would try to have it come out of  the oven just about the time we would come home from school. She  would slice off a big chunk from each end, put a lot of butter on it, jelly  or something, and we   d have that for a snack.  One of my aunts, my Aunt Effie Gray, raised geese. She had a goose  nearly every holiday. Thanksgiving, Christmas or anything, and we   d  have dinner with them lots of times. They always had goose, but we had  turkey. My grandparents also had geese and kept them for their feathers.  They   d pull out these little fine feathers out of their breasts and stuff  pillows and feather beds. As a youngster, we used to like to go over to  my Grandpa and Grandma Wade   s. They had one of these, I think you  call it Murphy beds. The thing stood up nearly to the ceiling. It must  have been about eight feet wide and probably about three feet deep, and  you let it down. I   d get in there in the feather bed and sink down in there  and I couldn   t see out. (Laughs)  I remember one time I was just a little fellow. I was at Grandpa and  Grandma Wade   s and my folks had gone some place. I don   t know why  they left me there. But anyway, I was complaining about not having  anything to play with. Finally, Grandma emptied the matches out of the  matchbox and punched a little hole in the end, tied a string on it, and a  button on the other end. I remember pulling that around and around.  (Laughs) So I had a play pretty.  10  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  We usually went to the Christmas trees, usually at Pleasant Valley.  Sometimes we went to Haskell. We were about the same distance from  Pleasant Valley and Haskell, and we went to church services at Haskell  Schoolhouse, but we went to school at Pleasant Valley. So we were kind  of drawn between the two places. And I remember, I think it was in the  second grade, Pleasant Valley, and of course they had a school program  every year. People would come running in every little bit with a  telegram,    Santa Claus is coming this way, about half way between  Canada and here     And it so happened that just about the time the  program was over, Santa Claus would get there every time. (Laughs) I  remember one time Santa Claus came in the back door,    Ho, ho, ho      And I thought,    Santa Claus has got a cap just like Dad   s.    Dad had  bought a cap just about a week before that. People then didn   t buy   you  know, if you were going to get new stuff you got it at Christmas, you  didn   t get it a week before. But anyway, he had a cap just like Dad   s  new cap. And Dad had some new boots just like Santa Claus   s boots. I  thought,    He sounds like just Santa Claus.    Then I thought,    That   s not  Santa Clause, that   s Dad     (Laughs) That ruined my Santa Clause from  then on.  Would he bring gifts?  Oh yeah. Everybody took their gifts and put them under the Christmas  tree. Then people didn   t know any better, but they   d put live candles on  the Christmas tree and paper rings and stuff. I know one time we had a  bad spell just before Christmas, and we didn   t go to either place for a  Christmas tree. It was really a blizzard and our folks woke us up  sometime during the night after we had gone to sleep. Lauren and I each  got a tricycle, and I remember we rode those tricycles round and round  in the house there nearly all night long. (Laughs)  That was the night Babbs Switch School burned. They had candles on  the tree and papers on the tree. All the schoolhouses had two doors. One  end was the door of the schoolhouse and then the other end, but the  Christmas tree was close to one door and the people all ran to try to get  out the other door. The doors open to the inside, and the people were  crowding so fast through the first one that they wouldn   t let them get  back to get the door open. That very year, the legislature passed some  new laws that said from then on all schoolhouse doors had to open to the  outside. They also said you couldn   t use candles on the trees. You  couldn   t use paper on them, anything that was  flammable . Anyway,  that was the night that Babbs Swtich School burned.  Do you know how many perished?  No, there was quite a bunch. Have you seen that monument?  11  L. Wilson  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  I don   t think so.  Where is that at? What year was that approximately?  It must have been  December 24, 1924 . We used to go by it going to  Weatherford. Nothing there except the monument now, no schoolhouse.  What other holidays or celebrations would you have with your family or  community?  Well, we lived about three-quarters of a mile from each set of  grandparents. So we were with the family, one side or the other, time  after time, all the time. We were really lucky to be in that position. We  miss our children. Our grandchildren are too far away, but I was with  relatives all the time when I was a youngster, which is really nice.  So did you have a lot of family traditions?  Oh yeah. We went in for everything. And my folks were supporters for  the Tipton Home from the very beginning when they first moved down  there. I was at the first Thanksgiving here at the Tipton Home. They  borrowed lumber from the lumber yard to put on saw horses, made saw  horses sitting on there and people brought their own meals. I remember  Mother cooked for two or three days there before that, we came over for  that. And we had lots of company, especially on Sundays. Brother  Whitaker used to come over to Haskell School and preach one weekend  a month, and he came home with us quite often from services. We were  always with family, which is really nice.  You mentioned that your grandfather was friends with Quanah Parker.  Yes.  Did you meet him?  Oh no.  Do you remember hearing many stories?  Oh yeah. Mother told lots of stories. In fact, she was scared to death of  the Indians. But he   d come up and visit with Grandpa. Grandpa got  along fine with him. We didn   t have any timber on the place where I  lived as a youngster. Dad would go around Indiahoma and take the  wagon over there, and he   d buy a load of lumber from one of those  Indians. Blackjack mostly, for fifty cents. Of course, he had to cut it and  12  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  put it in the wagon and everything. The Indians didn   t do anything. They  were just getting that money free. (Laughs)  Fire wood?  Yeah, to burn.  What are some stories you remember about Quanah Parker?  Well, I don   t really remember much except what Mother told me, but  that was really a good hunting place, a good fishing place up and down  that creek then. Of course, there   s probably no water in it now, I don   t  know. But he liked to travel up and down there and visit with the people  that live in there.  To change the subject a little bit, my granddad was a U.S. Deputy  Marshal back before statehood. He was asked to go on the hunt when  Teddy Roosevelt came down. He   d go out east of Frederick on what   s  Number Five now to the bridge over Deep Red, and on the south side of  the road, I guess there   s still a spring there. Anyway, when I was a  youngster there was a spring there and that   s where Roosevelt made his  headquarters. I read several accounts that said that country was  uninhabited. Nobody lived around there. But my grandparents were  living about four miles north and about a mile east at that time. And part  of the hunt was on land that he had leased. He subleased from the  Wagner Ranch. They had a whole lot of that land leased from the  Indians. And they hunted on part of that land that he had. He was quite a  hunter himself. Of course, he was in the neighborhood, but that wasn   t  the reason they asked him to go on the hunt. He had the best pack of  Russian wolfhounds in the country, and they used his hounds to run  wolves down. Wolf stories don   t say anything about that. That kind of  ruins the catching them by hand, but they had already been run down  before they were caught by hand.  Didn   t have any energy probably.  Yeah, the dogs already had them worn out.  So did your grandpa tell you stories about the hunt?  No, not much. And he didn   t tell us much about being the law. Of  course, that was even before statehood, and after statehood   he carried a  .44 rifle and a .44 pistol. Sometimes he   d be gone maybe a couple of  weeks at a time, but he kept his pistol there in the northwest bedroom in  a dresser drawer. I   ve seen his pistol many times and the rifle, too. And  in fact, my Grandpa Wade had a shotgun when he came to this country. I  13  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  have that shotgun right now, and he always kept it under the bed. As  youngsters, we would play hide and go seek. We would get under the  bed and the gun was under there the whole time. (Laughs) Of course,  when I was in the service I kept my rifle in bed with me. (Laughs) I put  my blankets down and that rifle would be right beside me. I   d go to  sleep with my hand right behind the trigger so I could shoot without  taking it out of the blanket. (Laughs)  Do you know how your grandparents came to settle in this area?  My Grandpa VanScoder came from Ohio with his older brother   Lemuel  and his sister-in-law when he was a young man, I think maybe  about twenty or twenty-one, and they went to Texas.  Were they considered Dutch or do you know anything about the name?  VanScoder, the name is supposed to come from Holland or Belgium. I  don   t know which. In fact, I can   t trace it back that far. Now on my  Grandma Wade   s side, I can trace some of her and my Grandma  VanScoder, I can trace some of those back to the 1500s in Ireland. So  far, I haven   t been able to trace back   but my grandpa went to Texas  down around Montague County, and then he married an Indian woman  who lived in Ohio. I don't know whether they knew one another. I  suppose they knew one another before he came to Texas, but anyway, he  married her and they had two children, twins, Zenus and Zora. They had  another child, Walen, and either at birth or soon after she died. Grandpa  had these two little twins and this baby, and he got  George and Malissa   Givens to take care of them. Now, the Givens had a little two room log  cabin close to Forestburg. They were bound to have plenty of room  because Grandma had one sister and each of them had nine brothers. So,  you know they had plenty of room. My grandma was the oldest  daughter. In fact, she was the oldest child. So it fell her job to take care  of the babies. And of course, Grandpa would have to come over and see  the babies every weekend or so. Then he and Grandma married.  My mother   s parents,  Henry and Ida Wade,  were both born in Missouri  about twenty miles apart. Both families moved to Texas down around  Denton and Grandpa and Grandma met there in Texas for the first time.  (Laughs) They had been twenty miles apart in Missouri. Then Grandpa  and Grandma Wade moved over some place in what   s now Jackson  County. It was Greer County at that time. In fact, they thought they were  still in Texas. Grandpa would probably not have come to Oklahoma, but  they thought they were in Texas. He dug what they called a half dugout,  which is about a half storm cellar with a top on it. That   s what they lived  in over there.  My mother, Odessa Wade, was born in the half dugout on  June 22, 1898.   14  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  Now Grandpa and Grandma VanScoder lived in tents. When they  moved, they moved from Montague County over close to what is now  Duncan. There wasn   t any towns over there then, but Dad said he  thought he was about seven miles toward Duncan later. Then they  moved out to what they call the big pasture and they lived in tents until  they could build a barn. Dad said the closest place that they could get  lumber was Vernon. They would take four wagons and teams and ford  the river, I think at what later came to be known as Doan   s Crossing. He  said when they started to come back this way with the loaded wagons,  they would take all the teams off and put them on one wagon. They put  about a twenty-foot long chain between each team. And they would pull  that wagon across, and they   d go back and get another and pull it across,  and go back and get another one.  After they got the barn built, then later they built the house. But they  lived in the barn until they got the house built. They used the granary for  rooms. They had three granaries. Grandpa built a real big barn and had  three granaries along one side and places for stock on the other side. He  had a big track, something like a railroad track. It went all the way  across the top of the barn and stuck out about six feet on each end. It had  a trolley on there and when they   d gather the feed, of course, they didn   t  have any balers or anything like that. So they had to just cut the cane or  whatever they were using for fodder with a scythe, and then pick it up  and he   d put a tarp on top of the wagon. They   d throw this hay or  whatever he was putting up on top of the tarp. Then he had a big  opening on each end. They could drive through the barn either way.  He   d pull out just past the edge of the barn. He had a big rope and pulley  going up to this track, and he   d tie one end of the rope to the back of the  wagon, and then just drive the wagon up and pull the hay up. They had a  big hook and put it any place in the barn they wanted to, and dump it  out. That was really a saver on labor. In fact, he had the biggest barn  around there, and the only one I know of that had that sort of thing in it.  Did he have much hired help?  No, he had two boys. (Laughs) No, not much hired help, but Grandpa  had a big bunch of cattle. He was more into raising cattle than he was  really into farming first few years. My other grandfather had a lot of  cattle, too.  With the cotton, would you have people that would come in and help?  Yes. When I was a youngster, Dad would hire   he didn   t hire many,  couldn   t hire many because he just wanted to hire enough to keep  enough for him to pick up. Dad always paid us when we would use the  15  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  little gunny sack. Mother would sew a little strap on the gunny sack and  we   d pick cotton, too. Dad always paid us the same as he paid the other  hands, but we were expected to buy most of our school clothes. (Laughs)  But I liked to go down and pull for my Grandpa VanScoder better  because he never did fuss about anything (Laughs) and Dad didn   t like it  if we got a rock or two in those sacks. (Laughter) One of those other  things we were not supposed to have.  Paid by the pound, weren   t you?  Yes.  Was there much dust that came through in the Dust Bowl days?  Well, now the Dust Bowl days came after we moved to Chickasha. Of  course, we went so terribly long without any rain. The dust started  blowing, and you couldn   t stop it. Now, with tractors and things you can  go over it with something and kind of control it, but back then they  didn   t have any way of doing it. After we moved to Lubbock and then  back to Tipton, that fall Brother Chitwood and Brother Reuel Lemmons,  we were living out southwest of town on the J.M. Carroll place. They  came out there one day and I went to the door and invited him in. He  asked me to come out and sit in the car with them. They asked me if I  wanted a job, and I told him I   d let him know in a day or two.  I took the job and started working at the Tipton Home as the boy   s  supervisor. When I started, I had 117 boys. Had more than that later, but  I don   t know how many exactly it got up to. But we had three adults  living on the boy   s side. Had Ervie and Ina Givens. Ervie was the farmer  and Ina worked with the little girls. I was really responsible for putting  all the boys to bed, seeing that they stayed in bed and getting them up  the next morning, unless they were on a milking team. If they were on  the milking team, Ervie got them up. I did the maintenance in the house.  I was the carpenter, the plumber, the painter, the electrician and I got a  new job that I had never done before. I learned to plaster because they  had plaster on the walls, and can you imagine what a couple of big old  boys scuffling down the hall can do to a wall that   s plastered? They  make a hole in it. (Laughs)  What year did you take that job?     39.  And how old were you?  I was twenty-one.  16  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  And the Home opened in    39?  Oh no. They moved into the Home in    24. Yes, they got along without  me until then. (Laughs) And then we had a war come along and they let  me go over there to get Hitler, and then I went up and took part in the  invasion of southern France, went across it. Private in the infantry. Had  all those luxury things you can think about, slept on the ground. In Italy,  I never once put my feet under a table or sat in a chair or a cot or  anything else. I slept on the ground all the time.  In training at Camp Gruber, they had given me a brand new M1 rifle and  they said,    This will be your rifle when you go to war.       Okay,    I  believed them. So I really took care of that rifle, and I mean, it didn   t  have a spot on it or a scratch any place. Well, when we started to go  overseas, they took out my rifle, and it was fifteen days on the water  getting over there. I guess you   d call that a slow boat. But whoever was  running the thing didn   t go in a very straight course. They   d have to  keep dodging around. In fact, every night just about sundown we   d have  to get up and prepare to abandon ship for about two hours. Then about  two hours before sunup, we   d have to stand there ready to abandon ship  again, because that   s when the submarines were most active, just before  or after sunup or sundown. I got to Italy and they issued me another  rifle. The guy said,    We   re going to have an inspection here in less than  an hour.    I went to work cleaning that rifle. I ran patch after patch  through it and sanded it and oiled it and everything, and then when the  second lieutenant came to me, he looked at the rifle and he started  chewing me out for letting that rifle get in such bad shape. I   d had it less  than an hour, but anyway he really gave me a working over, and nearly  every inspection after that, I got chewed out.  But, another thing, when we started to leave Camp Gruber, they gave us  all new clothes, including a brand new overcoat. This was in July, a  wool overcoat. We got over there to Italy and the temperature was about  120 degrees. Here we are wearing a wool uniform, carrying a wool  overcoat and I know those natives there thought,    If they   re sending this  bunch over, we   ve lost this war.    (Laughter) Well about two weeks later,  they decided we didn   t need the overcoat. They took them up. And I got  me another brand new overcoat the day I was discharged.  What year was that?  (Laughs)    46. I was discharged the last day of March    46. So I got me a  brand new overcoat.  So were you in Italy most of the time?  17  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  No, they were getting ready to invade southern France and they let me  go along on that. (Laughs) There were several ships went from Italy out  there. We went during the night and I got guard duty during the night. I  was supposed to be on from twelve o   clock to two. So I stood my watch.  I don   t know what I was guarding. There was the biggest fog you ever  saw. Nobody relieved me. So, I stood two more hours and nobody  relieved me and you   re supposed to be   if you leave your post during  war time, there is supposed to be a death penalty if they want to give it  to you. So, I thought,    Well, they   ll probably put me in the brig when  they find out I   m not on duty.    And the more I thought about it, the  better I liked that idea. I thought,    Well if they put me in the brig,  nobody is going to shoot me, and if I get on land, somebody is liable to      They stopped these ships about half a mile from shore. They ran these  little boats they called    land and ship troops    (LSTs) and it was a pretty  good sized row boat. One side went up at a forty-five degree angle and  about half way up, it folded down and had cleats running up and down  the sides there. When they got up, the water was a little below your  neck, they stopped. We all jumped off and waded to shore holding our  rifle up and all of our equipment. If we had fallen down, I   m sure we  would   ve drowned because we had our rifle, our bayonet, mess kit, our  blankets, our first aid kit. We probably had 100 pounds of equipment  and so     Strapped to your back?  Yes. And to get off a ship, they threw a big net off the side. We climbed  down that net into these little boats, which was a lot of fun. (Laughs)  So what branch of the military were you?  I was a private in the infantry until after the war ended. Then I made  PFC  private first class . (Laughter)  Stiff up?  Yes, stiff up. But, I went over there as a replacement. In fact, the 42nd  Rainbow Division trained, and then they sent nearly everybody overseas  as replacements. When a commander would call in and say,    I lost so  many men last night or yesterday,    they   d send him that number and  maybe some extras, usually some extras. So, I really didn   t have what  you call a home in the service until about Battle of the Bulge.  I drove a semi for the 144th Quartermaster Trucking Company, but I  wasn   t really in the company, I was just on loan to them. And when I  18  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  was an aircraft gunner, I wasn   t really in an outfit that was supposed to  be an aircraft gunner, I was just on loan to them. Then when I went up to  the 100th Infantry, I was there for sure (Laughs), and I stayed with them  all the way through the rest of France and through Germany.  When we got to Italy, the first thing they did was issue us two blankets.   No pillow or sheets.  We slept on the ground about three-fourths of the  time in France. Still had these two blankets. Went through Germany,  still with my two blankets. How many times do you think those blankets  have been cleaned by the time the war was over? Never were cleaned.  (Laughter) And my clothes were about the same shape the whole time.  Would you ever get a chance to do laundry of any kind?  Yes. In fact, I did some laundry when I was in the 144th Trucking  Company that I shouldn   t have done. I wanted to have my picture made  to send home for Christmas. So, I washed my clothes in gasoline. Well, I  smell like gasoline the rest of the war. (Laughs) Never did leave that  smell from the war. (Laughter) And of course, we were close to a little  town Luxelles des Baines. They had a photo shop there and of course,  before the pictures were ready we moved on up about 100 miles. I  caught a ride back down there and those people don   t take business very  seriously. They close up at twelve o   clock, have a real long lunch and  then they take a nap. I sat there on the front steps of that place for about  three hours. Finally, they opened up again and I got my pictures. And it  was getting pretty dreary. In fact, overcast skies all dreary and  everything and cold.  We were also having a snow storm. It snowed  every day all winter.  There was one main street in this little old village  and I was standing out of the wind beside the house. Just before I turned  straight north, I saw a woman knock on the window across the street  from me. I went over there and she handed me a cup of hot tea, and it  was really good. I mean, I was about to freeze to death and hadn   t had  anything to eat since breakfast.  And that was in France or Italy?  That was in France.  Did you exchange gestures with her?  Well yeah, a little bit. Sometimes we had to make do with signs quite a  bit. In fact, one time in Germany, I was on guard duty and we were on  the side of a pretty good hill. The roads came up and crossed right on top  of this hill, and we were down on the side of it. There was a trail across  there. People had been going across there for centuries, and of course we  didn   t want anybody going across our camp there. Anyway, here came  19  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  this man   a German   and I let him get up there and I yelled,    Achtung   Es ist verboten     I told him in my best German that he couldn   t go  through there, and he acted like he couldn   t understand me. And I told  him a couple of times, and he started on like he was going to walk off.  So I ran in front of him, aimed my rifle in the middle of his chest, pulled  the bolt back about three-quarters of the way and let it slam shut. I didn   t  say another word to him. He turned around and went back. He  understood.  He got the idea.  Yeah, he got the idea. You can   t imagine the first big river we came to in  Germany. Now, they   ve got some big rivers over there. In fact, they run  boats and barges up and down those rivers all the way through summer  hauling produce. Well, there was no bridge. So they stretched a cable  between two trees, one on each side, and then tied about twenty-foot  links of rope to that, and then tied a row boat on the end, and put some  two-by-twelves across from one to the other. We went across that. I  figured we   d go down, but we didn   t. (Laughs)  Do you know what river it was?  The Rhine, I believe it was. But anyway, they have some big rivers over  there, and they freeze over in the wintertime. In fact, I slept on the  ground within two or three hundred feet of a waterfall and it had frozen  over one night.  Did you say you took part in the Battle of the Bulge?  Yes.  Do you want to tell anything about that?  Well, it wasn   t as bad as I   d thought it   d be. In fact, the night before I  joined them, I didn   t sleep much. (Laughs) Now, I don   t know when  these people decide when the battle is over or when it starts, because  firing was going on continuously. Of course, now they have some way  of knowing, I guess they have to. I was in the Battle of Southern France,  Battle of the Bulge, Battle of Central Europe, Battle of Germany.  I  received a Meritorious Service plaque, Expert Rifleman badge, and a  WWII Veteran ribbon.   I think it was the second or third day in Germany, I was on the wire  construction team. We were trying to run two trunk lines to the 397th  Infantry regiment, and I mean, it was a snow blizzard. You couldn   t see  ten feet in front of you. And those people don   t know enough to make  20  R. Wilson  VanScoder  section lines like we do here, you know. We lay a mile at a time and  cross. Well, they just go every way, whichever way the cow was going  when this started. And we got lost.  We thought the 397th Infantry was in this little town, but we had  bypassed the town and took the wrong fork. We made a U-turn and  came in this little town from the back. There were eight of us on a team.  We   d run these wires, and put somebody off about every half mile or  mile, put two guys off and then they   d try to get the wires up as best they  could. But anyway, we saw a little cow shed. No cattle in it because it  was too cold for cattle. And it was like, we have a cow shed. Had the  south side open, had to roughen the back side and come up the side a  little. Well that would be a good place to set up the switchboard.  I had been reeling out the wire, loading the reels and doing the splicing.  When we got there, there were just three of us left. We had what they  call a weapons carrier. The driver, then the team chief, and I was the  other one. We had set up the switchboard and the team chief called back  and the guy on the other end of the telephone line says,    I think  Lieutenant Drinkard wants to talk to you.    He talked with the company  commander and he asked him how he got there. And he said,    Get out of  there right now. The Germans still hold that town. There   s not supposed  to be an American in it.    About ten minutes after that, I   d have been  sitting there at the switchboard, the only American in town. So we got  out of there right quick and quiet. We were pretty well armed. We had  our own machine gun and we had a couple of rifles and a pistol, but we  didn   t want to start a fight. (Laughs)  You might have been outnumbered.  We figured we   d be outnumbered, so we eased out of there. But after the  Battle of the Bulge, that was the next day after that I thought,    My, there  are a lot of dead people around here.    I felt like saying,    I believe I   ll  just stop here and see how many I can count.    I counted over a hundred  bodies without moving out of my tracks. Germans, Americans, a few  civilians, right after the Bulge.  All those houses over there have basements. Hundreds moved back just  past a little town called Bitche, B-I-T-C-H-E on the Moselle line. They  have a lot of heavy fortifications. After World War I, the French decided  they couldn   t trust the Germans, so all the way between France and  Germany the French people built big gun in placements. They were dug  in and they had all living quarters underneath there so they could just  stay under there and have these big guns pointed toward Germany. And  they did their job. The Germans never did break through, but the  Germans cheated a little. They went up and went through Belgium and  21  R. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  then moved over and came back through from the north into France.  France and Belgium were on good terms, so they didn   t have  fortification. It wasn   t in Belgium. But they never did really take that  fort, and the Germans shot at it first and then the Americans. After the  French surrendered, then the Germans moved into it. Then the  Americans shot at them for a long time. Finally ran the Germans out and  then the Germans shot at the Americans, and finally ran the Americans  out. And then the Americans came back one more time and shot at the  Germans. I mean, they had leveled that town. I don   t think there was one  house that had four walls standing. But, those people have basements  and they   d go down in these basements and they   d just stay in there.  After the Germans would run out, they   d come crawling out of the  basements.  I believe the worst night, most dangerous night I had during the war was  the first night in Germany. It wasn   t so much the Germans were shooting  at us, but those people over there have schnapps and beer by the barrel.  And most of the Americans thought that they had to liberate them that  day. (Laughter) Before that, you knew which side of the building you  had to get on to get some protection. But that night you didn   t know.  Too much to drink for everybody?  Nearly everybody was drunk, and a guy with a loaded rifle was not good  company. They were just drunk.  What did the commanders have to say about all that? Or were they a  part of it?  I don   t know. We didn   t see much of the commanders. In fact, just a day  or two after that is when we got lost and they decided instead of having  us work out of the company, they   d leave us with the regiment. So a  bunch of us were assigned to the 397th Infantry for quarters (which they  didn   t furnish anything) for rations and duty. So we stayed with 397  until the war ended. In fact, from that time, I don   t think I saw my  company commander but maybe twice. From the time we went into  Germany until the war ended.  How did you hear about the war ending?  Well, when we first went into Germany, we swung over toward  Frankfurt, which was to the north and east. Then we made a big circle,  went right down the center of Germany. We were down about Munich.  We got there about two weeks before the war ended, because  Eisenhower had promised the Russians that they could take Berlin. We  had to wait until they took Berlin before the war was over, but we had  22  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  quit fighting about two weeks before the war was over.  So you knew it was approaching.  Yes, we knew it was over. In fact, they were surrendering. Towards the  end of the war, the 144th Trucking Company I was in was hauling food  from Marseilles on the coast up to the front. About the time the war was  over, the Germans would be surrendering, just by the gobs. They were  hauling some of them back in these trucks, the company I was with. One  of them turned the truck over, and the German prisoners got out and  turned it back up and got back in. (Laughter)  Kept on going again.  Yeah, they knew it was over. In fact, the last week or so I   d seen guys  standing beside the road with their hands up over their head waiting for  somebody to take them.  How much longer were you in Europe then before you came back?  Too long. (Laughs) In fact, I have a ribbon over there that says,     German occupation.    But anyway, they decided that we needed to go  all over and pick up all this wire and re-do it. So, that took about three  months. Then they sent me to what they call power maintenance school,  up pretty close to Frankfurt. I didn   t want to go. In fact, I was really  aggravated because I wanted to come home and the thing lasted three  months. The first week I was up there, I didn   t do a thing. I didn   t even  open my book, didn   t open my mouth during class. The next week, I got  to thinking about it and said,    Well, something might do me some good  here.    So I decided I   d start reading my lesson. Most of the guys didn   t  even try. Every night they   d have a big gambling party and beer  drinking. They   d be up until one or two o   clock every morning. So, there  wasn   t much competition. Most of the guys didn   t even try. And we   d  have these kinds of tests and put trouble on   we were working on diesel  engines because they wanted us to work at the 7th Army Radio Station. I  got pretty good on some of those. In fact, I hadn   t been there very long  when they started calling me out of class to work on their equipment.  You guys were already trying to rebuild Germany after the war, as soon  as it ended?  Well, the 7th Army Radio had enough power in it they could go any  place in the world at that time. And that   s what they were training us for,  because they had a lot of guys who were fixing to come home. In fact,  they offered me a staff sergeant rating if I   d sign up, but I didn   t want  any part of it. I hadn   t enjoyed the Army very much. (Laughter)  23  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  (With case of war medals) I   m going to have you hold this real quick  and show the video. Will you tell me what they   re each for?  Well, I don   t even remember. (Laughter) Now these little stars are  supposed to be battles and these are supposed to be the different  campaigns I was in.  The second one says Africa and Middle East?  No, not Africa.  It says European Dent  Theater .  European Dent. My brother went to Africa. He was in U.S. Army Air  Force as an engine mechanic, and then his company moved over from  Africa over to Italy while I was in Italy. Lauren came over to see me a  couple of times. They repaired airplanes and they had to fly some into  Naples, and he caught a ride and hitchhiked to where I was. They liked  to never   I think it was about three hours finding me.  So how did he find you? Just asked around?  Just asking, yeah. He felt kind of sorry for me, I think, because he was  sleeping in a tent, had a cot and a mess hall. We didn   t have a mess hall  in Italy. We had our own mess kit, and after you got through eating, they  had a garbage can full of water and pushed it up and down a few times  and that was supposed to be clean and ready for the next meal. (Laughs)  Rinse off?  Yes. You just splashed it up until you didn   t see anything you noted.  (Laughs)  So when did you finally make it back to the United States?  Well, I was in Germany, and then I moved up through Luxemburg and  then Belgium. I shipped out from Antwerp, Belgium and was discharged  the last day of March of    46  at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas .  And what did you do then?  Well, I   d run off and left Lura before   we were engaged before I went  to the service. I came back and her dad and mother had a hardware and  plumbing  store . I didn   t really expect to work there, but maybe it was  longer than a month or something while I got a job. But anyway, I kept  24  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  working there, and finally we bought the business, and sold out then in     77. Sold out on about nine o   clock Thursday night, and I didn   t go to  work until Monday morning. I was off all day on Friday and Saturday. I  could have gone to work Friday, but tried to do some finishing up     some collecting. And I worked with Randy here a little bit on some jobs.  Doing electrical?  No, I was a plumbing contractor.  He was the plumber and I was the electrician.  He kept some terrible hours. The rest of us would go home after the day  was over and then he   d just be getting there sometimes. (Laughs)  What was your position at the Tipton Home then after?  Well, they called it boy   s supervisor, but I did a little of everything. I did  a lot of maintenance and I did the doctoring. I was a medic. In fact, my  room had more medical supplies than my personal stuff. I was also the  butcher. Saturday morning, usually about ten o   clock   we raised our  own hogs to butcher. We raised our own cattle to butcher. We raised our  own chickens to butcher. Saturday morning, I   d butcher something and  we   d eat that Sunday and maybe whatever is left Monday. And then  we   d have meat again next weekend.  So what year did you retire from the Tipton Home?  In    84. I worked there twice, before the war and then after we sold the  hardware  store .  And did you go to school anywhere using the GI Bill or     Yes, I went to school at Southwestern for a couple of years.  Did you say you had some credits from Oklahoma A M?  Yes. But I didn   t go to school there. I got those over here at the base.  Oh okay.  Got some from OU at the base.  So, what are some of your current hobbies?  Well (Laughs), we stay pretty busy here doing a little bit of nothing.  25  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  How many years have you all been married?  Well, since    46.  Do you have any secrets to a long marriage?  Now her folks had the hardware  store  and I   d come down and buy  some things. Her mother always kept some pictures of her two daughters  and she   d show me those pictures when I came down and tell me about  them. They were still going to school up at Sayre. I was on good terms  with her folks before I ever met her. And I guess that   s a good idea.  (Laughs)  Sounds like it.  So the secret there is to start with the parents.  Yes, that   s the best way to go. They were going to school up at Sayre at  the junior college. So they didn   t move when their parents did.  So how did you finally meet her?  After school was out, she moved down here.  And you looked her up?  Oh yeah. (Laughs)  And how many children do you have?  Two. Two daughters, Donna and Nancy. And two grandchildren, Sarah  and Timothy.  Well is there anything that I haven   t asked you about that you   d like to  share?  Well, I don   t think of anything right now.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well it is home (Laughs), and I   ve never had any desire to really live  any place else. Although we lived in Arkansas for awhile, we were not  doing very well farming.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  26  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  R. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  Well, I   ve been very active in church work. I taught bible school for  about thirty-five years, and I   ve been a deacon since May of    56. In fact,  when they redid the church building, I did the plumbing, heating and  cooling on it. And so far as I know, I   m the only person that had a  plumbing contractor   s license to live in Tipton. And I also had a license  for liquefied petroleum gas there. We used to buy and sell propane and  butane tanks, sell fuel, appliances and install them.  Through the hardware store?  Through the hardware, yes. And did a good pump business. Did a lot of  pumps.  Did you do some bookkeeping out at the Home?  Yeah, that   s what I did. I went back to Cameron and had an accounting  major. Brother Garrison was getting up in years, and so I went down and  saw Brother Putnam, told him I wanted a job and he hired me. (Laughs)  Has the Home change a lot over the years?  Oh, you bet. Have you been out at the Home any time lately?  Not lately.  Okay, well they all have cottages now, and they don   t have over eight  people in the cottage, the Home children. When I lived there, when I  started working there, there were 257 children and we had four big  classrooms. We had the kitchen, dining room, and hospital in there. The  top, most all the top was hospital, and when somebody got something  that was contagious, well they   d go up and stay in the hospital until they  got well. But I took some first-aid courses, and I did just nearly all  doctoring of the boys. In fact, I   ve held a guy when the doctor set his  arm with no medication. (Laughs)  His arm was broken?  Yes. A lot of time in the spring when we   d get little baby chickens, we   d  have to, I   ve gone out lots of time during the night and checked the  brooder to see if the heat was about right, because nothing was  automatic. You had to turn it up or down by hand. Same thing, we had a  boiler that had steam heat. Nothing was automatic.  So has the number of inhabitants of the Tipton Home changed  drastically?  27  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  VanScoder  L. Wilson  Oh yeah. In fact, we were really crowded. We had four dormitories and  then in what they called the little boy   s dormitory, they had one bunk on  top of another bunk, and it was only about this much room between  them. I mean, just lined up on each side and down the middle. It was  crowded. And we didn   t have much money then. Things were pretty  tough.  What are the ages of the kids that stayed there?  Well, from diaper sized through high school.  And did it used to be just boys?  Oh no. No boys and girls.  Alright, well I want to thank you for letting me interview you today.  Thank you.  It   s been a pleasure visiting with you.  -------  -------
