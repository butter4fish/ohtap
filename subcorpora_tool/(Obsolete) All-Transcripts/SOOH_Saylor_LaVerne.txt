 Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Today is April 8, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I am in Clinton,  Oklahoma, with LaVerne Saylor. We are here today interviewing  LaVerne as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project  on  Germans from Russia, which is  part of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program  at the Oklahoma State University Library. Her  friend Barbara Kissler is also joining us today.  LaVerne, thank you so  much for being with me today.  Thank you.  Can we start off by having you state your full name and tell us where  you were born?  LaVerne D. Saylor. LaVerne Darlene Hamburger  to start with . I was  born on a farm seven miles, maybe eight miles south of Weatherford,  and I have a picture of me sitting in a tub on the front porch. No, it was  on the front walkway, coming into the house, and here they   ve got me in  a picture that they took of me sitting in a tub.  A washtub?  A washtub, nonetheless.  Do you know what number it was?  Well, it was a washtub that you washed your clothes in all the time.  (Laughs)  Tell her what year this was.  I wasn   t even a year old when they put me in there and took my   and it  was across the road from Ruben Kissler   s dad   s farm.  5  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  And what year were you born?  1923.  Did you have any brothers or sisters?  I had two brothers. They were younger than me. Arlie Hamburger and  Jerry Hamburger. And Arlie is still the farmer on the home place after  the folks stayed at this other place where they took this picture of me in  a tub. Then, Dad bought a farm, a hundred and sixty acre farm, about  two miles east of that there. And that   s where Jerry and Arlie were both  born.  Let   s talk about your family history a little bit. Do you know how your  parents came to be in that area in Oklahoma?  Well, because their parents, my grandparents all settled in that area.  They all went to the German Zion Church out in the country.  And where did your grandparents come from?  They came from Russia, but I really am not   I don   t have that  information. My daughter   s going to do a little looking in on that.  But then your grandparents eventually moved to Oklahoma?  Yes.  And then your parents were born in this area?  And then they were born, yes. And they all went to the same church.  Zion Church. A German church.  Did they speak German with each other?  Boy, that   s all they talked  I was confirmed in German, but then, after  that, they were just in our language now.  The church had English and German both for quite a while. They had  sermons in both. When I got married, you were English and German.  I left here and went to Washington, D.C.  Did you grow up speaking German in your home?  6  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  No.  So your parents spoke English with you?  Oh yeah. And my Sunday school class was English. But I was confirmed  in German. Don   t know what I said, but I said it.  What did your parents do for a living?  Farm.  What crops did they farm?  Wheat. And you washed on the washboard. You didn   t have a machine.  Now, that was something. I do not understand how a woman could go  out and help milk cows and come in and fix the meal and then rub  clothes on a wash board, hang them out on the line and then iron. I mean  to tell you, the men, their shirts were white for Sunday, and they were  washed and ironed and starched beautifully. But I can   t understand how  you could get an iron hot enough on a wood stove to do ironing.  Can you describe what the iron looked like?  Well, just like a regular iron, but it didn   t have all that top stuff on it. It  was a flat iron.  So you would set it on the wood stove to heat it up?  Yes. Well, not the handle. The handle would come off of it, but the iron  itself was on the wood stove, getting hot. So you had a couple of them,  so when one got cooler, they had to have a hotter one.  Did your mom make your clothes?  My mom made a lot of my clothes, and I had an aunt. She was married  to my uncle, and they were just wonderful. I was the oldest one, you  know, and my aunt had two sisters. When they got through with their  dresses, they brought them out for Mom for her to make clothes for me.  Now, can you imagine taking a dress and fitting it for a small person? I  don   t know how they did it. I really don   t. But I wore a lot of those, and  I looked as good as anybody else.  Did your family have a big garden?  Oh my goodness, yes. And that   s another thing. Canning every summer.  And they raised their own potatoes. So they were down in the cellar for  7  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  the winter, so we didn   t have to buy potatoes. And they had the cows so  they had their own milk and cream. Oh yeah, Mom made a lot of things.  And canned a garden. Anything from the garden that she could can, she  did. So I think,    How did they do it all?     What were some of your favorite meals that your mother would prepare?  I want to tell you something. There weren   t any favorite ones. They  were all good. Oh, my land. When I go to the restaurant sometime and  what I get, I think,    Good night, Mom wouldn   t have served that.    And I  don   t know if you girls have found out or realized that mashed potatoes  that you get in a restaurant anymore, they just get boiling water and they  have a sack that they get them in. They open that sack and put it in that  boiling water and you   ve got mashed potatoes.  There   s no mashing involved.  There   s no mashing to it at all. You take the spoon and dip them out.  Did your mom have a lot of German influence in her cooking?  Oh yes.  What were some things that she would make?  Well, we made our own sauerkraut. Oh, was that good. And she made  her own bread. Well, we didn   t know what store bought bread was. She  made rye bread. She made pies. We had pies and cookies and  Reigelkuechle and cakes. That was Saturday, baking. Saturday morning  was baking. And our own homemade bread all the time.  What were some of your chores around the house?  A little bit of everything. No, I had to work. I was the oldest, so I had to  go and get the cows every evening about five o   clock. And don   t you  know those suckers would always manage to get in the furthest corner at  five o   clock, and here I am walking through the pasture, and it was a  long walk. I had to go up to that corner to get those cows. Boy, and then  walk back home making them get home. Well, when I   d get real tired,  I   d get a hold of one of those tails and I   d hold onto it and let them pull  me for a while. (Laughter)  Would you have to milk the cows?  Well yes  Get home, get your bucket and start milking. And then you go  to the separator, take the milk to the separator, and that was always my  8  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  morning thing to do, too. Wash that separator. Well, that wasn   t easy  either with all those things that was on it.  Did you have chickens?  Yes, we had chickens. That was another thing to take care of. I helped  feed them and collect the eggs.  What about pigs?  We had pigs, too.  Did you have a smokehouse on your property?  No. We had a big washhouse, though. Dad built it, and they were  making 54   that was just a one way road. Very, very narrow for  umpteen years, and when they widened that, that was another job.  Was your meat house part of the wash house?  Yes. Well, how did we?  You had meat in there, because you didn   t have a deep freeze.  Our meat. How did that     Salt it down.  Well, I think they rented some places in town and put your meat in.  Meat lockers?  Yes. When you had a lot of that, but see, we didn   t   I grew up without  electricity. I don   t think Mom and Dad got electricity until after I left, so  that was just a lamp that you had. Well, try to do your school work with  an oil lamp. It   s wasn   t very easy.  Can you describe your house?  Yes. It was a two bedroom. It was a kitchen, well, when they first moved  there and I was born and for quite a few years, you didn   t have an  indoor. You had a pot. And then eventually they had a room built, and  that was where the stool and a tub and a sink was put in. Right at the  entry as you come in from the side door.  But you started out with an outhouse?  9  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Yes. It was kind of cold to go out there, but you had to use the pot, then.  And then rinse that, pour that out every morning and rinse it up.  Did your mom do any quilting?  Oh, yeah. I   ve got lovely quilts that she made, and my daughter, too.  Do you quilt?  No. I didn   t have to. I went to work. I went to Washington, D.C.  Well, tell me about your school.  We had really a good country school, and we had good teachers. They  had a wood stove and every   just think in the winter time that those  teachers had to get out there, they were the janitors, they had to keep  their   there was nobody else. It was the teacher that had to take care of  the floors, start the fire, go out and get the wood to start it, and then have  school.  It was three miles to go to school.  One through the eighth  grade.  How many kids do you think went to the school?  I   d say she had about eighteen.  What was it called?  Missouri School.  And were many of the kids of German heritage?  No. I think I was about the only one.  How about Elroy?  And Arthur Repp.  Well, you were in a German settlement. Lapped over into Corn. All  around there, like Elroy Hamburger and them?  They didn   t go to our school. They went to another school.  Country schools were every few miles.  Oh, yeah.  10  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Were your grandparents around when you were growing up? Did they  live nearby?  Yes.  And so your parents spoke German with them?  Yeah. They could speak it.  Could you understand?  Sometime. They   d sit and talk German if they didn   t want you to know  what they were saying. (Laughs)  She can still sing German.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. We had a man at our church, George Repp. Well, the  Repps were down the line. George, his dad, they went to Zion. They  were German, and Adolf Repp and Arthur Repp.  Momma was a Kissler.  They were all there. But actually, Reuben Kissler was the one that  started the music there when I was growing up. Francis Kissler   s dad.  He had the choir, and we always had a good choir, and we had good  quartets there, too.  Was it a pretty big church?  Yes, it was.  And was it mostly Germans?  Oh, yeah, they all were.  And were they Germans from Russia?  Well, I guess, yes. Yes. And some of them even came in wagons to  church with a load of kids.  Did your family drive a wagon?  No.  Did you have a car?  11  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  A car? Yeah.  But you had horses first, didn   t you?  Well, I didn   t go in a horse.  You went in a wagon and horse?  They had four wheels.  Do you remember hearing stories from your grandparents or many  other     Well actually, not a lot. I wish now there would have been more, but I  tell you, in those days it was just nothing but work. Work, work.  Were your grandparents farmers also?  Oh, yeah.  Wheat farmers?  Yes  Yes. And some of them, you   d raise cotton, a little cotton, or you   d  have corn. And the women would have a great big garden.  Let   s talk a little bit more about school. What were some of your favorite  things to study when you were in the country school?  Oh, well I think arithmetic was good, and reading, and spelling. You had  to learn to spell.  What kinds of games would you play at school if you had a break?  We might play tag, and then we did have a swing set. We did have that  at school, and that was about it. But we did have some programs at  school for the parents, you know. Maybe they   d all make pies or cakes,  and then they   d have a sale, and that was something else there at our  school.  So was the school kind of a center of the community? If your parents  would come also to these events?  Oh, yeah. If the kids went there, the parents would be there.  One room?  12  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  We had two rooms. And we had a library. The school itself was pretty  big, and we had a stage. We   d have good programs sometimes. And then  the women would bring cakes and pies so they   d have a sale there with  that. With all of us. The families and all. And we had really good  teachers.  Would you bring your lunch with you to school?  Every day.  How did you get to school?  Well, sometimes I walked three miles. Sometimes I   d ride a horse, and  it   d get to a little bridge, and it didn   t want to go over that bridge, and  I   d have to get off of the horse to lead it across and then get back on it to  go. Can you imagine?  Would you just tie him up at school all day while you were there?  Yes. He was tied up.  Were your brothers going to school with you, or were they much  younger?  I think Arlie, before I left there, I think he started in as a little boy. But  Jerry, I was already beyond that.  What were some traditions in the community? Like, some events you all  would have?  At the school?  Well, in the community?  Well, nothing.  Church.  No, that was all work.  What about for holidays?  That was work, too.  For Christmas?  13  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Well, I have to tell you this, that my brother    Christmases were not  very big in those days at all, and I know that one time, I was already in  Washington, D.C. Now our yearly pay to go up there for the first few  years was  14.40 a year. Now, that wasn   t very much money. That was  big money at that time for us, but to pay our rent and to get to our work,  you had to ride a street car, and for us to eat, money was taken out of  that. But I   ll never forget my younger brother saying,    If it wasn   t for  LaVerne, we wouldn   t have had a Christmas.    Because I saw to it that  my mother and my dad and my two brothers had a Christmas box under  the tree for them.  Did your family attend the church at Christmastime? Were there special  Christmas services?  Oh yeah. In the country? My mother and dad, absolutely. They went to  church every Sunday, and they had nice Christmas programs. And like I  say, we had a musical church at that time, and even, we had a   what do  I want to call it? Well, actually, a band. We had a band, a big band in  church. I played a violin. There were quite a few girls that played  violins, or you played the piano, or you played a guitar, or you played  some kind of a horn, the guys. That was for Sunday night   s services, that  they usually used that. We had a good congregation, really.  Did you learn to play the violin at the church, or at home?  No, I had instructions. I had music lessons before I got there, but George  Repp, he insisted and he got all of us with an instrument. So yeah, I  played for a long time, there.  Was there much dancing in the community?  Oh, no. That was a sin. A total sin.  No shows.  You could not, no. (Laughs)  Did people drink alcohol?  Oh heavens, no  (Laughter) That was a sin, and number one, they didn   t  have the money to buy it. Listen, we were glad to have some pop and  buy watermelons. (Laughs)  Would you get a birthday cake on your birthday or anything special?  14  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  You know, I really don   t remember that. I really don   t. Mom made cake  and pies every Saturday morning. That was her job. On an oil stove. I  mean, on that wooden stove we had. I don   t know how they bake bread  or pies or cake on those kinds of things. No thermometer. And then  you   d have to go out and get the wood and carry it in. That was another  nice thing.  Were your neighbors Germans from Russia?  No.  How far were your nearest neighbors down the road? Pretty close?  Oh, yeah.  And did you get together with your neighbors very often?  No. Everybody was working.  Did they help each other out at different times with the crops?  Not really.  When they did hay and stuff like that, didn   t the farmers go together?  Well, see, I left here. I really don   t know everything that went on after I  went to Washington, D.C. And there were eight out of Zion Church who  landed up at Washington.  Well, tell me about that. What did you do after eighth grade, after you  finished at your country school?  I went to high school.  Where?  In Weatherford.  What year did you graduate high school?  1942?  I think Francis did.  If Francis did, I did. Yeah.  15  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  And so how did you hear these people in Washington, D.C. were looking  for     They came out. They sent people out to find girls who knew typing and  shorthand.  They were desperate.  And they came out to get them to come to Washington, D.C.  So did they visit your high school, or did they come to your house?  No. They got in touch with us.  They sent you papers. You had to     Fill them out.  Do a written test, and     But that   s how they did that. They came out, they wanted girls out there.  They rode the train out here.  Did you learn shorthand and typing in high school?  Yes.  So what did you think when you heard about this? Moving to  Washington, D.C.?  Well, you were happy that you had found a job. Now it was up to you to  go. And we didn   t all go at the same time, so see, we could get word  back from them how things were, and where you would live after you  got here and all that. Now, I went to Washington, D.C. on the train.  Well, when I got to Washington and off of the train there, I didn   t know  how to hail a cab. So finally I got one, and it took me to the place where  a couple of the others were already living. Room and boarding house.  And how many lived together? How many girls? Wasn   t there like  twelve in one apartment?  Or eighteen?  With a bathroom down the hall.  16  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Eighteen girls for one bathroom?  When we first went to Washington, that   s where we all landed. At this  rooming house, and there was a restaurant right beside it that took care  of this place, so after we got up and got dressed, that   s where we would  go to eat, right next door where the restaurant was. But there were  eighteen girls and one bathroom.  How did that work out?  And then the latch was just a latch you could push up. Well, if you were  in dire need, you didn   t care who was in there. You opened that thing  and got in there, too. Can you imagine? A bathtub and one stool? It   s  good we didn   t have to get up and go during the night. Our innards were  pretty tight, I guess. (Laughter)  Can you remember who you worked for?  The Judge Advocate General   s office. And then they stuck me into, they  were all lawyers. Well, me, a country bumpkin and going with all these  high top lawyers from all over. I was scared to death, but I made it.  Did you enjoy it?  Yes. And then we had a higher general who was the head of that  department, and he   d walk around and look to see things were all right.  So he kind of took care of you or watched out for you.  Oh yeah, yeah.  But she didn   t come home.  But I didn   t come home. (Laughs)  You stayed out there for quite a while, huh?  She married.   When I first married, we lived in Washington, D.C. In 1959, we moved  to Silver Spring, Maryland. We moved from Silver Spring in 1985 to  Naples, Florida, and in 1995 we moved to Weatherford, Oklahoma.   When you were living in this boarding house with eighteen girls, would  you all eat at the restaurant next door?  17  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Yes. Oh yes.  And how much money were you making, again?  I   m trying to think. I think it was eighteen dollar for two weeks. I think  that   s what it was. You didn   t have much left over after you had to pay  here and there. But, you know, I have a brother, the younger one, he  said,    If it wasn   t for LaVerne, we   d have never had a Christmas here.     Do you remember how much money you were able to send back to your  family?  I didn   t send money back, but on their birthdays, I bought shirts for  church. I would send that. I would see that they all had Christmas boxes,  and that they had their birthdays. I wrote letters and I also would call. So  I didn   t have much left.  When you went out to Washington, D.C. on the train, were you all by  yourself?  Yes  And scared to death.  Do you remember how long the train ride was?  It was a long one.  What were you thinking?  Dreading. But see, there were some other girls, like Frances was already  there, and Cordelia Ekhart, so that was pretty good. That was real good  to have somebody there, and then there was the Adler girls. Two of them  were out there, too.  So you knew you were going to know a few people when you got out  there.  Oh, yeah.  But it was still scary.  Well, yeah it was. I was scared. You know     Were you eighteen?  Probably. But you know, you do that, and you   re going to be put in  where they   re all   what did I say they were?  18  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Lawyers?  Yes, lawyers. That   s enough to scare you.  How long did you work for those lawyers?  A long time. A long time. And then you learned to, I did, to go to  different areas, you know.  Of Washington, D.C.?  Of work.  Oh. Did you find a church in Washington, D.C.?  Yes. Frances, I have to say, she drug us to a different church every  Sunday. And I will never forget her cousin Eloise, and her husband   s  cousin. We went to church one Sunday, and Eloise had a new hat. We  wore hats to church. We were dressed. And do you know what? A bird  crapped on it. I   ll never forget that as long as I live. (Laughter)  Before church?  Well, while we were waiting for a streetcar to come by to get on it, and  they were under a tree  And that bird crapped on that hat. (Laughter)  Did she still wear it to church?  I don   t know if Eloise ever wore that hat again. I   ll never forget that.  Did you find many other Germans from Russia in Washington, D.C. that  weren   t from Oklahoma?  No.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, who was it? Oh, where us girls was living, next door to us was a  married couple that had a couple of children, and they knew Lee very  well, and his mother. His dad, I have to tell you, he never gave that boy  one cent. He wasn   t even with his mother when he was born. Her own  husband.  So she raised him.  19  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  So he had nothing to do with him until he got older when he knew Lee  was working. See? So anyhow, one day after I had retired from the  government, he learned about that somehow, and he called one day  when I was home. He wanted to move in with us. Do you know what I  told him? I said,    You never gave your son one dime, and you   re not  coming here to live.    And that was the end of that. He never gave Lee or  his mother one dime for his support. And he knew where Lee was  working and was making good money, see? And he wanted to get in on  us, now.  So was Lee an only child?  He was the only child.  So it was just him and his mom growing up?  Yes. But he had aunts and an uncle that you can   t believe how good they  were to them. I mean, they were very, very close. I loved all of them.  And he grew up in Washington, D.C.?  And he grew up in Washington, D.C.  Did he have German heritage?  No, nothing.  What did his mom do?  His mom worked for the Archdiocese for years. She had to work, but in  earlier days, she worked at other places, though I don   t know how. But  those sisters, there was three of them living together. Two at one time, in  this apartment where Lee was raised. Then another one was married to  this Greek who sold all kinds of vegetables. Big vegetable place in  Washington, D.C. So he was very good with him with all of that,  because he would help out.  So were you able to come and visit your family in Oklahoma after you  moved to Washington, D.C.?  Yes. I managed about every year to get out here.  Would you generally come with the train?  Yes.  20  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  After you married. Lee retired from the Navy.  Yes, and then Lee retired. Lee came out here, and of course, he was  Catholic, and Catholics were not very well recognized in this area, so  I   m marrying a Catholic. Well, I didn   t know who would be there, but  my mom and dad were there, and my dad walked down that aisle in that  Catholic church, and it was just the same as any other church. And the  priest knew the family very well, and he was very, very nice. He really  was. So, they all changed their minds about the Catholics.  And you got married in Weatherford? Or in Washington, D.C.?  Oh, Washington, D.C. Lee   s mother worked for the Archdiocese for  years, for all those priests there.  So your family accepted him just fine?  Oh, yes.  Did you ever hear any grumblings from anyone else back home about  him being a Catholic?  Well, I went through a   yes, I did. But I think they all found out later  that he was a human being, and     Had a very good personality.  Yeah, he does.  Good speaker. He   s still living. Just bad health.  But he   s not in good shape, now. He   s on oxygen all the time. In the last  three years, it   s been very difficult because he was so active in  everything. In fact, he and another fellow seven years ago brought a  ship   well, the Greeks got it. We had it during World War II. The  Greeks took it over when the U.S. was finished with it, and when they  finished with it, this one guy got word that they were   well, Sam got  word. My husband got word that they were going to sink it. Well,  sinking a ship when Lee had been in the Navy twice didn   t sound good,  so he and this other fellow called the Greeks and told them that they  wanted it brought back here to the U.S. So he and this other guy got the  ball going, and they brought that ship back to Albany, New York, which  needed a lot of work done on it, because they Greeks were going to sink  it.  Anyhow, Lee knew this fellow in Arizona that had a huge building full  21  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  of parts for ships. So he got a hold of him, and he said,    If you can get  them out of here, you can have them for nothing.    So Lee got a hold of  another fellow and the two of them went out to Arizona. They got big  trucks and trains to get that equipment back to Albany, New York. That  ship is now a museum up in Albany, and has helped that town very  much.  That is wonderful. What is it called? Do you remember?  USS Slater.  Have you visited it?  Yes. Oh, yes. And you know, the men who work on that have worked on  that ship every day are still down there, every day, and they   re in their  seventies and eighties. They get people coming aboard. A lot of the  younger organizations can use it for a weekend. You can sleep there.  You can cook there.  That sounds wonderful.  And my husband, he begs for money all the time to keep that ship a  going. Does a good job of it, too.  So, he was in the Navy?  Yes.  Where did he serve? In which wars?  He was in over this way.

Tell me about Naples, Florida.  22  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Oh, my gosh. It   s beautiful. We had more fun down there. We had a lot  of nice friends in Washington, D.C., and Lee knew so many people, too.  But down there, we got there and you just cannot believe. All of our  friends in the area, and we square danced.  Swimming pool.  We went down there, and I cannot believe how the neighbors were. All  of them were from another state, and had bought property down there.  We had a house built on a lake, and it was just about ten minutes from  the beach. Very nice, and our neighbors, a doctor from the northern part,  they were across the street from us. And all over there, it was just  wonderful. We joined the Elks Club. Well, that   s when we got into  square dancing. There was a woman, I can   t tell you how many people  she taught square dancing. We square danced for a long time down  there. We did in Washington, D.C., too. But we went down there and got  back into it.  How did you end up back here in Oklahoma?  Well, I want to tell you something. I would have never asked him to  move here. I would have never done that. It was his idea one day. He  said,    You know, all of my people are gone. Maybe it   s time for us to  move back to your home.    I said,    What   s got into you? You never        So he called my brother, and my brother said,    Well, what got into you?  You were just here and you never said nothing about moving.    So Lee  told Arlie, he said,    Arlie, you get out and look for some houses. I   m  going to send LaVerne out there on a plane. I have to go to New York on  business, and I   ll send her out there looking for a house.    Well, I came  and I bought one.  Pretty fast.  So what year did you move back?  We   ve been here twelve years.  And when you came back did you immediately get involved with  Germans from Russia again?  Well, I knew them all.  So you found them? They were just     Why, the Zion Church    See, I kept in touch with a lot of them.  23  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  And you had relatives in the church.  Oh yeah, and I had relatives here, sure. Frances and     Her brother   s still in the church, Arlie. His wife.  So did it feel just like coming home?  Not really. It   s different. I just can   t believe what Main Street is like.  These big trucks and cars are zooming     And the church changed a lot, too.  Oh, and the church is not the same Zion Church.  So you get together with Germans from Russia through the church, or  mostly through the organization?  There   s not very many of us from church that     Sam is a Catholic, and we go to the     She   s going with her husband to the Catholic Church.

But she hasn   t got hooked up with anybody up  there. But she   s a home person. Everything has to be just so-so in her  home, and her yard, and she does a lot of her yard work herself. She  cooks. They eat out very little. The last time Linda came here was     Christmas.  Christmas. She brought enough prepared food, already cooked for us for  the freezer. I still have a little of it left. Every kind of food that you can  think of that we always had that she has prepared for us.  Did she grow up with much of the German culture that you grew up  with?  No, because she wasn   t around any. Only when we brought her out here,  and Claire Kaiser was real fond of her.  Does she make German food?  She loves Strudla and noodles. And Reigelkuechle and stuff like that. I  usually have it when she gets here.  And the fruitcakes, she brings all of us for Christmas.  Oh, at Christmas time, I can   t tell you how many fruitcakes she makes.  Don   t you get one?  She always gives me a fruitcake.  And I think Frances and her dad.  Well, is there anything else about your history or heritage that you  would like to talk about today that we haven   t touched on?  Well, I really don   t know of anything.  Is this Germans from Russia group a big part of your life now?  Well, I   ll tell you what. When I left here, I   ve never lost contact of the  ones I grew up with out here. They   re not strangers to me.  And you still like to go.  Oh, yeah.  25  Finchum  Saylor  Finchum  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  And you still make German dishes?  Yes, I do, but my husband don   t eat such.  Do you have a favorite dish?  Well, I love Strudla nudla.  Is that what we   re going to learn how to make tomorrow?  I think that   s what you   re going to learn. But I think some of them make  it a little different than others do.  Was there a restaurant in the area that served German food when you  were growing up?  No, no.  Just Corn, I don   t know about     Not here in Weatherford.  But Corn   s only about, what, ten miles away?  Yeah, Corn is.  And it   s a Mennonite German  community .  That   s Mennonite. That   s a little different, but they are very nice people,  too.  Is there a Germans from Russia community in Bessie, also?  I don   t know.  That   s Lillian   s people.  Was there much dust that came through Weatherford in the 1930s  during the Dust Bowl?  It sure did, especially if you lived on a farm where they had spring  toothed or they plowed. I can remember how Mom was trying to keep  the dust from coming in the windows. It was bad.  Hang up wet dish towels.  26  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  Kissler  Saylor  Wilson  Saylor  And we had hay fever like nothing. Oh, it was awful. Sneezing all the  time.  What would she do to keep the sheets clean or the dishes clean?  Well, she just had to wash. But I   ll tell you. That wasn   t an easy thing,  either. Plus, everything that goes along with your daily things. But we  did that. I know wet clothes were put around quite a bit in different  places.  Do you remember any rabbit drives?  Rabbits? Well, yeah, we had some rabbits. But not a lot.  There weren   t too many?  No. We had a few snakes once in a while. Had to be careful going into  the chicken house. They   d want to eat eggs.  Do you remember feeling the effects of the Depression?  You bet we felt the effect of it. There was very little money, or you just,  I don   t know    I look back and I think,    How did they make it?    But we  never failed to have enough to eat. That was for sure.  You always had your garden.  That   s about it.  Well, I would like to thank you for talking with me today and sharing  your experiences.  Well, I   m glad to still be alive. (Laughs) I   ll tell you.  -------  -------
