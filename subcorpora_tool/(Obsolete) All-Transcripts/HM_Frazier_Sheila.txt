Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five kind of lightweight questions--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that they compel me to ask of everyone as a warmup, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Sure.
Speaker 1: They only require a short answer.  The first one is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Jerk chicken--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is my favorite.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I got one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Praise God.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I say that a lot.
Story_ID: 122792
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Dennis.  D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, D-E-N-N-I-S.  No middle initial.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born March 30, 1928.  And she was born--oh, you know what?  I can't remember if she was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, or she was born in New York.  I have to find that out for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's possible the ancestors on her side are from Portsmouth, or some anyway.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her mother is from Portsmouth.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them, and what do you know about them?  Any stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  You know, the sad thing is, is I really don't know a lot.  I mean, my--I mean, I knew my grandmother and my aunts very well, but they were in New York at that time.  So I haven't--I have no real recollection of being, you know, in the South as a young kid.  My grandfather, I have more of a history in memory with because we lived with him; my sisters and I lived with him for a couple of years when we were, like, I don't know, seven years old.  And that was in a rural part of Long Island [New York], Gordon Heights.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is your mother's father?
Speaker 2: This is my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was a great man.  In fact, I pattern a lot of the things about myself, because he was the kind of man that--and I don't know his education--but he would turn everything into a business.  And every business he ever started was a successful business.  So wherever there was a need, he created a business.  So in Long Island, where he built his house, he had a lot of parts, you know, in the yard, and when people needed parts for their cars, you know, he would sell it to them.  So he started used parts as a business.  When we were living with him and other children found--their found difficulty getting them to school, then he bought a school business and he started, you know, a school bus.  So everything became a business to him, you know, a service business in some way or another.  But he was, you know, an incredible man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's his name?
Speaker 2: Walter Dennis.
Speaker 1: Walter Dennis.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stores or any stories at all about the family in Virginia, you know, and period that goes back to slavery, you know or back to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  In fact, the majority of things that--well, by habit and by observation with my grandmother and her sisters, I would observe certain things, and more superstitions than anything else that came out of the background.  So I'm not sure where it came from, you know, but growing up, if the broom touched your foot, you know, like she would have to spit on the broom, you know, and take salt, throw over, you know, over the shoulder, you know.  And they had--they just had a great deal of superstitions and a lot of fears, you know.  Death was a shhh, you know.  Death, I'm not sure why, but death was very frightening to them.  Darkness in the woods would be very frightening to them.  So I would only imagine that that much of that came from stories that were passed down, because in those days, they passed tradition, which you know, through storytelling.  So I can only imagine what stories they, you know, they had.  But in just listening to a lot of my grandparents' superstitions, you know, they were--they were not something having growing up in the city that I ever experienced. It just seemed just so bizarre, you know.  It's like, whatever, you know, way back there.  So I never understood that.  So that's probably the only touch, you know, I had.  And my grandfather and my grandmother, they, I don't remember them being together.  So I think their breakup happened very early on, because he lived in the Bronx or Yonkers in New York.  So it was a different kind of exchange.
Speaker 1: Where did the grandmother live?
Speaker 2: Where did my grandmother live?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: She lived in Harlem [New York].  She was from Portsmouth, Virginia, she and her sisters.  But they all migrated to New York and settled in Harlem on 118th Street between Eighth--between Seventh Avenue and Eighth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or maybe down there it's Amsterdam because something happens, you know, where the streets cross (unclear).
Story_ID: 122793
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, did your mother [Dorothy Dennis] have any good stories of growing up that she shared with you or talked about what it was like growing up in--now, she grew up in Harlem [New York].  Right?
Speaker 2: She grew up--her father [Walter Dennis] really raised her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, in Yonkers [New York] and whatnot.  And the things that I recall her speaking of, you know, not a great, you know, but just what a hard worker my grandfather was and, you know, that he started an ice business.  And I don't know if you remember when the ice truck would come by, you know, and you'd have to take that big ice brick, you know, and carry it up to whoever it was in the apartments buying ice, you know.  And so, she would, you know, she would talk about that.  She would talk about that as a teenager, my mother is absolutely beautiful.  She looks like Lena Horne, beautiful woman.  And she would, you know, talk about just for fun how they would, you know, kind of just walk through, like, the streets past some of nightclubs and listen to the music and just kind of, you know.  It was a time when black people--entertainment was very vital.  And so, in Harlem in the Bronx, music and entertainment, it was sort of the lifeline to--well, I don't want to say "to their existence," but it was certainly an important aspect of it.  But her father was very strict; very, very strict.  And he protected her a great deal.  So she wasn't allowed to do a lot of things that perhaps a lot of the girls her age were able to do.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she go to school in Harlem or in Yonkers?
Speaker 2: I'm going to have to ask her some of the questions, because, you know--and this is really good we're talking about this, because I don't think I ever asked her.  I don't think that there was a conversation, sadly to say, that we've ever had.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know where she went to school.  She did attend college.  And my father [Eugene Cole Frazier] went into the service.  Oh, you haven't asked me about my father, yet.  So we're not there yet.
Speaker 1: Well, I can ask you, like, how did they meet?  How did they meet?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Some people have a story about it and some don't, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But if not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know how they met.  That's two things I'm going to ask her so far.  Something tells me I should have a little pen and pad myself.  I don't know how they met, you know.  But they were a cute couple, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I look like my father.
Story_ID: 122794
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go to your father.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Eugene, E-U-G-E-N-E; Cole, C-O-L-E; Frazier, F-R-A-Z-I-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born April 3--let me see.  Subtract six years from 1928.
Speaker 1: Oh, 1922 [April 3, 1922].
Speaker 2: That's when he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: In the Bronx.  Okay.  Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?  Do they have roots down south, too?
Speaker 2: Well, most of his family members, his father and his father's mother, as I recall, lived in New York in the Yonkers area and Bronx area.  Where they were from originally, I would say--no.  I was going to say Boston [Massachusetts], but, no.  They lived off of Boston Road.  I don't recall.  And I know I have asked the matriarch of our family, my auntie Peggy, but I don't recall where they're from originally.  I think the Bronx, though.  I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a lot of black people in New York from all the way--from way back, you know, so.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna have to--yeah, but I'm gonna have to find out where he was born, you know.  But I remember his father, Grandpa Gene; he was such a dapper man.  You know, back then, the style was, you know, like you'd wear these little applejack hats, you know, and they always had a cigarette hanging from the mouth, you know.  And, you know, that was what was very hip, you know.  But Grandpa Gene was, I remember both he and my father were great readers, because in the Bronx where they lived, you know the houses--the apartments were what we used to call railroad apartments, which were one room to just follow another room all the way to the front of the room.  And they had rooms filled from the ceiling to the floor with just books, books, books, books.  So, you know.  So he read.  I mean, his appetite was incredible.  And I got--I'm pretty sure he got that from his father.  I don't have ah lot of memories about Grandpa Gene other than, you know, his family was a very loving family.
Speaker 1: Gene, G-E-N-E (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Grandpa Gene?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  G-E-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a Eugene as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were they involved, with all this reading, were they involved in any organizations that, you know, fostered reading like that?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I mean, I knew my father was very active in--oh, what's an organization that has the Eastern Stars, and you have the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Mason.  The Shriners?
Speaker 2: Masons.  Very much involved in that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I don't know if his father, if that was something that was a tradition.  But he was very much involved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think that had something to do with all the reading?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I just think he--I just think, you know, some kids just enjoy reading, and I think that he was just one of them.  I think his mother was a reader as well, you know.  So, I think, you know, when you read, you teach your children to read.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father--now did he finish high school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both finished high school.  I don't know if he went to college.  I'm not certain.  You make me want to pick up the phone and start calling my auntie Peggy to find out.
Story_ID: 122795
Speaker 1: So was he [father Eugene Cole Frazier] a veteran of the war [World War II, 1939 - 1945]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  Now that was a tough thing for him.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: That was really tough, because I didn't find out until he died, until his funeral, that he had fought under [General George S.] Patton, you know.  And it wasn't until maybe three months before he passed away that he would talk about it. And he--it's the first time I ever heard him cry about it, because he--at that time, he was in a nursing home.  When he was in his mid-forties, he had suffered a double stroke.  So he was relegated to, you know, to a nursing home.  And he talked about the war and how it was to be--you know, to be out in the field, and he said, you know, and, like, see your entire command destroyed and you're the only one who survived.  And I didn't realize why he was in so much pain until he started, you know, talking--he couldn't figure out why he should've lived and they--why he would live and they would die.  That experience for him gave birth to alcoholism, and he was--my father, for me, you know, and my sisters, he was such a special, special human being because he loved us; he loved his girls.  I have two sisters.  And he loved us, you know, so much.  And there was just that other part that when, for example, if he heard a firecracker, you know, it would just kind of send him off, you know.  It would send him to that place.  So he sort of--he went, for what I understand from his sister, he went from being one personality to, you know, to this, you know, person who was extremely kind, but the alcohol, you know, which just sort of anesthetized a lot of the pain that he went through, you know.  Like, I remember my cotillion, you know, and like all of the girls' fathers, you know, had the first waltz and he was late, you know.  And I'm the only one standing there, and I'm waiting for, you know, for my father to come in and do the first waltz.  And my boyfriend's father came and took his place.  And when he came, you know, he was a little, you know, inebriated and whatnot.  But we were very close, my father and I.  We were extremely close, and to me he was an amazing good man, because we would talk.  We would talk about everything and anything, you know.  He was a man who never judged anyone, you know.  And then, I guess, I understand why because of his experience.  There was no reason to, but he was, you know, he was great communicator--great lover of animals, you know.  I mean, he was a sweetheart.  Now he and mother [Dorothy Dennis], they were divorced when I was very, very young, so I don't remember a great deal beyond the age of, maybe, five or six with him being in the home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he--you said he was with Patton.  Was he in one of--I know there was black tank unit that was with Patton--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I don't have any of--I don't have any information--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: other than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For those watching this, he might have been involved in the 761st Tank Battalion, which was a horrible experience for a lot of people in it.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was because they were mistreated at home and abroad (laughs) (unclear).  In pay they caught it both ways.
Speaker 2: Very, very, very possible.  And, you know, I wished that he would have talked about it, because I feel like I'm so hungry to know more about what drove him to certain things, you know, and put the pieces together.  But back then, you know--and it's very steeped deep in our culture, though we didn't talk about lot of things, you didn't discuss a lot of things that may have been off, painful or may have been something that was a reminder of a painful experience.  So everything was buried, you know, and dressed up.  You know, everything was fine and wonderful until you see, you know, like certain things, and it's like, "Well, what's wrong with Daddy?  Why is he so angry?  You know, "Oh, he'll be okay."
Speaker 1: Now, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He ran a factory.  I remember, as a little girl, there was a belt factory downtown in New York [New York], and he managed that.  And I also remember that, one time, he was a limousine driver.  But I don't remember a lot about that.  That may have been something that someone told me, you know.  But I remember very much the belt factory, because he was very proud of his girls.  So he would pick us up, and he would bring us, you know, to the factory and kind of, you know, like show us off and whatnot, you know, so.
Story_ID: 122796
Speaker 1: They must have met after the war, then; your parents [Eugene Cole Frazier and Dorothy Dennis]?  I guess they met right after the war [World War II]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And--now do you have any--you have two sisters, right.
Speaker 2: I have two sisters.
Speaker 1: Right.  Two sisters.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Diane and Linda.
Speaker 1: And are you their youngest or--
Speaker 2: I'm the middle.
Speaker 1: The middle?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughs).  The middle child and it was true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it's true, but, you know, that means--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  You know, middle children, they never feel like they belong on, like, on either side, you know, and they are usually the more creative ones.  They're usually the ones that cause more--wreak more havoc, you know.  I was--I used to fight my sisters a lot as a kid.  Okay.  Okay.  And my mother used to stay, "Go--(unclear)--.  And I would always beat my sisters up and whatnot.  And I think it came out like, "Why don't you understand me?  Why don't you understand me?" You know, as a kid.  But, yeah, middle children are very interesting, because they have--I don't know if all middle, but for, like, me, I had a great sensitivity to both of my parents.  And, like, I always felt like what was most, you know, important was communication, "talk to me," you know.  I always wanted to be talked to, to be understood.  And then, you know, growing up was like a child has their place and parents have their place and whatnot.  Yeah.  We grew up in the projects of New York, the Lower East Side of Manhattan.   I still remember, 44 East Houston Street.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory, a very first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably, my earliest childhood memory--you mean in the projects or just period?
Speaker 1: Just period.
Speaker 2: Probably growing up in the projects, which was such fun, you know, because in our project there were a lot of kids who became actors and, you know, and jazz musicians and such and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Richard Mason.  Richard Mason was very close to Gil Noble in New York.  My uncle, Jackie Mclean, lived on the third floor, you know.
Speaker 1: That's the famous jazz musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was married to my aunt.
Speaker 1: He played the saxophone.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.  He passed away last year.  But there were actors who, you know, who you may not know of.  In that whole family, the Mason family, there was a Richard and there was--what was his other brother's name?  I can't remember.  Oh, God.  But they both got involved in, you know, in the industry--
Story_ID: 122797
Speaker 1: You might want to go back and tell me something about your father [Eugene Cole Frazier] that you just found out, you know (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah--oh yes, yeah, yes.  I called my--I called the matriarch of the family, my auntie Peggy, and she was telling me that my father, he did not go to college.  He was, you know, born and raised in the Bronx [New York], and he went directly from high school into the service [U.S. Army], where he fought under [General George S.] Patton.  And he was actually a--he drove a truck, she said, in the convoy.  I don't know what, you know--she didn't know what the unit was.  She said she'd have to do a lot of digging through his paperwork.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They had this famous unit of black drivers called the Red Ball Express.
Speaker 2: Oh.  And she says that it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Ivan Dixon had a T.V. show based on their (adventures?)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and exploits on T.V., you know.
Speaker 2: Was that the series--real--was that what was?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  And she was saying that--I was asking her also about the reading, you know.  And so she said that, you know, that they just all always read; he and his sisters and, you know, that they would just--it was just something that they did because their aunt Lula was a school teacher.  And, you know, and when they would get bored, she would say, you know, "Pick up a book."  You know, and that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they all read.
Speaker 1: So, but just for--there's no guarantee that he was in the Red Ball Express itself, but he was in some sort of truck convoy?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: A Quartermaster Corps in the Army during World War II with Patton?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 122798
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, earliest childhood memories.  We were talking about those.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: Your earliest childhood memory, you said that a lot of images have popped up.  But you talked about where you lived.  You gave us the address and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  On Houston Street--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on the Lower East Side of New York [New York].  And one of the fun things that we always did, which I really like was rolling skating, 'cause I was, like, rolling skating queen.  And--oh, but there was something--oh.  I had talked about when--well, okay.  Let me back up.  My mother [Dorothy Davis] and father [Eugene Cole Frazier] had a divorce very early.  So my mother was raising myself and my two sisters [Diane and Linda], and we didn't have very much money at all.  But we didn't know.  Kids don't have any kind of understanding of what money is.  And we saw--when she (unclear) was out--she must have been downstairs in one of the other apartments--and we saw a five dollar bill on the dresser.  And we--and my sisters and I were, like, "Oh, yeah, five dollars."  So we took the five dollars, and we went across the street to the candy store.  And we bought, like, this huge bag of candy, you know, the plastic lips and the nails, you know, and the paper dots, you know.  And we were just in heaven; five dollars worth.  When Mommy came home and saw that, well, she had a field day on our butts.  We really, really got it.  And then we had to do go back down to the store and ask the man to take the candy back.  So it was one of the things--when I realize how hurt she was, you know, that this--watching her response and, you know, and how upset she was over this five dollars, you know, because to us it was just a piece of paper, I realized that that five dollars must have meant a heck of a lot to her for her to respond to that, to that five dollars.  And I realized that that's all she had was that five dollars, you know.  So we learned the value of a five dollar bill and the value of leaving my mother's money alone, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  No.  I mean, Daddy always liked music.  He loved, like, Sarah Vaughan and, you know, he was a romantic, so a lot of the music of that time was the music that, you know, that I recall.  So Sarah Vaughan and, I know you probably remember it, you can help me out; but, music became interesting when my aunt [Clarice] "Dollie" [McLean] married Jackie McLean, because then jazz filtered into my life.  And so we would hear him blowing, you know, playing his horn through the project window; as you know, you could hear it.  And I remember going down to the apartment and just hearing him, you know, play.  And it was fascinating seeing other jazz musicians come by their home and, you know, perform and whatnot.  And I remember hearing that it was such an interesting sound, it didn't seem to connect like other music; like Daddy's music, which was more melodic and, you know, had a different kind of rhythm.  This was some sporadic sounds, and you know, that they just kind--it gave me a different kind of sensitivity and a different kind of feeling, you know.  And so, when I got older enough, I mean, I used to go down to Slug's [Saloon, New York City, New York] and, you know, listen to some of the jazz greats down there.
Story_ID: 122799
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're saying you gained an appreciation, I guess, for bebop and other forms of jazz?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And see, and also, my aunt [Clarice] "Dollie" [McLean], she was in the theatre, you know.  And so you just, you know, so you would hear about the Bohemians, you know.  And that was kind of like the "in" thing there, where everyone was into art in a different way, you know.  And so it was kind of, like, a very cultural experience for me.  Because as I said, from the--in the Bronx [New York] when we would stay with my father [Eugene Cole Frazier], it would be one kind of music playing, you know, and whatnot.  And then in the projects, it would be a different kind of music in addition to the other sounds, because the projects was filled with poor blacks, poor Jews, and poor Puerto Ricans, you know.  And all of us had our own sounds, our own music and whatnot.  And so you'd pass the--on the second floor, you know, and like it would be the salsa music playing or, you know, which I always liked, too.  So it was just sounds.  The sounds of the projects.  It's probably one of the most impactful times of my life; that and living with my grandfather.  But the projects was something that was cultural.
Speaker 1: Were they like high-rise projects?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were--I don't know-twenty-six stories.  I forget what the average was.  So they were pretty high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the name--they were the what?  What was the name of the projects again?
Speaker 2: Oh, and they did have a name.
Speaker 1: In the Bronx?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  On the Lower East Side of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh.  Lower East Side.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was 44 East Houston Street.  And they were called something.  I'll find.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, anybody doing research of it will be able to figure out from what we're saying, I guess (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, 'cause--
Speaker 1: But, what was your aunt's name, Dollie?
Speaker 2: [Clarice] Dollie.  McLean.
Speaker 1: Dollie, well.  Yeah.  Okay.  Finally.  Yeah, I guess I'll (laughs)--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was church a big part of growing up --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly, enough.  My mother [Dorothy Dennis] and father never took us to church, but they assigned each one of us a godmother.  And so the godmother--and the godmothers, they were all--I don't know how they found them--but they were all from Jamaica, you know.  And they're kind of rigid, too.  They were very rigid.  And so--although each of us had a godmother, I don't know where the two eventually went away.  Mine was, I remember, her name was Ms. Eastman, you know.  And I don't know why they were so mean, but we wound up all being under the care of Mrs. Miller, you know.  And Mrs. Miller, she really impacted our lives in that way where we went to church every Sunday.  And she taught us, you know, the "Our Father," you know, the Lord's Prayer. And she probably laid the foundation for a reverence of God and a belief that there is a God, you know.  And so, she developed--she helped develop our discipline and--which paid off years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we didn't stay with it once we got, you know, older.  We kind of all went, you know, but we all came back.
Story_ID: 122800
Speaker 1: What did you like--now, you like to skate and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Skate and ride a bicycle.  I remember I wanted a bicycle more than anything in this world.  And they were throwing out this old bicycle.  It was--I remember it had a blue fender on it.  It was a sky blue fender, and the wheel was all twisted, you know.  And I took that bicycle as a project, you know.  And I worked with it, and, you know, and helped straighten it, you know.  I mean--and I remember the first time I was able to ride the bicycle, you know, although the wheel was going back and forth and shimmying.  The thrill I got from being able to take something and fix it, you know, and function, was probably--it was a highlight for me, because that bicycle was, like, the greatest thrill.  So bicycle riding, skating, and then we would all--on the other side of the FDR Drive was this big drum; at least it looked like a huge drum, and we used just climbing on it, because there was an echo, you know.  And we would all be singers, and we would be, you know, orators and whatnot (laughs), you know.  And so it was just--I think it was the camaraderie that, like, all of us--all of the families had one thing in common, is that we were all poor.  So, you know, so there was a bond there amongst the children who--we never knew anything about poverty, but it bred families and relationships, you know, that would last a lifetime.  And so, you know, so we played, you know, together and we were all just very committed to each other.  I can't even explain it, you know.  The most devastating thing for us was when we left the projects and moved to New Jersey, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: Ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ten years old.  We moved to Englewood, New Jersey.  Englewood with an E, N-G-L-E-W-O-O-D.
Speaker 1: Every community seems to have an Englewood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Los Angeles [California] got one with an I.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Inglewood, yeah, but that was an I.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's very true.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Everybody's got an Englewood.  But, now did you move into a house or something there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was--that was probably really, really tough, because as I said, when you live in the projects, you have relationships.  You have--even the sounds, you know, were, you know, just the loud traffic.  You know, all of the sounds are what you become accustomed to.  That's your rhythm.  But when we moved to New Jersey, that was really tough because it was quiet, you know.  And it was just--the quiet was louder than the, like, sounds.  And we were used to--you know, you wake up in the morning and you go, "E I Kee" (ph); that was a big thing.  We used to go (makes sounds).  And everybody, you know, in the (unclear) of the projects, you know, we knew to wake up and kind of meet, you know, convene.  But Englewood, New Jersey, was a whole different ballgame.  It's like what do you do with this, you know?  Where are the people?  Where's the, you know.  (Unclear), you know, like, where's the smells, you know, of the Puerto Rican food and the, you know, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, this "E I Kee" thing, I think that's from 'Lassie,' I think, or one of these T.V. shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know it is.  It's from one of them, but I can't think of which one.
Speaker 2: Was it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was one of the early T.V. shows--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --'Father Knows Best?'  Was it--
Speaker 1: --where they would go, "E I Kee," and everybody would come together.
Speaker 2: I don't know where it came from.
Speaker 1: So you all were doing it in the projects--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: We would do it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We go "E I Kee," and we'd go (makes sound).  (Laughs.)  Real great language, you know.  Great language.  But, yeah.  That was our, you know, our club; our club call.
Story_ID: 122801
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had to adjust to a whole different rhythm of life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that was really tough for me.  That was really, really tough because for two reasons, you know.  My stepfather, you know--I mean, this is how we moved to New Jersey--he was white, and back in those days in 1958, that was a tough thing, because, you know, you just didn't intermarry, you know.  And so, but in this area of New Jersey of Englewood, it was okay; because on one side was a black family; on the other side was an Italian family; across the street was an interracial couple, you know.  So it became easier, you know, to deal with on some levels.  But the transition from what I've remembered, you know, in the projects and just my father, you know, it made a really hard transition.  Everything became new, you know.  But it was probably the best thing that ever happened to any of my sisters or I, because where we lived in Englewood was really like a 'Happy Days.'  You know, I mean, school and our neighborhood.  On our street alone, you had Clyde McPhatter--I don't know if you remember Clyde McPhatter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Clyde McPhatter.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a rock n' roll singer back in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, from the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was it the Impressions or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I know he was with a group, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Singing).  Remember that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Who was it?  Was it the Drifters or--Clyde McPhatter and the whatever.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Either the Drifters or the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Platters?
Speaker 1: No.  It wasn't the Platters.
Speaker 2: It wasn't the Platters?
Speaker 1: Drifters or the--I know there's another group that was similar to--the Coasters?  It is Coasters?  'Cause the Coasters and the Drifters--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There was a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I know, had similar styles now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But on this street--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Clyde McPhatter.
Speaker 2: --it was an amazing street.
Speaker 1: I remember Clyde McPhatter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then down at the end of the street were the Isley Brothers.
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.
Speaker 2: Around the corner was Van McCoy, you know.  Van McCoy was a composer and producer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, there again, music and the creative process was around us.
Story_ID: 122802
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned earlier your aunt [Clarice "Dollie" McLean] knew a lot of people in the theatre.  Was she in the theatre herself?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  She had sort of being doing some acting.  Years later when I decided to become an actress or at least explore that, she was the first person I called and talked to.  She was the one who encouraged me to go.
Speaker 1: Now, was she in the American Negro Theatre over there in Harlem [New York]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  She was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --she was at a theatre group in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know if it was NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].  I don't think so.  But, yeah, she was part of a theatre group downtown.
Speaker 1: I know that--there was a WPA [Works Progress Administration] project they called--not, I don't know--it's not the--well, the one that Orson Welles--(unclear)--in for a while that [HM] Ossie Davis and [HM] Ruby Dee ran after the war.  Right after the war.
Speaker 2: Oh.  I don't--you know.  I have no idea.  I have no idea, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That she was involved in theatre?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it black theatre as such or with some other black folks?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think so.  During that time, it probably was more like--more than likely black theatre.  But I'm going to ask her.
Speaker 1: Yea.  I think it there was a Rose--a Rose McClendon in New York.  Is that the name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Because I only knew--when I was coming up in the theatre, it was NEC, the Negro Ensemble Company, where I studied; and then there was the New Federal Theatre, you know, where I studied there as well; and then when I studied it was HB Studio.  Now HB Studios, I mean, that was run by, like, Uta Hagen, and you know, in that group.  So that was not a black theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to ask about that, 'cause I didn't want that to get away without asking if she was, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Dollie McLean.
Speaker 2: --that's right.  She and Uncle Jackie [McLean], they started a whole cultural group up in Hartford, Connecticut, you know.  And they--and he was the dean, I think, at Hartford University.  He was the Dean of Music there.  And so they have a huge cultural organization up in Connecticut now.  And I think all of the disciplines are taught there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we need to get their numbers to interview them later.
Speaker 2: Oh, you've got to interview her.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You've got--because she can tell--you know, she can talk about, one, Jackie, you know, who, you know, and I'm sure she's got tons of footage and, you know, and photographs of him.  But just their efforts to preserve and to, you know, and to keep the art form, you know, going.  I mean, she's amazing.  She's amazing.
Story_ID: 122803
Speaker 1: Now, let me just ask you about the schools you attended.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your first grade school?
Speaker 2: P.S. 97.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: P.S. 97 was on Houston Street [New York City].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that street?  I keep hearing it.
Speaker 2: H-O-U--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: H-O-U--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Foreigners say Houston (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  It's Houston in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Houston.
Speaker 1: --New York.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: P.S. 97.
Speaker 2: P.S. 97.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's where--so you were there until you moved to New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  P.S.--I remember my teacher's name was Mr. Mendel.  And I was a class favorite of Mr. Mendel.  And so Mr. Mendel, when he would leave the classroom, he would leave me in charge.  And I think he had a crush on my mother, you know.  I think that's probably why he did that.  But I'll never forget, there was this kid, Edgar Allen [ph.].  And Edgar Allen was so mischievous, so Mr. Mendel said, "You know, if the kids act up, you put a check next to their name."  Now, then in those days, you know, they were allowed to spank you and such so, but his discipline was, however many checks you had next to your name would determine how many fingers got pressed down, you know, like this; or how many books were slammed over your head.  In this instance, Edgar Allen  was just, I mean, he would just taunt me.  Right?  And anything--then I said, "Okay.  Edgar, you know, you got to sit down."  He said, "Oh, shut up."  So, I (motioning).  So by the time the teacher came back, he had five checks next to his name.  And Mr. Mendel took five books about this thick (motioning), you know, and just kind of stacked them up together, slammed it over his head five times, and took, you know--well, four of his fingers, and just kind of just pressed them down.  Well, Edgar, you know, when that was over, he said (motioning). "See my pinky, see my thumb, see my fist, you better run."  And so after school I was scared to death.  "Oh, he's going to kill me."  Right?  And so I start home, 'cause the school was across the street from the projects.  And Edgar Allen jumped on my back, and I think he--I think I ran all the way home with him on my back (laughs) screaming.  I was like, "Get off of me."  But that was my experience at P.S. 97.
Speaker 1: Well, those are days that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my God.
Speaker 1: --it's hard to imagine that now, you know, a teacher hitting a kid with five books.
Speaker 2: You know.  And it was something the people just did.
Speaker 1: Took for--yeah.
Speaker 2: You know.  Or they had a board, you know.  And, like, you'd have to bend over and they would, you know, like, whack you.
Speaker 1: They have the holes in it?
Speaker 2: I don't--no.  I don't remember any holes.  Yeah, to make it go faster (laughs).  I don't remember the holes.  I don't remember the ventilation.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: I just remember that, like, they found all kinds of ways of disciplining us, you know.  And then on some levels, discipline was a great thing, you know, that they could spank you.  Not the way he did, because I didn't learn too much later how abusive that was, you know.  We didn't know.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In fact, just the thought--just the threat of that made us behave, except Edgar.  But, no, they--P.S. 97 was an interesting experience.  It really was.
Speaker 1: Now did you--I mean, in retrospect, do you think it was a good school in terms of did you learn a lot there or was it too--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's too long ago.  I don't really think I was educated until we moved to New Jersey, because the classrooms were smaller; there was a different level of, you know, like, in New York, you know, the intensity, the frenzy of New York sometimes was in the classroom, too.  In New Jersey, you know, it was a much calmer existence, you know, and kids had a different level of respect for the teacher.  So, I think I probably learned more.
Story_ID: 122804
Speaker 1: In--but, you know, I had a speech impediment growing up.  So the stammer really got in the way of me learning things, you know, because, I just, you know, just the idea of having to, like, speak was just kind of like.
Speaker 2: Did you always have a speech impediment, I mean?
Speaker 1: As long as I can remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As long as I can remember, 'cause I remember as a young kid in the projects I had it.  But I don't remember when it began, you know.  So, you know.  I don't know, but I know it carried me all the way through.  The only time--well, I'll tell you when I discovered I did not--or I could control it, once we get further along.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  When you reflect back on it, do you have any understanding of why you had a speech impediment or what's that about?
Speaker 1: I don't--you know, I don't really know.  Like, my mother [Dorothy Dennis] used to joke and say, you know, like when she and Daddy [Eugene Cole Frazier] used to, like, play, you know, and toss me (unclear), which he would throw me into her arms, she would throw me, you know, then maybe it started then, you know.  Because I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  And she can't remember when it began.
Speaker 2: I know there're different theories about it.  And other people we've interviewed have the same, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Oh, really.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it's hard for people to still figure it out after all these--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: I don't know, you know.  I don't know.  Some people say it comes out of a trauma of some sort, you know.  But I don't know.  I just remember it's something I've always done.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did you have a favorite subject at school?
Speaker 1: I always liked history, you know.  I always-I always enjoyed hearing the back story of something, you know.  I used to be fascinated, I remember, as a little girl hearing about the Pilgrims and the Indians, you know.  I mean, you know, just a little historical stories and what not.  And then as you get older, you discover other stories, like Toussaint [Louverture], you know.  And then, just things that, like I said, "Wow, you know.  So, Africa?"  You know.  "So, not everybody dresses like this or has this--" and then, you know, just little things.  So history was something I always liked.
Speaker 2: Was there much in the way of black history taught when you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.  No.  No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  In fact, even growing up in New Jersey, I don't remember being taught anything about black history.
Story_ID: 122805
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you--I read that you always wanted to be an actress.  You always thought you would be.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: And, you know, is there a---were you fond of television and movies--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to watch movies.  You know, children--people who stutter have an incredible imagination, you know.  And so, we can watch something and study it and then put ourselves in it.  So acting was an expression that I would be probably envy most, because it was something that was as far away from me thinking that I could do that, you know.  And do, I used to watch, like, movies on television, and I'd go stand in a mirror, you know, and reenact it and whatnot.  And in [Dwight Morrow High School, Englewood] New Jersey, we had something called "spats nights."  And Margaret Travolta, John Travolta's sister, she was a senior when I was in ninth grade, I think.  And so I used to love watching her on stage, because she could sing and she could dance and she could do everything.  And then there was Hazel Smith, who could, you know, who could sing.  And you had blacks and then whites sung on stage when they were performing, and I just thought, "Wow.  What an amazing thing, to stand up there in front of an audience and perform."  I wouldn't stand in front of an audience to perform, because the idea of--even in the classroom when the teacher would have me read a play or something, you know, I mean, the kids, you know, would turn around and say, "Oh, yeah.  You don't fight, but go ahead and read this."  And I would start, and I'd go (stuttering), you know.  And they would just laugh and laugh and laugh.  And the teachers thought they really thought they were helping me by giving me that exercise, you know.  But it was, like, punishment really.  But, I wouldn't learn that I could--that acting could be a realization until much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have any favorite movies or actresses, you know, from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Susan Haywood.  Loved Susan Haywood's work, you know.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You have a favorite movie of hers--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: 'I'll Cry Tomorrow.'  Loved that movie.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know.  And there was something about her vulnerability, you know.  She was vulnerable, but yet she was tough.  And I admired that about her, you know.  And she was very transparent as a performer.  And I liked Diana Sands.  But I don't think I saw Diana Sands until much later, you know, because growing up there weren't a lot of black actors on television, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think every now and then you see 'Cabin in the Sky,' maybe on a late night movie.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was just going to say that when I saw 'Carmen,' you know, and I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 'Carmen Jones'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, and I was, like, "Is that their voices?"  You know.  And Brock Peters and Dorothy; and [HM] Harry Belafonte, you know.  All people I would--with the exception of Dorothy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Dandridge.
Speaker 2: Dandridge.  Thank you.  You know, but I mean, Brock and--Brock Peters and Harry Belafonte--all, you know, many of them I would meet later on in years and whatnot.  But I thought, "Wow.  How pretty.  How beautiful."  You know.  I mean, that was the first thing that struck me, was that, was the beauty of us, you know, and that there were all different colors of us, you know, performing, and she was sassy, you know.  And I always identified with sassy, you know, because I was so rebellious as a kid.  So that really, you know, I liked that.  But just the singing and the story really left an impression.  'Cabin in the Sky' was-'Cabin in the Sky' and there was 'Greener'--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 'Green Pastures.'
Speaker 2: 'Green Pastures.'  Loved those movies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And [HM] Ruby Dee, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, did you see--oh, Ruby Dee, she was in a lot of television productions in those days and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that was all much--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) later.
Speaker 2: --much later.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, did you see any of these movies at the movies actually?
Speaker 2: I don't remember see--no.  No.  'Carmen' and 'Cabin in the Sky,' I know all those movies I saw, I believe, on television.  I believe.  The movies I would go to, I would see westerns.  You know, that was the big thing as a kid.  You'd see a lot of westerns and 3D was very popular.
Story_ID: 122806
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite T.V. show?
Speaker 2: Growing up, I used to like 'Father Knows Best.'  I used to enjoy that.  You know, it was 'Father,' no, 'Superman.'  Loved 'Superman.'  You know, these are all the shows that were very popular, you know, so.  Oh, Roy Rogers and Tonto, the lone cowboy--the lone--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 'Lone Ranger'?
Speaker 2: 'The Lone Ranger.'
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: 'The Lone Ranger,' and 'Annie Oakley,' 'cause I was going to be Annie Oakley.  I was going to (motioning), you know.  I was going--I loved 'Annie Oakley.'  And that was it pretty much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, what high school--what school did you go to in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: In New Jersey?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You started, what, fifth grade when you were ten?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In the fifth grade, it was Liberty School [Englewood, New Jersey].  Then junior high school was the Englewood School.  High School was Dwight Morrow [High School, Englewood, New Jersey].  And then I left New Jersey, and although I was accepted at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I didn't go because I didn't want to go through any more painful experiences with the stuttering, you know.  So it was such a painful experience, I didn't want to do that.  So immediately started working.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had a scholarship to Central State or you were accepted to Central?
Speaker 2: I was accepted.  Now, I didn't apply to Central State until after, like, until after I'd entered the, like, workforce.  And then I flew up to Central State to visit some friends of mine.  I flew up to Central State to visit a girlfriend of mine, and then I, because I told her, you know, "Well, I think I'm ready to go to school now."  So she introduced me to the dean and we worked it out what they were going to give me, you know, allow me a scholarship to attend.  And then I just backed out.  I backed out.  It wouldn't be until much later that I would go to, like, in California, you know.  I entered a community college there and took different courses at UCLA [University of California-Los Angeles], you know.  But I still haven't finished college.  One day, I'll finish that.
Story_ID: 122807
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're just to back to high school [Dwight Morrow High School, Englewood, New Jersey] for one minute now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, here you have this speech impediment.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you're, I would guess, a very attractive young lady in high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But never thought of myself as attractive.
Speaker 1: And did you get--so you didn't get any attention for being attractive, I mean--(unclear)--simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, sure.  Sure.  I mean--you mean, did I have boyfriends?
Speaker 1: No.  Well, I'm sure you probably did.  But, I'm just thinking, did you think about modeling or something like that or where you didn't have to talk, you know?
Speaker 2: You know, I thought about modeling and did modeling once I left home, but not as a young person.  I mean, when you stutter, you think everything about you is unattractive, you know, and would be made fun of.  So the idea of doing anything that was--that reflected a self-confidence, it just wasn't there yet, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you involved in clubs or that sort of thing in high school at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I was in the marching corps.  You know, my sister, Diane, was the first black--what's it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Majorette or cheerleader?
Speaker 2: The leader of the marching corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  In fact, Margaret--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Drum major or is that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I forgot.  I don't even remember what they were called, because Margaret Travolta and her best friend, Lila, they were the last ones.  My sister was--when my sister became, like, the head of it, and it must have been--I'll just say the marching corps leader; then I, auditioned for it and became a part of that.  So, which meant that we would dance at the football games and at half time.  So as a part of that.  But I didn't get involved in anything that would require me to talk a lot, you know.  I always said--as I said, I always had a fascination for history and science, but I wouldn't get involved in either one of the classes outside of that.  I was very good athletically, you know.  I was very good at sports.  Because, once again, you didn't have to talk, you know, but you can express it in a physical sense.
Speaker 1: Did you do any--did you play tennis or run track or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Ran a little track.  Softball, I was good.  I was good at climbing those ropes, you know.
Speaker 1: That takes a lot of strength.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the key is in, like, how you wrap that rope around your leg, and then kind of just put your foot there and just kind of pull--hoist yourself up and whatnot.  But I liked sports because I could excel at that.
Story_ID: 122808
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So when you're a senior then, you said you didn't apply to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] until after you got in the workforce.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you weren't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know what was interesting?  Although the high school in the area where we lived, it was a very middleclass lifestyle, you had counselors that encouraged the black girls to be secretaries, you know.  Don't think about school.  In fact, that's what my guidance counselor told me, not to think about college.
Speaker 2: Now, we have lots of these counseling stories and we could probably put a book together about counseling the black people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --but are you sure that they told you different?  I mean, gave you different advice from the, you know, than they gave to the white students, I mean, the white girls?
Speaker 1: I didn't compare it to other, you know, like, students.  But I know that all of my white girl friends, and whatnot, I know the counselors worked with them to help them choose the right college or university for them.  I know there were several stories, including my own, where we were encouraged to become secretaries.  So I don't know if they came to the counselors and insisting, you know, because their parents expected that.  I don't know, but I do know that they worked with them to identify colleges for them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did your older sister go to college?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  She went to Bishop College [Marshall, Texas], you know.  And I'm not sure how that came about.
Speaker 2: Now that's down in Texas.  Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  See, you know everything, don't you?
Speaker 2: No.  --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Wow.  Yeah.  Right (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: She went to Bishop College.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, but--all right.  So nobody was encouraging you to go.  Did your parents have any--I mean, did your mother say, "Well, (unclear), you got to go to college."
Speaker 1: Well, no.  See, here's the thing.  I was such a little renegade that when I graduated from high school, I left New Jersey and moved to New York [New York].  So I was seventeen when I left home.  And I moved back to New York and had a room with my godmother.  And so, I just went into the workforce.  You know, I had a couple of jobs.
Speaker 2: Did you do secretarial work?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, that I was good at.  Stenography and typing and whatnot.  So I became an executive secretary at Allied Stores Corporation.  And I remember my boss's name was Ambrose Crowley.  The sweetest man in the world.  Ambrose Crowley.  He used to turn beet red when I would come up with an excuse why I couldn't come in or why I didn't come in or why I had to leave.
Speaker 2: Now, the name of the place was--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Allied Stores Corporation.
Speaker 2: Allied Stores.
Speaker 1: They owned all of the Stern's stores.
Speaker 2: So this is what, 19--okay; 1966?
Speaker 1: This was '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 122809
Speaker 1: Before I get you too far along, I want--now, did you have any--were there any people that you considered to be mentors or special teachers in [Dwight Morrow] High School [Englewood, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: There were teachers that I admired a great deal, because it's the--because there was Dr. Carrol, who was the math teacher.  He taught geometry and algebra.  There was Dr. Ashley.  Dr. Ashley taught music.  In fact, I ran into his niece.  I haven't seen Dr. Ashley since I left high school and whatnot.  But I ran into his niece, like, a couple of months ago.  She said, "Oh, you know, good ol'--he told me to tell you hello."  So, yeah.  And because--oh, and there was another teacher who--all of the black teachers impressed most because you didn't see them.  I mean, it was very odd to, like, see black teachers.  So I was most impressed with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you're in New York City, 1966, so.
Speaker 2: I'm in the--oh, yeah.  I moved back to New York City.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And with my godmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I started working for Allied Stores.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, well, for how long did you do secretarial work before you got involved in the arts?
Speaker 2: I think I was there for about three years, and--maybe about three years. And I was on the subway one day, and a guy came up to me and asked me if I had ever considered modeling.  And so I said, "Well, no."  And he said, "Well, you know, you should.  I'm a photographer.  I work for, for a very popular photographer."  And then he said, "You know, you should come with me."  "No.  I mean, I couldn't do that now."  You know, I think I would be a little bit wiser.  So I said, "Really?"  He said, "Yeah.  I think you could model."  So I got off the train and the studio was off of forty--we got off the train at 42nd Street.  And the photography studio was on 8th Avenue in the, like, 38th or something like that.  And the studio was owned by Burt Andrews.  Now, Burt Andrews was a premier photographer that captured all of the images of blacks on Broadway.  He has a wonderful book, you know.  And so, he chronicled our history, essentially.  And that's where he and I became very, very close; but it's also where my modeling career began, because we started taking pictures.  And I did some runway in New York.  Didn't particularly care for modeling, because I thought that it was too plastic.  I didn't like standing there and having all that attention on me; just in my face, 'cause I wasn't that secure to have that kind of concentrated attention.  But modeling was, like, fun after it was over, you know.  Walking down the runway, I thought I would pass out because of the attention, you know.  So I realized that wasn't going to work for me.  So I did that.  I modeled and then I became--there was a fashion magazine that I think [HM] Vy Higginsen, who wrote 'Mama, I Want to Sing.'  Vy and I worked together back--I think the magazine was called Boutique magazine.
Speaker 1: And so, after that era was when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So this is, like, 1970 or so, Boutique magazine?
Speaker 1: Boutique magazine, I believe was probably, like, maybe '69 [1968], '70 [1970].  Maybe '69 [1969], because '70 [1970] was when I got my first commercial.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.  So I'm not even sure how I even got in that game, but.
Story_ID: 122810
Speaker 1: Now, this is--now, I haven't asked you about this, but, now you're growing up right on the--during the real stretch around about the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Black Power Movement is starting up and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your family discuss that very much at home?
Speaker 2: No.  Because, remember, during that time, I was on my own.  And so, I was very much interested in hearing about Civil Rights.  Didn't quite learn all, you know, a lot about--I think my first political impact came from John [F.] Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I remember, as we all do, we remember the moment and the time when we got that call saying that he had been assassinated.  And I felt it.  So, this man had impacted me because I'm sure the conversations around me growing up was that this was a great man, a great politician; someone who was a friend of minorities and black people.  That was the sense, okay.  So I didn't know a great deal about it, because by the time I had moved to New York [New York], I think that there were other stirrings.  Like there was the--I think the beginning of--what--the Panther Party--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Black Panther Party--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The starting of the--really, like the Black Arts Movement in New York was really starting to jump.
Speaker 2: Now, see.  I wasn't a part of that, I mean, because I still was not a part of the arts at that point, not really.  But I was very impressed with Malcolm X, you know.  I was very impressed with his, like, standpoint on who was a field nigger and who was a house nigger, you know.  And I remember reading that book, and, although working at Allied Stores, I was one of two black people on the executive floor.  And so, I watched how the people who cleaned the bathrooms and whatnot, how they would always kind of, you know, they knew their place.
Story_ID: 122811
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So it disturbed me how they were almost invisible.  And so, I remember having these conversations with them, "Do you know who you are?"  And I started this whole militant thing about them.  I said, "You guys should have a union."  And so, it was all from the impression I had on 'Malcolm Speaks.'  And so I started becoming more and more militant.  And by the time I left Allied Stores [New York, New York], I was more prone to, at that point, the [Black] Panthers and their impact.  I felt like that they had the answer.  So I remember--my hair used to be down to here, and back then growing up you had the relaxers in your hair and whatnot.  And I remember I had my hair cut off, and I went to this place on 135th Street where they could put this solution in your hair--I think it was a vinegar or something solution, to kind of turn the straightener around and get some kind of frizz and whatnot.  So my Afro, you know, it was big.  And I remember going to the Panther headquarters in Harlem [New York].  And I remember me going in saying I want to learn more, I want to hear more about what's going on.  And I was with my--a girlfriend of mine.  And her hair was still kind of just relaxed and she had, you know--and they wouldn't let her in, but they would let me in.  And so then they went and started drilling me, "Where do I live."  I said, "Well, I live up on 181st and Haven Avenue."  "Oh, you live around white people.  Blah, blah, blah."  And they went through this whole thing, and I'm saying, "Yeah, but I'm here to get some information about you all."  "Yeah, but you're still up there with the white man and the (unclear)."  And I'm saying, "Yeah, but I'm down here trying to figure out how I can help you."  And they took me to--so finally, the other side of me came out.  And so I just went off on the guard.  I remember, "Y'all are so stupid.  I'm telling you I'm coming down here and you're telling me this old silly stuff, blah, blah, blah.  Listen, either you're interested in me being a part of the--or you're not."  It's like, "Okay, sister.  You're down."  (Laughs.)  I didn't even have a clue what I was talking about.  I didn't have a clue.  But I knew that it brought me closer to that sense of valuing who we were as a people.  You know, I think the goal has always been in my heart, was to find ways to feel a sense of pride about who we are and where we came from.  So I think identifying with them was just a beginning or perhaps a deeper way of connecting to who we are.
Story_ID: 122812
Speaker 1: All right.  So you did some volunteer work with the [Black] Panthers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was interesting, 'cause I was still working downtown [New York, New York].  And when I would leave there, I would notice that on the street when I would walk downtown, that there people snapping pictures.  And I remember hearing that, "You'll be followed.  And you'll be this and (unclear)."  I mean, I'm sure they discovered that I was no threat whatsoever, because I didn't even know half of what I was doing.  But it really impacted how I dealt with this--the janitorial system; you know, that group, and my relationship with people, blacks who were in that area in a--what's it called--in a service form of business.  I never, ever, ever liked the idea of treating them any less.  So that became almost like a campaign of mine, to make sure that they were treated with the same dignity as any of us working at that company.  So I would make sure that when I would see them on the floor, I'd stop what I was doing, "Oh, Mr. So and So, I'm Miss So-and So.  Wow, it's great to see you today.  How are you doing?"  And so all of that made me feel as thought I was honoring them in a small way and the only way that I knew how in terms of making a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now--so you're modeling now and you're working.  Are you working for the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: For Allied Stores, now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  At the same time as you're modeling and everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, because, I mean, it was just here and there.  And when I left there, I started working for the United Negro College Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did that happen now?
Speaker 2: To be honest, I don't even remember.  I think, I don't know if someone told me, or I don't know how I'd heard about that there was a job opening.  And so I just went--and I have very good secretarial skills.  I could type well, and I could take shorthand very well.  So those skills were easily transferable.  And so when I started working there--in fact, my boss who was there, Vaughn Thomas, we are still best friends today.  You figure I was eighteen--no, nineteen at that point.  So maybe I only stayed at Allied for two years then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, what, 1970, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm trying to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Or maybe before.  If you're nineteen, that's only to '68 [1968], I guess; '68 [1968], '69' [1969].
Speaker 2: No.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So Vaughn Thomas was the New York director or the director of the whole thing?
Speaker 2: No.  Vaughn--I don't remember which area Vaughn worked.  All I remember was that I was his secretary, you know, and the keeper of his schedule from one girlfriend to another.  That's what I had to help him do more than anything else, is to keep his life organized so one didn't cross the other (laughs).  But the involvement in the community and education and helping black people who would not normally receive an education, I felt like that was a worthwhile thing to do.  Okay.  All right.  So I'm still in line with that sense of community.
Story_ID: 122813
Speaker 1: Now, did you--had you applied to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] before that time or was it during that time that you applied to Central State?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Central State, I had applied at while--let me see--while I was at Allied Stores [New York, New York], actually.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, that sounds like a--okay.  So you were with United Negro College Fund.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I was with them very long.  I think I had probably only worked there maybe--I don't know, maybe eight months, maybe, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I think--I'm trying to--okay.  So that would have been--oh, I worked at a real estate office.  And that was on 168th Street and Broadway.  Because for a while, I was working the two jobs, Allied Stores from nine to five; and then I would take over at the real estate office.  And then after that time period was when I started thinking about acting.  And--okay, so what year was that?  I'm trying to remember.  I started--okay.  'Super Fly' was 1972.  Okay, so I started studying at HB Studios [the Herbert Berghof Studio] first, and that must have been like 1971.  But I don't know how I started doing commercials in 1970.  Somewhere along the line, I was cast in a commercial.
Speaker 1: Now, were you--in 1970?  Now, this is pre-acting lessons?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, did you have a lot to say in the commercial or just a couple of lines?
Speaker 2: No.  And I think it was, like, voiceovers.  I mean, I wasn't saying the voice, but I think it was nonspeaking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you just had to do something and somebody else was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause I remember one was a L'eggs commercial, you know (laughs).  And the L'eggs commercial, 'cause I have thin legs, and then the L'eggs commercial was this--the pantyhose--what they do--the idea was that, you know, L'eggs really fit your legs.  But back then, like, women always had trouble with stockings wrinkling around their ankles.  So what they did with me was, they put these oversized like pantyhose on, and I mean, I'm telling you, I looked like Olive Oyl.  But they were all wrinkled around my ankles.  That was my first big commercial, actually.  And so it was a L'eggs commercial, and I think that there was some kind of an alcohol commercial.  You know, it was something where there was just a group of us some place, I don't know.  I can't even remember that.  You're bringing back memories.  I can't remember.  But I know I did some print ad stuff during that time as well.
Story_ID: 122814
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is--now, HB Studios [the HB Studio, New York City], now tell us what that is.
Speaker 2: Herbert Berghof.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was one of the premier acting studios.  As I said, Uta Hagen came out of that.  Herbert Berghof was out of that.  Bill Hickey was my instructor.  Now, Bill Hickey, the role that I remember him most in was 'The Godfather' [sic, 'Prizzi's Honor'].  I forget which role he played in that [Don Corrado Prizzi], but he was--I mean, he was a brilliant teacher, except he talked all the time.  So you didn't get a chance to really work in his class, and you'd have to listen to four hours of him talking, you know.  And maybe once every three months you get up then to do something.  But it wasn't until I met Richard Roundtree, 'cause Richard Roundtree was really responsible for me.  Well, you know what?  Actually, I went to NEC [Negro Ensemble Company, New York, New York] first, because Richard Roundtree had just done 'Shaft.'  And a good friend of ours, Tony King, said, "You know, come on.  I'm going over to a buddy of mine's house," you know, Richard Roundtree.  And so we went to his house, we got into a conversation about acting, and he'd just come off the road doing the "Great White Hope."  And so he had--I told him how much I admired acting and actors (unclear) and that it was something I always wanted to do.  And so he said, "Well, here.  Read this--read the part of"--I forget what the counter role was for his character in the 'Great White Hope.'  And so I read like this little paragraph or something.  He said, "Oh, that is not bad.  That's not bad.  You know, you should consider acting."  And I'm like, "Oh, come on."  Richard was the one who said, "Listen.  Call--you know, I studied at NEC. Call NEC, make an appointment and see if you can get in."  And, I don't know what, I think it was his encouragement that caused me to actually call and set up an appointment, and you had to come in with a monologue.  And, which was the toughest thing I had to do, which was to face people expecting me to, like, speak.  And I remember at NEC that there were Gil Moses and different people.  He was my first teacher, Gil Moses.
Speaker 1: Gilbert Moses.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yes. Gilbert Moses.  A great director.  And It was a whole group of people that watched your audition process.  And I remember that when I stood there, and I could see it just like it was an hour ago, when I stood there, I remember that like all of a sudden it got quiet in my head, you know.  And this voice was coming out, and the monologue took over, and it was like I was standing watching this person perform, not stuttering, you know.  I mean, it blew me away.  It blew me away that I could stand in front of somebody, and then I realized that there is something--'cause I analyze everything--I realize that there is something in the mind that we have more control over than I thought that I could switch it off, that I could turn it off, you know, and would give me permission to be somebody else.
Speaker 1: You think that stuttering basically is a reflex rather than--and that might be the difference between, you know, doing dialogue where you memorize something and you deliver it, and reacting that it's something that somebody says?
Speaker 2: A reflex, I'm not sure.  I think stuttering is linked to some sort of emotional something.  And when you're able to give yourself permission to depart from whatever that is, and I'm sure it's buried, you know, back there, that you have a different kind of a freedom that you are some--that you're somebody else, essentially.  So, I don't know, a reflex; I think reflex--I wouldn't say reflex because a reflex, to me I would still stutter.  Okay.  I think it's something else.  I don't know what that little split in between reflex and how the mind works, you know.  I don't know.  Who knows?  It's a fascinating--the mind is fascinating.
Story_ID: 122815
Speaker 1: Gilbert Moses' sister actually lives in Chicago [Illinois].  She's a friend of mine.
Speaker 2: I never knew Gilbert had a sister.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I guess they all grew up in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Gilbert Moses was an incredible acting instructor, because he was very--he was so patient, and just the process of a good drama coach or teacher is someone who is able to help you dig and to come to an understanding of who the character is and yourself.  So, he and his infinite patience, and he had a sense of protectiveness I felt towards me, too, because he knew what the challenges were.  And he and Adolph Caesar--Adolph Caesar was my biggest cheerleader.  Adolph, when I wanted just to quit, he would not let me quit.  He was incredible.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit more about him now.  Adolph Caesar has passed.  So has Gilbert Moses.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And Adolph Caesar was the original--well, he was in a lot of plays and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: "A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste."  Oh, yeah.  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant actor.  Brilliant.
Speaker 1: A lot of Charles Fuller plays.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Some of his stories.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Adolph Caesar, he narrated 'I Remember Harlem.'
Speaker 2: Oh, did he?
Speaker 1: A William Miles film about Harlem that's on Public T.V.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I did not know that.
Speaker 1: I can hear the voice, "I remember Harlem."
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear.)
Speaker 2: He had a great voice.  You know, as little as he was, that voice was phenomenal.  I walked into NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] petrified, and my first day, he was the first one I ran into, you know.  And he had--he was doing his one-man show there.  And so he had on this makeup where he looked like an old man, and I thought he was an old man.  But he recognizes something, and then he says, "Who are you?"  And then I said, "Well, you know, I'm just an actress, so this is my first day."  He went, "No, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it."  And every day he would say, "How you doing?  Don't worry."  But the first time I saw him without makeup, I didn't know--I just said, "You the same person," because he was such a great character actor, you know.  He could create the mystique of somebody who was six feet ten, you know, into his--I don't think Adolph was over five, eight, maybe; five, seven or something.  But he had ways of creating a character and a confidence about the character and the strength of the character through his voice and his command of body language and just--I mean, just everything, every nuance he knew better than anybody at NEC.  He was great. He as amazing.
Speaker 1: Oh, [HM] Adam Wade, that we interviewed several months ago--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Adam, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Spoke so highly of Adolph Caesar as a mentor to him.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, I talked to Adam for the first time in a hundred years a few months ago. Somebody had mentioned him.  I said, "Oh, God, I haven't seen Adam in many years."  And I spoke with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He's here as we speak, I think, in 'Color Purple.'
Speaker 2: Is he doing the--in 'the Color Purple'?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He plays Old Mister, the same role that Adolph Caesar played in the movie.
Speaker 2: Does he?  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, 'cause Brenda Russell was telling me--in fact, it opened here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In the spring, I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  She was telling me when it was going to open here.  Yeah.  But anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A little sideboard.  I loved Adolph.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Loved--in fact, you know, I'm going to tell you a quick story about Adolph.  Adolph and Ron O'Neal and I did a film together called 'The Hitter' down in Baltimore [Maryland].  And Adolph--oh, wait.  What was I going to--oh, I was going to say something about Adolph and--oh, God.  It was something I was going to--oh.  So after we had done that film and I came back to California and whatnot, I guess this was a few years after that, we were honoring Bobby Hooks, and Adolph was coming to town because he was doing Che!  Che Caesar.  'Che Cezar.'  And so I saw him because he was one of the people roasting Bobby Hooks and whatnot, we were, like, "Oh," you know, okay, (unclear) we got to get it, we sat together.  And we had made a date to get together on, I think, it was that Tuesday or something.  And anyway, so he said, "Okay.  All right.  So we're going to have lunch, you know, on Tuesday?"  I said, "Okay.  Fine."  And Tuesday came and he didn't call and I was really upset.  I said, "I can't believe he stood me up."  You know, I was really upset.  And then I get a phone call that he had died a few hours before.  So that was really traumatic for me, because Adolph was, like, you know, he was one of the people that sort of just guided me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he--what was 'Che Cezar'?  Was that his one-man show?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  No.  That was a movie where he was in that movie with, I want to say Omar Sharif played Che.
Speaker 1: Oh, about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Che Guevara.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Che Guevara.
Speaker 1: Che Guevara.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Guevara.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That was it.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he was doing that film--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he died.

Speaker 1: Who is at--else was at NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] when you got to NEC?  Did you, like, pay them a fee or something?  Is that how it works?  You pay--you get accepted and then you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You definitely--I don't know, because five months after I was at NEC, I got 'Super Fly,' you know, because I had gone, after NEC, I had gone to New Federal Theatre, where I made my closest relationships with Dick Anthony Williams, Taurean Blacque.  In my class alone it was Dick was the leader.  I mean, he was the teacher.  Saundra McClain, [HM] Jackee Harry was in the class.  I think Garrett Morris was in that class, too.  Abaca, I can't remember Abaca's last name.  But there was a whole group of people that came; Saundra McClain, she came out of that class.  It was of actors that came out of that, that we would all kind of maintain a relationship with.
Speaker 1: New Federal Theatre, this is Woody King and is this--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And Dick Anthony Williams, as I said.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You guys should do Dick.  He's walking history.
Speaker 1: Right.  We were--he was on the schedule once and somehow--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's probably good to do him now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you're at New Federal Theatre.  Now, how do you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Briefly.
Speaker 1: --you know, yeah.  So you just basically get started and then there's a movie.
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.
Speaker 1: You know, you (unclear) in about two years or a year and a half?
Speaker 2: Not even probably, you know.  I mean, everything happened very, very quickly, because when I heard that Gordon Parks, Jr. was doing his film then, and I ran into Richard Roundtree and Bill Cherry on the street, and I was telling them, I said, "You know, Gordon Jr. is doing a film."  I said, "Yeah.  Wish I could audition for that."  And they called ahead and got me an audition.  In that room, I mean, I saw Rosalind Cash.  I saw Madge Sinclair.  Just saw all of these people that I'd seen on television, and I was, like, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: They were all auditioning for the same role?
Speaker 2: They were auditioning for the same film.
Speaker 1: Film?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember sitting in the corner, 'cause they squeezed me in.  And so I sat in the corner just observing this, you know, this kind of parade of all this amazing, amazing talent.  And I felt honored to be there, and yet intimidated, saying, in no way on God's earth am I going to be able to do this.  But I remember that Richard told me something.  He said, "You got to walk in there like the part is yours all ready."  He said, "So when you walk in and you got to command it."  And I kept rehearsing that line over and over and over again.  "I got to walk in and I've to command it."  "I got to walk in and command.  I got to own it.  I got to own it."  So when I walk in--when it was finally my time for the audition, I walked in and Gordon Parks was sitting behind a desk and whatnot, and I think the producer was sitting, like, over here somewhere.  And so I put my feet up on his desk--excuse me.  And so I put my feet up on his desk.  I said, "You can send everybody else home 'cause nobody can do that role but me."  You know, they're like, "Oh, really?  Okay."  And so we started talking, they gave me the script.  And they said, "Okay.  All right, Miss Nobody-can-do-it-but-you.  Go home, know.  Look at the part.  This is the scene and be ready to audition tomorrow."  I went home, I memorized all of my part.  I memorized just about the entire script.  And so when I came in the next day to audition, I had to read with Ron O'Neal.  And Ron, you know, and I, there was a chemistry there.  And the director, Gordon Parks, Jr. really wanted me.  He really did.  But the producer wanted a more statuesque sort of woman, you know.  And so for, like, months, Gordon kept saying, "Don't give up.  Don't give up."  And then I heard that they had cast a beautiful model.  Her name was Julie Woodson; tall, fabulous.  And so she had gotten the role.  So I just changed my phone number, you know.  I just--I didn't want to hear anything else about 'Super Fly.'  And months later, I was at Central--Columbus Circle waiting for a photographer so I could a new headshot.  And a guy walks up to me and, you know, and appears to be hitting--he was flirting, and he was asking me, he says, "I'm a producer.  I have a movie."  And I'm, like (rolls eyes).  You know how guys kind of do that.  And so he goes through this whole rap, and I'm not really interested at all.  And so I said, "Yeah.  Okay.  Fine."  And he says, "No, no, no, no.  No, I'm telling you.  I really am.  I really am."  Then he said, "The movie is called 'Super Fly.'"  I said (rolls head).  And that was like nails on a blackboard.  I said, "I don't want to hear the word 'Super Fly' ever again."  He said, "Why"?  I said, "It's all right.  It's a long story.  I don't want to hear about it."  And I said, "Why"?  And so he says, "Well, like--" so he asked me my name, and I said, "Sheila Frazier."  And he said, "Wait a minute.  We've been trying to find you."  And I said, "Yeah.  Right."  He said, "No, really, really, really.  We've been trying to find you for, like, months, you know."  And I'm like "Yeah.  Okay."  But something, you know, something made me a little bit curious because I gave him my telephone number.  And so it's after we finished--after the photographer and I finished the headshots and I went home, my phone was ringing and it was the producer telling me, you know, "We really want you to do the role."  Or was it Gordon called me back.  But anyway, this was, like, on a Tuesday; we shot on Friday.
Story_ID: 122817
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Gee whiz.  That's pretty fast.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It ['Super Fly'] was shot in New York [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 1: It was shot in New York.  Yes.  So I didn't really have a long training time in terms of, like, acting, you know.  I didn't have a long--I learned on--I learned as I went along.  I had certain jewels from studying with Gil--and Gil Moses and Dick Anthony, and also with Bill Hickey.  So there were certain insights I had into character development.  But I really learned as I went along, you know, so.
Speaker 2: You had to be really excited.  First, you get this movie role after--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --being an actor in about a year, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I was--it was amazing.  It was surreal, you know.  But I didn't take--well, even after 'Super Fly' came out, I didn't take it seriously.  I mean, it was weird to me to walk down the street with Ron and have people hanging out of the buses, "Priest, Georgia (unclear)."  You know.  I was, like, "What is--"  Wow, you know.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  And during that time, I had--I was engaged to be married at that time or maybe--let me--no.  I had just--"Super Fly" came out in '72 [1972], so I got married in '73 [1973].  So, you know, we were engaged and it was really kind of weird.  My husband--my ex--my husband.  No, when it came out I was married by that time.  And he didn't care for the attention that I was getting and all that.  But that was really tough for him.
Speaker 2: Well, you became, as I recall, a sort of a sex symbol--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because of a bathtub scene.
Speaker 1: I wish it was a joke.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  The bath--there's a scene in a bathtub where the bubbles are.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Right.  Which was as far away from who I was than left is to the right.  I, you know, that scene was the hardest thing for me to do.  Gordon Parks, Jr., you know, he convinced me. He had that closed set. It was, "Well, okay.  We'll keep the bubbles going."  It was just him, the cameraman and the audio guy, and that was it.  And when the bubbles, you know, went down--I never even looked at Ron's body.  I would turn my head when Ron--I would get into the bathtub first, turn my head, close my eyes, Ron would get in.  At that time, the bubbles were a little higher.  Right?  So we couldn't see anything.  We would start the (unclear) scene (laughs).  We would roll around, you know, and the bubbles would roll around.  And would I would open my eyes, if the bubbles were, you know, like, low, I would look at Gordon, he'd say, "Oh, okay.  Cut.  Cut."  And then, you know, like, I'd turn my head, Ron would get out and his wardrobe person was there, you know, and take him into another room.  Then I would get out and my girl was there with a bathrobe.  And we went through this process for five and a half hours.  I looked like a prune when we finished.  I was so wrinkled, you know.  My skin had gone from brown to something like this gray wrinkle.  But it was an interesting experience, very much so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was not ready for that.  Was not ready for the success of that film.  That was amazing.
Speaker 2: So everybody knew you.  Every black community in the country waited for 'Super Fly.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They had a big buildup, as I remember, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was amazing.
Speaker 2: --Isaac Hayes music and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.  Curtis Mayfield.
Speaker 2: Curtis Mayfield?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Isaac did 'Shaft.'
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Curtis Mayfield--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: 'Super Fly.'  Right.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Curtis Mayfield.  Right.
Speaker 1: Curtis Mayfield.  And at the premier, I mean, there were all these demonstrations.  I'm trying to remember if it was from CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or one of the other organizations (unclear), and that's where the guy coined the phrase "blaxploitation film."  And so there were picket signs and everything outside of the theater, you know.  And I couldn't figure out why they're picketing.  But it didn't do anything other than make it more popular.
Story_ID: 122818
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: There was a difference, as I recall, of the two movies, 'Shaft' and 'Super Fly.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They've all been compared.  'Shaft,' you had a--the character was dark-skinned.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Had natural hair.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: But he didn't--the 'Super Fly,' you know, light-skinned guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: His hair was either--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Long.
Speaker 2: --naturally straight or pressed out to like that.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And was a pimp.  Actually was a--the character actor was a pimp.
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't a pimp.  He was a drug dealer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  Wasn't he a pimp, too?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: No.  He was a drug dealer--well, six in one hand, six in the other.  His character was that, Priest was a drug dealer, but his friends were, you know, pimps.  You know, there was only one character who was a pimp.  His name was Candy or something.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, no.  No.  He had two women, you know.  He had one girlfriend who was white, and one girlfriend who was black, you know, who was me, myself.  So, no.  He wasn't a pimp.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But the style of dress, the platform --shoes--
Speaker 1: Very much so.
Speaker 2: --all of the, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --you know, the white Ermine coat, and, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.  But you see, that wasn't necessarily--that was not necessarily the uniform of a pimp.  You know, back in those days in Harlem, that was the uniform of a hustler, you know.  And that was the standard of success, you know, where they would wear their long full-length mink coats or the maxi coats, you know, if you will.  So you couldn't even differentiate--the pimps were the ones who wore, I think, more colors, you know.  Like their suits may have been red or you know, and then lots of jewelry, and you know.
Story_ID: 122819
Speaker 1: Well, so what do you think the message of the film ['Super Fly'] was or do you think that people miss it--they miss the message?
Speaker 2: I think people really do miss the message, because they look at it as glorifying drugs, when the reality was he was trying to work his way out, to get away from it and to get out of that business, and find some level of normalcy in his life.  And so, you know, hidden in that scene in the bathtub where she's telling him that she would be happy with a plain life, you know, like the picket fence kind of a thing.  And so he was, like, saying, "You know, they won't let me out.  I can't"--and then the scene at Gracie Mansion, we were in the Park where there's more discussion about getting out, you know.  So it was something that he wanted to do, wanted to work towards.  And then the scene with Scatter Man, where he tells him, you know, like, "I'm done," that he wanted to do this last deal or something so that he could retire with X amount of dollars and whatnot and get out and change his life.  So that was the bigger thing.  And some people, people who were in the street, (unclear) those are like, 'cause I remember after the film came out, a lot of hustlers would walk up to me and say, "Thank you so much for telling our story.  This is something that we're trying to get beyond."  I mean, so you had both sides.  So it really depended on where you were as a viewer, because I think some of the scenes spent a lot of time--like there was a whole montage that seemed to last forever of different people using cocaine, you know, and all that.  I think that's what appeared as though it glorified it.  But the story was not about that.  The story was about his journey to be out of the business as opposed to stay within the business.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think some people had a problem with the fact, I guess, he wanted to have his cake and eat it, too, (unclear), get out but still keep the money and trappings of being successful, or I mean, everything that the money made for being a successful drug dealer.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure.  You know, I mean, and we can look at it now and say, yes, yes, that it was the case.  But looking at through their eyes and people like that, you know, they--that most of them have a record.  And this is not to condone another lifestyle, but they can't get a nine-to-five.  These are people who are accustomed to having, you know, like, money.  So the idea is always to have something so they take it and build something else with it, which a lot of people have done, from what I understand (unclear) and build corporations.
Speaker 1: So it has been done on some level where people have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's been done on a lot of levels, both white and black and green and yellow.  They've taken drug moneys and, you know, laundered it through a lot of major corporations and built much of what this country--the economy of this country is built on.  So it just looks and feels different when you see it through the flare of, like, the inner city, because then it's just a microcosm of what goes on all of the time.
Story_ID: 122820
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the role of Georgia in 'Super Fly,' you reprised the role in, I guess, a couple of years later in 'Super Fly T.N.T.'  Right?  Which was kind of a second sequel.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So you're best known for that role, your first role.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And people, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The character of Georgia in 'Super Fly,' I believe, became popular for a number of reasons.  One, you know, many of the people like the fact that she was someone who was so important and so much a part of her man's life, you know, where she helped him get from A to like Z.  She helped him get out.  You know, she was his helpmate.  She protected him.  She, you know--so a lot of men love that in a woman, and they enjoy that camaraderie.  On another level, there was a love scene in there that had never been done, you know, on television or screen period, that was not just sex; it was sensual, you know.  But it was also a scene that people look beyond it to a relationship, you know, too.  So it was a sensual scene, but it was something that--it wasn't a wasted scene, you know.  It wasn't a scene just to have a sex scene in it.  It was--it defined, and it was the first time that you saw the real intimacy between these two people and how he viewed her and like who she was to him and who he was to her.  That was the scene that really defined their--the depth and the vulnerability in their relationship.
Speaker 1: I think that most people that saw the movie remember that scene if they don't remember anything else.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Which was rare in those days.  You didn't see that much.
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: In fact, you don't see it much today.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  That was a first, and I remember, because that was a Warner Brothers film, and I remember at that time the President of Warner Brothers--and that was considered a little film--and I remember the President of Warner Brothers said to me--and I guess had I thought about it, I would have been more insulted; I was probably surprised and trying to kind of filter all of this attention from this film.  But I remember him saying, "Oh, you're gonna have the most famous rump in the world," you know.  "You're gonna have the most famous rump in the world."  And I'm like, really.  Hmm, you know.  He didn't say rump, but you know.  And I was like, "Hmm, hmm.  Okay.  Really," you know.  And you start to, like, process that they were gonna probably market it from a different standpoint, you know, about the sex scene as opposed--I mean the lovemaking scene.
Story_ID: 122821
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Now, in the 1970s here in Chicago [Illinois], later on there was a play written by [HM] Useni Eugene Perkins, who was a sociologist--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --basically called the 'ImageMakers.'  Kuumba Theater performed it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at several different--it was, like, a spoof of--not a spoof, but a--I guess it's a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: A satirical play?
Speaker 2: Yes.  A satirical look at blaxploitation movies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, really.
Speaker 2: And there was a 'Shaft' character, there was a 'Super Fly' character, and, you know.  And it opened with Mr. White Man in Hollywood--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --telling them all what their role is and what they do in a black--what they're supposed to do in a black community.  Did--when you think about a movie like 'Super Fly,' did the--from what you say, I mean, there's--it seems to be a lot more thought on the part of the actors in terms of what they're doing off screen than, I think, what's expected in that play necessarily.  I mean, you know, as for what I'm getting.  And Ron O'Neal had a history in black theater before he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.  But what is the question?
Speaker 2: I guess the question is, did you all discuss, you know, what it all meant when you were doing it?  And did you--and what did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --or did it--were you surprised at some of criticisms?
Speaker 1: Of that scene or the film?
Speaker 2: The whole film, I guess.
Speaker 1: Well, I did not expect the film to make any kind of waves, you know.  I mean, I didn't think beyond just it being a film--a first for me.  And as far as Ron was concerned--I didn't even know Ron really until, you know, until that movie.  And we met.  He cooked dinner so that we could get to know each other before we did that scene.  And we didn't even discuss the scene.  We just talked about, you know, opera and, you know, and theater and, you know, just anything other than that.  We didn't expect the film to really make a huge splash when it did.  Then, you know, then our conversations, from Ron's perspective, he was happy to gain the popularity that he had long sought after--for being such a fine actor.  But for him it was a double-edged sword, because although he was happy about the recognition, he was pained, because being a Shakespearean-trained actor--being an actor that can take you from, you know, from [Russian actor Konstantin] Stanislavsky's, you know, like, style all the way through, to be placed in that genre, and not being able to be offered other kinds of jobs afterwards, you know, they kept from him.  That was a difficult discussion that he and I would have.  For, like, me, I didn't know any better, you know.  So I hadn't been as trained as he was.  To me it was like "Well, I played someone's girlfriend, you know.  Okay.  It was this big splash."  I didn't have an expectation, you know, be it beyond what I had done.  You know, I mean, I was blown out of the water on just that.  So in talking about it, we didn't really discuss it from that standpoint.  Now, when we went into the sequel portion of it, then it became, "Well, we better have a lot more going."  So that's when Ron--I think he was-'Roots'--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Alex Haley?
Speaker 1: Alex Haley.  All right.  Alex Haley had written, I think, the original script or something from 'Super Fly T.N.T.' or something, or he had some kind of involvement.  I don't even remember, you know.  And the idea was to now take the character outside of the street life.  And now we are in Italy, you know, and we are trying to create some kind of lifestyle for ourselves and whatnot, but without a clear understanding of what the audience expectation is based on, and the success of an expectation, and what you desire in creating a new kind of image of the character, you know, when they don't meet then there are problems.  So you had Ron, who wanted to take it to another level, and it just didn't work, you know.  I mean, and like he was rightfully so.  I really understood they said they were taking him into a hero, a different kind of a hero, you know, since that he became the character who wanted to, you know, like, help save this, you know, African people or something or rather, you know.  But the transition, people were not ready to go from a slick, super fly drug dealer into, you know, Africa.  It just didn't work.
Story_ID: 122822
Speaker 1: Yeah, when we look back over time at 'Super Fly,' I mean, how do you think it's affected, you know, people today?  I mean, the hip-hop generation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Super Fly' is a very interesting film, because it has long-lived out the characters in there.  I am the only principal character who is still alive in that film.  Everybody else is gone.  Fred--Fat Freddy, Carl Lee, Ron O'Neal, Julius Harris; they're all gone, you know.
Speaker 1: I figured that Freddy wasn't gonna last when the song was 'Freddy's Dead.'  (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)  Well, he actually just died, I think, just four years ago.  But the under--it is an underground film.  And so a lot of the rappers, you know, have taken that film--like, I mentioned Snoop.  Snoop is a big lover of the '70s [1970s] films and whatnot.  So it acted as a bridge for me and many of the actors from that day.  And the music, the hip-hop, the, you know, the rap generation to today; all of them, if you say, 'Super Fly' or, like, if you say--what's the film that Max Julian did?
Speaker 1: 'The Mack.'
Speaker 2: 'The Mack.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, they all know it.  They all know it, which for me, it gives me an opportunity to really talk to them on a different level, you know.  I mean, once they accept you, then I can talk to them and, like, have conversations about issues that I think are important, you know, like, politics or like back in that day; [HM] Angela Davis, you know, or--I mean, I can talk to them about issues that they were important to us that we fought for, for Civil Rights.  It just opens up the door, because there's that level of respect right there, just because you were in that film.  So immediately, you're somebody who they'll listen to.  Some of them.
Speaker 1: Does it surprise people when you talk about politics or--and show the depth that you have?
Speaker 2: With the young kids?  The rappers?  Or adults?
Speaker 1: I mean, you're about--I think even people from that era, because just seeing you as Super Fly's girlfriend doesn't necessarily--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, you just don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Don't know what you can do otherwise.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, yes.  You know, people look at an image and then they put a period after it.  So they don't know that that's just a small comma.  There's a whole paragraph after that on who you are and what you know, what made you--what you experienced in your life that made you make certain decisions, you know.  So they don't know.  And they are surprised that there's more to me.  And they're probably surprised that there's to many of the actors of that era, you know.  Because, see, then there was a segment of attractive black actresses that were relegated to being the girlfriend of the primary male character.  So, you know, your job was to look good, period.  You weren't supposed to be a rocket scientist.  You weren't supposed to--you know.  So I did a lot of that.  So Ron and I, we did three films together.  But in our films, we had more of a relationship.  You know, you saw a difference there.  But, in films, like, with Jim Brown, 'Three the Hard Way,' you know, I was a girlfriend.  And in other subsequent films, it was, you know, "just look pretty."  They wouldn't say that, but just because the character, you could just judge by the lines what your role was, you know; where the real story was around the male character.
Story_ID: 122823
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Most of the characters were like these tough black males that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --eventually would solve problems in the black community--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and actually trace them back to somebody in the white community who was either supplying the drugs--(simultaneous--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --or supplying something that, you know, was detrimental to the community.  But there are a couple of female characters.  We have, like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That came later, like Pam Grier.
Speaker 1: Pam Grier and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Tamara.
Speaker 1: Tamara Dobson.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Tamara.  That came a little bit, that image, came a little bit later, and which was great, you know, because--well, actually it was kind of around the same time, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a little later.  As you said, that we start off with the males--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But a hair, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but then it got into females--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It sure did.
Speaker 1: --doing the same type of thing with the same type of scripts.  Did you ever want to play one of the black women action heroes?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sure I did.  Sure I did, you know.  And I auditioned for them, but that's not how they saw me (laughs).  You know, they didn't see me as a tough, you know, kind of "I'll slap you down kind of a character."  And, you know, that may have been typecasting of such.  But they didn't see me as that at all. Because when Pam came out of the gate, she came out.  I don't remember films--I mean, that's how--that's where she came from, you know; Tamara Dobson, that's where she came from.  So it wasn't like they started in one area and then evolved into that character, you know.  You knew them as only that.  And then later as they had opportunities, Pam is the one person--not--yeah, that has been able to transcend those characters into a lot of different wonderful roles.  The role she did in the Bronx-something-'Bronx Tales [A Bronx Tale],' she was wonderful in that, you know, so.
Speaker 1: And Tamara Dobson just recently passed away.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That was--well, it--you know, I have tried to find Tamara Dobson, did not know where to begin because when people were doing documentaries on that era, and I said, "Oh, you got to find Tamara Dobson."  And everywhere I called, it was always a brick wall.  No one knew where to find her.  So when I heard about her passing, it was heartbreaking.  It was heartbreaking because, she was, you know, talented and beautiful.  And, I don't know what her story became after that time period or what her life became, but I always feel a sadness around her.
Speaker 1: Now, are there reunions of--you know, you see on Public Television, you see the Drifters or the Coasters, the Temptations get together and they do--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No (laughs).
Speaker 1: --special, you know, things, I mean.  Are there reunions of the black actors (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, there are no reunions.  And there should be.  I know a number of people have attempted, like film festivals, where they bring them all back and whatnot.  But I don't know--I don't think anyone has successfully done that. But there should be a genre.  There, like, should be, like, maybe the ImageMakers that are--The HistoryMakers that are doing so many incredible things, that would be a great category, you know, to kind of look into it and capture and tell our story, because the characters were motivated by things that happened, that were very real occurrences.  And, like, we just took snapshots of what was happening in inner city communities, and it was an important era, I feel.
Story_ID: 122824
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you--what happened next?  Now, after these two 'Super Fly' movies, those were--that was a big thing, but that's real early in your career.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: How did things progress?
Speaker 2: Well, I did a film with Jim Brown.  Then it became a different kind of a film.  I was still a girlfriend, you know, but it was Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, and Jim Kelly.  Right.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the, like, late seventies [1970s] now.
Speaker 2: That was seventy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, '75 [1975], '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: --four--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think '74 [1974].  After that, Lou Gossett [HM Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] and I had a television series on ABC called 'The Lazarus Syndrome.'  And I played his wife in that.  And I've heard that it was the first time a black woman has ever swam on T.V., you know.  So it's like two firsts.
Speaker 1: The first time a black woman has ever swam on T.V.?
Speaker 2: On film or on television.  No one could remember seeing that captured.  Do you remember seeing any of that?
Speaker 1: I'm rewinding my brain now.  I don't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Please do, because, you know, I don't want to say that if it's not the truth any longer, you know.
Speaker 1: It might be.  I don't know.  It's hard to ever say that it's the first, because there's always some contradictory to it.  But I can't--I don't know.  You might be right.
Speaker 2: I don't know either.  I don't know, but I know that I think that was the first time in Lou's character, for example.  I mean, he was a cardiologist, I think.  And I think that was the first time that there was ever that kind of series on television, or image of a black male.  And in that series, our marriage was, you know, on the rocks in the first--in the pilot.  And then the rest was us trying to kind of just mend our relationship.  So that was a good role, you know.  That was a good role.  And Lou, God bless him, boy.  He fought to, like, keep the relationship.  Because what they wanted to do--what the producers, you know, wanted to do was have him divorce the, like, wife, you know, figure, what he wouldn't have a home life.  But he would be this single guy, you know, having a series of girlfriends and whatnot.  And they wanted to kind of (unclear), and he refused.  You know, he refused.  So I think the show only lasted, maybe, thirteen episodes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The one season--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  With the promise to, you know, to rework it.  You know, that's a kind of a standing line in Hollywood, when you--just before--we learned, just before you're cut, you know, it's "Well, okay. Well, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna go down for a period of time and rework the storyline and come back."
Speaker 1: But it doesn't come back.
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Story_ID: 122825
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is about 19--this is late '70s [1970s] we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Late '70s [1970s], yeah.  Then--right.  And then I did a lot of episodic things--shows.  And then I got the role of--in 'California Suite,' where I play opposite Bill Cosby.  I played his wife, and that was with Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, and Gloria Gifford, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, this was--I read this is the most fun you ever had.
Speaker 2: Oh, this was the Neil Simon--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  I mean, working with Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor was hilarious.  Bill, I mean, Bill was amazing on the set.  Richard was hilarious because he would--our call might be six or seven o'clock, you know, in the morning.  Well, nobody could find Richard half the time, you know.  And so only Bill could--Richard had so much--Richard Pryor had so much respect for Bill, that where Herbert Ross couldn't get him to come to work, Bill could make one phone call, you know, and tell him, "Get yourself together and come to the set," and Richard would (snaps fingers) snap to it.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that Richard Pryor would have been in 'Blazing Saddles' had he been able to come to the set.  He wrote the script, I think, for Blazing--or wrote it with Mel Brooks--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Maybe.  I don't even remember that.
Speaker 1: --and--yeah.  And Mel Brooks' commentary on the DVD is that, he wanted Richard Pryor to be in it so bad, but he couldn't get him to come to the set.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  He loved Richard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He loved Richard, you know.  And Richard, I'm sure, loved him.
Speaker 1: But Bill Cosby could get him there.
Speaker 2: Bill could get--he had so much respect for Bill.  Bill could get him to the set, you know, in a moment.  And, we would, like, we all--I mean, I had known bill before doing that film.  And Bill was really responsible for me, you know, getting the role.  He could choose whoever he wanted, you know.  But, that was a fun film, because, you know, on the tennis court in that one scene where the four of us are playing doubles, and Bill, in just the warmup before we, you know, rolled tape and whatnot, we were practicing, you know, the tennis and whatnot; and Bill did a serve--now, everyone knows how great Bill is in tennis--Bill did a serve, and that ball hit me right in my thigh, and I promise you, for two days there was a tennis ball (laughs)--that ball hit me so hard that there was a tennis ball mark, a lump, on my thigh for two days; I'm telling you.  But we had--we just had such a good time, because Bill and Richard, when they would get into their comedic things, like, off-set, they were hilarious.  Hilarious.  And they would go back, you know, back and forth with one another.  It was just great.  It was just great.  Bill was wonderful to work with, and so was Richard--you know, Richard when you got him there.
Story_ID: 122826
Speaker 1: It just--it seems to me when Richard Pryor first emerged as a comedian, that he was patterning himself after Bill Cosby.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then he said--he talked about that.  And then he said that, you know, that, like, he realized, you know, that he wasn't, and, like, Bill, Bill didn't curse.  I don't know if Bill cursed early on, but I don't think so.  Okay.  But, like, Richard realized that that just wasn't, you know, wasn't him.  And he--once he became comfortable with who he was, there was no one better than Richard.  There was no one better than him.  And Richard was one of the kindest people, I've ever worked with.  He--and now, he was so sensitive that, like, he could tell when there was something with anybody.  He, you know--that instrument, that something inside of him was so super sensitive.  And I remember one day I had a toothache.  And, you know, I never said anything, you know, but he sensed there was something wrong.  And it was in between one of the shots.  And so I was kind of sitting off to--standing off to the side and whatnot, and he said, "Are you okay?"  I said, "Yeah, I'm fine."  Then, "What's the matter?"  I said, "Well, I have a little toothache."  And so he says, "Well, go to the dentist."  And so I said, "Well, I will when this is over."  He said, "Go tell the director that you need to go to the dentist."  I said, Well, you know"--.  So he said, "Herbert [Ross], she, you know, Sheila has a toothache.  She needs to get to the dentist."  So, like, Herbert said, "When we finish, you know; but right now, we have a scene to shoot, you know."  So he said, "No.  She needs to get to the dentist now."  And so Herbert said, "Well, we just can't stop shooting because she has a toothache."  Because I was the low person on, you know, on--Richard said, "If you don't get her to a dentist now, I'm going back, you know, home."  So he says, "Either you take care of her now or I'm leaving."  You know, and so they had to take care of me.  And his sensitivity, you know, was such that, I mean, he would put himself on the line.  He didn't care.  He was just great.  I loved Richard.  You know.  I loved him.  When he went through that whole fire, you know, when he was burned, and when he came out, he went directly to, you know, Hawaii.  And so I went over to, you know, Hawaii, and I would drive to his house every day just to spend time with him.  And we were just, you know, platonic; we never dated.  It was never about anything other than just a connection that he and I had.  So, he's very special; very, very special.
Story_ID: 122827
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was close to a lot of other--well, Jim Brown, you know, is very close to him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about Jim Brown much, but--and, the 'Three the Hard Way,' you had all these three heroes in this, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was Jim Brown, and Fred Williamson and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Jim Kelly.
Speaker 1: --Jim Kelly like to work with?
Speaker 2: They were all great, you know.  Fred was the comedian.  He was hilarious, you know.  Jim was more serious.  I think probably out of all of them, I got along best with Fred, because he didn't take himself very seriously, you know.  And Jim Kelly was really sweet as well.  But I think Fred, I was--I found a different kind of comfort level with Fred.  But they were great guys, all--you know, all of them; very respectful, you know.  And for me being surrounded by, like, three guys, working with three guys was fine with me (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  Okay.  Now, let's see--well, let's--okay.  Now after 'California Suite,' well, did you do any other movies?  I know--well, I know you did, but which ones?
Speaker 2: Okay  After 'California Suite,' I did a small role in a John Travolta film; trying to remember what that--two--was it 'Two of a Kind,' I think, or something like that?
Speaker 1: Right.  'Two of a Kind.'  Right.  That's 1983.
Speaker 2: Oh, was it?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What other films did I do?  I did a film for (Tweeksperry?).  You have to help me out.
Speaker 1: So you did--I've got, like, a filmography-sort of here (unclear) pulled out.  But it seems you did some afternoon school--after-school specials with Lou Grant.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Those were television.  I did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Lot of T.V.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A lot of T.V.
Speaker 1: 'Magnum P.I.'  A lot of the television shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I know I did some other films.  Ron and I did the three films.  Richard Roundtree and I had done a pilot for television called 'Firehouse,' you know.  It was a great pilot, actually.  It went to series, but they didn't have any of our characters in there.  What else?  I did other films, but I can't remember.
Speaker 1: The movie you mentioned earlier with Adolph Caesar and Ron O'Neal, now what--was that an independent film or something?  Or was that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was called 'The Hitter.'  And that was an independent film that was shot in Baltimore [Maryland] about a bare-fisted fighter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was a dated--I mean it takes place in a historical time?
Speaker 2: Not really, you know.  It had more to do with, you know, with an area of the South, you know, where, like, money was made on the pool table or craps or gambling.  And in this instance, you know, bare-fisted fighting was a popular sport in certain areas of the South.  And so--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is in--during a temporary--I mean, during a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A contemporary period?
Speaker 1: --it was a--was the movie a--well, it was in real time--this is--the time was now, and I guess in the 19 what?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We did that movie in '77 [1977], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.  I guess so, I mean, you know.  And, of course, I'm judging by our attire and the cars, and, you know, whatnot.  And there was nothing that said vintage--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, in there.  It just had the feel that this was a lifestyle hidden in certain rural regions.
Speaker 1: Like dog fighting or something.
Speaker 2: Kind of, yes.
Speaker 1: That are the things that, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: --a lot of things that are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  But they probably took license in doing that, creative license, because, you know, it probably was something.  It may have been more popular in the '50s [1950s] or something, you know, rather than the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was never said, you know.  It was never.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 122828
Speaker 1: Now you got involved in production at a certain point. Right?  Well, tell us about that?  How did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--well, when Richard Pryor formed his company, Indigo Productions, it was a company--it was the first time ever that a studio had financed a production company headed up by minorities.  And I think it was something that Jim Brown encouraged Richard to, like, do.  And so, he was the president.  And during that time, I was raising my son, I was so broke.  I was so broke.  And I remember I ran into Jim at the Comedy Store [West Hollywood, California], you know.  And so I said, you know, if you're hiring, you know, I really need a job, blah, blah, blah."  He said, "No problem."  This is the angel part of this man, Jim.  And so, like he hired me as a story editor, which was my first behind-the-scenes" role.  And in the story editor position, my job was to read the scripts and then write a synopsis on it, and they would--and then pitch the idea if I thought that there was a great story.  Probably, the greatest failure that we had was, was we had an opportunity to do 'Purple Rain,' you know.  And I don't--I can't remember if Richard didn't want to do it or what happened.
Speaker 1: Did you like it?  Were you in it?
Speaker 2: I'm trying--I don't think that was one of the scripts I read, you know.  But we all collectively--there were two story editors, you know.  I was the first one, and then they bought another young lady in.  And then we would talk with, like, Jim and then we'd kick it around.  I'm not certain in the end we didn't do it, because I know Jim was very astute and understood.  I mean, he really has such an ear for music.  So he immediately identified with Prince.  He knew Prince's work, you know.  And, like, he said, this guy is a real genius.  So, but I'm not sure why we didn't do that one.  But, that one kind of fell through the cracks, you know.  But it was great experience, because although Richard was not as much a hands-on, it had real potential.  And then there was a breakdown between Richard and Jim, you know, that they decided just to kind of sever their relationship.  And in any administration, you wind up getting rid of the whole cabinet, you know.  And so that's what happened.  Richard and my relationship, you know, remained intact, but, you know, it distanced-you know, because he wanted to distance himself from that whole--from our group and the group that he would bring in after, whatnot.  But, you know, there was no love lost between he and me, you know.  We were still friendly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a project there that you look back at that you really like the most?
Speaker 2: With Indigo?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I liked that we did Richard Pryor on Sunset Boulevard [sic., 'Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip], you know.  That was my favorite, because it was, I think that, I think Richard was our greatest commodity, and it was smart to, like, use him, you know, in doing something.  See the stutter come?  Did you see that stutter come back just then (laughs)?  Yeah.  But it was a great experience.  I mean, I look back--I don't have one bad experience that I look back and, you know, and say, "Oh, I'm sorry I did this," or "I'm sorry, you know, for this experience."  Every last one of them was a building block in, you know, in my history making.  You know, that was just--I mean, it was great.  It was great.  I feel blessed.
Story_ID: 122829
Speaker 1: Now, you were a story editor.  Now, that was, like, what year is this?
Speaker 2: I want to say that was '80 [1980].  Oh, was that '82 [1982]?  Because when I left that segment of my life--oh, no.  You know, what may have happened before then, I started working at a CBS affiliate, KNXT in Los Angeles [California].  And I hosted a T.V. show, a community affairs show on KNXT.  And I think after that is when I started working for Indigo [Productions].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to look that up, to be honest.  I can't remember which one came first.  That was a hoot, hosting a talk show back then.  That was a hoot, because the stuttering would come back because there was no script, you know.  So you would just have to interact with someone and ask a question to get into a dialogue.  And I couldn't turn the little switch off.  It was very interesting.  I remember the producer would come in between breaks, he would say, "Okay.  Okay.  Do you think that you could kind of stop stuttering for, you know, a little, 'cause it's really a lot, you know?"  And I remember thinking, "Oh, God.  This is not going to work at all."  But that was a great experience as well.  But that was a challenge to do it then that way.  So I think after that, Indigo happened, I think.  Okay.  I think.  Okay.  However, you know, it happened.  From there, I went into being a coordinating producer for 'Essence.'  'Essence' had a television show, and the way that happened, because I had such great relationships with the Hollywood types, if you will, celebrities, they wanted--they needed directors.  So someone had called me, Gene Davis, is like my svengali when it came to the behind-the-scenes, Gene Davis, you know, said, "Well, you know, can you help us find a producer or a director?"  And so, I knew so many people, so I said I would find--I said, "Well, you know what?"  Here comes my grandfather's influence again.  "I do that as a business."  They said, "Oh, really.  Really?"  "Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I have a company, Sheila Frazier and Associates."  "Oh, really.  Do you really?"  (Unclear)  "Oh, yes.  Sure.  This is what we do."  You know.  So that became my first company, you know.  And I found them their first, you know, director.  And then Gene said, "Well, you know, Sheila, you know, like, you should think in terms of, like, producing."  And I said, "How do you do that?"  He said, "Why don't I put you together with our East Coast counterpart, and you can be the coordinating producer, because we need you to lock in Sammy Davis, Jr.; we need you to lock in this person."  You know, these are people I could call on the telephone and say, "You know, can you give us an interview?"  You know.  It was just favor.  And in my life, God has really given me favor.  And so, I could just use that to create positions that became a building block.  So after that, you know, period--after 'Essence' came a PR [public relations] company I started, you know.  And after about a couple of years of doing PR, I decided, you know, I don't like the whole babysitting idea.  I don't like being on-call 24/7, you know.  And then I was at [HM] Reuben Cannon's house once.  Reuben and Linda were on vacation, and a girl, Cheryl Miller, who worked for Reuben, you know, I was sitting in the kitchen talking to her and telephone rang.  And they were asking her, "Do you have any idea how to get ahold of Sheila Frazier?"
Story_ID: 122830
Speaker 1: The phone rings and?
Speaker 2: So the phone, you know, rings and Cheryl [Miller] answers it, and the person says that, you know--I hear her saying, "Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know how to get a hold of Sheila Frazier.  She's right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on."  And so, on the other line is someone from BET [Black Entertainment Television] saying, "You know, we've been trying to find you, had no way of finding you because seems like you had sort of dropped out of the whole acting world, and we're starting, you know, with BET.  We're starting a new show there, and we really need some visibility, you know.  We don't have a relationship with the Hollywood community and you do.  So we want, you know, to see if we could hire you to come on as a producer."  And so, that's how I kind of, you know, segued into that, which was good, because I was ready to get out of PR.
Speaker 1: So this is what year, roughly?
Speaker 2: This was 1990.
Speaker 1: 1990.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: 1990, because I would stay with BET.  I only thought I was going to be there for six months, and wound up staying thirteen years.  So it's hard as a senior associate producer, not knowing it--producing entailed.  And I learned as I went along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me backtrack a little bit.  So that 'Essence' job, that was prior to BET; is that--(simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: That was prior.  The 'Essence' job--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and when did that start?
Speaker 2: --was '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, BET in 1990.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, tell us about that one.
Speaker 2: The BET job?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that was interesting, because the show was 'Live from LA with Tanya Hart.'  And I came in, as I said, as a senior associate producer.  I didn't have clue, but on-the-job training, you know, I learned how to produce these, like, packages and whatnot.  And our job as producers was to lock in the talent--pitch the story; lock in the, like, you know, talent; write, you know, write the segment and then edit it.  So it was a great learning experience for me.  And then when the producer was leaving, she recommended that I take her place, I became the producer of the show.  And then from there, you know, it went off from one thing to another thing.  And then it was screen scene.  And I stayed with BET--BET is really good for people who enter the industry and would not--and who would not normally get the opportunity to learn.  So you learn there.  I learned how to produce.  I learned how when they were doing something.  They tried their first sitcom.  Because I had been an actor, then I could go in and know--and be able to dialogue with the actors and communicate what the director wanted.  So that graduated to--I was not only helping them and communicating the director's wishes, but then I got into actually blocking the, like, scenes, you know, which was great, because ultimately I'm going to direct, so.  But that was good.  When that stage was over and the sitcom went away, I went on another show, and then I became involved in a newly-formed talent department at BET.  And after that, I started running the talent department for the network, which basically meant to--I had to ensure the celebrity value for the primetime shows and for, you know, like, some of the major events on the West Coast.  Primarily on the West Coast.
Story_ID: 122831
Speaker 1: What was the name of the sitcom?  Do you remember, the BET [Black Entertainment Television] sitcom?
Speaker 2: 'The Blackberry Inn.'
Speaker 1: 'Blackberry Inn.'  Okay.
Speaker 2: Horrible show (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  Was it really?  Oh.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know--yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the major problem?  I mean, now, BET, at least--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was supposed to be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that (area?) it's reputation for music video (unclear), you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But basically.
Speaker 2: Oh, this was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And then [HM] Tavis Smiley got his start there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but then couldn't thrive there, apparently.  And he had to move on.  But it's--black people love BET because it's theirs.  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear.)
Speaker 2: Well, this one--this was a whole new concept.  This was an over-the-top show.  I don't even know how to describe it, you know.  But all of the acting had to be over-the-top.  Everything had to be "What?!"  "What?"  "What?"  You know, I mean, it was very over-the-top, you know.  Everything, you know, was kind of outdone.  And so the concept--where the concept had some value of the execution of it, it just didn't work.  It just did not work, and it went away, you know, like many other things, you know.  It was unlike any other thing that BET had ever done or that we had done.  And the creator of the idea, well, he was very creative in the execution of it and the expertise and how to execute it in a form, you know, that made it more interesting and more creatively palatable; it just--it wasn't there at that time, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there ever a project that you really wanted to see BET take on and they didn't, it just wasn't done for whatever reason?
Speaker 2: I would have always loved to have seen BET do the kind of programming that was more uplifting.  Entertainment, you know; but not the entertainment, you know, that did not feed our young people, our young minds.  I would have liked to have seen, you know, programming that, you know, that gave them a greater sense of who they were; you know, a sense of pride.  Something that made them strive to go higher, you know, to, like, build upon and build and build and build upon all of the efforts of the people in the entertainment industry prior to them, you know.  And so, I think in some ways I was disappointed, you know.  And I was told often times was that the audience would not accept that kind of programming; that the, you know, that the audience wanted to see the kind of programming that was on there, so.  You know, it was their choices.  It was their network, but really, I was disappointed.  I would have liked to have seen a lot of other things happen on BET.  But they were also, you know, they also had to deal with the fact that, where the kinds of programming that even perhaps some of them may have wanted to, like, do, the advertising dollars were not there either.  So you see.  Had advertisers who would pay CNN that started at the same time, you know, [Ted] Turner started the same time, but he would get far more advertising dollars than BET did.  So it was cheaper and it kept them in the black to just have--run videos, you know, because that was like free money, you know, for them.  So I think, in their defense, I think that was a big problem, you know, as well.  But from a social sense, you know, I didn't like the lack of social responsibility demonstrated and, you know.
Story_ID: 122832
Speaker 1: Or am I right to say there was no, like, FCC [Federal Communications Commission] requirement for cable shows to have public service?
Speaker 2: It wasn't considered a public service.
Speaker 1: Or was it--I mean, or--I mean, the T.V. stations now don't have to have the kind of show that you hosted in L.A. [Los Angeles] anymore.  They, most of them don't have a public service show where you interview people in the community anymore.  It's the same for cable shows.  Even back in those days, they didn't necessarily have to have anything uplifting on.  They could run anything that could make some money, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, true.  Well, nowadays, you know, anything goes, unfortunately.  I mean, I look at the network now and there are--there is programming that I've seen that I've, you know, like, liked, but I so rarely watch it.  You know, I actually--I like--every year, I come back and I book Bobby Jones Gospel, you know.  And I enjoyed doing that because I like gospel, one.  But also it gives me an opportunity to, like, get people heard.  You know, get artists who would have not normally been on television, you know, who are fine performers and whatnot, and give them the opportunity to be on television, and ultimately get a record deal and, you know.  So I really enjoy that, you know.  And I think that I was always probably more comfortable in the kinds of programming, you know, that were a little more uplifting than the kind of the status quo kind of programming that was running, you know.  And I was kind of vocal about it.  That's probably why it didn't work out in the long run for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long were you at BET [Black Entertainment Television]?
Speaker 2: Thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Thirteen years?  Okay.  That's right.  You said that.  So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And met the most amazing people there.  Amazing, wonderful people.
Speaker 1: So--well, who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Well, like, Curtis Simon.  Curtis Simon was head--I mean, he was senior vice president of marketing and sales; just class; standards were just really high.  Jeff Lee [HM Jefferi Lee].  Loved Jeff Lee.  Jeff Lee was president at one time.  Maurita Coley.  Maurita Coley was in the--she was a lawyer there, and then she moved up the ranks and became senior vice president of the network.  And she was great because with Maurita, you could, you know, you could come to her, you know, and you could say, "I have this grievance."  Like, you know, "I have a suggestion.  I have an idea.  I have this."  And she was always--she had a very--she had an open-door policy.  But those were the three people I think I liked most there at that network.  I really--'cause I felt that those were the three people who had a lot of integrity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So.  Now, that's a--so you were there from 1990 to 2002, 2003?
Speaker 2: 2003 I left.
Speaker 1: 2003.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, you know, and I left because they had discontinued the primetime shows, so.  My position of filling it with talent, it was nonexistent.
Speaker 1: Now this is where--at the time it was sold to Viacom?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.  It was after.
Speaker 1: Afterwards.  Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 122833
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: I formed my own company, Frazier Multimedia Group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what my company does is books talent on shows, grooms talent; independent production kinds of things, you know, field producing.  Kind of what you're doing, you know.  And I'm working on a documentary.  I've started that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us what it's about?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It is--it takes the--it's called 'You Don't Get Old Being a Fool.'  And what it does is, it juxtaposes how our grandparents, people eighty years old and above, approach life, love and the pursuit of happiness; how the baby--I mean, how the buppies did it, you know, in our generation; and then in how the young people, you know, address it.  And it's not to cast any judgment on either one, but along that way, there's been a breakdown in family; there's been a breakdown in what love is, you know; dating, you know, it is; you know, how we deal with problems and struggles; how our grandparents dealt with it, and how the young people, you know, dealt with it; how we deal with anger, you know.  I mean, how we deal with work or, you know, and how we do it raising, you know, fam--everything has just kind of shifted, but they didn't get old being a fool.  You know, they knew something that would be of value to the young people, you know.  So the hope is that, you know, we can just kind of take a look at one another and just see what we can gleam and how far we've come or how far we've--you know, how much ground we've lost or how much ground we've actually gained; and be able to, like, you know, gleam some of the pearls of our grandparents and grandparents and maybe incorporate that.  Maybe our children will look at that and incorporate some of that in their lives, you know.  And maybe all of us can learn from one another.
Story_ID: 122834
Speaker 1: Now, in producing this documentary, do you have in mind the audience of young people that, perhaps, have not been--had the privilege of having older people to talk to?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think it'll be both.  You know, I think in any documentary, you know, one of the most important things you want to create is dialogue, you know.  So I think if it can open up a discussion or a curiosity, then it's done its job.  It's going to be musically driven, you know, because I want to subtly show the effects of music on our lives and our decisions and how we feel about things, and just how, you know, just kind of flow, you know.  So like, if you take a love song, you know, that maybe our grandparents had--I can't think of one offhand, you know--but in our day, we could think of The Temptations or [HM] Smokey Robinson and what have you.  And then you have, like, the younger kids, you know, who, like, dance to 50 Cent.  It creates a different kind of emotion; a different kind of drive and how we--and a different kind of approach to life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.  Because the pursuit is different, you know.  The values are so very different today than they were then, you know.  And it's not leading our children to any real joy or any real happiness, but they don't know how to find it, you know.  So maybe if they have some images that reflect, you know, how they did it, it just might cause for pause, because if you can stop--when I look at the generation today, a lot of the kids are just spiraling, you know.  And there's a sense in many respects.  And I blame a lot of these music videos.  I really do.  And a lot of the, like, programming on television, its, you know, its sense and it's thrown our young people into a false sense of what life is about.  And when they look up and life is out of control--that's why you have Britney Spears, you know--and there's so much drugs.  There's so many things that they try and find their way through, you know, through the sexy thing.  That's doesn't, you know, get through the pills or the drugs.  That doesn't get it, you know.  They don't know to have relationships.  They really don't know how to have relationships.  They don't know what the language of love is.  They don't know how to communicate, you know.  They don't know how to get to the heart of what they're really feeling, because they've been so overly stimulated, you know.  So the hope is that the documentary helps to just give them a glimpse just to look.  You know.  Just look at it.  Stop.  Just kind of stop that wheel, you know, from spinning.  Just stop, you know, and just see how and why they were able to do (unclear).  I think back then, everyone that I've talked to, God and church played a huge role, you know, in families; in keeping families knitted together, and discussions on how they approached things, you know.  There was a fear of God.  There was a relationship that kept a moral balance there.  You know, like now, I mean, people are gaining it back, but I don't know if the youth are as much, you know. So there are lot of things to be learned in all areas in each group.  And the breakdown, I always look at the breakdown from my grandparents to my generation, to that, you know, generation was when the glass ceiling was broken after the Civil Rights period and our men went out into the workforce, where the options appeared to be so much greater, you know.  They had more options.  So they left the home, and consequently, many of them the family, you know.  The divorce rate jumped sky high after the whole Civil Rights period.  And that gave birth to mothers having to go out into the workforce, and that gave birth to the latchkey kid, you know.  And the latchkey kid was raised by television, music videos, you know; a lot of things that did not necessarily get them healthy in terms of direction.  That's my philosophy.
Story_ID: 122835
Speaker 1: Now, you've had to, in the course of this documentary, interview a number of older people.  You're doing something similar to what we're doing.  Right?  Oral histories?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How has that been for you?
Speaker 2: Amazing.
Speaker 1: And how do you choose who you interview?
Speaker 2: Very much like, you know, just having a conversation and I'll say, "You know, my grandfather." (unclear).  You hear--everybody has a grandparent or a family member with a story.  I'm trying to, like, get--he isn't eighty, but he still has a great story, Lou Johnson [HM Louis Johnson]; and what's the guy from the [Los Angeles] Dodgers?  I have it written down at home.  I mean, in fact, he still works in the Dodger Organization.
Speaker 1: Junior Gilliam (sp) or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  Oh, God.  I have it written down (at home?) and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he has a great story that just talks about--he was very much like 'The Spook Who Sat by the Door.'  You know, he knew how to keep his mouth shut and just go along with an organization until the whole concept of racism shifted, you know.  And, he could speak up, but he learned how to pick his battles very cautiously, you know.  And he learned how to--you know, how to keep his temper.  And that's something a lot of the young people have problems with.  But it's just very interesting.  Now when he has conversations with them, he'll say, "You know, you can't talk to me like that.  You know, I'm a man," and so and so and so.  And they'll say, "You know what, I am so sorry.  I didn't realize that what I was saying was like racism."  And so then he gives them a history of where he came from.  And they're like, "Wow."  You know.  It's just a different--it's just a wonderful different way.  So if I learned anything, I'm learning a great deal from the stories as well, that we just have a rich history.  All of our elders have so much to tell us and to help us with.
Speaker 1: So are the people recommended to you by word of mouth basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You and I might have a conversation or, you know, or Matthew and I may have a conversation, and you'll say, "You know, my great-grandfather (unclear) or my grandfather, he's still alive and he's always said so and so and so and so and so."  Like, there is one person that I hope I get to interview.  She's 104, you know.  Her mind is still very, very clear.  And another friend's father--no--cousin's father is ninety-seven, still drives, you know.  I mean these are people who have got stories.  Just to talk about how many of the presidents that they remember; what was going on during that time.  Just fascinating stories.  I hope it's--you know, it may not be interesting to anybody else but me.  I may be the only one who watches it.  But just to kind of--just to capture that history.  See?  You might be able to help me.  Just to be able to capture that history is just, you know--I mean, you can't beat that.  You can't beat that.
Story_ID: 122836
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So any other projects?  Is that the major thing you're working on now, is the documentary?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've just come off of a BET [Black Entertainment Television] project, which is the 'Bobby Jones Gospel' show, where we shot twenty-one hour-long shows, concert shows.  And it's all talent driven with over a six-day period, you know.  And the stress of--first of all, booking all those shows, 'cause there're seven performances in each show--booking that over, like, a six-month period.  And then all the shooting it over	those--it was like six days.  I'm just going to cool out for a minute.  That's why I'm here in Chicago [Illinois].  My girlfriend said, "You need a break," you know.  So we finished that the end of July.  And so I'm just trying just to kind of fall out and whatnot.
Speaker 2: I know years ago, they used to shoot the 'Bobby Jones Gospel' show here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: In Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The ETA Creative Arts Foundation on the South Side.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: In their new theater.
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Well, we do it in Washington [D.C.] every year.  I think it started out in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think that's where he first started out.
Story_ID: 122837
Speaker 1: Tell us about your son.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a son.  He is--his name is Derek McKeith.  And he is a music artist.  He is a singer, a writer, producer.  And he's so extreme--he's far more talented than I am.  Derek Samuel McKeith. M-c, capital -K-E-I-T-H.  And when my marriage broke up, he was a year and a half, so we moved from New York [New York City, New York] to Los Angeles [California] and whatnot.  And so, he's, you know--he was one of those latchkey kids, though, who became--whose life went in the music direction.  Although, he came up about it honestly, because his father was one of the first black music agents at William Morris, you know.  And his love for music came very early.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just wanted just to throw that out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did you ever sing, yourself?  Did you ever sing?
Speaker 2: I, you know--nobody wants to hear me sing.  I love to sing, but nobody wants to hear me sing.  No.  I can't sing.  I enjoy it though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a pleasant voice.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.  Thank you.
Story_ID: 122838
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: That--my greatest hope is that we learn the value of family again, you know, and that we have more intervention on the part of black men for our kids, because I think they're key; that God--I mean, I'm a Christian woman, and I believe, I really whole heartedly believe that, you know, that, like, God has to be in our midst in order for there to be change.  But I think it's critically important that wherever we, who have been fortunate enough to have gained access to certain knowledge, that we come back and we take a position in helping our, you know, community get to the next level.  But I think men, males, are just key, are just key, you know.  So my prayer is that, and my hope is that, we, you know, all never look at our kids who have gone, you know, in the opposite direction as those people or those kids; that we look at it as, these are our kids, and we take the time to invest.  You know, we take the time to invest and we start early.  We start early, and we teach every neighborhood--if our--if it's our neighbor's kid, that we invest in them and never see ourselves outside of their success or their failure.
Story_ID: 122839
Speaker 1: All right.  We always ask this question, too:
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When you think about everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I would probably learn more--I would have probably have gone to, like, school and learned directing from a technical standpoint, because I think that that's just one of the ingredients.  I mean, and I still plan to do it, but I would have probably have done it sooner than later, 'cause I had an opportunity to and didn't do that.  So I would probably say that that would be, you know, it.  I may have--I don't know.  I don't really have many things I would regret, you know.  I mean, it has been a good ride.  It's been a good understanding that entertainment is a business, you know.  And you got to get your emotions out of it.  And if I learned anything, I learned to be able to be able to transition, you know.  That the real key to longevity in this industry is your ability to, one, identify it as a business and understand that it's always a learning process; and the gift of creativity has always given birth to another form of creativity.  So when the acting thing slowed down--oh, I should say, when the PR thing slowed down and the acting thing--oh, no; when the modeling thing happened, that gave birth to acting; acting gave birth to producing; producing will give birth to, you know, directing.  So, you know, if you understand and you don't attach your emotions to any aspect of it, and you allow yourself to just kind of just blossom, you know, there's no telling where you go.  Then it becomes a wonder adventure, you know.  And so, you don't look at it as regrets.  You look at it as, "Okay.  So that season was over.  Okay.  So, what's the next season?  Okay, where am I," you know, "Where am I fitting in," you know.  You just be flexible and be open.  You know, I mean, it's a great gift.  I just say, "God, you know that I have this gift, so you show me how you want to use it in this new season," or how--and you always will use it.  There's nothing that we've ever experienced that will go wasted, if we allow Him to use it.
Story_ID: 122840
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any acting opportunities on the horizon or are you in any yet?
Speaker 2: I sure hope so.  It seems like this is my season doing commercials, you know.  I have a couple of those, a few of those running now.  But, I like commercials, because it's quick, fast and in a hurry.  But I would really love to do a great movie.  I would love to do a great part of a very smart woman, a very--a woman who is smart, wise and, like, leaves you with that "Ahh" kind of thing, like, "Ahh, I learned something, like, hmm," you know."  Who that character is, you know, I don't know.  But I just really want to do--I really, you know, I want to--I--if I never act again, I want to go out having said, "Ooh, I nailed that one.  Boy, I did a fantastic job in that.  You know, it's a great character.  I feel good about it, you know.  All my chops were there."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess there aren't many opportunities to do that, I guess, for a lot of actors to really get a real good role.
Speaker 2: True.  True.  Then, you know, who knows?  See--okay.  Now, this may go back to my faith, you know, which is that part of myself that I, honest to God, believe that, like, if that desire is strong enough, that the opportunity will present itself.  Now, how it will, I don't know.  Maybe I'll come up with an idea and sit down with a writer, and they'll write it.  And, you know, and then the pieces will come together (unclear).  I don't know.  You know.  I don't know.  One or two things will happen:  either that will, you know, will happen, or something else will take its place, that which will happen, you know.  So I'm mutable in this instance.
Story_ID: 122841
Speaker 1: Now, likewise, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  That's a good question.  I think that my relationship with young people, you know; and being able to impart the things that I've learned, you know.  I have a lot of young people who will call me for advice or direction, you know, and they value it.  There's no greater gift than taking what I've learned and giving it away to someone else.  And so, that to me is the greatest legacy to have someone say, "I learned this from Sheila Frazier," you know, "And it's helped me in some way or another," you know.  That, to me is, you know, is it.
Story_ID: 122842
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked or discussed--that we haven't discussed here that you need to--that we need to raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think.  I'm sure on my way home I'll think of (unclear) (laughs), you know.  But I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered as someone who was in this industry and never compromised her integrity.  Someone who held a standard, you know; and someone who always maintained a good reputation and helped others.
Speaker 1: Okay.
