Elizabeth Buford: Mr Seawell, coming from a very prominent North Carolinian family, a family that is very diversified. . . specifically, just as we were talking before the tape, with politics and certainly your brother Malcolm Seawell, I wonder if you would tell us how you became interested in the theater initially and how you ended up here as a Carolina Play- I maker. Seawell:  Actually, I was never a Carolina Playmaker. B.B.:  Really, that Seawell:  I got in the theater simply because one fall afternoon my best friend, Johnny Wilkinson, told me he had a date with a little Playmaker by the name of Eugenia Rawls. B.B.:  Incredible. Seawell:  And he asked if I would pick them up and take them out to my house. I did.  He said "Miss Rawls, I'd like you to meet Mr Seawell."  I said "How do you do? I'm going to marry you." B.B.:  What a story!  That's a tough act to follow. Seawell:  . . . hard to keep away from . . . the theater. B.B.: You were part of the American theater. One of the things that we're so interested in in terms of the tension, the conflict between roles, specifically of women, but in the American theater during the 30s and 40s and the way women were presented not only on the stage during that period but the way women were presented in movies during that period.  And I wondered if you have any sort of reaction, either to that or some of your favorite plays dealing with sort of characterizations, not necessarily of page 2 southern women but just of women. Seawell: Well, with respect to the women's role in the theater during that period, I suppose I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world. Not only because Eugenia said yes to the rather abrupt proposal but because when I went to New York to practice law I had such clients as Tallulah Bankhead, Lynn Fontanne,Alfred Lunt, Noel Coward, Howard Lindsey, Russell Grouse, Ruth Draper and on and on.  But actually the women in our theater in America really dominated that period.  Because you had not only Lynn Fontanne, Helen Hayes, Katharine Cornell. . . fabulous array of women actresses.  And on the stage there was only one actor, Alfred Lunt, who you could mention in the same breath with any of the great ladies of the American theater.     Fortunately I've been able to work with most of them, to eventually produce plays with most of them.      It'sbeen a fabulous experience.  But the women certainly didn't need any liberation movement during that period.  They dominated the American theater. B.B.:  Did you find, in terms of most of the. . .we're been sort of batting around amongst ourselves sort of the whole role that the theater performed, especially during the depression.  Not just getting into WPA projects and all that social consciousness theater . . . but an incredible outlet that usually we think of when we talk about movies, as sort of the escape valve. And being involved with people who were very paramount in the theater during that experience, was there much discussion amongst all the people involved in terms of what they were doing.  Sort of greater than life and the roles they were performing for a public who really needed it? Seawell:  I don't really think so.  Of course times of crisis are apt to produce great plays  as a necessity because of the dramatic source of material. I actually didn't get started in the professional theaters in the 30s.  I first became a Broadway p'roducer in the 40s and was fortunate enough to start page 3 out producing a play with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne written by Noel Coward.  And after that. . . B.B.:  That's a tough act to follow. Seawell: . . . where to go.  But let me get started back before the 30s because Prof Kock  did such a magnifleant job here of pinpointing the great need of the theater in the development of the folk theater so that people could write about what they really knew about best.                                 So  many of the people who are connected with the Playmakersthat is from the student point of viewweren't as sophisticated as they are now because the opportunities for travel, the opportunities for learning through the electronic media weren't present.  Today the folk drama might be something of an anachronism if you focused on it to the exclusion of all else.  And of course I know that the Playmakers now are going in for other directions and I'm so delighted and happy with all the new developments.  But to me the most important thing that has happened in the theater in America since I've been connected with the theater has been the development of the regional theater on a professional basis.  Actually, it was nonexistant until the early or mid 50s.  But it proliferated at a great, great rate.  For years, when I was concerned with the Broadway theater as a producer rather than as head of the American National Theater, which I am now, we were living on the British theater because that's where the plays were coming from, that's where the actors were coming from.     Ifc wasn't that they had more talent than we but a greater opportunity for the talent to develop, because they had regional theater, great regional companiesBirmingham, Bristol and so forththat could feed into the Royal Shakespeare and later into the National Theatre.     An actor can't become an actor in a vacuum, he's got to work. A playwright, unless he has an opportunity to see his plays presented, can't really be a playwright.  But the regional theater is developing so wonderfully and an important adjunct to that,of course,is page 4 that after 185 years of giving absolutely not a penny to the arts, our money for the arts. government's finally appropriating/ And that too is growing.  The first year I was associated with the national council,there was only 3 million dollars for all of the artsmost of which had to go for administration. This coming year there will be $82 million for the arts.  But even two years ago the theater only got less than $3 million of it.  We're always low man on the totem pole. B.B.:  I was going to say, is the theater the secondary child. . . Seawell:  We are always, for some reason, expected to make our own way. And its impossible for any of the performing arts, when you're dealing on a repertory basis, to make a go of it. B.B.:  Exactly. Seawell:  And. . . but nevermind, the fabulous invalid has survived now for twenty five hundred years and it's not. . . B.B.:  It's not about to stop now.  Right. Seawell:  I think it's very happy that there's a great opportunity for everybody in the theater to be employed in the regional theater.  Local talent. I'm right now building, through foundations that I control, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, which will be a major center.I think frankly it will be the best center in the whole world for the performing arts because we know  all the mistakes that the rest of them made. B.B.:  Specifically, will you have students coming to the center or will it be something such as on a national repertory basis where people will be coming. . .? Seawell:  Well, you're thinking primarily of the theaters now.  And I'm going to have five theaters in the performing arts complexsimply because , after a great deal of experimentation J. think that you can't have one We are going theater that you can adapt for all purposes.   /   to have a proscenium page 5 theater, a thrust theater, an experimental theater, an outdoor theater, and an empty space theater where you can do anything in of variable shapes and forms.  But a theater of that type to be important must be professional, professionally oriented.    There must also be a conservatory where the most promising of the people that come from the universities around and about or from the various amateur playhouses can have a chance to work with professionals and become a part of the company.  Perhaps I shouldn't be saying it in the Playmakers theater here where so much wonderful talent has developed, but there is a gap between the college theater and the professional theater and this is a method of bridging itworking with the professionals.  And if there wasn't a gap, why in the world      bother about going on with the theater. B.B.:  In terms of sort of that inbred isolation      with the incredible transition from college to the theater.  Are you encouraged by the number of performersnot just Miss Rawls, who has come home to give this special performance.  But I'm thinking of for example of the National Repertory Theaterhas sort of a live-in residence training program in different universities before it goes out.  Are you encouraged by more of that or do you think there's a danger of ensconcing itself too much in academia? Seawell:  Not at all.  I think that some type of association between resident professional companies and universities should be pressed everywhere we can afford to do it.  I know there have been many administrative problems and I've been through many unhappy experiences on both sides.  By all means it should be encouraged.  My own feelingand this comes as much from an administration point of view as any      is that there should be independence.  I think that there should be complete opportunity for the best of the college actors, directors or whatever, to feed in to the repertory company.  There should be a close association, but an independence, page 6 because that's where most of the fights have come as I've known them throughout the country in my capacity as chairman of ANTA. Genie, I think, gets a great  kick out of going to the universities, as she's done in many instances and working with the students as artist in residence.  And that is and a very new development in the theater,/Very very important one. B.B.:  Dealing with you specifically, of the incredible associations that you've had and the various plays you've produced, do you have any particular favorites in terms of your sense that it wasexperimentation is a fairly strong word, but that it was something different.  Or that sense of going out on a limb at a particular time. Seawell:  Favorites in terms of productions or individuals I've worked with? B.B.:  In terms of productions I was thinking of specifically, but in terms of individuals would be fine. Seawell:  Oh, from a strictly family point of view, of course Tallulah is godmother of our children and so very, very close.  But Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne have been just as close.  As a matter of fact when I was at Genesee Depot for Alfred's 80th birthday, Lynn threw her arms around me and said "Donnie, how does it feel to have an 80 year old son?"  (laughter) B.B.:  Alfred Lunt. Seawell:  They are the most incredibly gifted actors I think of almost any era.  One, they would have been great great stars individually.  When you have two stars of that magnitude working together, living together, what happens is. . . B.B.:  Creative. Seawell:  Creative. . . takes off. . . and they never, never stop working on any part.  It's not a part, it's true.  And as far as experimentation is concerned, they were the most experimentally oriented people I've ever seen.  They never page 7 stopped experimenting.  They never stopped. . . B.B.:  Never stopped growing. Seawell:  Actually, long before there was such a thing as repertory theater in America they had created their own repertory company, the Theater Guild. And it. . . and yet they would never of course take star billing.  Had to force it upon them.  (laughter)  Alfred's ideas are fantastic.  By any young, way-out director today, Alfred would be far, far ahead.  He had, of course, a practical sense based upon his experience and his knowledge of the theater, which  , transcends any other man in our theater and any other man I think we've had in the theater.     They were the most exciting people to work with, no question about it.  And I do remember in a play that we produced together, The Great Sebastians, I went out to San Francisco for the close of the tour.  It closed on a Saturday night and Alfred called a rehearsal between the matinee and the evening performance because he and Lynn had thought of some new business to put in it. B.B.:  That is professionalism. Seawell:  And everybody in the company was happy  to   do it.  This is a story they could tell the rest of our lives.  (laughter)  But the business worked. B.B.:  For the one night stand.  (laughter)  In terms of the whole aura of the theater and. . . Americans. . . the whole tension really of, you know, the pragmatism, you know, of what we as a people think about the theater, not just       the, I don't know, sort of the luxury of the elite for so long in terms of so much perception.  And I think so much of that is beginning to break down, possibly from what you've said, in terms of its becoming more localized and decentralized.  But just in your experiences in New York and the Broadway theater, have you noticed a change or is this a superimposed transition, you think? page 8 Seawell: Well, there's a great change brought on by the fact, I think primarily, that the economics of the theater have changed so much. You can't, anymore, open a Broadway show with any hope of getting your money back except under the most unusual circumstances.  I don't know what the failure ratio is now but it costs a million dollars or more to do a musical.  I did Sail Away, Noel Coward's musicalbrought it in to Broadway for $285,000 and got the money back in four months.  Now, one Broadway show, which cost $1.5 million to open has been running to capacity for well over a year and not a penny has been repaid to the investors.  The same is true of the nonmusicals, too, on a smaller scale, of course.  But who can afford to put that much money. . .? During all of the shows that Helen Bonfils     and I did, we never used a penny of public money. B.B.:  Never. Seawell: Most of the plays       with the Lunts we didn't use any public money.  We didn't think it was fair to ask the public to risk that.  Today there are no producers who can produce without going out and getting the public money.  And that. . . I think to a large extent the economics of the theater dictates that the new, exciting, experimental things are going on in subsidized theater. Ballinger: Why has it come to this that it costs such a great deal to produce things, and how has that effected the quality of the plays that are being written? Seawell:  Well. . . I. . . the quality. . . Let me take that up first. In the commercial theater you can't really do the experimental work that you did before.  You try to get, I think most of the producers, something that will fit a pattern that they think is fairly commercial and will sell.  The costs have gone up just like the costs of everything else. And yet the revenues have not gone up.  This is going back a few years ago, when the Lunts opened in the Visit, in the new Lunt-Fontaine theater, and page 9 gosh that must be 15 or 20 years ago, Roger Stevens and I did a little checking and we found that if the cost of theater tickets had gone up commensurate with the cost of groceries, we would be charging $45 a ticket. It could be even more today. Ballinger: Are fewer people going to the theater, then, than went previously? Seawell: Fewer people are going to the theater in New York for a lot of reasons. One, the cost, although they haven't gone up commensurate with other costs. Two, Broadway is not an attractive place for anyone to go. And. . . its a dangerous place, today. And who the devil would want to go? I'm just so happy when I find somebody who has gone to the theater. But still there's an excitement.  A couple days ago I had to preside at the Morosco Theater, which they're tearing down, of course, as they're tearing. . . The graduation of the American Academy.  I'm a trustee and they vote&amp;lt; me the job of presiding, practically every year.  And to preside over the presentation of an award to Colleen Dewhurst. Now there is a stage where you do have excitement and. . . B.B.:  Greatness. Seawell: Greatness.  In Jason Robards and Colleen. But it's a revival. I think today perhaps the most exciting stuff is coming out of the subsidized theater.  And that isn't all bad. I no longer produce  on Broadway ,other than as chairman of ANTA, because I don't produce commercially anyway. . . not enough time. . . and I'm much more concerned with the development of new talent, new theater. B.B.:  Saving the theater.  Right. We have Seawell:   / the well known playwrights. It's practically impossible for of someone unknown to break in.  As a matter of fact,/all of the thousands of scripts that I've read, I've never read a decent one coming from an unknown playwright.  Because a playwright, like an actor, has to have worked his way page 10 up through various stages of the theater. I was producing plays by Lindsey Grouse, ^y Noel Coward. So on and so forth. I should say right here something that I just thought of that might be important to the Playmakers and Lindsey to this campus.  Howard  /  and Russell Grouse once told me that long after their names were forgotten the name of Paul Green would be remembered, because Paul Green had produced a different type of play.  And that he would be eternally honored for that.  And I don't think Lindsey and Grouse are going to be forgotten. . . B.B.:  I. . . that was the only qualification in all of that. Seawell:  They meant it, and we all know what they meant.  No, I'm very much encouraged by all of the developments.  I once produced with Helen Bonfils  and Haila Stoddard A Thurber Carnival which was something of a hit.  And I was just reading the other day, the last thing that James Thurber ever wrote,                                   "Let us not look backward in anger, nor forward in despair, but around us in awareness." And I think that's what we must do to keep the theater. . . B.B.:  To keep it going. Seawell:. . . going. Ballinger: Mr Seawell I hear that you have a number of associations with British theater.  And I think I read somewhere that you were at some point working on British Seawell:  Yes, one of the happiest aspects Ballinger:  I'm just curious to hear you talk about some of the things you've done in Britain. Seawell:  Well, they would fall down, break down into two categories fall down, sometimes.  But for years I was fortu&amp;jte enough to produce for the Royal Shakespeare Theater such things as the Hollow Crown which I It was the brought to America.   / only Broadway show I ever directed and the only page 11 one I ever will.  Because it got unanomous raves and I'm not about tb challenge those. B.B.:  You can't fight it. Seawell:  Also, on Shakespeare's 400th anniversary Helen Bonfils and I production of brought over the Peter Brook-Paul Scofield /Lear which we presented in Washington on    Shakespeare's 400th anniversary.  We  brought over at the same time Comedy of Errors which had in its cast such unknown actresses as Diana Rigg, Julie Christieneither have been heard from.  (laughter) Alec McGowan, Ian Richardson. . . (laughter)  It goes on and on.  You see, and the they weren't known then, but they've had the talent 'opportunity to develop. I've worked Also   /    many times a great deal with Peter Hall, who has now as you know replaced Lord Olivier as head of the National Theater.  Scoffield and I have gotten together and decided things we're going to be doing, even things we're going to be doing in Denver.  I've also taken over, from America to England, plays that we've done here.  But to me the most excit-is ing part 'not just simply transporting something from one location to another, but to work with those great repertory companies and the depth of talent that they have.     We have as much talent but we don't have This we must create. the opportunity for it to develop. /On the movie side, that's a lot of fun and it's still going on.  Bill Travers and Virginia McKinna and I years ago formed our own movie company.  At that time we were doing a lot of Wee Geordie things in Scotland like    /   Bridle Path and a few others, Smallest Show on Earth.  Then after Born Free.we started turning our attention to Africa. And I don't know how we're going to get out of Africa right now. four Last year we won / Fannies and one Tony for our productions.  That was all due to Bill And Ginny.  They're wonderful artists.  You know them? B.B.: Yes. Seawell:  And we were just with them last week.  Eugenia was over doing page 12 her Tallulah show at the American Embassy.  She also did her Fanny Kemble show which she did at this theater                                for the Royal Historical Society.  She goes back and forth.  As a matter of fact she's the only American actress ever to be sponsored in England by the British Arts Council.  That's primarily the type of thing we've been doing in the way of movies, but it is. . . is a lot of fun.  I guess maybe I try to do too many things.  Running a newspaper, running a publishing company, my law office easier and all.  I think it's /  to do a lot of things than  concentrate on one. You don't get bored. B.B.:  I agree.  If it wouldn't be too presumptions, could you give us a little advance warning or a little enticement of some of the things that you and Mr- Scofield, for example, think that you might bring in to Denver. Or at least the kinds of things that you might like to do or you envision in your center? Seawell:  This, you see, is going to be an important center for another reason.  It will be the first center for the performing arts ever to be endowed in perpetuity and primarily because of my late partner, Helen Bonfils  and her interest in the arts.  I've been able to direct the Bonfils Foundations  ,   toward this development and we will have a nest egg of $50 million left over after we build the center, to be used for the maintenance and operation of the Centerwhich has enabled me to say to Lord Olivier, to Larry, to Paul Scofield, to Diana Rigg "Do whatever you want to.  Just. . ." B.B.:  And not be threatened by. . . Seawell:  Just blank check them.  Of course I trust them.  They're not. . . B.B.:  It's a good blank check, yes. Seawell:  I mean, they're not. . . Larry Olivier would cringe if he saw three cents being thrown away unnecessarily. page 13 Di Rigg, such a close personal friend of Genie's and mine and the children, him is dying to come over and do some things there.  And Paul we met with/in London and Paul said "This is firm?" I said its firm.  "All right, I'll start thinking.  I'll let you know when things gel and we'll take off from there." B.B.:  I think the thing that's so exciting. . . well, Sir Lawrence Olivier's work with Eugene O'Neil's play comes to mind.  But the whole interchange, that when you're dealing with that much talent of. . . we're not talking about the British theater or the American theater or something. It's an entirely different. . . Seawell:  I agree completely but there is one thing that should worry us all.  When Lord Olivier did his tv special. . . B.B.:  Yes. Seawell: . . . everyone that I know was glued to the set.  And yet I looked up the ratings and it was the lowest rating of all the television specials for the whole year. B.B.:  I can't believe that because everyone we know watched it. Seawell:  That's because we are oriented to the theater.  Of course we were glued to the set.  People gave up everything just to get to a television set.                                        the people that we know.  But no one else did.  Which, again, emphasizes one of the most important things that I can do with the center for performing arts in Denverwhat anybody must do.  And that's create new audiences. We've almost lost a generation or two and we've got to save the kids from constant attention to the boob tube.  Once you've done it, then you've got them hooked as an audience. But we've got to get them to the living theater.  And there have been a few programs, such as HEW and the National Council sponsored theater laboratory which took place in Los Angelesnot Los Angelesin New Orleans, in Providence and to some extent page 14 San Francisco.  Where you'd have a poll and find out that less than one professional percent of high school students had ever seen live/performances.  You'd have a poll to find out what their preferences are. Not more than 5% would say they'd want to see the living theater.  But once they'd seen it there would be a complete reversal.  99% would say "Yes, I'd rather see this than the movies or the television." Which again leads to an important thing.  With our performing arts center we are building initially this has never been done before although they've been addedfilm arts study.  The point of this is that when last year we had the Shakespearean festival at the John F. Kennedy with which I was associated, Roger Stevens had built as an afterthought a film institute theater into the set up Sort of back stage.  And they were showing Olivier films of Hamlet and the kids came to see those and stayed on to see the living theater.  But we've got somehow to get out. . . to get to them. . . B.B.:  Enticing, yes. Seawell:  And for that reason, since the idea of the Denver Center of the Perfor Ing Arts occured to me, I've been sending traveling companies out into the various ethnic areas of Denver and surrounding country to try to trap them.  It's working, I hope. B.B.: When will the center really begin? Obviously, it's begun, but when do you see people really coming en mass to Denver and the center.  Do you have a time line at this point? Seawell:  I've never fooled myself that they are going to come. We're. . . its a very little oasis in a cultural desert that extends a thousand miles in any direction. And while Denver right now has about a million three-quarters people,they are not theater oriented and you're not going to get them that way over night.  We are going to expose them to the best there is in the theater, and sooner or later it will come about. page 15 B.B.: Wearing down. Seawell: At the moment I know I'm building for the future and maybe in 20-25 years it will come about. B.B.:  Does the tension of this realization, you know, that we have to get newer audiencesin other words generations that have been missed or whatevercounterbalance with the problems of financing.  As you say, getting back into the problems of public financing.  Does that concern you in terms of the types of programs that might come to mind. What I'm thinking of specifically is the National Endowment of the Arts, a few years ago, set up an experimental theater in Watts.  But what happened, it became a guerrilla theater, which was certainly all right, for the purposes of the people involved, but it wasn't exactly what the National Endowment hoped would happen.  In. . . you know, in that particular context.  And. . . do you think that's being too hysterical an appraisal? Or. . . Seawell:  Right.  Well, I'm playing hookey today.  Actually there is a meeting this weekend of the Theater Panel of the National Council and I'm a member of it.  I went by yesterday morning en route to Chapel Hill to say "Thank you, but I won't be here.  I'm going down to the University of North Carolina." So I am somewhat familiar with, obviously as a member of the panel, with what's going on.  It doesn't concern me.  I don't think it concerns the panel.  Just as a matter of semantics, the Council didn't really set it up. All the Council does is to finance programs.  It very early took the position that the worst thing it could do would be to try to dictate what those programs were.  So that. . . that, of course, would be censorship and we tried to avoid it.  There is a qualitative judgment made on the basis of the track record of any theater.  And this becomes very important outside the experimental theater group.  Within the page 16 experimental theater group it's hard to put any qualitative analysis because you don't have the history of performance.  Normally there is, even with the experimental theater, there must be a year or two years in money to existance to show that you're not giving/something that will not be there tomorrow. But this rule has been waved, particularly in ethnic situations where there would be, for instance, a feeling that there was a great need to have a black theater in the black section of Washingtonwhich, incidentally, has worked beautifully.  Now there are other areas, not only black, but brown and the chicano areas, where it has worked but where it has also not worked.  But obviously you're taking a bigger chance with experimental theater.  But I know from my point of view, and I think from the point of view of the entire National Council and the entire Theater Panel, that that's a very small risk to take compared with censorship of the theater.  And I don't know that my judgment would be as good on what should be shown in Watts than the people who are doing it.  I think it would be probably much worse. B.B.:  To come back a little to your roots (laughter)  and the diversity of your family.  We were talking the other night that another famous Carolina Playmaker said that you can't go home again. And we were curious, in terms of all the diversity of both of your lives, and coming in and out of the south and going in and out of London and your, very obvious your very strong commitment to the university.  We went back and read, for example, when Miss Rawls came down before to do Fanny Kemble, you know, which was a very conscious effort, you know, to touch base again or something. We just wondered what your reactions are, just by talking to the, I guess the theater community here, of what's happening in the south, to the theater. And how that. . . and how you feel about that? page 17 Seawell:  What is happening here at the university is something I'm very proud of.  You may know that I sent Robert Downing, who is now my drama editor of the Denver Post, here, oh, about a month or two ago.  And he came back so delighted with the quality of the training, with the. . . with what is happening and what will happen, in his opinion, in the relationship with the Eugene O'Neil Theater.  I think that as far as the south as a whole is concerned that the theater situation is deplorable.  It is something that you recognize every time you sit down with the theater panel of the National Council to determine where appropriations should go.  If it were strictly on a qualitative basis we couldn't find very many professional companies in the south that we could give very much money to.  You simply have to take another point of view and say "My God, there is a need for the professional theater to develop there that transcends any other section." The possible exception to that would be the Rocky Mountain West where                                            . . . B.B.: Seawell:  There's always been a desert.  But again, fortunately, through the generoueity of my late partner, Helen Bonfils,  we're going to make that anything but.  And there too we recognize the necessity for that center, sending out the symphony orchestrawhich, incidentally, Denver Symphony got very very excellent notices in New York and Washington. Sending out our own professional theater companies throughout that area. I don't know what we can do in the south except perhaps continue to grow outstanding talent here at the university and other universities.  But it's got to have a place for it to take root.  There are a few theaters in Atlanta, struggling along.  You have                      in Florida.  You've had some coming and going in New Orleans.  But none of them are really outstanding when you compare it to the ACT or to the Mark Taper Forum or to page 18 the Arena in Washington the        Guthrie. . . B.B.:  Exactly.  And there doesn't seem to be a network of, you know. . . Seawell:  No, and of course you have theAW-e? Theater.  We don't consider Texas as part of the south, I know, but there's no reason why that couldn't have happened in Atlanta or in Raleigh.  Raleigh doesn't quite have enough people at the momentthe area does. B.B.:  Exactly, exactly.  Do you think the Playmakers, or not necessarily the Playmakers as such if you prefer to talk about the theater in the south, that people are beginning to change their sort of focus.  For example we refered to earlier with the Koch and the marvelous Green era with the emphasis on the folk play and students literally writing, directing and acting in their own play.  And then coming more into established productions.  And you mentioned the Eugene O'Neil Associations.  Really the first play, Che, which was just given here a few weeks ago, which had was a fantastic play-obviously so or it would not have won in the competitionbut it had capacity crowds here.  In other words it was a very the word got out, I guess is what I'm trying to say.  But it was fine and people who didn't have, you know, regular tickets, went out and tried to fill in a few seats.  And do you think this kind of diversity is helpful, or do you think that it might burn itself out? Seawell:  No, of course it is.  And helpful at that.  Obviously Che would draw here because it is a university community to a much greater degree than it could possibly draw in a non-university setting.  And you know what Prof was doing when he turned the focus entirely on folk play was a gamejust having his students write about what they knew about.  And the same thing is true today.  It won't be folk plays because that's historical now. B.B.:  Exactly. page 19 Seawell:  There's so much more going on in the world all over and you have to write about what you've known about, and as I say that crisis and necessity bring about correspondingly great theater. As you pointed out, in the depression, the 30s, I was just graduating from this university.  I don't know what we can do about developing. . . all of the arts in the south.  But it is a great necessity and there's a great appreciation of culture in the south, I know. And with the fabulous people you have its going to come about but I can't say when or how. B.B.:  Some of the problems are obvious.  Problems of economics, certain kind of provincial infrastructure that is going to prevent people from looking outward.  But do you have just any thoughts in terms of why the theater hasn't developed? Because certainly historically, if you want to go way back, some of the stronger points of the theater, focus of culture, were in the south.  And. . . Seawell:  I can remember when I was growing up in a small town, south, there wasn't a little town that didn't have what it called it's opera opera, house. It wasn't really /but you put on plays, everything.  I think it's primarily a question of economics.  And the fact too that the south hasn't had any really large metropolitan concentrations until recently. When I was a student here at the university there wasn't a single city of North Carolina with a population of over 100,000.  And it does take money to support a symphony, to support a ballet, to support a theater.  And it takes a population to do it.  Today, most of the nonprofit theaters hope to get about 75% of their costs from the theater ticket sales and the other 25 from endowments,                                      foundations, individuals and from the federal government.  Well, obviously, that's going to take a concentration of population, which doesn't, for the most part, exist in the south.  That has to be one of the reasons. page 20 B.B.:  And sort of backing in into why the south, in terms of kind of acculturation sense, you know, the continuation of that kind of vacuum. Are there many other university programs with any kind of interchange? We've talked about UNC and the Eugene O'Neil Theater, but are there many interconnecting links between regional theaters across the country? For example, a theater or university in New England becoming associated with something in the midwest.  Is there much exchange at all going on now? Seawell:  Very little exchange between universities and companies this far apart.  For the most part the professional theater that has an association with universities adjacent to it.  Yale, Oakland, Seattle, where-ever.  But I don't know of any that has this distant relationship.  I think its wonderful.  This reminds me of one thing that I shouldn't be sitting here in Chapel Hill talking about Denver.  But just by way of an illustration, our theater company will be the first two-city company. The. . . Gordon Davidson who now is artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles will be our artistic director and we will have a double company operating simultaneously in Denver and in Los Angeles, creating in both cities and exchanging them.  This is the first time it has been done, but we think not only will there be great savings but also generate a lot of competition. . . B.B.:  Point and counterpoint.  Are many of your friends who are based in New York concerned aboutgranted its the wave of the future, a healthy kind of expanse of the futurebut are people concerned about the kind of moving away from Broadwaywill end up detracting or is it a recognition that that era has been moving on anyway and that the theater has changed? Seawell:  As far as the actors are concerned I think that there is rejoicing, because there'll be more jobs.  Also recognition that this is really page 21 where the action is.  Broadway will always be a Mecca.  There has to be. B.B.:  There has to be one place. . . Seawell:  One place, you know, that everybody aspires to go.  And once you've been there, you know, you can say "That, I've had it." But you've really got to be there to have made it.   Judy Garland had a song once "If you haven't played the Palace, you might as well be dead." Well, I think most people feel this way about Broadway.  But all of the stars that I know now would like to go out and work with regional theater.  And most of them are doing it.  And yet, I was sitting on the stage two days ago withof the Morosco,        the thing I was telling you about with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. We were talking about it and I said, "You were the first to go out to the TyroneGuthrietheater and you were looking all over town for a coonskin cap." (laughter)  Friends were saying "Goodbye Jessica, goodbye      we'll never see you again. Watch out for the Indians." B.B.:  Be very careful. Seawell:  A lot of things have happened.  One, the decline of Broadway has made it so that people want to go.  Second, transportation has made it so simple now.  Get on an airplane and be there.  But there are still some hard core producers who chomp on their cigars and say . . . B.B.: Seawell: . . . "If it isn't on Broadway, it isn't worth going to see." B.B.:  Right. Seawell:  But that. . . there aren't many.  Sure, this is the way of the future.  But you see for so many, many years the regional theater had to feed off Broadway.  All of the. . . B.B.:  Directly. Seawell:  Now the hope is that you can, Broadway will be feeding off the page 22 regional theater. Because it can't keep on feeding off itself without eating itself up.  Like the calico cat or the gingham dog, or who was it, maybe the Cheshire cat. B.B.:  The Cheshire cat, exactly.  Devouring. . .  You've mentioned quite a few stars                          of the American theater in just our conversation and I wonder if you have any sort of reactions or comparisons to the star system, or really almost lack thereof, in the American theater.  It's almost a matter of sitting down and we can all come with our greats very quickly. Seawell:  I think that the happiest thing that can happen to any company is for a star to work with it.  And if it happens here just keep your eyes fixed on that star. I (end of side of tape) . . . the fact that some of the artistic directors don't want a star with their company, I think is pure chauvinism or perhaps jealousy or perhaps fear.  But there is so much that everyone can learn from working with an Alfred Lunt or working with a Paul Scoffield.  Just so unbelievable, the difference that it makes in a company      on the stage. And there's such great modesty in great stars, too.  I don't know any of them that really have the type of temperament they're supposed to have.  Tallulah, of course,had great temperament and great show.  But when she was working, she worked so beautifully with everyone on the stage.  And I never saw her throw a fit of temperament on the stage. B.B.:  So much of your life isboth of your lives, have been associated with Miss Bankhead. And just in looking through the papers here in the library and whatever.  We're very aware, in a very strong way, the two of you are going to be great contributors of the myth.  There are great aspects of the truth.  You know, I'm thinking of the                                  bio- graphy or whatever and I just wonderedwhat an awesome kind of responsibility page 23 its not only of getting the word out, but getting the word out for a loved one. Seawell:  Genie's doing that so beautifully.  And of course Tallulah was unique.  There was never one like Tallulah and there will never be one like Tallulah againso generous.  They broke the mold and all that. It was of course possible for anyone to meet Tallulah for the first time for a few minutes and hate completely what they saw.  But it was impossible for anyone to know Tallulah for any period of time without loving her. B.B.: Do you think that. . . as you say, genius and they broke the mold and all that. . . that Miss Bankhead wouldn't be Tallulah Bankhead under any circumstances, under any time or if it was a matter of circumstances.  In other words, a very bright, beautiful young woman emerging from the south.  Certainly, talking about the whole role of her father and everything else.  And do you think that Tallulah Bankhead was such a live force that she could have survived at any time in any context? Seawell:  It would have been just as easy to have contained an atomic have bomb after you'd triggered it as to /kept Tallulah Bankhead from being a star.  The fact is that this probably worked to her detriment.  The Lunts said to me that Tallulah had the greatest natural acting ability of anyone they ever saw. But she never really used it.  She never had to.  She became more of a star than an actor, as compared to Lynn or to Alfred (there is some kind of interruption here) Joe Jaros:  I think that in the 1920s she was associated very much with the bright young things, the flappers, the role of. . . what we think of today                      .  And this in some ways went on.  Was. . . or do you page 24 think Miss Bankhead was ever conscious of being an example to women.  In other words, what I'm interested in is sort of her attitude about being a woman, being free.  Or was this just a part of the cult built up around her? Seawell:  No, Tallulah was a free soul, a free spirit.  I don't think she was trying to set an example for anyone.  She wasn't trying to start any cult.  She just did whatever she wanted to do when she wanted to do it.  Tallulah, of course, went nude long before it became fashionable. Genie suggested to someone that to get an audience we might put out a sign saying "Tallulah Streaked."  I said that Tallulah was the only one that I knew who could streak standing still.  (laughter)  She was just completely unique.  And not deliberately so.  She didn't do these things to shock anybody.  She just did what came naturally and an awful lot came naturally. Ballinger:  What do you think Tallulah represented to all the people from the 20s on who adored her so? What sort of symbol was she to them? Seawell:  I think that. . . I really shouldn't try to answer that because Genie will answer that in her performance today and I wouldn't want to steal her thunder     .  But she did have more instant adoration than perhaps anyone in the history of the theater.  Later on perhaps the Beattles had it. Ballinger:  I thought of that the other day. Seawell:  When she was in the theater in London it was strictly hysteria. Leslie Howard's book, if you've read it, described what it was like when he had as a star had a young actress like Tallulah Bankhead in the company. You'd walk out on the stage and nobody would even look.  Everyone's eyes where were glued to the spot /Tallulah came on.  The audience would start moaning and chanting "Tallulah, Tallulah, Tallulah," before she ever came on. She'd walk on and just stand there and the audience would stand and clap. page 25 She'd clear her throat and they would start cheering.  Then she'd let out that laugh of hers and everybody would go into hysterics.  And she still hadn't said a word.                                           that was what it was. Ballinger:  This was what you meant when you said she never used that great talent that she had to the fullest because she was playing to these people. Seawell:  Right she never had to develop as an actor.  She never worked at it the way the Lunts did.  Helen Hayes worked with it.  Kit Cornell. Because she had that quality, that fanatic devotion to fall back on. And sometimes it would even prevent her acting.  Now I saw her do Street car  NampH npgirp and it was the greatest performance I ever hope to see. Why? Because when she came on the stage she had this mad gang that had become devotees during the Big Show and they'd packed the house.  And when she walked on they started cheering and she cleared her throat and one  thought they were going to tear up the seats and all.  And she realized what she was up against.  She had to quiet them.  And she did.  She stripped her performance to the bone.  It was chillingher Blanche. . . B.B.:  Oh, no Tallulah. Seawell:  And even those hysterical kids realized what was going on and became quiet and listened for the first time since they'd entered the theater. B.B.:  Do you think that this ability to fall back on, you know, the devotion and to fall back on being Bankhead which would (laughter)                     in itself became more and more compromising to her as the theater changed? And certainly role demands were changed for her? Seawell:  The economics of the theater changed a lot of things.  Tallulah had the darnedest contract.  It called for 20% of the gross plus 25% of the profits.     I finally had to go to Tallulah and say "Look, honey, page 26 it you're going to get the roles that you want, you're going to have to compromise a bit because there's nothing left to pay off the production." And she listened, and she did. Ballinger: Mr Seawell there have been at least two other biographies of Tallulah in the past few years. We were talking about this yesterday. And I guess the Brendon Gill book has been the most recent.  But if it's not too presumptuous to ask, what do you think are the flaws in the way, for instance, the Israel biography treats Tallulah? Seawell:  The main thing that's wrong with the Israel biography is Lee Israel never knew Tallulah and never came close to understanding her. She was looking for something sensational.  She dwelt on the bawdy without understanding the rich, warm woman beneath it.  And as a result it wasn't Tallulah and therefore wasn't successful.  On the other hand there's a book, Tallulah, Darling of the Gods, by a fellow named Tunney.  I was quoted on one network and in some newspapers about that.  And I was quoted accurately.  I simply said that he might have had an affair with Tallulah at one time but he was never intimate with her.  (laughter) He blew up the small chance meeting    into something important and therefore had to invent a book, with again was not Tallulah.  On the other hand the Btendon Gill book is based upon all the material that was accummulated by Tallulah and by Eugenia during their lifetimes.  Tallulah used to call Eugenia the kin  keeper.  And she gave, or left to Genie, all of her records, memorabilia and so forth.  So that you did have an accurate presentation. And perhaps to some extent it was colored by Genie's obvious prejudices in favor of Tallulah.  But I don't think much, because Brendon Gill is an excellent writer, as you know from his New Yorker writings, too.  And I think that that is the only one which will emerge with any degree of accuracy or appreciation. page 27 B.B.:  In the whole problem of keeping and sorting memorabilianot only just with Miss Bankhead, but with, for example, the diversity of Miss Rawls' career or any person who is engaged in a variety of activities, who has spentwe were just talking about the theater, but television and just a constant development and growth.  Do any of that concern you? In other words, that someone ten years from now in going through the North Carolina Historical Collection when you all will have, probably have one of the more complete collections there, will come away with a distortion of Eugenia Rawls in terms of who she was or what she was doing.  That's the inbred problem of any collection or study, but when you're dealing with the theater you're dealing withits almost another        because its not like we can talk to the thousands of people who were in the hundreds of theaters at different points.  The moments were lost and certainly not to the people who were there, but I'm talking about an accountable record. Seawell:  Of course there's, there are going to be distortions with respect to trying to reconstruct the lives of anyone.  But I think there's more distortion where there's a lack of material than there is where there is materialeven though there are omissions.  I get that in the newspaper business,of course all the time. A lot of people complain about the total coverage of news.  And obviously it has created problems.  But I think in the long run, the understanding that it brings about is an effective force for peace and progress. But today, where there is instant knowledge of what's going on in any part of the world.  It can lead to campus disorders as it did a few years ago.  It can lead to a lot of things.  But, no. . . I'm still a believer in as total a knowledge as you can impart.  And that's the reason why the Denver Post today has the largest news hole of any afternoon paper in the world.  It has the third page 28 largest news coverage of any paper in the world, including morning papers. Just a percentage point or two ahead of the New York Times. B.B.: Which is not a bad percentage point to be ahead of someone. What do you think. . . being a little more specific in this, in terms of the actual filming of the play? I'm talking, for example, of Richard Burton's Hamlet that he did on the stage.  And do you think that that creates a distortion. For example, Tallulah Bankhead's Little Foxes and certainly Miss Rawls' portrayal in Little Foxes.  I mean, that's gone. Seawell:  I think that that should be done only for historical purposes. We're now considering exactly that problem on the National Panel and we're giving some experimental grants to various companies to film what happens on stage.  Now the reason I say it should be done for historical purposes is because it has limitations as entertainment.  Years ago, when I was working with the Royal Shakespeare Theater, we filmed, at Stratford-on- Avon, Mid Summer Night's Dream with Charles Laughton playing Bottom.  It was an awful productionas seen on the film.  There's something about sitting here in the theater, as we are, looking at thr prosceniumyou accept what's going on, you get caught up in it, you get lost in it and you forget the fact that you're looking over the head of 150 people be- proscenium tween here and the stage and that there is a    /    and outside of that the theater walls.  Somehow the mind accepts it and you're absorbed into the play.  But when you try to put that in a frame of a motion picture film then you lose that illusion and it becomes, it lacks the necessary dimension that you can get if you are filming for a film where you're using sets and you don't have to go through all that scenery. . . to some extent, of course, you can shoot from the sides here and get a greater illusion but you're still in a theater and you know it and you're losing what the page 29 living theater has to offer without gaining what film or television has to offer. B.B.:  And the magic of detachment that you get in the theater . . . the same way of seeing, you know, Hetta Gabber run around the stage.  It's not quite the same as seeing her run around an emormous apartment on film.  You lose a little of the frenzy. Ballinger:  I've felt very troubled that I've become interested in a lot of the great actresses about whom I haven't heard very much before I began working with your papers and I realized I'd never seen them do anything because everything I was reading about had happened before I was born.  And I wish to goodness that I could have seen Tallulah Bankhead in the Little Foxes.  But I'll never be able to because she won't ever do it again and it's not on film, is it? Seawell:  Genie has the only film clip of Little Foxes in existence.  This was done for the special ANTA benefits that we used to haveANTA album. And Genie and Tallulah and some other members of the original group came and did the last scene                                                               and Bill Langford who was Tallulah's beau at the time, simply shot it on 16 mm.  Genie has it.  And I think if you smile sweetly she'll include it in the collection. (laughter) B.B.:  I'm sure that                                      they'll all be smiling sweetly. I think that one of my favorite stories on that was Miss Bette Davis a few, two years ago on the Today Show was referring to a conversation she had with Miss Bankhead at a party where Miss Bankhead said "You've done some of my roles.  And you didn't do them as well as I did." And Bette Davis said "Yes, Miss Bankhead, you're right." And. .  . but she took the opportunity just to launch in to that to say that. . . again what you were talking about. . . a whole generation growing up will know who Bette page 30 Davis ispart of that whole film cult. And that same generation maycertainly Tallulah Bankhead is too much enigma they will not know who she is.  But in a real sense they won't.  I mean they won't have things to identify. . . Seawell:  There are very few performances that could catch it on film Jaros:                                    that was shown on the street this last week. I think that's perhaps the real                                          that people really know about Tallulah Bankhead.  And there were crowds lined up. Seawell:                                                 . They will be sending down the complete film. B.B.:  This was just through the student union.  They have a service that they can go through for films.  But the crowds were amazing and, you know, indicative that people knew that this was something to see and do. Jaros:  But that's the only real film of note, I think, that Tallulah Bankhead did.                                                                              .  But if we just did have the Little Foxes or something else captured. . . by The Skin of Our Teeth, or something. Seawell:  One of the fun things she did was Royal Scandal and we will be sending that down, toothe film clip. B.B.:  Do you find that in the whole problem of setting up regional theaters and, again, with this tension of the film and the theater, that, that you're having to talk a new lingo to people who haven't made that transition? Seawell:  Sure.  And this comes out not just in terms of audience support but in terms of the, raising the money.  They're just not used to it. They're not. . . they don't give.  And of course the business community has to take a bigger role in giving. B.B.:                         that whole mystique about the pragmatism of Americans. page 31 And the theater is, you know, THE THEATER.  And trying to break it through. . . . Do you all have to leave, because . . . we've enjoyed. . . Seawell:  The important thing is to get Genie, not me. (interruption:  Miss Rawls joins the group) B.B.: Miss Rawls, I wonder if you would just initially share with us some of your experiences involved in your childhood and your family that made the break from Eugenia Rawls in Georgia to the theater. Rawls:  Well, I always. . . I went on stage when I was five years old. There was no really question in my mind about what I was going to do.  I had, I was brought up by my grandmother and by two maiden auntsboth very beautiful ladies.  One of them had graduated from the American Academy in New York and the other from Emerson School of Oratory in Boston.  So that when they had a very small girl on their hands to bring up they started teaching me to recite and to breath.  And what happened of course was that I was getting the most fantastic possible training at the earliest possible age.  Which is what really, if you're lucky, you do in the theater.  I'm quite sure that's what Miss Lynn Fontanne thinks. She thinks if you're going to act, act.  But I think things have changed now so that it's of the utmost importance that education come along with everything else.  Because there are not the jobs available that there may have been in those days.  Of course some of the jobs didn't pay very much. But as a child then you just got out and worked if you were in the theater. Summertimes you belonged to a theatrical family and went around on tour with them.  As you know, many actors have come from them.  And that, I think, is wonderful.  But the last four or five years I've been artist in residence at different universitiesthe last three years, University of Northern Colorado in Greeleyand I see more and more how very important it is to get the schooling.  And besides, everybody is so well educated now, you know, and you need all the background you can get in the theater. page 32 And if there aren't acting jobs you better be able to turn your hand to something else.  So, while I think I'm very lucky in that I've grown up in the theater andthank God, touch woodworked in the theater all my life and hope to continue as long as I can get across the stage. . . See, there has always for me been one directional thingwork and the theater.  But I've learned so much in these last five years in working in universities.  And of course I was terribly fortunate indeed to get into the University of North Carolina.  I had no credits.  I didn't have any money.  But a friend had said "I think you should meet Professor Koch." So my aunt and I got in the car and we had friends along the way that we visited.  And they drove me over to Chapel Hill.  And just by sheer luck Prof happened to be here.  We walked in to this theater one summer afternoon and he just happened to be around.  And I said "I'm Eugenia Rawls and I've been recommended by" and I mentioned two or three people who had been to Carolina.  And I said "I would like to come here but I don't have any credits and I don't have any money." And he said "Well, I don't think that need bother us."  (laughter)  He said "You can come to Carolina." I still don't know how he arranged it or how it was put down on the books.                                 ... I found myself here as a special stu- dent.  He just, you know. . . B.B.:  A special student. Rawls:  A special student, whatever that entailed.  And I couldn't have been happier.  From the very first day of sitting in this theater and hear Prof talk, hearing him talk.  And then the first play I did was Paul Green's Fixin's, naturally, you know.  And then I did Return of Buck Gairn and thenthis is interesting I think because about three years ago the University of Denver asked me to play Look Homeward Angel.  And at first I thought, oh, do I want to play Eliza?  And then I started thinking and page 33 reading and I realized that she was not a great, tall god-woman.  She was a tiny woman, which I have an affinity for as I'm not terribly tall. southern And she had that same/quality that small women have, you know, that nothing was going to get them down.  So I thought, how marvelous, I'll go right back to all my Tom Wolfe.  And I read and read and when I did the play I was so happy doing it.  So you see I have Prof to thank for for all that background of playing Eliza.  And then the Paul Green plays I adored doing.  And then of course they were doing a great many experimental plays.  And we were toldyou know, everybody wrote a play.  And I know this sounds wild, but I must have done 300 experimental plays.  We were doing so many that once, when I walked on stage I had this gesture, with my hand out, and somebody off stage thought I was asking for a script.  (laughter)  I was furious, because I knew my lines.  It was a very happy and wonderful year for me, in many ways.  It brought me many good things, especially Donald Seawell.  And from CarolinaI didn't have any money then, either.  I think I had about $20.  So I hitched a ride to New York. Well, I couldn't come all the way to New York, but my auntie, my aunt said I could come as far as the farm in Maryland where they were living.  And Marion Tatum, who had a LOT of money, she had $40.  I've never forgotten that.  Imagine having $40.  And Bob Proctor had an old car with one side with the door off.  And we had to take turns, Marion and I, riding on the side that didn't have the door.  And we told Sam Selden , whom I adored and to me he was one of the greatest teachers in the world.  He taught me pure, unadulterated Stanislovsky without any airs.  Which I absorbed and, of course, used.  And it became a part of me without saying "Oh, I am being taught the method" or anything like that.  It was something perfectly natural.  But when we told Sam we were leaving to seek our fortune, he gave us some Chinese firecrackers and said "When you get on page 34 the outskirts of Chapel Hill,   set  these  off and they will bring you  good luck.     You won't  come back until you have a job.     So when we got outside of Chapel Hill we lit the firecrackers and then we headed for New York. And  they took me as far as Philadelphia, where I was met by an old beau stayed from Chapel Hill.     (laughter)     I      /     with his  family for  a while and then I went with my aunt to Maryland.     And  I didn't have any money,   again, but auntie said "Well,  you just have to write letters  to people telling them you're very good."    So I wrote a  lot of letters  to a lot of people, Clare Tree and I got an answer from         /       Major.     Now the reason that I wrote to her was that a group of  traveling players had  come  to  Carolina and put on a show and  I'd gone back stage  and said "I want  to get  to New York" and one of  the  actresses had said "Well,   I  think you  look very,  very young,  and you're very small and you could play all  the  children's parts Clare Tree for         /        Major."    And she gave me her address.     So I wrote Mrs.  Major and one hot dusty afternoon,  walking down the road in Maryland,   to  the post box at the end of the road.     I opened it and there was a letter Clare Tree from         /        Major saying "Dear Miss Rawls,   if you are as good as you think you are,  you may  come  to  see me.     Be in  Chappaqua, New York,   on" such and  such a date.     Well  Chappaqua, New York.     Now where is  that?    We found  out on a map  that it was  outside of New York City.     And  auntie  said, "Well,   I  can scrap up  the railroad fare  to New York,   Eugenia.     And you write Mrs Major when you'll be there and we'll find out and you'll have to get a train up there and we'll work it out."    So  they packed my lunch for metunafish sandwichesand I got  on  the train in eastern Maryland at dawn and  I rode  to New York.     Well I was so excited to  seeyou know,   looking out  the  train window.     And when I got to Pennsylvania Station I didn't know what to do.     So I went  to  a traveller's  aid     lady and  I said  "Is  it safe  to cross  the city alone  in a taxi-cab?"    And she said "Yes,   I think page 35 so." Because I have to get to Grand Central.  And I got to Grand Central. I couldn't really believe New York existed.  You know, there were people, walking on streets.  And I got to Chappaqua and I looked out the window and there was this rather forbiddng, formidable lady standing there and I got up and I saidhere I am, right from the farm in Maryland, you know, with my sandwiches.  And she said "Miss Rawls?" And I said "Yes." And Clare Tree she said "I'm    /  Major." "How do you do." She said "Come along, come along." We got in the car and we went to her house and went in the living room there. And she really was rather frightening.  She was very imposing.  And she said "All right, Miss Rawls, read for me." So I thought, all right.  I thought, I'll take the last thing first.  I'd just played Hermia here in Mid Summer Night's Dream.  So I began with Hernia.  Then I went backwards in time.  I did everything I could think of for about an hour.  And at the end of that time she called her daughter in the next room.  She said "Dorothy, Miss Rawls will be a part of our company." Where upon I fainted, dead away.  Right in the middle of the floor.  I'd had nothing to eat since six o'clock that morning.  It was now 4:30 in the afternoon.  So they picked me up off the floor. And the old girl, in Spite of her exterior I guess was pretty kind.  She said "Where do you plan to spend the evening?" "I really don't know.  Well, I could go back to New York." Knowingwhat would I do when I got there. She said "No, you will stay here." So they fed me.  They took me down and walked me down to the scene shop.  One of the actors, an actor named Jeff Morrow who was in the company, a very nice man.  He showed me the scene shop.  And then Mrs Major told me the part she thought I would play. She said I would play Rip Van Winkle's daughter and then I would play, in a play called Curdle,the Princess and the Goblin, and possibly some Shakespeare.  I woke up the next morning and she had this English bulldog page 3g and the door to my room was open and the English bulldog had pulled out my tunafish sandwiches (laughter) then eaten them, you see. So I grabbed those away                         and I went back. And I got back to the farm. Actually another Carolina Player helped me out because when I got to New York I rang up the Bissell family and Whit Bissell and Brad Bissell had been students here. And they said "You can't go back tonight. You have to see something of New York. You'll stay with us. And Dr Duggel Bissell, a very eminent physician. So I had that night with them. The next dayyou realize that auntie in Maryland didn't B.B.: Didn't know anything. Rawls: had no idea where I was. Well, I got back to Maryland and I got a message through a farmer to go and tell them. And they met the train, auntie and my uncle, who was an old,retired sea captain and rather brusque. I got off the train; he looked at me and said "Well, Gene, you get the job?" And I said "Yes, I did." So that was mymind you, I had no contract, no nothing. Mrs Majors said I would get $25 a week. Can you imagine being paid to act? When you should have been in school? You know. 1 thought, you know, heaven knows nothing greater for me than this. Seawell: How much did you save? Rawls: Well, wait a minute. So, summer went on. And one thing. I had the most marvelous teacher here in Chapel Hill. Phoebe Barr , who Deni-Shawn began the dance here in Chapel Hill. She had been a  / dancer. And Phoebe had said "Your body is the most important instrument you have. You must work, work work. You must never stop exercising. Dance, exercise." So all the rest of that summer in Marylandthe captain said "Oh, there's Gene, bumping her bottom again." (Laughter) I would roll and I would exercise. You know, I was going to get in good shape. page 37 Then September came around. I had no contract still. But I got a post card saying report for rehearsals in New York. So again the Playmakers. Elizabeth Farrar, here in Chapel Hill, told me about the rehearsal club. So I wrote and I got a room there for $11.50 a week. So I was set. And that's how I got to New York, (laughter) You see Carolina helped, all along the way, and it's going to continue to help. Just recently I got a call from Howard Richardson, who said "You know, we're going to do Dark of the Moon. How do you feel about Dark of the Moon?" I said " you bet." Playmakers to the fore again. That's the saga of why, you know, it's theater all my life. Ballinger: Miss Rawls, was it a good deal more difficult than it would have been otherwise, to break into things in New York, because of the depression? Rawls: I never thought of the depression. That thought never occured to me. I never thought about it. All I knew was that I had to get a job. And work. You know what I mean? I don't think anything else entered my mind. And I never felt underprivileged or anything like that. I thought I was the most fortunate person in the world. And I always have felt that way. Because, jobs vary in the theater, god knows there can be mean stretches. That's why you've got to do anything and everything. And that's why regional theater and university theater is of the utmost importance. We must tie it up, you know, and we must make companies, acting       , where people can work year round. To me, my idea of heaven is to know that I'm going to be doing so many plays, straight ahead for so many years. I can't think of anything more wonderful or more progressing or progressive for an actor. To know you're going to continue to work. I was just telling Chris and Tommy that in the last three years at the University of Northern Colorado, I've played Mother Courage page 38 The Show-Off. Family Portrait. Glass Menagerie. Butterflies are Free and Lion in Winter. And I don't know any actress in New York who's had those parts. Now mind, you must play New York and you must go to New York and you must work there. But it doesn't have to be the end all and be all. And thank god for Kennedy Center and the other theater centers. I think, ideally, I would like to play six weeks in New York, six weeks in Kennedy, six weeks in Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco. And makethat way, you know, and make your year. And that way you don't become provincial, which you can become if you just stay in New York. You forget the rest of the world. That's changed now. Theater's changing. And all to the good, I think. And I'm so impressed with the regional companies and with the repertoryI was with Stuart Vaughan in repertory in New Orleans and that a wonderful experience becauseIt wasn't easy, because to go to New Orleans and just establish ourselves as a professional company. Because they had a local company, Petit something, and they said why did they need professional repertory, you know. We had to . And now the success. I'd worked for Paul Weidner, a brilliant young director who has the Hartford Stage Company. And Paul has worked quietly there now for three years and he's just now gotten recognition for the suberb work he's done on A Touch of the Poet. Adrian Hall in Providence, at the Trinity Playhouse. You see, there are so many good people around America, it's so exciting. Jaros: This is sort of backtracking, back to when you went to New York in the 30s. Could you give us some sense of what it was like, being a southerner. Did you ever feeling of being a southerner? Rawls: Oh, no. . . Jaros: Or maybe as a woman. Rawls: No. I always considered I was acting, (laughter) You see, I page 39 have a one track mind. No, I think it might be funny. With Mrs Majors-her standards of speech were extremely high. And the first day of rehearsal, when we were rehearsing Rip Van Winkle I guess it was and Curdle we rehearsed them both simultaneously. Suddenly, in the middle of rehearsal, she said "Miss Rawls, lose that southern accent before tomorrow'.' I thought, oh, what do I do? There was a marvelous old character man in the company and a marvelous actress, character actress named Viola Roach hit very distinguished woman, had/been in many/plays and at that time was Clare Tree glad to be working for  /   Major because. . . you know. And Vi and this man, the old boy, they took me home with them that afternoon and they said "Now, it's very simple. The first thing you must do is listen to us. And the next thing is, there's certain things you must eliminate immediately. As a southerner you say any, you say many, you say call and ball and all. All right, now you start saying call [cawl], hall, ball. You say any, many." You know, for about four hours that afternoon . Gulp, gulp, gulp. But it worked. And I was so fortunate to B.B.: Rawls: So much so that when I went into the Ljttle Foxes, Mr Shumlin said "I think you could be a little more southern." (laughter) So when we got to Montgomeryit was very funnyon tour, suddenly Tallulah said "I know, Eugenia, I know they told us not to play it too southern." "But," she said, "honey, we are in home territory and I think we better do something." Nobody on the stage could understand a word we were saying. (laughter) You know, it's funny, but southern speech and English speech have a great deal in common. We have no r's to begin with, which is the evers and rivers, and things. I don't think English people can do as good a southern accent as we can do an English, (laughter) I must say I saw the musical of Qone with the Wind in London and Horton Foote, page 40 who had done the adaptation had worked with them. He'd done a very good southern in job, Horton, being southern, was very clever getting a /  . And apparently Ed Sherer and Edward Cherney who had gotten just rave reviews for his direction of Streetcar. And now Claire Bloom is playing Blanche, so someone must have worked, you know, with her on that. Of course, Jessica Tandy played it first in New Yorkan English person. Ballinger: Talking about the south, I've observed in just looking through the papers that you've given us so far that the 30s and 40s seem to have produced a number of plays about the south. Rawls: Some of the greatest. To me the Glass Menagerie will always be Tennessee's greatest play. I think Streetcar is next. But to me Menagerie is something so special, every time I play it I get shivers down my spine. I've played it now for five years and I hope to play it the rest of my life. Well of course, now, I record talking books. I've sent everyone of my books, talking books, here to the library including letters from most all the authors and people who have heard them. I've Flannery recorded all of  /  0'Conner, all of Eudora Welty, Ellen Douglass, and it is an absolute joy. Now this last year I did Eudora Welty's Optimist's Daughter and Losing Battles, both of those, and had the most glorious thing from herwhich I've given to Carolina and I want to take back because I love it so. She sent me a very rare book of hers of photographs that she took with a Brownie camera during the 30s. In it she has written an inscription to me on the front of the book. And this is something I couldn't prize more highly. We are such a complex civilization in the south that I think something has to come out. I think the writers that emerge from it. Now Lillian Hellmanyou know in doing both The Children's Hour and The Little Foxes I never realized the extent to which Lillian Hellman was southern, untilI mean, after all these page 41 years, and I played 691 performances of Children's Hour and over a thousand of Little Foxes. Not until I read Lillian Hellman's first book, An Unfinished Woman , and I'd just finished recording Pentimento. did I realize how deeply southern Lillian was. In all of her stems from her family and so much of what the Bankheads were in the 1900s. And Lillian Hellman, of course, to me is one of the most extraordinary writers. dialog Her  /  is something. You don't change a comma. You know, it is polished. She writes all the off stage dialogue, too.      given everything that was said off stage in the breakfast room scene. Off stage she wrote  . the lines that Tallulah said before she came on stage as if she had just descended from the carriage. All those lines are written. Lillian Hellman gave them to us. B.B.: Incredible. Ballinger: Do you think there was a particular reason that these plays came out in the late 3s and 40s. Rawls: Well I think they'd been churning around for a long time. Now, Flannery        Milledgeville look at   /  0'Conner.    /   Georgia. You know, Carson McCullers. Its just so much happening in the south and we are not people who hide our emotions. They've got to come out some way or another. One of my greatest friends and a womanthe next program I'm going to doI'm going to do two new programs. This one is Lillian Smith, who is one of the greatest people this country has ever produced. And I spoke for her the last ten years of her life when she was ill and couldn't make her speeches. I was privileged to give them. This woman changed the history of the south. This tiny, little southern woman B.B.: Talking about the power of the word. Rawls: continuing to live in the south, mind you. Not living in the north and saying it. But living in the south. Now Tallulah was a very page 42 early person to speak up. I have a tape of hers which is so marvelous because in the beginning of the sit-ins in Montgomery she was interviewed. Now it was not easy for a southern, in the south, to be interviewed about the south. And she said "I'm deeply concerned. I'm praying with all my heart that they will be given proper schools, proper jobs. To liveand the right to live not as second class citizens but first class citizens. Because otherwise it is not democracy." That's Tallulah Bankhead speaking. You see Seawell: Which is, of course, easy to say and everyone thinks today (general talking) Rawls:. . . and Tallulah loved the tradition of the south. I just happened on this little piece of tape the other day. I was pleased when I found it. And you'll hear more tonight, something about the south. If you're coming tonight. B.B.: You better believe it. Rawls: ... of the theater, too. Robert Downing said that to him he thought that was one of the most important        of history of theater. Jaros: Well, along this same line, you did Strange Fruit. Rawls: Yep, I played Harriet Harris, which was Lillian, really. Jaros: What about that as a controversial play? Rawls: At the time it was quite remarkable. We felt that we were pioneers because it was the first B.B.: You were Rawls:       integrated company. I know this sounds a bit old-fashioned now in a way. We've come so far. The furor that Strange Fruit created when it was published in 1944. Little Miss Lillian Smith, whose family, you know they were pillars of the Methodist church, and page 43 they said "                                                                                    ." (laughter) And Lil, who was, oh, the most extraordinary womanI wanted to do that part and I knew Joe      was doing the play. So I wrote Joe and I said "I have to play Harriet Harris." You know, there's no nonsense about it. And he said "Well, you come and meet Lillian Smith." And I walked into the office there where he was sitting and there was this little, you know, tiny woman with lovely white hair, gentle face. And Joe introduced us, said "This is Eugenia Rawls, Miss Lillian Smith." And I read and a little silence and then Lillian said "Well, we have found our Harriet Harris." (laughter) And from then on. . . well, we went onwe made the trip to Montreal, to open in Montreal. All of us, it was a huge company. And it was the first time in history, almost, a company traveling together, working for something. We had a run through Montreal in a bare hall. It was one of the most exciting things. And then the troubles began. Too many scenes. Too many scene changes. Fifteen sets. Scenery, a turn table. The play began to slow down. We ran 4% hours opening night. And I could just I began to worry then because it was over produced, really. Joe had put it on on a bare stage, almost, with just (interrupted by interjection from B.B.)       and Lill didn't want to cut, you know. And at that time, when we opened in New York, another play, Deep Are the Roots, opened, which was written by Arnold Duseau, who did not know the south. He had no idea of what Lillian had, but it was slick, it was quick, it ran fast and it had melodrama. And it got the reviews, which crushed Lillian. I just can't tell you what it did to her, to have her play but our play they said was too long, too talky. And it was. It needed cutting desperately. But it was a great company, great experience. As a company, we felt so warm. We felt, you know, we are a band of brothers. B.B.: But talking about the company, again it sounds strange to be page 44 articulating problems like this today, but what was it like traveling on the road? Rawls:                                Strange Fruit, because we went to Montreal. See we went to Canada, didn't have any problem. Then we went to, from Montreal to Boston. And that was somehow all right, too. And then closed up in New York. So that wasn't really like a tour. tell you more tonight about going through the south in Foxes. But I can remember Abbie Mitchell being, in Boston. Abbie had been, oh, she'd sung with the opera in Russia. She was the first, she sang "Summertime and the Living is Easy." She created that song. It was Serina in Porgy. And I remember, Abbie was rather light colored, you know. And she said "I could do with a little assistance from you." I said "What do you want, Abbie?" She said "Honey, we are going into the hotel Belleview and you are going topass me." (laughter) And we did. Walked into the desk and we registered together. But imagine having to do that, in 1940. But we did. So. . . now, theater today. Well, pretty much what we've covered. Just thank goodness for the excitement of university theater which is no longer a secluded little world of its own. It's reached out now. This is marvelous, I think. And people coming in. I've found that the people, the students that I've worked with have all said this, and I'm very glad. They said "What we learn from you is what a working actress teaches us. (end of tape)
