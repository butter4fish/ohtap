Story_ID: 86700
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go into depth, there are five "People-Magazine"-ish type questions we always ask.  They are lightweight questions and they just require a short answer basically.  The first one is, Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, being from New Orleans, Louisiana, as you know there is such a variety down there would certainly be red beans and rice, yeah, and you can throw in a little gumbo along there, but my favorite food is red beans and rice.
Speaker 1: Aright, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Brown, yeah, I love brown.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say spring.  Spring time is my favorite time of the year because it is not too hot and not too cold.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, my children tell me that I'm still trying to grow up.  I love Disneyworld.  (Laughter), I love going to Disneyworld.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one that I coined some years ago, that had to do with principals.  I usually say "that you may advocate your principles and you may give them away, but nobody can take them away from you."
Story_ID: 86701
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Let me ask you about what you, about your family.  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Certainly to my grandmother, I know of my great grandmother, but my grandmother would certainly be the start-off point.  My grandfather was deceased at that time but that's as far back as I would go.
Speaker 1: Now you have a photo of your great grandmother, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you know much about her?
Speaker 2: Not that much about her other than she was my great grandmother, and I have a photo of her but I never had an opportunity to really spend any time with her.
Speaker 1: Now was she from New Orleans [Louisiana] too?
Speaker 2: No, no she was from a little place called Burnside, Louisiana which is, oh, maybe - oh, it's close to Burnside, it's close to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, maybe about thirty or forty miles from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as far as you know your family is from around Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, the family is from Louisiana.  My father's side, his whole family comes out of New Orleans and they were -- I mean that's where everybody came from on his side, and my mother's side came out of Burnside, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories that have passed down through the family about what life was like back during the days of slavery or right after the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, like I say my mother lived to be 92 years old and we talked about a lot of things.  Growing up in Burnside and being in a rural area, it wasn't too much coming out other than we know about segregation in Louisiana.  My daddy was an activist.
Story_ID: 86702
Speaker 1: He [his father, Sidney Johnson] was very active.  He was a businessman and I can tell a story about -- on Magazine Street which was a predominately rich white neighborhood.  He was in the cleaning business, and he and his brother and a white fellow were in business together and the people in the area thought that they worked at the cleaners, and when they found out that they owned the cleaners along with this white fellow, and this is way back in the 1930s you know, and they burned it out.  So, that's one that stands in my memory.  My mother and my father used to tell more stories than my mother would in reference to what life went on.  That's why I am saying -- that's why he was such activist.  He was -- he taught people how to vote in our living room which wasn't very popular back in the '40s [1940s] before the Blacks were given the opportunity to vote.  He was a member of, you know, NAACP, Elks and all the organizations and I remember one time before he owned his own business, he had to -- he went on strike.  He led a strike at this big cleaners and it was really funny.  They took everybody back but they fired him because he was the leader, but it didn't bother him.  He went on and did his thing, and --.
Speaker 2: Tell me what was his full name and what's his date of birth?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sidney, S-I-D-N-E-Y, T. Johnson, and I'm going to get that right 1907, they got that exact date.
Speaker 2: He was born in New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was born in New Orleans.  Yeah--.
Speaker 2: Well, continue to tell us about it, but you know, kinda -- can you talk about his early life too and how he--?
Speaker 1: Well, not really.  His early life, that, you know, he grew up, my daddy he went to the sixth grade, but he had this disability.  He was a very, very smart man.  Very bright man and I always said that maybe I am what my father could have been if he had had the opportunity, and you know he was always -- he always had those wheels spinning trying to do something -- he was very concerned about his people.  He was concerned about what went on in America, and it wasn't very popular during the time when he came along, but his father was also a very, you know, active -- what they tell me.  I never met my grandfather, but that's the type of person he was. He was just -- he was always involved in something, always very civic minded and he believed that this whole thing about the entrepreneurial -- being an entrepreneur and, I know on many occasions like I said, he probably could have done much better, but the times that he came along, those were very difficult times.  I'll tell you another story about him, and you have to appreciate the times -- you're too young and I was too young at that time.  He said that one time he was driving in New Orleans and a white guy ran behind him and hit him -- his car from behind and so they got out and here come the police and the guy said -- the white guy said, "Well, this gentleman had his hand" -- they didn't have signals at the time -- "he had his hand out the window and officer, I ran behind him, and the police officer walked to my daddy's car and rolled up the window and said it's no way in the world this boy could have had his hand out the window" and he gave my daddy the ticket instead of the other guy.  So, those are the kinds of things that I think fuel the energy in people to want to do some things about some of the things that went on during that period of time.  It was a very -- New Orleans was a very tough place like every other city for Blacks in America at that time, but he was always able -- he was a survivor.  He knew how to survive, he had survivor skills.  Didn't have the formal education, but I'd put him up against any PhD that I may have come in contact with in this country.
Story_ID: 86703
Speaker 1: Okay, now you mentioned your grandfather was an activist too and were either one of them a member of an organization?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, like I said my dad was a member of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and of course, his biggest thing in New Orleans is the Elks Club.  They did a lot of things in -- and he was a member of the Progressive Voters League.  That's how he was teaching people, you know, how to work the voting machines, right in our front room, you know.  We didn't have a big house, but people were -
Speaker 1: That Progressive Voter League, okay.  Now was that a part of anything else or--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just a part of a league that they had in New Orleans.  That -- it was designed to teach people how to vote.  I mean instead of going to the polls ignorant.  Well a lot of people didn't have the ability, you know they could go and vote and didn't know who they were voting for.  But so, they would try to teach them.  They would take the ballots and show them the ballot and things of that nature.  Then they would get out to register people to vote and they were active candidates.  So he was very active in that way.
Speaker 1: Alright, now, what did he do for a living basically other than he worked in a dry cleaners -- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah he had his own cleaners and then when they burned that one down he worked at another dry -- then he had another cleaners that he opened -- he and a friend of his and he also had a security service that there in New Orleans and he basically, you know, he was supervisor of it.  It was called "Johnson Security Service" and you know, in a City like New Orleans people are looking for security officers and -- but he was always doing something in the business sector, but his love was that cleaning.  He loved that cleaning business, and he was good at it too.  He was very good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what side of town did he -- was he raised on in New Orleans?  What part of New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Well he would be considered the Uptown section.  That's where he grew up.  We grew up in the section called probably the Mid-City -- the Mid City section.  That's where we grew up.  Course we lived a couple of places in New Orleans, but he grew up in the Uptown Section of New Orleans, up around Valence Street, Soniat Street that's the particular area.
Story_ID: 86704
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, what about your mother?  What was her full name, and how do you spell it and when and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's name was Lillie.  L-I-L-L-I-E, M-I-C-K-E-N-S, Mickens, her maiden name, and of course Johnson was, you know, her marriage name.  Of course, my mom grew up like I said in Burnside, Louisiana and then her parents moved to New Orleans and that's where she met my dad, and I think mom must be around 1907 somewhere in that range too.  She died when she was 92 years old, and what she did -- mom was basically a housewife and in her later years she did -- what do you call that?  She worked as a maid at one of the richer homes in New Orleans, but basically that's what she did and very -- she's a very avid churchgoer.  She loves her church, even in her final days- one question she would always ask us "did you guys pay my church dues?"  (Laughter) you know, but she was very active.  She sung in a choir.  She was a member of the Eastern Stars and so in her own way, you know, she was very active too.  She was a very active person within the City, and voting -- wouldn't miss -- wouldn't miss voting and you know, campaigning for people.  Her favorite person was Dutch Morial.  He made the first Black Mayor in New Orleans.  That was her pride and joy when Dutch became the Mayor, but she was very active too in her own way and she did it through the churches and as well as several organizations that she was involved with.
Story_ID: 86705
Speaker 1: Okay, okay well tell us about growing up in -- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: In, the city?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up, you know in New Orleans [Louisiana].  That's home for me and I went to Lafone, L-A-F-O-N-E, Lafone Elementary School, and I became interested in athletics during that period of time, and started elementary and participated in baseball and football and all other things, and always a halfway decent student, but I enjoyed and really enjoyed athletics, and so I grew up and went to Booker T. Washington High School.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you that far, but I want to let -- I want you to tell us about the neighborhood.  What was the neighborhood like?  Who lived there--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know really --.
Speaker 1: What did it look like, what did it smell like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, really, you know New Orleans being a segregated city; it was kind of interesting where we lived in New Orleans.  We lived on Talladama (ph) Street, and it was kind of interesting because right in the middle of Talladama street, was a neutral ground, and I don't know if you know what a "neutral ground" is.  Well that's a strip where you've got grass and you don't play ball on it and what have you, and we lived on one side and whites lived on the other side, and you know you're talking about way back, and we played ball together on the neutral ground (laughter), but they lived across the street and we lived on the other side of the street and families didn't mingle, I mean, but, you know, I'm talking, you know, back there in you know the 1930s and the 1940s, and -- but it was -- it was an interesting City.  New Orleans was a very interesting City because you've got, you know different types of individuals down there.  You know you've got the Creole section which was Downtown, and you've got Uptown and you've got what we call "Backa Town" (ph) and you had different turfs, you know if you lived Uptown you gotta be careful about going Downtown, and if you lived Downtown you gotta be careful about coming Uptown, and -- and it wasn't like they have today gangs, but it's just that people recognized different turfs and -- and we got along together pretty well, but New Orleans was a very interesting City growing up.  We never really wanted for anything, we were not rich, but we always had everything accessible to us, you know as a family, and it was very good growing up, you know with a father in the house -- father and mother and having a family.  I had a brother and a sister.  It was three of us in the family -- but I was the youngest.  I was the baby so they had to protect me (laughter), but that basically -- that's -- it was a pretty good life growing up in New Orleans with my family.
Story_ID: 86706
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  What were the kinds of things that you liked to do other than play -- you liked to play ball I know but--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I participated in ball; of course I loved to read.  I always did love to read.  Tried to keep me some type of a job, always wanted to have money in my pocket to do some things and didn't want to burden my parents with a lot of things, and I remember graduating -- when I got ready to graduate from high school -- I worked on a riverfront and saved all my money that summer to make sure that I had, you know, my class ring and a suit for graduation, a tuxedo for the prom, things of that nature but I worked in the afternoon at a drug store, and we call them a drug store.  It's a pharmacy now, it's a little fancier now, but I use to deliver drugs to people in the neighborhood.  When I say drugs I don't people to think I was a drug pusher, but from the pharmacy people would call in and then you know, on my bicycle I would stay in the afternoon until about 10:00 at night and just deliver.  Had paper routes, early morning paper route, had an afternoon paper route and worked on the riverfront sweeping the wharf, sewing sacks, carried ice.  In those days, you know, you didn't have refrigerators like we know of them now, but I was always trying to do something, delivered furniture at a furniture store, but I was always trying to do something to make me a few dollars, you know, and because I just wanted to be independent like that, and I thought that was important.
Story_ID: 86707
Speaker 1: Okay, now you went to Laflamn (ph.)?
Speaker 2: Lafone, yeah, L-A-F-O-N, yeah.
Speaker 1: Elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, yeah?
Speaker 1: This is a -- this is an all black school right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Every school that I went to all the way through undergraduate were Black.  We were black college bound, you know Black, went to Grambling College and went to Booker T. Washington -- black and I went to Lafone Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Lafone -- well tell us about it.  What was--?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Sound in background).  Excuse me one second what is that sound?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a segregated elementary school.  We received second-hand books after the white students read the books and used the books, they sent over to us.  I guess the mistake that was made was that they sent the books over and we learned how to read, and I don't understand how kids can't read now.  I'm always befuddled by that because we had second-hand books and everybody learned how to read.  There were very few people that, man that in my classes that, you know, couldn't read and that's why it's so shocking today with the libraries and we didn't -- you know we didn't have any libraries.  The public libraries -- we couldn't even go to a public library, but we had people who were dedicated and they wanted to make sure that we survived and they taught us, didn't make any money like they paying now, but these were good -- they were good people, I mean and they taught, they taught.  I remember at Lafone Elementary School there was a lady named Mrs. Bates, and we had to all go and read in front of the class.  That was the old-school way of teaching, and if you would talk while someone was reading, Mrs. Bates could throw a book better than Doug Williams could throw a football, and she could hit you right in the head with that book, and in those days, you know the last thing that you wanted was for a teacher have your parents to come because you know, that's a double dip there, you know, not only did she have the authority to put it on you, but your parents would put it on you when they came, but--.
Speaker 2: So you mean she'd throw a book at you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she'd throw a book.  She is a big lady too, big fat lady.  She wouldn't move around, she would sit at that desk.  Good teacher, but you didn't, (laughter) if you talked in Mrs. Bates class while someone was reading you were in trouble, a lot of trouble, (unclear) I remember Mrs. Sykes who was also a very strong disciplinarian, and you know, several other people -- Mr. Green who was a principal.  They were good people, it was a good school and very dedicated people and they took a lot of time and a lot of interest, and if you showed any promise, you know, they would go even beyond the call of duty to make sure that you would be placed in the tract so that you could move on much higher later on.  So it was a good school, didn't have everything like some of the other schools, but yet, you know, we didn't know we were poor.  We didn't know.  We took what we had and we made the very best of that -- and those are the most vivid memories that I have of growing up in that elementary school, but there were people who really cared about us and they were willing to share their time so that we would be successful in life.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright what were you favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 1: I love history, cause I love reading.  That was -- and civics was another subject, matter-of-fact I eventually ended up teaching civics in high school in Shreveport, Louisiana and world history, but those were -- I'm -- I'm always fascinated by history and what has happened in history and how certain people have been able to come to power and do certain things and why these things happen.  So that was always my -- my favorite area, that history.
Story_ID: 86708
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me about high school.  You went to Booker T. Washington [High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington, yeah.  You know interesting enough for the first year I went to Walter L. Coyne.  That was a -- a formerly all-white high school and they gave it to Blacks, and I went there for the first year, and you know, very uneventful.  I was a student.  I did well and what have you.  I didn't participate in athletics or anything like that, and then the next year I went to Booker T. Washington High School, and that's where I got interested, you know, in athletics.  I guess you grow and people notice that you can do certain things and the coach said "why don't you come out"-- but prior to that time we use to play baseball in New Orleans in the summertime in that little league thing so that made you -- but Booker T. Washington was a very interesting school.  We -- we always talk about it.  As a matter-of-fact we are having our 50th reunion on May 18th, 19th and 20th down in New Orleans, and I am going to be going back for that.
Speaker 1: 50th reunion (unclear)?
Speaker 2: 50th reunion, high school reunion.
Speaker 1: What year now?
Speaker 2: 1953.
Speaker 1: Oh, 1953, thanks okay, so it's coming right up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  I don't know how many of left, but (laughter) you know that's a long time and so, but I have very good memories of Booker T. Washington, and -- and I think the person that may be responsible for me even being in administration now would be the principal down there, Mr. Lawrence D. Crocker, C-R-O-C-K-E-R.  We called him the "little man", and man, he ran a tight ship.  He ran a good school and you know, he was -- give you a classic example.  We had to wear a necktie to school every day.  You didn't get into Booker T. Washington High School without a necktie, and he felt very strongly that he was not only teaching us how to survive, but he was teaching us for life how we need to look and how we need to be prepared when we left there, and he was a tough disciplinarian.  He was very strong, and a little guy.  He must have been about 5'2" - 5'3" but, you know, he was tough -- he was tough and -- but he was fair.  He had an interest in us and he made sure that we at Booker T. Washington had all of the best of everything that any other school would have, black or white in that City, and he fought for that and I gained a lot of respect by watching him -- for him, by watching him.
Speaker 1: Okay, did any other teachers make that big impact on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there -- one lady Mrs. Dobson, she was really very, very interesting and she was tough on men, she was death on young boys, you know, from the standpoint of wanting to make them do and she was -- I think that that's where this history thing, as far as I am concerned happened for me to really get into it.  You had to -- you had to recite the Gettysburg Address and Patrick Henry Address before you got out of her course in history (laughter), and everybody, every man dropped out, of course, but myself and another guy, Warren Baxter.  Now, Warren went on to the University of San Francisco and he played with Bill Russell.  He was on the basketball team and played on those great teams out there, but he was a good student too, and -- but she was, I mean she was a taskmaster, you know, but -- but, you learned discipline from people like that.  You learn that there are certain things that you gotta do and you do them and that's what happened with Mrs. Dobson.  She a task -- I remember her very, very well.  I remember another person -- well, of course, my high school coach, Charles Flint Perkins.  I thought that probably he was one of the smartest coaches that ever lived, and some of the things that he was doing now, it's really ironic when I watch games on television and I hear them talking about "transitional basketball".  He was using those terms and doing that way back then.  Very bright young man; he was a young guy too, so I remember him and he is the one that, he was so proud when I got a basketball scholarship to Grambling that, you know, he got it, he brought it, he wanted me to know that I had my scholarship.  So, Charles Flint Perkins was the person, you know that, that I was very, very proud of.
Story_ID: 86709
Speaker 1: --just talked about your coach, and --.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Now, you played basketball and football (unclear) baseball?
Speaker 2: I played basketball and football--.
Speaker 1: Football?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I played baseball but I got away from baseball when I got to high school.  That was more, you know, in the summertime league, things of that nature, but this -- couldn't spend that much time.  We had to do some other things too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you a pretty good basketball player when you played?
Speaker 2: Well, Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] thought so.  They gave me a scholarship, you know.  That's how I got through college.  I had a scholarship, four-year scholarship, and had a -- I thought had a successful career at Grambling.  I don't think we won less than twenty games per year the four years that I was there, and I was the Captain of the team in 1957 in my last year, and -- but, yeah, I enjoyed basketball.  I enjoyed basketball and it was very good to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't good enough to go to pros, but, hey (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they weren't taking players from the Black colleges then, you know, I mean to tell the truth.
Speaker 2: The first guy that was on my team that went was Bob Hopkins.  I don't know if you ever heard of Bob.  He played with Syracuse and then --.
Speaker 1: Syracuse Nationals.
Speaker 2: Nationals, yeah and then after Bob, I think Willis Reed was the next person that came on and then we had Larry Wright, Aaron James, Jimmy Jones and -- so those were the guys that kind of followed behind with -- you're right in 1957 -- and then when he -- when Bob was drafted he wasn't making any money, and he wasn't drafted high.  You know, we had Tank Young, who was the first Black player from a Black college to go to pros, and so we've had a lot of -- coming from Grambling, we've had a lot of history makers, guys who've done very well,--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 86710
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, back in high school did you have a -- when you were a senior in high school, did you have an idea of what you wanted to do or where you were going to college at that time or did you know -- what, what -- what (unclear)
Speaker 2: No, not really.  At that particular time I knew that I was a pretty good basketball player and several schools had contacted me about coming, and certain to say and I developed an interest.  Now, go back to Mrs. Dobson in high school, one of the things that she did with me is that she sent me to Bayou Boys State and that was at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and there you learn about government, all of government, you know.  You would have -- well you would have a governor and a lieutenant governor, a secretary of state and what have --.  It was a whole political thing that you learn about and I think that is when I really developed an interest and really wanted to go to college.  See, I was the first person in my family to go to college at that particular time.  We've had nieces and nephews, and all my children have gone to college, but I developed, through the inspiration of Mrs. Dobson this thing of wanting to go to college, of wanting to be able to -- well, we spent a week on a college campus at Southern University, and I just fell in love with it so coming back and going to -- that was my junior year, going on my senior year, so you know, I had this desire to want to go to college and in the process my skills developed that several coaches -- several colleges were interested in what I was doing -- Southern University, Xavier [University], Dillard [University], Savannah State [University], and -- I wanted to go to Grambling [State University] though, I kind of -- it was in a rural area and it appeared to be a closeness up there, and that's why I went to Grambling.  I'm glad I did, I met my wife (laughter), right.
Story_ID: 86711
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  What is, you know, because your life, you know, a lot of your life centers around Grambling?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how was Grambling started?  What do you know about the history of Grambling and what is, you know --?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, I know a lot about the history of Grambling.  You know, it was called Charles P. Adams, the founder in 1901 and he was there for 35 years, and then Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones, he was there for 41 years, and I was the third President of Grambling, and Grambling was a segregated institution up in the Northern part of the State of Louisiana, which was a hard, a hard part of the State.  It - you would think if you could use the term being liberal that the Southern part of the State of New Orleans were Catholics was much more liberal, than North Louisiana where you had the Protestants, the hard-core Baptists up there, and Grambling was located up in that particular area and I mean it was a tough area.  It's pretty close to Monroe and Shreveport, Louisiana which were the two major Cities.  So we had -- we were in a rural campus, the largest City was five miles away was Rustin, you know, and I think they must have been about 10,000 people, and when I was in school, you know, we were you know, right at maybe, 800 or 900 students in school, but it was a confined campus and it was a very close campus and the relationships among the various students was very, very good.  It was a good environment and I say now, you know, if I had to do it all over again, I would want to go back there, with all I've seen in terms of colleges and universities, I wouldn't trade that experience for any experience that I've had.  So it was a rural institution, it was -- when I went there, it was really an institution designed to train teachers -- teacher education program, and it had a strong teacher-education program, and then later on you'd begin to develop other curricula like the business curricula, which became very strong, computer science, the science majors, things of that nature, but basically when I was going (unclear) a teacher-education major.
Speaker 1: Okay, now -- now Grambling was founded by what organization did, I mean --?
Speaker 2: Well, it -- actually Charles P. Adams was at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] , and a group of farmers wanted an institution in North Louisiana.  They didn't have an institution in that part of the State, so they contacted Booker T. Washington, and Booker T. Washington sent Charles P. Adams down there to start Grambling State University, and basically, you know, he started it.  It was a school -- it taught people trades because that is what Tuskegee was all about.
Speaker 1: So it was a State-supported school basically and (unclear) with some assistance-?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was more State assisted than it was State supported, because -- then later on Grambling became, you know, a State-supported institution.
Speaker 1: Okay, it started off without State support--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.  It was just an institution that was developed, you know, like Tuskegee, and Charles P. Adams came there and he started it, and he taught people how to, you know, how to read and write, agriculture, how to preserve foods and things of that nature.  That was the beginning of it, and Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones, who became the second President -- we affectionately called him "Pres", he had been there for forty-one years, and he developed the institution to -- when I went there in 1977, and in 1977 I stayed until 1991 which was fourteen years.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get too far--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 86712
Speaker 1: Now, now when you were a student at -- what was Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] like for you as a student?  Well was it exactly what you expected it to be, I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was during that period of time.  It may have been a little more, you know, than I expected it to be because -- of course, I met my wife and that kind of slowed things down quite a bit there and it helped out tremendously, but basically that's what it was.  It was a small institution, you had people from all over the State, and you even had people from out-of-state.  It was interesting - who would come to Grambling State University to play football, cause, you know Eddie Robinson was the Coach at that time, and he was a very active coach in seeking out people.  I remember he recruited me because at that time he was the Basketball Coach, he was the Assistant Baseball Coach and he did everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just for the sake of history, tell us about Eddie Robinson, because--?
Speaker 2: Oh, Eddie Robinson, like you say, he's truly a legend in his time, and what he did will probably be un-paralleling the history of athletics because, here is a man that took a program and brought it to the pinnacle of success.  He developed a lot of good athletics, but even more importantly, he developed a lot of good students, and he always said that -- a couple of things he's very proud of.  First of all, he said -- he use to always brag that he had two of his players who were college presidents now.  That was myself and a guy -- President of Coppin State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], but also it was his graduation record.  I mean he, you know -- you didn't go to Grambling just to play ball, you had to go to class, you had to turn your grades into him, and he double checked and I think from that, a lot of people don't know about that aspect of Eddie Robinson.  They think that he is a coach, but he was a little more than a coach, and I think that that's the thing that makes him stand out from a lot of other coaches, and that's the reason his players are so successful.  You know, you take -- just about all of his players are -- you know, Willie Davis, you know NBA, University of Chicago, big time businessmen, James Harris who now has become the Vice President of Jacksonville.  Willis Reed, who is the Vice President of Operations at the New York Nicks; so, he could point to you, Charlie Joiner, a CPA, and everyone of those players that you could talk about that played under him.  He'll be able to tell you where they are and what they are doing and why they are doing what they are doing and it's because of his influence that he had, a tremendous influence on young men, and so we revere Eddie Robinson.  He -- it was really interesting when I came back as the President of Grambling, and he had to work for me now, and he and I had a joke.  He came in my office and he said, "You know, Pres, I need another coach."  I said, "Well wait a minute now Coach you remember, I went to school here", I said, "I remember you coached football and baseball and basketball (laughter), and he said man it's a different ball game (laughter), but -- that's the kind of guy he is, you know, and very good to work with, and he loved that institution, he -- you know, he respected the administrators.  You know, you have a lot of these schools where people of his caliber try to run the school, but he -- that's not him.  He loved that school and had respect, you know.  Nothing but the utmost respect for me as a President, even though I was of his former students and he recruited me at Grambling, and so he's a tremendous individual and the record speaks for itself what he has done for the game of football, but I think that as a man, I think people need to know him as a man and what he's been able to do and the young men and young women that he has been able to inspire over the years.
Story_ID: 86713
Speaker 1: Okay, now what were your grades like at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I was pretty good. I was pretty good.  We were talking about Coach Robinson, I remember one time whenever the Coach was looking for you, they'd say, "aw, hell, what have we done wrong now?"  You know, he came across the campus and I think that semester we had -- that grades had to go to the coach to see what was going on.  I think I had four As and two Bs and he was calling me, "Joesie" (ph) come here."  I said, "Aw, hell, what did I do now?"  He said, "man, I just wanted to tell you, you know I got your grades in and how proud you know we are of you and we want you to keep doing it", but my grades were pretty good at Grambling, and even participated in basketball because that's the reason I was there.  I was there to get an education and I didn't -- to me if I didn't take advantage of that opportunity, that I didn't want to 25 - 30 years down the line look back, and like many of the people I know sitting on the corner talking, (unclear) now in New Orleans [Louisiana], "if only I had".  So, you had to take advantage, and you had to -- Bobbie Seals says "you had to seize the times", so, but my grades were very good and I was very proud of what I was able to do.  Stayed on the honor roll and, you know, I guess that's how I ended up going to the University of Colorado and other places because people recommended me to do certain things.
Story_ID: 86714
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now you were a Kappa [Alpha Psi] too weren't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a Kappa -- matter-of-fact I was the Polemarch, Willie Davis was Polemarch before me which was the President and then after him I became the President of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity and --?
Speaker 1: And that's the Willie Davis that played for the Packers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Green Bay Packer, yeah, Willie, yeah, and--.
Speaker 1: An All-Star (unclear) NFL and--
Speaker 2: Right, right he was our good student.  Willie was a good student too, a very good student, multi-millionaire now, made a lot of money in pro ball but he made more money in his business enterprises.  Willie may be on more corporate boards than anybody in the United States.  He is well-connected, very well-connected and that comes out of -- while he was playing ball in the summer times, he would go up to the University of Chicago and he finally got his MBA degree and he got into business and did a lot other things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so any other activities at college you want to talk about before we (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, basically when you are on an athletic scholarship that consumes a lot of your time along with your studies and I would be involved with the Student Government Association and didn't hold any top position but always involved in different organizations like, you know like Kappa alpha Psi fraternity and -- but basically that was the extent of it.  I tried to get out of there man, you know it wasn't no second chance, I had to do what I had to do and I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  What was your major?
Speaker 2: I was physical education and a history minor.  It really should have been a reversal because I was more interested in -- but I was always interested in culture.  I just always thought that was the role I wanted to play in, because someone -- people had worked with me all the way through my life since elementary school.  So, I majored in physical education.  A lot of people don't understand physical education.  They think it's -- you just play, but I tell you when you take kinesiology and when you take physiology and when you takes tests for measurements, those are three of the toughest courses that anybody could take anywhere -- any curricula, but I enjoyed working with young people and I had an opportunity to teach in high school as well as a coach before going to the University of Colorado, so that was my major and I love it.  I enjoyed it.  It is a good major; it was a tough major too.   Much tougher than a lot of people thought it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out in 1957?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 86715
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to the [U.S.] Army next?
Speaker 2: No, the first year I worked at -- in Shreveport, Louisiana at George Washington Culver High School, and then I was drafted, and I spent two years in the Service and I came back and I was called up again.  I was in the Reserve.  I was -- yeah, I was -- taught one year when I came back and then I was called back up for one year and then when I got out, I taught a year in high school at Booker T. Washington High School, and that's when I taught world his--?
Speaker 1: Back in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, no that's in Shreveport.
Speaker 1: Shreveport?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I taught world history as well as civics at that time and then I moved to -- to -- the next year moved to Hammond -- Hammond, Louisiana, yeah, Hammond, Louisiana and I taught at the Greenville Park High School.  I was down there for six years, yeah, six years before leaving going to the University of Colorado [Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].
Story_ID: 86716
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I spent eight years at [University of] Colorado [Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], you know, going to graduate school, working, and finishing up my degree.
Speaker 1: Now, you decided to go to grad school, and why at the University of Colorado?
Speaker 2: I had a friend of mine that I worked with in Shreveport, Louisiana, Leonard Bonds who had been up to the University of Colorado -- he had gotten his Masters Degree, and he and I were talking one day cause I really wanted to go to the University of Indiana because I knew about Indiana, I knew about the program there, but he told me, he said, "man, just go up there - spend one summer", and I went up one summer and fell in love with it and so, I went up a couple of summers working on my Masters Degree and then the people at the University of Colorado called me in the middle of the year while I was teaching and they asked me to -- would I come and be a teaching assistant at the University and they would pay for everything and what have you, so I took a semester off, went up to finish my Master's Degree, and then, I think about a year after, they called me again, and they wanted me to come to the University of Colorado to be a teaching assistant, to work in the Program, but to work on my doctors degree because of the work that I had done previously up there and they felt and I guess I might be a good for the future there.  So that's how I ended up at the University of Colorado.  So, when we got up there and I was in my program and I'm doing several jobs around the Campus, different organization, the President, he wasn't the president at that time.  He was Executive Vice President of the University, he became interested in some of the things that I was doing and he asked me to come and work for him when I finished -- when I got my doctor's degree, and so I worked with him and then I think a year afterwards he became the President of the University, so I ended up as his Executive Assistant and that's how I got into this whole thing of administration and from there, I came down to Grambling in 1977.  I spent eight years at the University of Colorado.  I enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a good experience--
Story_ID: 86717
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about how was the President [of Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] before was Ralph Waldo Emerson (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was getting ready to retire--?
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Did they have a nationwide search for somebody (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, they must have had about eighty-five people and really, it's really ironic.  My wife didn't want to go to Colorado, but when she got there she didn't want to leave  you know she (laughter).  So I wasn't thinking about leaving and the people at the University of Colorado had said to me that they wanted me to stay.  They had plans for me and things that they wanted me to do and -- but I had some people down at Grambling who said "look man, you are doing some things up there; we need you at this particular time, at this juncture at the history of this College."  The College was running a $5 million deficit and there's a lot of problems that existed, so they needed somebody to come in with some oh "young blood" to do some things and with a lot of energy, and my wife and my oldest daughter, they weren't particular about coming back.  I told them, I said well you know, you have to give something back.  I said that's part of our problem.  We don't have enough people giving something back.  The people at the University of Colorado put, you know, money on the table, "look man, we could pay double whatever they"--, and I had to tell him it wasn't about the money, you know, it was about giving something back.  I said here is a school that took me in and provided an education for me and gave me an opportunity, so I needed to be able to give something back, and that was my contribution.  I stayed 14 years at Grambling, but that's how I ended up back at Grambling.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well then even with a sense of you know, duty to go back and try to help, didn't you feel a little bit of trepidation going back to a situation where they are $5 million in debt and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but yeah, this whole story "to much is given more, much more is expected", and I thought about President Jones and Mr. Adams how those guys tried to keep the school floating.  It wasn't nothing that they did.  It wasn't any money stolen or anything like -- it's that that they never had enough money to run the school like most of these black institutions.  So, I felt as though I had a commitment, and then, you know, if you believe in spiritual things, sometimes you don't question certain things.  You don't know why you do things, but you do them, and at this junction in history, maybe I was the chosen one, the person to be able to go back and do what needed to be done at Grambling, so I accepted that role and I never even gave it a second thought other than that it needed to be done, it was my institution, and I had been called upon to do it and people were impressed with what I had been doing, and thought I could do the job, and so I never thought about -- you know, my wife did.  She and my daughter they -- well, why you wanna do this?  Well, I wanna do it because I think it's the right thing to do and like I said I never thought -- who would have thought that I would have been the President of my alma mater.  As a matter-of-fact, who would have thought that I would probably have a doctor's degree at that particular time?  So things happen to you in your life, and I guess it's the way what Dr. [Martin Luther] King and everybody else, I mean, you know, he didn't have to do what he did.  I mean eventually, he probably knew that he would be killed because of what he was trying to do.  So you do things without looking at what the end results are going to be.  It's about risks, you gotta take risks.  If you don't take risks, you are not going to be able to do anything.  You are not going to be successful, and there a lot of people who played it safe, and I've always been a risk taker, you know, that's just me, and so, but I thought that this was too important not to do, and you're right, it wasn't easy.
Story_ID: 86718
Speaker 1: It was tough. It was very, very tough, and there were a lot of people, you know on the campus, man, that coming into try to save the school and do some things and they had apprehensions about you, you know.  Why him, you know, they were playing their little political games, but it was about Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] so, and when I left Grambling, I said to them, "Keep your eyes on the prize".  "It's not about you, it's not about Coach Robinson, it's not about me, it's about Grambling.  Grambling needed to be there for the thousands of young people who would need an education, and I would say here in 2003 that Grambling is needed now more than when maybe I went to school back then, and I think all these Black institutions are needed because it's a very difficult period that we're going through I this country, and these are the institutions that will spend the time and the energy to try to train a majority of people, who people say shouldn't even be in school, and that's the beautiful part about Grambling State University that I enjoy.  When I see the young people who are working in industry, when I see the young people who are medical doctors and the nursing profession and the corporation and doing so many things, and people say that they shouldn't even be in school, and here they are so, I think that the gratification.  You won't ever get rich as the President of a black college, you can bank on that.  Oh, you'll live decently, but by the same token it's what you do, that's where the reward comes from -- from when you see the young people that you've been able to touch.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what did you tackle -- what did you have to tackle first at Grambling?
Speaker 1: Well, the first (simultaneous) thing I had to tackle was the fiscal problem, you know, to -- a state institution, you know, you run a deficit, you get fired (laughter), you know, so the first thing we had to do is to -- I had to come in with an organizational structure that would provide, you know, the people in the right positions to do what needed -- administrative ---want needed to do what had to be done to get that thing taken care of, and we did that.  I brought a young man with me Dr. Earl Vincent from the University of Colorado.  I brought another young man.  He was at the University of Nebraska, Dr. Kermit McMurry.  We were all classmates at the College together, and I identified a young man I taught in high schools who was brilliant with finances, comptroller and so we identified and we put together a structure and to make sure that the money that the State was giving to us that it would be, you know, it would be spent appropriately, and we were able to do that.  So that was the first thing.  Then the next thing I had to do they had dwindling enrollment.  I had to make sure that I established an administrative structure that would get me some students.  We were Grambling-- when I got there in 1977 Grambling had oh, about 2,300 students and dropping, and when I left we were close to 7,000 students.
Story_ID: 86782
Speaker 1: Now, you say well the finances you had to get straight, the enrollment--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had the enrollment--?
Speaker 1: What else, anything else (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Saving facilities.  When you have a problem with finances that's going to impact on the kind of facilities that you have, so I had to put together, you know, a master plan designed to ascertain additional resources from the State because they were not giving like they should have given to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and in the process when I left Grambling we had, I think we had over $100 million construction that went on and so we got the facility back in place, and you have to -- yeah, kids are not going to come to you if you don't have the facility, and then making sure that, of course, that would fall in between that -- making sure that I identified the best possible people to come there and to teach at that institution, and we were able to identify world-class faculty, then making sure that I had the resources to pay them.  We were number -- when I left Grambling we were number three in the state in terms of faculty salaries.  There was LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and nobody in the State could beat LSU.  Then there was the University of South Western in Lafayette and Grambling.  We were the top three paying of faculty and staff.  So we were able to attract very good faculty and staff to Grambling State University.  So, those -- those were the things, you know, you had to get those things taken care of, you know, to move the student forward and to move the School forward and -- and we did, I mean we did.  Like I said, we went from 2300 to over 7,000 students in fourteen years and could have gone higher than that.  It also brought in some additional programs, like we have the first doctor's program in developmental education in the Country and maybe, I think, Appalachia State might have one now.  We brought in some good programs, the MBA, the Masters of Social Work, Master of Criminal Justice.  We did more on the graduate side.  We had a good undergraduate curriculum, but we did more on the graduate side.  So, we brought in some good programs, and we were moving.  When I left there we were moving and I tried to identify some information that I sent, how we left the school fiscally sound when we left there.
Story_ID: 86783
Speaker 1: Now any, any good stories from your term at Grambling [State University, Grambling Louisiana]?  You were there a long time, there must be some good stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like I said I think the best story that I have are the kids that graduated when I was there, you know. I remember the time Doug -- Doug Williams graduated and he was -- Doug told me, and said - Doug - he said, "Pres", he said, I wanted my degree because if they don't let me play quarterback I'll go back into teaching", and he felt very strongly about it.  He said that --that's -- when you talk about Eddie Robinson pushing guys to get your degree so that you have that other option, and of course you know everybody knows the history of Doug, and-- you know, first Black to -- and I don't put much stock into being the first Black of doing anything, because I think if opportunities had been there, Blacks would have done much more, but you know he won the Super Bowl, but that was--.
Speaker 1: In a dramatic fashion too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was -- injured and--.
Speaker 1: He really -- when you think about his career in pro football, I think one of the first games he was in they broke his jaw.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You know, I mean --.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't, you know, he's down with Tampa Bay and they shit -- bad news.
Speaker 1: No line and (unclear) --.
Speaker 2: Right, right and then there are a lot of stories that you know that I could point to, then are good stories and some sad stories, you know, to the worst thing in the world that when you have to -- we had a kid -- two kids were in the dormitory, just what we call "horse playing around".  The boy hit his head on this -- on the bed and died and I had to be there at the morgue when his mother came and to try to explain to her what happened to her son, you know, I sent my son away and this is what happened, and you couldn't do anything to the other boy because they were playing and they were good friends, I mean just horse playing, you know.  Sad stories like that, you know, we had about three kids were killed going to New Orleans [Louisiana] in a car wreck and I had to go to that funeral, you know, and -- so you know those are some of the sad things that happened and the positive things that when I see the young people doing some of the things that they're doing, those are the stories that feel me with joy and it makes me know that my work was not in vain, and they've called me now.  Kids still call me, they see me in different places and they always held me in a high -- with high respect and to me that is more important and I use to tell the kids all the time that "you don't have to love me, you don't have to like me, you don't have to accept me, but don't disrespect me," and I used to say that to them to always make sure you get that respect and maintain that respect, and that's what we had.  So I had an excellent experience at Grambling the 14 years -- 14 good -- could have stayed longer but I wanted to move on, and a lot of people are very disturbed that I did leave, they wanted to know why with President Jones staying 41 years, at least you could stay 20, but I thought it was time to move on.  It was time to move on and do something else and -- because -- I think sometimes you can -- and it's just individual, I can't speak for other people.  Other people, you know, take like - like Norm has done, did 36 -- he's done 36 years at Xavier, Eddie Robinson been there, you know, 50 some years and some people can do that, but I'm the kind of person that -- I just think in life there are other places and other things that you need to do with your life and that's why I decided at that time I had done what I could do.  I had put the school back where it should have been and it was time to move on to something else.
Story_ID: 86784
Speaker 1: Now, you moved on to Talladega--.
Speaker 2: Talladega College.  A little small liberal arts college in Talladega, Alabama, of course, it's known for the race track.  You know the big race that they have over there, but it was a small private liberal arts school.  I went from a school of 7,000 to a school of about 600, and--.
Speaker 1: What's the history of Talladega?  Who founded Talladega and --?
Speaker 2: Well Talladega was founded -- I'm trying to -- 1867 there if I remember correctly, and --
Speaker 1: It was right after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's exactly right, and it was founded by a group of whites from the United Church of Christ, and that is who they are associated with and they came in and they set up a school in Talladega, Alabama, and they taught and -- it's never been a large institution, it's always been a very prestigious institution. At one time they were able to, based on schools that size -- they were able to put more people into medical school than any other school, and they have a very strong emphasis in the science area now along with the other things education and what have you, but it's a small school.  It's a private school, and like small private schools, you know, they need money.  They need money to run the school.  I'm concerned that many of the private schools with the economy the way it is right now, they are gonna have a pretty hard time trying to survive. Historically, that's fine, but if you don't have the money you can't run the school, and people are not going to come and work for you if you can't pay them.  I mean it's just basically that simple.  So that was the biggest problem at Talladega, and we had to move the enrollment, and I was able to get the enrollment up to a thousand students, which I thought was where we needed to be in order to do some of the things that we need to do, but a lot of these private schools, and that's not -- that's black schools, white schools as well.  They are going to have a tough time going through this phase that we are going through right now, and some of them are not going to survive you see.  Right now you see Morris Brown had a serious problem.  There are other schools that come under these accrediting associations that -- they are going to lose their accreditation.  You lose your accreditation, you lose your financial aid.  While the kids that go to these schools are all dependent upon financial aid.  If the Federal government cut off the financial aid, you are going to lose your school.
Speaker 1: How do you go about raising the money for school, I mean does a lot of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, first of all you've got to sit down and develop your plan, you know, what is it you need?  Look at what your needs are because you need something to take out once you start talking with people.  Then you got to identify people who can really help the institution.  One of the major problems that I find with many of the Black colleges is they have too many people sitting on these boards who can't help, and you've got to have people who can make things happen, and so I'm saying if people calling in their chips.  So you identify people who can get the money and can talk to people with the money, and once you do that, you know put together some kind of organizational program with -- identifying somebody to head up your campaign, and you gotta have someone who can really get out there and help you to identify and bring in some people.  We were able to do some good things at Talladega because Elmer Harris who is the President at Alabama Power and Light was very interested in some of the things that we were doing.  Ron Payne who was former President of Farmer's Furniture, and Willie Davis and even Bart Star is getting ready to help us do some things.  So you got to identify people who can just call on people and -- and make it happen.  People give to people, they don't give to causes.  People believe that -- they can believe that if they wanna.  People give to people, and sure there is some people that believe in causes, but when you start talking about building campaign or building endowment you've got to have people who can talk to people and say, "you know my school Talladega needs $600,000; man, I need you to help me out."  When you talking to him you already know that he has some money, but even more importantly you know that he is going to have to come back to you for something.  So those are the kinds of people, so you gotta to build a strong team of people who can actually go out and get money and if you don't do that, and a lot of schools can't do that because it's like the "quid pro quo".  What are you offering?  If you don't have nothing to offer -- Norman Francis has been very successful at Xavier because he -- they put more kids into medical school than any school in the country, and they've got a pharmacy school.  The only -- in the City of New Orleans, Xavier is the only school that has pharmacy.  So, you've gotta have something.  You've gotta have something that people will identify with and then you've got to identify people who are willing to work with you.
Story_ID: 86785
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have to really revamp the boards of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah we identified some people that we had, of course, the Board was already in place when I got there, and of course, they had certain set terms that they were there and then some of those people rotated off.  We tried to identify people who could do some of the things that could help us, yeah.  So you need identify good board people.
Speaker 1: And as an example, what would a school offer?  Say I have access to a lot of money.  You know I have the money to help you, then what could you offer me as a corporation or--?
Speaker 2: Well it depends on what corporation -- say if you are looking for good students in business, you know we can make sure that you would have access to those students once they graduate and in the process what you could do, you could during the time that they're in school, as you identify them, you could have them come and working in the summer time at your corporation, and that's what Dr. [Frederick] Humphries was able to do at Florida A&M [University], that's why he was so successful.  He had a program called "Life Gets Better", and he went to these corporations and he said to them, "you know if you hire a kid -- when they graduate if you give them a job every summer, we'll make sure that those kids come to you when they graduate.  So okay, if I'm a corporate president, I'd say hey, "I can get the cream of the crop.  It's not going to cost me that much anyway".  So you've got to, you know you've gotta to have something that these people want in order to, you know, get them to participate with you.
Story_ID: 86786
Speaker 1: Well tell me about-now you were at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] from '91 [1991] to '98 [1998]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '91 [1991] to '98 [1998] yeah, and we did a lot of good things over at Talladega like I said.  I went from a state institution to a private institution.  I went from an institution where you have a budget allocated and of course, it's not enough.  I started calling it state assisted.  It wasn't state supported -- to an institution that depended upon finances from the bigger community.  You had the UNCF [United Negro College Fund] that raised money for the 41 schools that they had at that time, then you had to have your own campaign, then you had to have your alumni actively involved giving money, you know.  We had the phone-a-thons, where the kids would call in -- so it was a different ballgame of getting money.  A State institution, you know you're going to get some money.  As compared to a private institution you better raise that money if you want to keep that institution rolling, and identifying, you know, the various types of Federal grants and private grants, and foundations and corporations having them to give to the, you know, the institution and that's how you raise your money, and it's not easy.  It's not an easy job, you know when you are talking about competing against some of -- some of the schools have been very good because of their history.  Morehouse [College] and Hampton [University] and Howard University; see Howard is supported by the Federal government, and they get their money from the Federal government.  So that makes a big difference when you know.   When the dollar goes bad in the Federal government, everybody's dollar is going to be bad, but not for Howard.  So, we don't have that many schools, Tuskegee is another one that has a pretty good endowment.  So, but you're talking about maybe five or ten schools, you know, out of a hundred some schools, and the rest of them gotta really scrape for everything that they get, just to keep the doors open and as I alluded to earlier, we'll probably lose some more schools because they just can't afford it.  I mean, the -- to go to these schools is astronomical, I mean you're talking about people having to pay the tuition $20,000.  Well, "why would I come to your school and pay $20,000 when I can go to a State institution?  I don't have to pay that much money", and I think that's what these presidents and these boards had better look at, but by the same token with inflation going up, utilities going up, they've got to have money to run the schools, so it's, you know, it's a catch-22.
Story_ID: 86787
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the challenge of the black college today -- you went from a school that Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana]-- that had like a superior music program--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The band was recognized--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The athletic team was recognized.  Eddie Robinson was the most recognized--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Black Coach in the United States to Talladega with no -- none of those extra curriculum programs in place, basically not or (simultaneous) --.
Speaker 2: Well, we had -- you had a basketball team and we had a golf (unclear) golf team -- good golf team.  We won a national championship in golf, and we had a little track and we had a baseball team, but that was the extent of it, I mean we couldn't afford anything else to run the program, but so it's a big difference, and believe me when I tell you and I have tried to impress upon the people at Grambling, how important that football team, how important that band was as a public relations tool.  A lot of times people don't understand that, particularly faculty, because they are caught up in their own little environment and they think that "well, I teach a class and go home and I write a paper and what have you", but they can't see the big picture and how important it is to have Eddie Robinson to go out and to speak for Grambling or Conrad Hutchinson, the Band Director to take his band to Africa and different places where people -- because what that does is it turns into resources for the school.
Speaker 1: Right, people know about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: They know it from the football team and the band.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah so it makes it tougher I guess to--.
Speaker 2: And that's what, like Dr. [Arthur] Thomas tried to do at Central State.  He tried to get the name of the school out there.  I remember having a meeting with George Steinbrenner.  George Steinbrenner and Eddie Robinson are very close.  George Steinbrenner brought the Yankees when they had Reggie Jackson, you know had a strong championship team.  They brought them to Grambling to play and everybody thought we were crazy when we announced that the Yankees would be coming to Grambling.  I mean you got this cow pasture for a baseball field, and they didn't believe they were coming, and so they came and Louisiana Tech was right down the road and the President called Steinbrenner.  He wanted to know could they play a game at Louisiana Tech, and he said "that what you got to understand, I didn't just come down here to play a baseball game."  He said, "Grambling is my school".  I have given them honorary doctors too.  He said "Grambling is my school".  He said, "So we came down to generate money for them for the baseball team", and they couldn't understand it.  I mean, they just couldn't understand so the President at Louisiana Tech, Jay Taylor, was a very good friend of mine.  He said that, "man, you got the Yankees."  I said, "Well, Jay what are you complaining about man.  You got all the facilities."  He said, "Yeah, but hell you got the programs" (laughter).  So we were able to bring in people and something I was about to get to that George Steinbrenner said.  He said to me, he said -- I asked him, "well why you and Billy Morton, you know--".  He said, "Don't ever forget, always keep the name of the school out there."  He said sometimes the press may be negative, he said but the name  -- he said, he wants the name of the Yankees to always be out there and I understood where he was coming from on that, you know.
Speaker 1: So if you lose a list -- less fighters--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it's something, you know what I mean.  You notice he's been back in the news you know, and that his MO, you know.  He -- just keep the name out there, you know.
Story_ID: 86788
Speaker 1: There were rumors a couple of years ago that Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] was going to close.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they, well they've been having rumors like that for years.  They were having an accreditation problem and it's -- it's very political. The State auditor went in and did a job on Grambling.  I mean he did a job on Grambling, I mean he, you know -- he's now running for governor, but he went in and he said that --Grambling wasn't running a deficit, Grambling had money -- said, but he didn't know how they were accounting for the money.  Well he knew how they were accounting for the money because you're money is drawn down from the State once a month, but he wanted to -- he was a racist.  He wanted to destroy Grambling, and it's still not over because Grambling is now -- still on probation by the Southern Association.  It's on probation and I just hope that they come out of it, this -- I think next December they go back, but these State institutions are something when you got people like an auditor who would come in and do the job that he did on Grambling State University, and that's why the leadership now that goes into these institutions -- they got to make sure that everything is alright, and the people who are working there they've got to understand you can't be messing around you got to make sure that everything is in order so when they come you are able to defend that school.
Story_ID: 86789
Speaker 1: In terms of Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama], what were some of your accomplishments there?  At Talladega were you able to---?
Speaker 2: Well, we -- we did for instance I mentioned that Talladega was a part of the United Church of Christ, and I thought it was very important that it had a religious background and we had a chapel and we needed to get that chapel renovated, build some dormitories.  We renovated many of the old buildings around there.  We rebuilt the infrastructure of the school, administratively as well as fiscally as well as physically, and so those were some of the basic things that needed to be done and then in the process when we did those things we were able to bring our enrollment up.  Kids started coming back.  We were able to raise money for scholarships.  You know we got scholarship money to -- you know you're competing, and let's face it, you could like Talladega, but you could like the University of Alabama better if they are paying your way.  So you have to get the resources in order to make sure that you can compete against other schools, and we were able to do that and that's how we were able to increase our enrollment, but and then also we were able to get some of the programs like our business program became a very, very strong program, and we were able to get people to give to the institution who hadn't given.  Alumni took a tremendous interest once again in the institution, and for instance at the end of the year we would have alumni to come in right before commencement and you know, the different classes would come and give money to the institution and as well as stay for commencement and things of that nature but, it wasn't a large school and the requirements were not as great as they were at Grambling [State University] because you had a larger institution, but you had basically some of the same problems there, and we were able to turn those things around.
Story_ID: 86790
Speaker 1: Okay, what about the future of Black colleges?  I mean, it seems to me that it seems to be a -- it could be a -- Black colleges, are they still -- I know there's still a need for them right now, but as the Black colleges strive to put people into the mainstream would they not -- aren't they like making a case for their own extinction at some point?
Speaker 2: Not really, as I said earlier, I think that the black colleges may be needed now more than ever before.  The interesting thing in statics that people never deal with is that who teaches on the black college campus?  The Black college campus has probably been more diversified than any school in the United States.  They had more whites teaching on campus -- here in Talladega [College] it was founded by whites.  So, the thing is -- is that I believe and -- and I have problems when people ask about the future of the Black colleges because they never ask about the future of the white colleges, and I think that these colleges are needed now because they are a lot of kids out there that need this type of institution where you got people who are willing to make that sacrifice, prepare them and to train them and to get them out into the mainstream. Now, your point is well taken and I think it is going to be real difficult over the years because you have a lot of the Black students who are going to the white institutions and the reason a lot of them are going is because they are giving them the kind of resources that they need.  It's like what happened to the athletic programs.  You saw what happened in (unclear).  We've lost all of our good athletes and it's always comical to me when I hear these coaches talk about the institution and the education, and then you look on the other hand and these guys are not graduating, you know they -- all kind of stuff going on at these institutions.  We just had a big thing here in Georgia, at the University of Georgia.  They fired the coach, but the guy was taking a class and he didn't even go to class and made an "A", but I would say to you that when you talk about the future of a Black college, some of the colleges will have a hard time surviving because they just can't compete.  They can't compete with the resources out there.  Like you said integration, you know, many of the kids prefer going to other institutions, so it's going to be tough.  I think that a core of them will probably survive because all my kids went to black colleges and I'm proud of them.  I'm proud of what they did for them at those colleges.  Morehouse [College] was great for my son, you know, he knows who he is.  He is a black man.  He lives in America and he needs to understand that.  It doesn't mean he walks around with a chip on his shoulder, but at least he knows his history.  You know, my daughter went to Xavier [University], and she went to medical school.  She had no problem in medical school.  Xavier got one of the best preparation programs -- the other girl went to Grambling and then one, you know, went to Southern Law School.  She's one of the -- she's one of the top four lawyers in the State of Louisiana in the State Senate. She said, "Dad I don't have no problems.  Southern University prepared me well."  So these schools still have a very, very important role, but the reality of it -- do they have the resources to compete and I don't know whether or not many of them will have the resources.
Story_ID: 86791
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to ask you about the cultural mission of a black college.  What should a black college teach black students that they couldn't get some place else?
Speaker 1: Well, and I think that's one of the assets of a black college is that they take a lot of kids in who they come out of environments that they need specific, basic things that they need to learn in order to be successful as they get into the big world, and a lot of other institutions they don't have time to do that.  I mean, you know, the kids at the University of Colorado, I mean they -- you know when I taught up there -- I can't think of the name of the guy that his daughter was in my class -- I mean they got money, parents got money, they've been exposed to a lot of things, so this is -- from a cultural standpoint at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] we made sure that there were programs on that Campus that these young people could relate to and understand that this is only the beginning.  When you leave here you've got to be able to mix in and to be able to socialize, you know, with people if you are going to be successful out there, and I think the black colleges are doing an excellent job with the speakers that they bring on the campus, with the type of cultural programs that they have, the type of entertainment that they have and I think when kids leave they're able to deal -- deal with it.  Then the other thing that we do that's a little different and a lot of kids rebel against it, we make a lot of things compulsory, and we make it compulsory because we know that they need it.  "Aw man, I don't want to go to this program, or I don't want to go to that program", and then when they go to the program, they say, "you know that wasn't too bad", but suppose they hadn't gone to that program.  You know, for instance, this thing about the dress.  I had a big thing about dress and how you look.  You don't go in a corporation with the earring on your ear and all that other stuff.  Man, you know you need to understand the culture of the environment that you are dealing with.  So I think that what we do in the black colleges we're willing to say to the kid, face him head on and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him and tell him if you don't do these things, this is what's going to happen to you.  At the University of Colorado they don't do that.  They come in and they've got a body of knowledge that they expect you to learn and once you learn that knowledge then you are on your own, but at the Black colleges it goes beyond that.  We have to go beyond the standpoint of just giving them information to regurgitate back to professors.  They need to have information for life, and that's what we do best.
Story_ID: 86792
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, my number one hope would be that people would give back more to their communities and I mean -- I'm talking about financially.  We have some people out there who are unparalleled in the history of the black culture, making the kind of money that they are making and they are not giving back.  They are not doing anything in their communities like they should be.  You know this whole thing about reaching back and pulling somebody along with you.  Yeah, it's okay to move into the white neighborhood or the upscale black neighborhood, but what are you doing to try to help some of those that you left behind, and I would think that there are people out there who are making the kinds of monies that they could be giving back, and a classic example would be Morris Brown College.  Morris Brown College never should have gone under in Atlanta [Georgia] when we have the number of Black people, you know making the kind of monies that they are making and the connections that they have.  I think it's really bad and I think it is a reflection on the Black community that we allow that school to go under.  It's not everybody.  A lot of people gave them a lot of money and they did a lot of things but it just wasn't enough to stave off -- off the Southern Association, but -- see schools like that -- well, now Morehouse [College] -- pretty well.  Oprah [Winfrey] gave them $5 million and John Johnson gave them $4 million and -- but schools like Morris Brown they're not receiving the kind of -- and I guess it's fashionable to associate with somebody already doing as compared to somebody that's not doing, you know, but to me the -- I would think that if we can get people like that with resources -- you can't take it with you.  I mean, they might as well understand that, but I think the greatest gift that any could give is to give back and to try to pull forward those who are less fortunate.  Then we are -- I'm concerned about, very, very concerned about what's happened to our black males.  You -- when you have 900,000 Black males in prison and 600 in college, something's wrong somewhere, and when you look at the whole family structure you can see what's happening to the family structure because you don't have the black males who are there and this whole thing of drugs in the community and crime in the community, but all of that is a part of this lack of education and yeah, I believe in life education is the key to everything we do.  I always say with education it's going to be difficult and without it it's going to be impossible, and a lot of young Black males have got to be willing to make that sacrifice and to get that discipline that they need in order to survive.  We all did it.  I mean it can be done.  So those are the major concerns that I would have.
Story_ID: 86793
Speaker 1: When you look back on what you've accomplished, what do you see as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: [Off camera interruption]
Speaker 1: God darn it. Legacy, I really never thought about it other than I really don't care about anyone naming a building behind me or naming a street behind me.  What I want to be remembered by is that for 21 years I was able to keep the doors of an institution or two institutions open that provided an educational opportunity for a lot of young people who were able to go out and fit into this American system.  To me, that's my legacy.  That's what I want my legacy to be that I was able to inspire and to help young people to survive in America and to make them understand this system so that they could survive in the system, and to me that's the greatest legacy that could ever be left to anybody, is that you've been able to work with young people and give them an opportunity.
Story_ID: 86794
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I doubt seriously.  I doubt seriously, because from a spiritual standpoint I really don't know if I had that much control over some of the things that I got involved with.  When I look back at how these things happened, no, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I just think that to have the opportunity to serve is probably one of the greatest gift that anybody could be given, and I was able to do that and still doing it.  Even though I am retired, I am still actively involved in a lot of things.  People call, students call.  People ask for recommendations, and so this is involvement and I think that we are all chosen in this life to do certain things at certain times and how well we do those things, I think history will address that later.
Story_ID: 86795
Speaker 1: Okay, and one last question is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, first as a good father and a good husband.  I think that's -- I don't think, I know that's very important to me that I was blessed with four wonderful  young children and a beautiful wife, and to me that's the most important thing, and then secondly that I've been able to serve and to be able to help other youngsters.  Those are the two most important things to me.
Story_ID: 86796
Speaker 1: That's basically it.  So you don't have to tell a long story about a photo.

Speaker 2: Okay.
