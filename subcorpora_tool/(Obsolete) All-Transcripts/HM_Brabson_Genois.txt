Story_ID: 68455
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Let's just talk about your beginnings in [Phillips County] Arkansas.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell those names for us and the dates of their birth--their birthdates?
Speaker 2: I will do the best I can, Larry.  My dad's name is Leonard Young.  And Dad was born in 1928, July 18th.  And he was born in Blytheville, Arkansas, and my mom (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Leonard?
Speaker 2: Leonard, L-E-O-N-A-R-D; Young, Y-O-U-N-G; and
Speaker 1: How do you spell Blytheville?
Speaker 2: Blytheville.
Speaker 1: Blytheville.
Speaker 2: B-L-Y-T-H-V-I-L-L-E. [sic B-L-Y-T-H-E-V-I-L-L-E] I have to see it (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's it though.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And Arkansas you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Right?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) You're okay with that.  And my mom's name is--she was born Bernadine Cokes, and she was born in 1932 and she was born in Holly Grove, Arkansas, and her name is spelled B-E-R-N-A-D-I-N-E; Cokes, C-O-K-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did your parents [have stories about their parents or their ancestry, especially any stories that go back to Reconstruction or slavery?
Speaker 2: Well, neither of my parents had stories, but I can remember they're--my mom's mom sharing some stories a little bit about some things when she was a little girl.  She talked about--well, she said that her mom--her mother's mother--was from Georgia and that they had traveled--that they were like Indians and that they had traveled from Georgia to Arkansas.  So it was like a-- back then.  To them it was like traveling from one country to another, just that distance.  And she said that her dad was not a slave, but she believed her grandparents were, because they had very few records of them and trying to remember what--nobody could really tell us, you know, if there were, you know, who--if they knew any slaves.  And it just seemed to be kind of a quiet topic really.
Speaker 1: They didn't talk--they didn't talk about slavery.
Speaker 2: No.  They wouldn't.  But I had done some research, and I tried to find some of the information, and it was like just nothing was written or records--no records kept beyond, you know, a certain period. It's just a really dead end.
Speaker 1: During the, I guess, the latter part of the 19th century, early part of the 20th century, did they own their own property, or were they sharecropping with people or were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My granddad's father owned his own property, and my grandmother's dad owned his own property, and they passed it down to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear).  Now, how did--I mean, did they have any stories about how they (claimed?) the land and what they did with it, I mean?
Speaker 2: Well, they mostly found it themselves, and then when they were not able to, then they rented it out to other farmers.  So right now, that land is being farmed.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  So it's still in the family?
Speaker 2: It's still in the family and still being farmed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 68456
Speaker 1: All right.  Did your grandmother [Hattie Cokes] tell you any other stories about--I don't know--I guess what we'd had to call a turbulent period from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear) (simultaneous)--up and through the sixties.
Speaker 2: The saddest--the saddest story my grandmother ever shared with me was the tuberculosis period, when it just wiped out almost everybody in the family.  And they were all, you know, what they call that when they have to stay in their house?
Speaker 1: Quarantined.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they were quarantined in the house.  And she said it was just horrible with, you know, how everybody was just sick except for, you know, a handful of 'em, 'cause she said they had a lot of sisters and brothers, like eight or nine of them.  And when they--she said when they were all getting sick, and she was about eight years old, and she said she could remember very well when they tried to hide the fact that the dad had died from it.  And she said she knew he had died.  And she said it was really hard when she was losing her sisters and brothers.  She said, but when her dad died, she said that was just like the end of the world.  So she grew up with a lot of grief like that.
Speaker 1: Well, who provided for them when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Afterward?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was just their mom and, you know, the older brothers that lived that, you know, helped them.  And her mother had land and, you know, and she seemed to be okay.  Her mother lived a long time.  So that was really good.
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother?
Speaker 2: This is my grandmother--my mom's [Bernadine Young] mom.
Story_ID: 68457
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about that period of time that you were (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --that you were (unclear) your ancestors that did something that...?
Speaker 2: Right now, I can't recall.  It was just, you know, it was a time where the people were just extremely poor, and you know, they wanted to make sure their children went to school; and, of course, most of the kids did not finish school.  I think, like, some of my aunts and uncles might have finished, but most of them dropped out in high school.  And there was a war going on, I think.  I remember my dad saying there was a war, and they didn't send him because he was the only child.  And he was helping his parents' farm.  And my dad [Leonard Young] didn't know his father, and so he, you know, was just--he grew up with his aunts and uncles, with his grandmother; and then when his mother [Samantha Hurd] married, then his stepdad.  And he was with them only briefly, but mostly with his grandmother.  So, it was just really poor people struggling.  And, you know, and they married people just maybe within a half mile.  You know, they never did travel very far.  So everybody that married each other in that area, they were like, you know, they were like family, because they only lived down the road or, what they say, "over the hill" or something.
Speaker 1: There weren't that many people around.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just--it was a really small community.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Very small.  I think Mom [Bernadine Cokes] said there was probably--I know when we were visiting there, there were only maybe about a thousand people.  So I know it had to be less when they were growing up.  But they all had big families.  So, you know, it wasn't uncommon for a couple of brothers in one family to marry the sisters in other family because that's what happened with my grandfather's sisters; the three girls married the three brothers from the college--you know, from the family that was nearby.  So they were--it's--so they were all Ewings.  So, it's funny, when we have our family reunions, we have the Cokes/Ewing family reunion.  And that really is--that is them.  That is all the boys and all the girls (laughs), because they all have the same name.
Story_ID: 68458
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your parents [Leonard Young and Bernadine Young] have a story or do they have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  I never really heard them talk much about it. I know they married in '40' (1940)--1949, and in January 8th was when they got married.  So it was probably cold down there when they married.  And I remember my dad saying something about that--I don't know if it was a joke or if it was really true, that he gave my grandfather a cow, you know, for Mom.  So I go "You're kidding?"  But I think he was serious.  So Mom never said that it didn't happen.  And she, you know, she always looked like, you know, she just looked at him when he said that.  So I thought is he telling the truth (laughs)?  So I think he did.  I think he gave my grandfather [a cow, 'cause my mother was the eighth of twelve.  So see, there were still younger children at home when she left.  So I could see where he wanted to give them something.
Story_ID: 68459
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your father [Leonard Young] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a construction worker.  He, you know, poured concrete and did subcontracting for other builders; and plastering for new homes, you know, where they would go in and do that plaster work.  He really enjoyed that work.  It's hard.  Hard labor.  But he seemed--then, you know, that-those were his best years when he was doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your mother [Bernadine Young] do?
Speaker 2: And my mom, she started working in the factory after--oh, I guess after most of the kids were big enough to go to school.  She worked for Magnavox, here in town.
Speaker 1: Oh, here in Fort Wayne [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She worked there, but I think she worked there about twenty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Now, when did the family moved to Fort Wayne?
Speaker 2: In 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So you were, like, three years old?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.  Right.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know how they do.  They come on the train or something and--I think Mom said that's the way we got here, and Dad was already here.  And we stayed with family, Some of his cousins, until they could get a job and get up and get--you know, get an apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was like everybody helping everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And then they got jobs here in Fort Wayne, you know.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 68460
Speaker 1: Now, think back to--I don't know if you remember a lot about Arkansas.  You probably don't.  And I wouldn't (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some.  The time when we would go back and visit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, just tell me what it was like growing up, I guess, here and when you would visit Arkansas, you know; what neighborhood did you live in here, and what was it like--what were some of the sights and sounds and smells in growing up in Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I had to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --growing up here in Fort Wayne [Indiana], of course, we lived pretty much in the downtown area or the central part of this city.  And we lived--it was near kind of a busy highway, the downtown, you know, that thru street, Lafayette-Clinton.  We were only maybe two blocks from there where we lived.  But it was a very quiet neighborhood.  The highway wasn't that busy when we were growing up.  And, you know, as a kid you enjoyed the summer.  You know, the summer was just the greatest time, and you'd have people come by selling popcorn, caramel corn, peanuts, soft ice cream, popsicles, and, I mean, you know, it was just fun.  You'd hear the little bells ringing and you run outside and you'd have your change ready or you'd have it by--close by the door, 'cause you know 'bout the time you're gonna come.  And you'd go to the grocery store, corner little neighborhood grocery store, and you'd get supplies for the--you know, your mother [Bernadine Cokes Young] would you send you usually for bread or milk.  And she'd give you maybe an extra quarter, and you could buy yourself something, you know, just have your little brown bag full of something sweet.  And it's just fun.  And my dad [Leonard Young] would take us to the park.  There was a park that was--actually, that park would have been on the west side of Fort Wayne where we went.  They called it Westville.  I remember that.  And you could play on the swings and, you know, and you just--it was just nice and cool and breezy; and just being with Dad, you know, that was just fine to me, 'cause I was, you know, pretty much a daddy's girl.  And anytime when that car moved, I--you know, I thought that I should be able to go.
Story_ID: 68461
Speaker 1: Now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And where do you rank (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --I have four brothers, and I have three sisters and I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when we would travel south [to Arkansas], we would always take chicken and cake, and we'd have, you know, all kinds of good food in the windows.  So while you're riding down there, you know, you're just snacking the whole way, you're eating.  And you'd just stop for gas, and sometimes we would stop in Memphis [Tennessee] because my dad [Leonard Young] had an aunt that lived in Memphis.  So that would be kind of nice to stop there before you do that last leg of that trip, which was--and you had about a hundred more miles to go.  And basically, you know, it was just a long, dusty hot ride 'cause it would always be summer.  It would always be like July, I think when we'd go.  And that had to be the hottest time down there.  And you get--you know, you'd get out the car, you'd go up and, of course, you know, hug Grandmother and hug Granddad, and Grandmother and I would just talk nonstop, you know.  When I first get there, I'm so hyped up and so excited.  And she'd always have cakes and things baked, 'cause she was an excellent cook, especially cake maker.  And she would have peach preserves and biscuits, and you'd get up in the morning, you know, and she's already cooking food for you.  And you go and you're going "Yes, yes, yes.  This is so great."
Speaker 1: You're really doing a good job of describing it (laughs).
Speaker 2: I mean, can you picture what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughs).
Speaker 2: And, you know, there's chickens running around in the yard and the rooster is crowing.  And I would wake up and I'd hear that rooster crowing and I'd go "Yes, I'm in Arkansas," you know.  'Cause when you first wake up you're like, "Oh, where am I?"  And then you hear that rooster, that was just it.  You know, I was like (giggles).  And then, of course, the country smells was just--you'd be walking around the yard like this, pinching your nose and grinning and laughing.  It was just, you know--we were a really close family, and I think my mom [Bernadine Young] and dad, you know, really taught us a lot about respecting, you know, each other and our grandparents and made certain that we would go and visit them often.  And they were just--my granddad was a Sunday School teacher, and I was--I would go to Sunday School with him.  So, Grandmother would usually stay home, you know, 'cause she had company, and so she'd stay home and cook.  And granddad would get up and he'd say "Who's going to church with me?"  And, you know, I was like "Yeah, I brought a dress.  I'm going."  And it was just neat to, you know, to be going to church with him.  And at that time he had a wagon.  I remember riding in the wagon with the horse, and I was like "Wow.  This is something," you know.  It's not just in the books.  This really happens (laughs).  So, yeah, those were good times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went down there most summers?
Speaker 2: Most summers.
Story_ID: 68462
Speaker 1: And when I didn't go there [Arkansas], I would go to Chicago [Illinois].  And, of course, Chicago was just really an exciting city where my cousins that were living there at the time, they lived on the West Side on Walnut.  And there would be--you know, they would be in summer programs at their church, and the church people would pick us up.  And they also had the peanut people coming around and selling peanuts.  We'd be playing on--you know, their streets were a lot busier than what I was used to because, you know, there were cars, lots of cars, in Chicago versus Fort Wayne [Indiana].  And we would just stay outside all day.  I mean, all day.  We were hopping around, jumping rope, running up and down the sideway, running down to the schoolyard to play.  And, you know, it was just neat, 'cause they had a big family.  There was, like, twelve of them.  And we would sleep, you know, three or four in a bed on one end and three or four down on the other end (laughs).  It was just--it was wild.  But we loved it.  And I had so--my one cousin, the older one, she was a cheerleader and she was real stuck up.  And when we would come, she would be like, "Well, you can have my bed because I'm going to stay with my girlfriend."  And so, you know, as soon as we get there we know she's leaving and we'll have her bed and her room.  And it's funny, because even today she's still stuck up (laughs).  I mean, people don't change a lot.  But I loved going to Chicago.  I really did.  And my cousin would come to Fort Wayne and she would stay all summer.  And it was funny how we--you know, after we would spend those summers together, and as we were growing up, you could see where you're changing.  You could feel the--in different experiences that you were having and how you were growing up.  That was a little bit painful.  You know what I mean?
Speaker 2: You kind of split apart?
Speaker 1: We kind of.  Different tastes and different things that I liked and different things that she liked; you could see where your, you know, that you're changing.  You're maturing.  And I think, "How do you prepare for that?"  (laughs).  That was a little bit scary.  I can remember that.
Story_ID: 68463
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about school?  Where did you go to school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I went to Hanna [Elementary] School.  That was the first school I went to here, and I was--that was the elementary school.  That was on Layfette Street near Buchanan (ph), and it no longer exists.  And I think it's--I think it's--yeah.  Homes are built on it now.  Then I went to another elementary school when my parents moved to Eliza Street; 836 Eliza.  It was on the corner of Harmar and Eliza.  And the name of the school I went to was Harmar [Elementary School].  I loved that house.  I loved that house so much and that neighborhood.  And the kids that I was friend--that I made friends with in that neighborhood, I'm still friends with today.  I mean, that was just--well, you know, when we had to move from there, because my dad [Leonard Young], you know, didn't have the money, you know, to pay the rent, and it was like, I couldn't understand why we were moving.  I was like, "There's nothing wrong with this house.  Why are we moving?"  And you know, our mom [Bernadine Young]  and dad wouldn't tell me.  And I'm thinking, "Mom, I'm 11 years old.  I need to know why we're moving, you know.  My friends are, you know, down there.  I don't want to move away from them."  They're like, "Well, you're only moving two blocks away."  I'm like, "That's still too far, you know."  For an eleven year old, two, three blocks is a long distance.  I mean, you weren't allowed to go any further than maybe next door or two doors down.  I mean, it's not like they're going to let you travel all over the place at eleven.  And so when we moved to this other place, it was so cold and it was so tiny, and, you know, I just--I didn't get it.  I was hitting my head up against the wall trying to figure out what we move here for (laughs).  And, you know, my mom was expecting my brother, and she had--let's see; and then I--she had another little girl that she had just had like, maybe two years--she might have been two years old. So I was like, "This is not making sense" (laughs).  But, you know, and it ended up that they did move from that little bitty house into a bigger house on Washington Street, which was another highway.  And--but nothing could place Harmar Street for me.  I mean that just--that was just, you know, heartbreaking 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What's the name of the street again?
Speaker 2: The Harmar Street?
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: H-A-R-M-A-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just (unclear)).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Harmar.  And the school where we were going to school was Harmar.
Story_ID: 68464
Speaker 1: And, actually, it was nearer the other house, the Washington Street house, 'cause it was about eight or nine blocks from where we used to live.  And, you know, we went to elementary school, and then from there we went, you know, to the high school--well, middle school they call it now, but back then, it was junior high.  But they didn't have a junior high for us because Fort Wayne [Indiana] was changing.  They had started to integrate the schools, and so the sixth graders were supposed to go to Central High School.  They had a spot in Central High School for us.  And so seventh and eighth grade was actually in the building where we would attend high school.  We were in a wing of it, and there might have been--it was a very small class, not very large.  But they were trying to figure out, I guess, how to integrate, you know, at that time, 'cause they were tearing down some of the elementary schools and building junior high schools.  So that way the kids--our kids--in the central area would be bused.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, I've heard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was--that was frightening.
Speaker 2: Now, I've heard folks--some of the older people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: --that think that the philosophy was that the white community didn't want to come to the (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so they tore down (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So they needed to tear down those schools and build the other schools.  And that way bus and put the kids together.  So that way it was supposedly--the idea--the superintendent at that time was Superintendent Grial (ph) and, you know, he was a very powerful man, and people listened to him.  And I remember our pastor from Pilgrim Baptist Church, Reverend John Dixie, was also very highly respected in Fort Wayne, and I think he and some of the other ministers went and talked to the school board and tried to talk to them and tried to give them an idea of how the community--the central community--felt about the integration and how they needed to have some questions answered, because they didn't feel that there was good communication, you know, to just start busing kids, and, you know, they didn't want a problem.
Story_ID: 68465
Speaker 1: You were saying--I think the dynamic was that they had--they decided to tear down perfectly good black inner-city schools [in Fort Wayne, Indiana] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the black community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in order to bus black children from the black community to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to white neighborhood schools (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the suburbs basically (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Pretty much.
Speaker 1: --and so, you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Pretty much.
Speaker 1: --you (unclear) a fish out of water, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in another neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we were kind of like in limbo trying and--of course, a sixth grader, you know, we--it was an experience for us.  But we knew there was a lot of discussion.  We knew there were a lot of meetings.  But we didn't actually go to them.  I mean, we didn't actually--I know I didn't read the paper or watch the news that much about it, 'cause we were just enjoying being kids, and we just knew that we would still be together.  I think the important thing was the kids on my block, we all knew we were going to the same school.  And that was important to us, that they weren't splitting us up.  We didn't want to be split up to be integrated.  We thought "Integration is fine, just don't split us up," you know.  And so since we felt that we were lucky because we all went to the same middle school.  And that wasn't the case with my sisters and brother, because they actually did get involved in some of the splits because, you know, they were--came along later after those schools were ready.  They were ready to go (laughs).  So they actually did, you know, get involved in some of the busing; like my one sister graduated from Snider High School; and the other sister and brother graduated from South Side High School; and, you know, you could have people that were two blocks down the street who were going to a totally different high school.  And that was--I don't know--that was a lot of dissembling.  It was emotionally painful for a lot of families.  And I think it did cause a lot more problems than people even--maybe even are willing to admit to.  I'm not certain, but I know it was very turbulent, and I can remember that (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 68466
Speaker 1: Now just go back to grade school [Hanna Elementary School and Harmer Elementary School] for a minute now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what kind of a student were you?  Did you like school and (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loved school.  Never wanted to miss school (laughs).  I never would tell my mom [Bernadine Cokes Young] that I was feeling bad.  They always had to send me home from school because if I was sick, they'd end up sending me home, because I'd never tell her I was sick.  You know, there--it was just exciting.  I loved to learn, and I could always tell when a teacher was really into the job and really into us kids.  And, you know, we had some just excellent teachers.  I had--I remember Mrs. Cook or Miss Cook, rather.  And she had to be young.  She probably was only in her twenties.  But, you know, she was pretty.  She had long hair, and she was black, and, you know, and she was smart.  It just made you feel like, wow, this is kind of like having another mom (laughs), you know.  And then I had the one scientist teacher.  I remember his name, Mr. Oferly (ph).  And Mr. Oferly, he really wanted us to learn science.  I mean, he (laughs)--he went to pangs to make sure that we would learn and like science.  And he really did.  He helped me to like it.  I enjoyed science, learning how to--you know, he let us be weather people, and he would pick a girl and a--a girl and a boy would--they would be the weather people for the week.  So all week we had to go out and collect weather data (laughs).  And we knew, you know, that morning when we got in, we had to go outside and collect our data and come back in and chart it.  I mean, you know, we were doing that in fifth grade.  And we felt like we were learning something, you know.  This was exciting.  And the music teacher was--you know, they were just good about teacher us songs and helping us to, you know, to actually feel the beat, feel the rhythm.  And when they offered--I'll never forget when they said, "Okay, anybody--anybody that wants to play an instrument can play an instrument.  We have a list of instruments, and all it's going to cost is five dollars.  You will get music lessons.  And, of course, the first people that pay their five dollars, they get picked--they have first pick."  Well, I didn't get my five dollars in to get--I wanted to either play the clarinet or the saxophone.  And those were all taken.  So I ended up with--it was--the only thing left was the violin (laughs).  It was funny.  Nobody wanted the violin.  And I thought, "I'm going to play something.  I'm going to play the violin then" (laughs), 'cause I wanted to take an instrument home.  You know, you get your instrument and your case and you can carry it home.  I'm like, yes.  So I took the violin home, and I actually did, you know, study that for that semester and, you know, learned a lot about it--how to take care of it and how to, you know, put the resin on it and how to actually get it to have a nice, you know, flow and sound.  My mom and them, they were not encouraging though.  They would just laugh when I would be practicing the violin.  And I was embarrassed, because I didn't--you know, I wanted to find a way to practice it without having them make comments.  I mean, you know, it's so small in your house that you hardly have any privacy.  You know, it's like, where do we do?  Can't go in the bathroom 'cause somebody always got to go.  Can't go in the basement, 'cause they were not, you know, living space at that time.  And it was just weird, trying to practice without all that laughter.  They'd laugh.  "Oh, she's trying to play that violin again."  And it was just--but I loved it.
Speaker 1: Did you learn how to play it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I learned how to play some songs.  But I didn't take it very long because, you know, it was kind of like--I don't know if that--whatever they had for that offer.  If that teacher left, seems like somehow we only had it offered just that one semester.  So we must have had a bunch of instruments just for a little while.  Maybe they passed them around   I'm not sure what happened. Nobody ever tells kids, you know.  That's the strange thing.  I had so many questions about stuff.  Nobody would ever say, "What happened to this or what happened to that?"  And it's just--it's almost like people just think kids don't.  I mean, even if they're thinking that's not important to the child to know or what.  I never did understand why people didn't give us answers.
Story_ID: 68467
Speaker 1: What other kinds of questions did you have when you were younger?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I had questions all the time.  I was always asking questions and not really getting answers, but I don't know.  I suppose I had questions about religion.  I was curious about why did these people go here and these people go there, and how did you decide, you know.  I ask my mom [Bernadine Cokes Young] how did they decide to go where they went; things like that. Those were questions to me that just weren't getting answered.  You know, nobody wanted to talk about it.  They just kind of looked at you, like, "Oh, you'll find out," or "Oh, just wait."  But I just--you know, I kept trying to find some answers (laughs).  But as far as school, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Do you still ask some of those same questions now about things?
Speaker 2: Probably.  Yeah.  I think I still have some of those same questions.  But at least now I have, you know, some vehicles that I can use to kind of find some answers now.  I don't feel as frustrated about it, because I'm always reading and researching things and just--I don't know.  And I like--I think I had a really good school experience as far as elementary anyway overall.  I think it was good.
Story_ID: 68468
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, in high school [Central High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana], did you actually bused--well, in the middle school I guess you had to be bused, right?
Speaker 2: We didn't. They kept us together because we went to that high school 'cause they didn't have a middle school available for us.  So we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --so we went to Central.  And then we went to high school there also.  Yes.  So Central was our high school.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to leave the community.
Speaker 2: Nope.  We were able to walk.  I think it about ten blocks.  We were able to walk the ten blocks and stay in the neighborhood and actually graduate from that high school.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the teachers or mentors that you had in high school?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  In high school I had Mr. Saunders; he was the science teacher.  I had Mrs. Rawlins (ph.), and she was like English; Mrs. Plumans (ph.)--Miss Plumans--she wasn't Mrs.  Miss Plumans, and she was like the algebra teacher.  I had Patty Martone (ph.), who was our English teacher.  And Helen Lee.  Dr. Lee was one of the most phenomenal people I have ever met; I mean, just so smart.  You know how you just meet people who are--you can just tell that they're just really smart, like, photographic smart; like, remember everything they ever read?  And, you know, she was just--she was so smart and was--you know, I don't think we really had an appreciation of really what she had to offer us, because a lot of kids were trying not to be in her class because she was so tough.  And they were like, "Oh, no.  I got Helen Lee.  I'm going to get this changed."  But it was funny.  I never wanted to change mine because I felt like, well, she's that tough and she is that strict, well, you know, if all I can get is a C, then so be it.  I still will be better off with her than trying to get a teacher that doesn't know as much as she does (laughs).  I mean, you know, I think I had that kind of thought about it.  I wasn't as concerned about whether I would have an A.  I was really concerned about learning.  You know what I mean?  I was like, yeah.  You know, that's what's important.
Speaker 1: That's unusual.  Most kids I think, think about, you know--think about, you know, getting an A (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they think about not (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --going to school at all (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --what do you do?  What do you do if you don' get that?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --very few that are (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Honor Roll.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: Honor Roll was very important, and I had made--I made Honor Roll, not every year, but I made it enough that I felt that I had a good appreciation for it.  But it wasn't like my main, main thing.
Speaker 1: It wasn't the bottom line?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it wasn't like-- my parents [Bernadine Cokes Young and Leonard Young] wasn't pressuring me, you know, in any way.  So it was like I was just competing against me.  And so it was kind of neat, because, I mean, I just loved books anyway, so.  And they always knew they didn't have to, you know, say, "Are you doing your homework?" or anything like that.  I just--I always just loved doing it, 'cause I--to me, school had been such a good experience, I mean, you know, why change.  I think that the only disappointing thing that might have happened in high school was just, I guess, you know, seeing some of the kids just kind of throw it away, and seeing some of your friends not take it very serious.  You know, they had different priorities going, and you know, they were rushing off to do other things, and I'm like, you know, "I'm going to enjoy this moment, you know.  When will we get this again?"  You know, I--somehow I had a sense of that.  And I don't know if it was just, you know, something that my parents, my grandparents taught me or, you know, or if it was just an inner sense I had about it.  But I knew that those were special years to take in, and I just--you know, to me, it was--it was the thing to do.
Story_ID: 68469
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in very many activities in school [Central High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was involved in cheerleading, and I think briefly I was in a few clubs, you know, where they would just--they were seasonal things for me.  I mean, I lose interest in them, but, like I was in a history club; I was in a service club, where you assist other students, you know.  Teachers would say, you know, "We could use some help with this student, tutoring, maybe some younger kids."  So I'd do things like that.  But I didn't want to do too much that would divert me from actually, you know, hitting the books.  I, for some reason, I just knew that that was the key.  I knew that was the key for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at this period of time, did you have any sense of what you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: In high school, yes.  I knew I wanted to go to college, but I wasn't--I kept toying with secretary, teacher, nurse.  And I think what was really strong--well, I had a really strong feeling to be a nurse when I was probably in eleventh grade I started thinking about "what courses do I need to take if I'm going to study nursing."  And then I said, "Well, but what would I take if I actually wanted to go into teaching?"  So I just mainly took college prep.  So that way, whichever way I went, I'd be okay.
Story_ID: 68470
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me about graduation.  What were you ready to do at graduation from high school [Central High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: At graduation (laughs), I had fell in love at graduation, believe it or not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --and I--the boy that I had all this affection for, he had gotten a football scholarship for Ball State [University in Muncie, Indiana], and he was supposed to be going to Ball State.  And so I thought, well, "I want to go to Ball State too."  And then somehow he ended up getting in some trouble, and he couldn't go to Ball State.  And so I thought, you know, "What to do, what to do."  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So you were already signed up to go to Ball State.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had put--sent my--what was it called?
Speaker 1: Application.
Speaker 2: Entrance--applicant's in, and I had been accepted at Ball State.  And I ended up--did--not going.  I didn't go.  I didn't go, 'cause I was all in love and just all heartbroken over this boy.  And so we got married instead.  And I thought "This would be a ticket out of the house, and then I won't lose him," 'cause somehow I had it in my mind that he'd be gone, you know.  It was just--I don't know--an eighteen-year-old's thinking, whatever.  So I kept thinking that I would still go to school.  And--but that first year, it was kind of tough 'cause he was working at the factory, Zollner, Pistons [Fred Zollner ran the Zollner Corporation in Fort Wayne and was founder and owner of the Zollner Pistons, who are now the Detroit Pistons], you know.  And he--hot and he was getting burned, you know, and he was coming home with these burns, and I'm like, "Oh, wow, this is not good."  And then there was the Vietnam War.  So he got drafted, and so I ended up just taking my allotment, the wife allotment and then I went out to Saint Francis College [University of Saint Francis in Fort Wayne, Indiana], and I started studying for a teaching career.  And then I moved back--I moved from Saint Francis College out here to IPFW [Indiana University- Purdue University in Fort Wayne] the next year.  So I went a year out there, 'cause they were very expensive and it was, like, taking all of my money.  So I thought, "Nah, I got to do something' different."  And so when I came out here, I started studying for teaching.  I gave up nursing.  And, of course, the marriage didn't last, 'cause, I mean, I don't know.  After you start learning things and your experiences are so different, you're just not the same people.
Story_ID: 68471
Speaker 1: Now, how long did he [Wilson's first husband] stay in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: He was there for--let's see.  He stayed in there for about two or three--about two-and-a-half years.  He ended up getting out on--what did he get out on-- something'--some kind of hardship thing that he just said he couldn't stand it; he was losing his mind or whatever.  And he said it was just so tough being there.  But I don't--it seemed like to me he didn't even sent out of the States, and he was just training or whatever, you know, right there in Fort Campbell and Fort Knox area.
Speaker 1: In Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And he kept saying, you know, how devastating it all was and that he couldn't take it.  But I think he had gotten caught up in, you know, that partying and drinking and, you know, drugs and things.  So when he, you know, finally get out, you know, I was--I had finished my degree [at IPFW; Indiana University- Purdue University in Fort Wayne], and I thought, "We don't have anything in common."  And, you know, so we went our separate ways.  But we did have--we had my son, Marlin [Adams].  I had Marlin when I was like in my second year of college.  So, when I got out of college, it was like everybody was--I mean, it's like all the jobs here in the area--'cause I switched my degree over to sociology--everybody had taken those jobs.  I mean it was like jobs were gone, and I was thinking "Now what to do," 'cause I didn't want to go very far from home, because I had--you know, my son was only three, my mom [Bernadine Cokes Young] and dad [Leonard Young] was helping me with him, and I thought, "Now, I need to find something here."  So the thought of leaving Fort Wayne just never occurred to me.  And so when Hank Sanders from the police department came out here on the campus, he was walking around the campus, and we had these fliers; and he says, "We're looking for police officers."  And he says, "It's a really good career if you have a college degree."  And he said, "We start you out at such and such amount of money."  And I'm going, "What?"  I mean, it was a lot more than what they were paying social work.  And so I was like, "Let me have one of them."  (laughs)  And so, even though I had no clue about what it would be like being a police officer, I thought, "I'm going to try it."  And so I, you know, put my application in and they called me and they said, "We got 200 applicants and we want you all to be at this building for this test."  And they had the test in one of the high schools, and we went over and took the test.  And they said, "We'll let you know after we see how you do on your test."  And they called me again.  They said, "Well, you did well on your test, and we want to know if you're still interested."  And I went and talked to the police captain, the one that was doing the interviewing, and he says, "Well, you just don't look like you would make a good police officer.  You just don't look very tough to me."  And here I thought (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --well, how tough can you be at twenty-four?  And, you know, and he's like, "You're not very big," and, you know, and he just was so negative.  And he went on and on and on.  And I was like looking at him, like, I said, "Yeah, but I need a job, and I got a son to support."  And, you know, I said, "And I'm divorced.  So, you know, what do you think?"  He--so he sits there and he looks at me and he's thinking and he goes, "You know what?  You wouldn't make a good police officer, but I think you'd probably be good in our dispatch area."  He said, "Would you be interested in that?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And so that's how I ended up on the fire department, because that--their dispatch area was made up of police officers.  They were half police officers, half of them; and the other half were firefighters.
Story_ID: 68472
Speaker 1: Somehow, they'd come up with that concept because the [Fort Wayne, Indiana] police paid the pension of the--of their dispatchers, and the fire paid the pension of their dispatchers even though we all had the same job; except they made a rule where only firefighters could dispatch fire equipment, which was, you know, kind of funny, 'cause then you always had to have the combination in the room.  And it was really interesting.  I mean, it really was, because when I went in there, at that time--I'm trying to think--it was just guys.  I'm trying to think.  The only woman there was his secretary.  And, you know, and we worked Monday through Sunday, twenty-four hours; and that center was open all the time.  And so I was on that shift of--every shift that they had for four years.  I mean, it was like you get what nobody else wants. And one of the fire chiefs, [Thomas E.] Tom Loraine, was one of the people that was instrumental in starting women in the fire department, because he came down and he talked to me, or at least he talked to one of my supervisors and said, "Well, you know, ask her if she'd be interested in going through our fire academy.  We really need some women go through this academy to see how they match up to the men."  He said, "But, you know, they're doing it in Indianapolis [Indiana] and, you know, a lot of the other big cities.  Fort Wayne needs to catch up."  So I told my supervisor, I said, "Sure."  (laughs)  I said, "Yes."  I said, "That would be exciting.  I want to try that."  I mean, you know, to me it's a learning experience.  And he said, "Well, what if you don't make it?"  He said, "You can always come back in dispatch."  So I thought, "What do I have to lose?  I go and try it, if I don't make it, I'll go back in dispatch."  So I go through the fire academy, which is a--the group of twelve, the dirty dozen that I was with.  And, you know, and they put us through all this rope training, and they start you out jogging.  You got to jog, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a real physical training.
Speaker 1: It's very physical.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking, I haven't been physical in years, and I'm like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) at one time (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --yeah, but how many years ago.  I'm think, "I can't do this."  I mean, I literally said, "I can't do it.  I'm going to quit."  And my son--let's see, old was he, Marlin [Adams]--at that time, he was probably about seven--seven or eight.  And then my little brother was about maybe nine.  And I took them and we went over to one of the school tracks.  And so when I leave the fire academy school, I get my gym shoes and take those two boys and we'd run around the track, 'cause I knew--I said, the only way I'm going to get this, I have got to build up my muscle and my endurance, 'cause I am just spent.  I mean, when I get to that academy and they say, "We want you to run down there and round there and back here," I was always the last one, you know.  Everybody else was back, I'm the last one, and I'm still gasping for breath an hour later.  So I thought, nah.  But I actually did build up my strength, and I ended up with an injured ankle out of the ordeal, but, you know.  I felt I had toughened up, you know.  I was ready for whatever they, you know, challenged us with to do, you know, we were able to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was--it was good.
Story_ID: 68040
Speaker 1: Now, then, tell us about training; fire training began, and I know that you were--there're several facts here we don't want to get away.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First of all, you were the first woman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --to be trained by the Fort Wayne [Indiana] Fire Department (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's absolutely correct.
Speaker 1: --and then you were the first black person to be trained by the Fort Wayne (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The first black female.
Speaker 1: All right.  Oh, they trained black males before?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So you were the first black female (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I was just the first female.
Speaker 1: Oh.  All right.
Speaker 2: They had--they didn't have any women when I came.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was very traumatic for this department, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --I think the men--from some of the comments I heard was, "This is a man's domain.  This is not for women.  This is not women's work.  This is hard work.  This is very heavy equipment, and we work in the most extreme of conditions.  It's just not a place where we want women, and we don't want to work in that close a proximity with women.  That's why we're firefighters."
Speaker 1: (Laughs).  They told you.
Speaker 2: And they said, "We have nothing against you, young lady, but we just don't think this is the kind of work you really want to do."
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And they--and they pretty much--you know, we went to the fire academy, the training chiefs were not saying those things.  They were saying this like, "You can do this," you know.  "It's physical, but you can learn to do this.  This is not something that's too hard for you to do."  Because I think someone had given them the philosophy that we really want some female to be successful.  And that was what I got.  That was what I could hear, the intent of their training and what they were saying was, "We need you to be successful."
Speaker 1: So that was the encouraging part of it.
Speaker 2: And I was encouraged, because they were like, "We need you to break the ice.  And we think you can do it."  And they said, "We're not going to cut you any slack.  This is hard.  This is physical.  You need to be up for the challenge.  You need to be able to get here, work at things that you're not good at.  We'll help you with the ropes.  We'll help you with tools.  We'll help you to learn the name of everything that you need to learn, but you got to be willing to put the work in."  So every night, you know, I'm taking the books home, and I'm looking at the tools and I'm trying to figure out what's this, what kind of wrench is this and what kind of, you know, tool is this that you're supposed to turn the hydrant with this one, and--.  You know, every tool on that truck, we needed to know, we needed to be able to test out for that.  And I'm going to be honest.  I just, the only thing I knew was a hammer and a screwdriver and a Phillips and a straight screwdriver.  I mean, I was like--I didn't know there was that many tools.  And that was difficult for me.  And the ropes were difficult for me because they were so big and they were--so, I mean, you know, you had to tie these knots and then I'm thinking, "Isn't a knot a knot?"  And they're like, "No."  You learn how to tie certain kinds of knots.  And they had a chimney knot, and they had a bowtie that they used for certain types of rescues.  And they said, "You got to be able to tie knots that don't come loose."  And they said, "This--you need to know how to do this in case.  You know, you may be the only one that can do it at that particular time.  You know, even though you are with a team, everybody needs to know how to do all the jobs, because you never know when somebody's incapacitated on the job.  So somebody has to come up and take their place."  So I was thinking, that was hard, because, you know, to go home and practice these knots and then, you know, and try to remember what knot is what, because you got to be able to demonstrate it.
Story_ID: 68041
Speaker 1: So it was just, you know, just the bookwork in itself was something that I just wasn't familiar with.  I wasn't familiar with anything to do with things like that.  My dad [Leonard Young] had tools, but they were all thrown in one little box.  You know what I mean?  They were all together.  I mean, he didn't say what they were.  So I had no clue.  But the young men that were in the class with me, most of them were, like, 20, 21.  At the time when I was going through, I was 27, and they were calling me "the old lady" and they had jokes and things like that.  But they were letting me be a part of their team.  They were actually bonding with me, which was exciting.  I mean, they were actually saying, "Yeah, you can do it.  We want you to be successful, because, you know, you're the one who's bringing all these news cameras around here and everything, and we don't want to them to say 'she failed and she didn't make it.'"  And so, you know, I had all of this encouragement going on, you know, even--whether they were for real or not, I thought they were.  So, whether it was real or not, it was real to me.  And I thought, "Okay.  I'm going to do it," you know.  And at that time, you had to--there was a four-story building on the academy ground, and everybody was required to jump at least from the fourth story into the--it's more like this (laughs) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a trampoline.
Speaker 1: Yes.  More like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --yes.  It's like a trampoline, but it's like a balloon.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So underneath (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Big airbag?
Speaker 1: Yes.  A big airbag, but this is what you see on top.  And so when you're four stories up and you look down, it really looks this big.  So you're thinking, "How am I going to jump in something that's not going to be big enough to catch me?" because your perception is different.  So here we are getting ready to jump, we know this is the day, you know, and you separate the boys from the men and whatever; the girls from the women, and I thought, "Wow."  So I didn't want to be last, and I didn't want to be first, so I had to figure out how do I get in the middle.  And so as we're going up, you know, I'm thinking--I have never jumped out of anything, not even a tree--so I'm thinking "I don't want to do this."  And when I saw that some of the guys were jumping out, some of the first guys to jump, they were just, you know, yelling, "Yay," you know.  And they were just really looking like it wasn't too bad.  So, like, I think I was like the fourth one out of twelve.  I decided I can't be five or six.  I got to be fourth 'cause otherwise I'm not going to do this.  I was already getting cold feet.  My hands were ice cold 'cause I was scared to death.  That was scary.  And I thought, "Okay.  Get up on the window, get on the window sill and jump, focus on hitting your rear end and your arms are up, keep your head up."  That was the idea.  So I'm taking breaths, I'm picturing that, and then I jump.  Oh, the worst headache I ever had.  I felt like my neck was going to snap.
Speaker 2: Did you hit head first or what did you do--
Speaker 1: I think when I hit, I think I must have been like--I must have been like an arrow.  I must have just went "qwoosh" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Did you hit it (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --because I felt my head flop back, and it was just, oh, the worst headache. I was like, "Oh."  And they said, "You don't have to jump again."  We're only required to have you jump once."  And they said, "Anybody that felt that they needed to go up again and they wanted to jump from the sixth floor to go ahead."  I said, "No way I'm going back up."  I was about ready to throw up.  And it wasn't even two years after our training class they outlawed it.  They outlawed that thing, 'cause they said that was extremely dangerous.  I said, "Uh-huh.  I knew it."  I said, "I sure knew it."  Because the (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --because the guy that had designed it was saying, you know, how perfectly safe it was and everything.  And I think he was the one that ended up breaking his neck.  Yeah.  I mean, that impact of that, jumping down from, you know, a height into that is such a jerk on your body.  I mean, your body just goes--like somebody just, you know, put you in some kind of machine or something and just went "whack."  And I'm like, "Huh-uh.  That's not good."  (laughs).  Too much gravity going there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So did you all practice for that at all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --at shorter heights?
Speaker 1: There was no practice.  There was just that test.  There was no practicing, because they figured if we practiced, we probably wouldn't jump.  I think they had psyched us out to say one jump and be done; go up, put your mind to it, get it done.  And I think they knew it was dangerous, extremely. But that's the device they used to rescue people? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That was the device that they used because they said, "You need to know how to talk people into jumping from a window if there is a fire.  And you can't talk anybody into it if you've never done it."  Uh-huh.  Whoa.
Story_ID: 68042
Speaker 1: And then the first fire that we had to go on, we had to leave the academy to go to it.  It was a fire at our--Concordia College [Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana], and the fire was in the basement.  And so when we--of course, the professional guys were already there, and they said, "We want the class in here because, you know, we pretty much knocked the fire down, but they need to experience a fire, you know, low like this one," 'cause the fire was right on the floor, and we had to crawl in there.  And that was my first experience, you know, with the fact this is real, this is not a set fire; this is something that's real, that really caught fire, and we didn't know where it was.  So we had to go in and search before the fire, you know, spread.  And it was so dark, so dark; and I thought, "I don't think I can do this."  And they're like, "Yes, you can.  Go ahead."  And I'm like, "No.  I don't want to go in," 'cause we had that air tank on your back and just felt like--like a truck.  I mean, you know, because here you got your adrenaline going, you're breathing hard, and then you got your equipment on, and you got this tank on your back, and you're supposed to get down and crawl.  I thought--that was a lot of weight.  But, you know, we got in.  We crawled in and we crawled out and, of course, it--you know, you had--even with your tank on, you still get some smoke, you know, in your system.  So you're coughing, and you got soot and everything, you know, inside of you when you come out.  So you can understand why firefighters end up with some of the illnesses that they do.  That's serious stuff.  And they used to not even have the tanks.  I couldn't imagine how did they go in and fight a fire without anything.  But they did.  They said they used to put fires out mostly from the outside before they had the tanks.  But they did have to try to go in and rescue people.  But now they fight fires from the inside out.
Speaker 2: You know, that's a tough job.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  So, it's dangerous.  But I don't remember any firefighter getting killed during the time I was there, anybody local.  I remember some people getting injured.  I remember one of the women falling off the ladder and guy fell on her and, you know, broke her leg, when she ended up not being able to fight fires after that.  But the majority of them, just tough old men.
Story_ID: 68043
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me about graduation from the [Fort Wayne, Indiana fire department] academy.
Speaker 2: Graduation was good.  I was so glad to be done and I made it.  And then--well, of course, they let us know that--I think, it seems like everybody made it in that class.  Yeah.  All twelve of us.  They all had their station assignments, so it was kind of sad that they were all going to a station, and I was going to the Fire Prevention Bureau.  But, you know, I thought, "Well, this is probably better, you know."  'Cause that is hard.  I'm thinking to myself, "That's hard work."  You know, how long could I do that versus if I wasn't in the Fire Prevention Bureau.  So I think overall, you know, that was a good deal, to go in there and then I ended up getting lots of training.  I mean, they send you to the National Fire Academy where you get more training.  And you were always going to some workshop or seminars and, you know, this was just good.  I mean, it was right up my alley of what I enjoyed.  And that's how I think I was able to think of things to help the department, 'cause I kept trying to think, you know, "Why am I here?"  You know, "Why did I have an opportunity actually be a part of this service?"  And so I was always thinking about that, and so--through all the training and everything.  So when I did the fire safety training at the National Fire Academy, it hit me.  It hit me.  I knew exactly what I was going to do to help Fort Wayne Fire Department.  And so when I came back, I talked to the chief.  I told the chief my idea about that I wanted to start a fire safety team.  I said, "And I would like use on-duty firefighters."  I said, "I think I have an idea how we can do it."  And I said, "Cause you would only have to use two people at a time and you just rotate them."  And I said, "Cause if I could train a team of at least 10 or 15," I said, "You would always have plenty of people."  And I said, "And in that way, your younger guys, who are coming into the department, would be able to stay active, you know, because that's kind of hard for people with that downtime, you know."  Firefighting has a lot of downtime 'cause you're sitting around.  It's not like you're going out setting fires and go put them out.  But, of course, you got to be ready when there is a fire.  But during the time there isn't a fire, you can only do so much training.  So I'm thinking, you know, this will be perfect for the younger people, because we had, you know, we had at least forty elementary schools with, you know, private and public, and I'm thinking, "This will be great.  Let's have these guys work.  Let's use this energy during school day time."  And so the chief, he kind of looked at me like, you know, he wasn't sure that I really, really had it together or if I really had a good proposal.  So he said, "Well," he said, "If you can get"--what did he say?  "If you can get ten guys to volunteer for it, then I'll let you go ahead and try it."  He said, "It will be an experiment."  And I think--the feeling I got was, from the chief, that I wouldn't be able to get anybody to do it (laughs).  You know how you can just kind of tell, just the way he said it.  You know, I felt like, oh, I said, "The chief doesn't think I can get anybody to do it."  I said, "But I know.  I just feel this.  This is really exciting."  I said, "I can"--it's like I wake up in the morning and I already could see it.  I could see the guys actually doing these programs.  And so I went around to the engine house, you know, with my idea, sharing it with the guys, and I ended up getting eighteen guys to sign up.  I mean, I went around to each station.  There was thirteen of them at that time.  I ended up getting eighteen volunteers.  I was like, "Yes."  So that was like at least having more than one from each station.  And that was perfect, because in that way, whatever area, you know, I was in for the school, the city would still be covered with firefighters.
Speaker 1: So this went on to be fairly successful?
Speaker 2: This was a very, very successful program.
Story_ID: 68044
Speaker 1: Actually, that program ended up with the development of Safety Village [Fort Wayne, Indiana], where the fire and the police together developed that village.  And that village is still in operation today.  As a matter of fact, they had an article in the paper this weekend about Safety Village, and firefighters donated $15,000 worth of those little cars.  So they got little fire Jeeps that the kids can ride in around the Safety Village.
Speaker 2: Now, that's like a--Safety Village is a model (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's a model city.
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: A little model city, village.
Speaker 2: How small is it?  Is it like--or what it is?  Can you walk around in it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You can walk around in it.  It's--how many acres?  I think it's four acres.
Speaker 2: Okay.  With buildings that kids can go in?
Speaker 1: And the buildings are of course not built to scale, but they are realistically built, you know, with the--where the kids actually, you know, look up at the one and say, "Oh, yeah.  That's the skyscraper and that's the police station, and that's the fire station, and that's the bakery."  And then they have like a little railroad in there and a bridge and a little pond area.  And then they have like a farm area in that village.  So they got rural, residential, business, and then, of course, they have the two--the learning area where they would go for their class.  So whether they're learning bicycle safety or they're learning fire safety, or they're learning--just being, you know, how to protect themselves as kids from danger, and that sort of thing.  So the car idea came from the police department having the police cars for the kids to ride around in.  So when we first was a part of Village, all the police kids that were there for training, they got to ride in the police cars; and all the Fire Safety kids that were there for Fire Safety, they'd just stand there and look and go, "We want to ride in a car."  And it was funny, 'cause the police department would say, "No, they can't ride in our cars.  They have to come back for our programs.  So they were very competitive.  So I thought this is neat.  Years down the road, now they're getting fire Jeeps (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: I never envisioned it, but that's good.  I liked it.
Story_ID: 68045
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now.  So how many years--now, you're not--no longer with the fire department?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I retired seven years ago [1995].
Speaker 1: And how many years had you been on?
Speaker 2: Twenty.
Speaker 1: Twenty years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you retired with a full retirement from them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a good career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good benefits and that sort of (simultaneous) (unclear)
Speaker 2: Could have been fifths.  Yep.  And they take care of their own.
Speaker 1: Were you able to see other women coming on the fire department?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One--the other lady that came on after me, she didn't go through the fire academy, but ended up going--coming from dispatch over the Fire Prevention Bureau.
Speaker 1: Who made her go through the academy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They didn't make her go through.
Speaker 1: So how many women have gone through the academy?
Speaker 2: Oh, they have a lot now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They probably--before I left the department, there were at least sixteen females they had hired.  And they had retrofitted the fire stations with double, you know, showers and, you know, the separate bedroom--bedroom area.  And so they were ready.   They--you know, and I felt like, "Did I have anything to do with that?  Did I help them with that at all?"  You know, I'm thinking probably not, since I wasn't in the engine house, they didn't have to worry about it then, but at least it gave them something to think about, 'cause we did have some sessions with the wives of the fire fighters, and they had the fire chaplain that got us all together, you know, where they could talk to me, and the women could ask questions, and the men could ask questions.  And they brought in a female firefighter from--I think she was from Tennessee, Nashville.  And I'll never forget when she came in with her captain, and they were sharing how it worked in Tennessee, you know.  "In Nashville, we work in the engine house together, we cook together, we--you know, we fight fires, and we come back and we do training together, and there's no problem," you know.  "They have their families, we have--I have my family.  We go home to our families, and then when it's time to come to work, we come back."  I mean, it was just amazing how they were trying to share and calm the fears of Fort Wayne [Indiana] at that time about, you know, how it's okay.  You know, "You'll be able to do this."  I'll never forget that.  I think they had like three or four meetings where they'd bring, you know, people in and let them ask questions.  Of course, I had to go because, you know, being on the department.
Story_ID: 68046
Speaker 1: You were getting ready to tell us about one negative experience, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You were just (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The most negative experience was the one female who came after me, and she came in the Fire Prevention Bureau, and she had become our--what they call them--Fire Prevention Chief.  So she became director of that department.  And she started making changes, and she had a lot of good ideas, but, you know, the fact that she just came in and just was kind of running roughshod over everybody, and then especially me, I mean, it just seemed--I felt so targeted.  And I, you know, tried to talk to her about it.  And she was just, you know, very closed and didn't want to talk about it.  And it just seemed like she had a mission.  But it didn't seem to be going, you know, where I was going to benefit from it, so I thought.  I didn't know what else to do.  So what I ended up doing is, I end up going to Metro, which is run also by the City [Fort Wayne, Indiana], and I didn't have a good feeling about them, 'cause I'm think, "Well, how would the City prosecute the City?" because she works for the City.  But I thought I got to do something, because she's not going to stop.  And I had talked to other coworkers about it, and they were all saying, "I don't think it's anything you can do unless you go to court."  And I thought, "But I don't want to go to court.  I don't have any money to go to court, I don't want to go to court, and I don't know if I trust the court."  And they said, "Well, you got to start with Metro."  So I go to Metro, you know, and they run me through all this paperwork, which, in the first place, was discouraging.  I mean, three days' worth of paperwork to just file a complaint.  And I, you know, I kept saying to them, you know, "Can't--is there a way that we can, you know, kind of work through some of this?  Can you guys tell me what you think?"  "No, no, no.  We can't tell you what we think.  We, you know, we can only take your application, and then we can have a hearing."  I mean, just very cold.  And I thought, "Oh, this is not good."  And so it ended up, they had the hearing.  They had Evelyn, the lady, and they had all the city attorneys, and they sat me over on one side; made me feel like I was this big.  And all these people sat on the other side of the table; more or less like "You're on trial here."  And I thought, "There's something wrong with this picture.  This is not going to work."
Speaker 1: Did you have any attorney with you?
Speaker 2: They wouldn't let you have any attorney, 'cause that's supposed to be your--this is supposed to be your, you know, your application about your complaints.  So you don't get an attorney.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --you have to go through this step before you can go through the attorney route.  So, in other words, that's to ice you out, you know.  If you get cold feet enough, you're not going to go any further than that.  And I think that's what that was all about.  It was very posturing--they were posturing.  And you could feel it.
Story_ID: 68047
Speaker 1: Now, did it--I mean, how did it affect you?  Did you continue to fight it or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I felt that I wanted to try another step.  So I ended up filing with the Metro of Indianapolis [Indiana].  So I asked that I, you know, get a referral to them, because I wanted someone, you know, to at least look at it where I think it would be more fair, maybe, to send it there.  Well, they did the same thing.  The Metro in Indianapolis, they did that same posturing that Fort Wayne [Indiana] did.  You know, it's like, you know, get you to throw it out.  And I kept telling them, "No, I don't want to throw it out.  I want you guys to actually look at this, you know, to see if this is right?  Should this happen?"  And they just--they let the time run out.  So, you know, you don't have a clue unless you actually know how that works.  Unless you have an attorney.  And they keep telling you, "Well, no.  You--attorneys aren't involved in this.  This is--that you have to let Metro go through their part first," which is--"Yeah, you let the clock run out."  So the clock ran out.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then, of course, I mean, do you want to pursue, still?  No.  It's already been painful.  It's three years of pain.  There's no win.  How do you win?  So I thought no way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--police departments and fire departments are notoriously hard to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You--how are you going to go in there and fight against somebody?  I mean, if they're in there and that's their job, they're your supervisor and they're right; you are wrong.  You can't show physical damage to you.  You haven't lost any pay.  Oh, that drove that nail.  They drove that nail in that coffin.  I mean hard, just like "phew."  It was very painful for my family, because, you know, I had to put my husband through that, and I had to go to work with all this--you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You're an upbeat person (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  And, you know, and it starts to pull on you.  You know, it starts to nag at you.  And, you know, and I did.  I felt like I need drugs (laughs).  You know, it's like, "How do you do this?"  It's like carrying a weight around.  But, you know, the good thing that came out of all that was, you know, that person decided to target somebody else when they got bored with me, thank God, and she ended up coming to me, you know, later and, you know, saying how she, you know, she had had some changes in her life and she personally wanted to make some amends about some things she had done.  She had lost her sister and, you know, and she was dealing with grief with that, and she asked me if I would please forgive her.  And she knew that she was wrong, and she knew what she did was wrong, because she could do it.  She could get away with it.  And, you know, and I said, "Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Bygones be bye," you know.  "Good-bye."  And, you know, and she and I became the best friends.  You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: We just--I mean, it was like, not immediate, but I started to trust her and I started to actually, you know, let her into my space.  And we became the greatest friends.  But she did leave the fire department very bitter--very, very bitter, because some of the same stuff she did to me, it ended up happening to her.  It was so odd.  I never thought it would happen to her, but it did, because that--males--you know, that male kind of spirit that says "you don't get to do this and you don't get to do this because you're a female" started to affect her.
Speaker 1: Where they had to have a system that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --both the police and fire departments in most cities are linear (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if you're on top, you're really on top (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --if you're not there, you're not.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: And if you have trouble with somebody at the top, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They will put the thumb on you.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: And that's what happened to her.  They decided to stop her, and she--I guess she started to feel what she had, you know, done to me.  And she started to feel really bad.  I mean, and I knew she meant it.  She wasn't kidding.
Speaker 1: That process that they--the complaint process is never really designed to really work.
Speaker 2: It don't work.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I can tell you that.  It don't work.  You better have a broken limb, a hole in your head and, you know, something.  But don't just come in there saying "They're doing me wrong."
Speaker 1: Now, that occurred at what point in your career in the fire department?
Speaker 2: That was--I'd say that was right about the time that I was district chief at the time, and I was working on--that was when the fire department was going through some moves.  They were moving out of the city county building, and they were moving the fire chief's office around quite a bit.  It's like they couldn't figure out what they want to do with the fire chief's office, you know.  First they moved him to the garage, and then they moved him to the fire station; then, you know, the biggest one.  Then they still don't know what they're going to do with him.  So the rest of us that are in Fire Prevention Bureau are moving all over the place.  You know, we ended up being in some space with the hospital.  Then they ended up putting us in the firehouse, our office, some of us.  And they just couldn't figure out.  And so all that was happening at the time when we're moving all over the place.  And I think it might have been around 1989.
Speaker 1: And you say you've been there (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So it was sort of like on (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --on the--yeah.  Yeah.  It start--that's when that was going on.  It's kind of weird.  And so you get commendations and awards two years before it, and now in 1989, you're filing a Metro suit?  Something's not right.
Story_ID: 68048
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your decision to retire, did it have anything to do with the politics of the fire department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  My decision was to retire in twenty years.  I pretty much, you know, had that in mind all along.  Twenty years and out, because after you've gone through your twenty-year period, there's such a turnover of people.  So you've got all these, you know, very, very young people; and you've got all these very, very old people.  So it's like, I didn't want to get caught up into that.  You know what I mean?  It was kind of negative, 'cause some of the old guys taught me, "Don't stay that long."  (laughs).  'Cause they got to be very negative.  I mean, they were like really griping and not able to keep up with the, you know, the young guys.  So I thought I don't want to get caught into that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Go get out.
Story_ID: 68049
Speaker 1: So, what are you going to do--what are you doing next?  Now, you're working for the probation department?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what do you--do you have any plans for the future?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: After the probation department?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, what do you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --what's your--you're still young.  You've got (unclear)--you know, you got a (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I, you know, I like to work at the probation department as long as I feel that I have something to offer them.  And, you know, I just kind of see myself always doing something.  I don't see myself not doing something.  So I think if I'm not working, you know, at a job where I'm drawing a paycheck or whatever, I think I'm working at something that I really love.  So I would say I probably still would be doing something for children, 'cause I do enjoy children, and I enjoy seeing them grow and mature.  And I think that I have a gift for getting children to listen to me.  And so I see myself still doing something in that area.
Story_ID: 68050
Speaker 1: Okay.  And if you had it to do all over again, would you do the same thing? (Pause)
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think I (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: What would you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --I think--I think--I think I probably would have if I could do it all over with the experience and knowledge, that I probably would have tried more stuff, you know.  I think I probably would have tried more challenging things.  I probably would have, you know, pretty--tip my hat a little bit higher than what I did.  I think I was comfortable with being pretty conservative in a way, even though I did some very challenging things that most women that I knew wouldn't do.  But at the same time, I was pretty conservative.  And I say that to them, and they're like, "Nah.  I think you were pretty outgoing."  And I said, "No.  I was very conservative," because I was able to really be able to calculate what I was going to do before I did it.  That's very conservative, you know.  Because the police department could lay out to me, "This is what--these are your steps.  This is what you need to do."  The Fire Academy, they're saying, you know, "You have a safety net.  If you don't go through here, you're not going to lose your fire dispatcher job."  I was very conservative.  And so, you know, I don't think I did anything extraordinary.  But I think, you know, with the experience of being around some very extraordinary people and learning a lot of extraordinary stuff, I probably would be a lot more outgoing, you know.  I'd probably dive in there into something.
Story_ID: 68051
Speaker 1: Now, what do you do--what do you think is the future for our--the future for black people in terms of fire prevention?  I mean, do you see a lot more black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --entering into it?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, even before I left the department [Fort Wayne Fire Department in Indiana], there were lots of black people in the fire prevention, fire safety; and, you know, we were meeting them all over the country.  We would go to the National Fire Academy and we were meeting people, you know, all over the United States.  And, of course, it was just--it was a field that was opened up.  They were being accepted in the field and, you know, people were saying, hey, they can do the job, let them.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It has opened up.
Speaker 1: --you know, what do you--what concerns--well, what special concerns do you think the black community has in terms of fire safety?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the black community has--still has a lot of concerns with fire safety because of the fact that they do live in housing, very poor housing.  And a lot of times, they are renters, and the electrical systems are not that good.  And as far as the ability for some of those places to catch fire, I mean, you know, it would just go rampant throughout some of those homes because of, you know, the very poor construction and the poor conditions that those homes are in.  So they are definitely high risk for having fires, and therefore, if they're high risk for having fires, they're going to be high risk for having fire fatalities.
Story_ID: 68052
Speaker 1: Actually, I didn't share this part with you about mom [Bernadine Cokes Young], our--  my older sister.  There was one other sister who--she caught her dress on fire at a wood burning stove in that rural farm house that we lived in.  And I probably was--I think Mom said I was one--one or maybe one and a half.  And she'd say, you know, how--there was no way I could remember her.  And I said, "But, Mom, I do remember her."  I said, "I don't know if I remember her because if you were talking about her or about you talking about the fire and how she caught her dress on fire," I said, "but somehow, I remember her."  I said, "I remember her picking me up."  And my mom, you know, she's like, "You couldn't remember her 'cause, you know, what memory would you have at that age?"  And I said, "I don't know, but I remember her."  I said, "Because when you talk about her, it's like I can see her."  And she died, you know, from that wood burning stove fire.  And it was so strange, 'cause one day when I was sharing my fire safety story with--I don't know, it was third graders or second graders, but it was young kids.  And I was trying to give them an example of, you know, what it would be like if they had a family member that got burned or got hurt in a fire.  And all of a sudden, it just came out.  I said, "I think that's probably why I really enjoy teaching this, is because of my sister."  I said, "It's like, you know, I lost her before I ever got to know her."  And then I realized I never shared that story before.  Why, you know--I never even spoke that to my family.  And there it was coming out right in that program.  And it was so emotional.  I mean, it was, like, I gave them something of myself that I hadn't given to anybody.  And it was--it was very freeing.  It was a very freeing experience.  So, you know.

Speaker 1: So your parents [Bernadine Cokes Young and Leonard Young] got a chance to see you become a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --firefighter?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My dad and I, we've had big discussion about it, 'cause I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: --I did--I did try to be the fire chief in 19--what was it--1988?  No.  That was when I got district chief.  But, there was an opportunity to apply for the fire chief.  This mayor decided that you all, any of you who wanted to apply for the fire chief job, to come and put your application in, and I'll interview you.  And so, I, of course, I was the only female again, but there were other women at the time.  And so I applied for it, and I told my dad about it.  And he just looked at me like, "No, you didn't.  You cannot be a fire chief.  What do you think?  You cannot."  I mean--and we just--I was like, "You got to be kidding me?"  I said, "Dad, I am so upset with you right now."  I said, "If you don't even believe that I can be a fire chief, how will the mayor think I can be a fire chief?"  He got really quiet.  He didn't say any more.  It was a moment.
Speaker 1: You think he was just overwhelmed by it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think it is just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The idea?
Speaker 2: --I think it was just the idea to him.  "You need to be woman," you know.  "You're a girl, not a guy."  And, you know, you just kind of hear that.  Yep.  That was the first time he ever said anything about me being a firefighter that I could tell that he was not totally accepting.
Speaker 1: How did your mother feel?
Speaker 2: She didn't have a lot to say 'cause, you know, she always say, "Well, look like you're doing well.  You're getting--people are recognizing you and they're listening to you and I heard you.  You seem to know what you're talking about."  (laughs)  Mom says, "You like to talk, so."
Story_ID: 68054
Speaker 1: This is--well, you know, you kind of, you know, created this milestone, I guess (unclear) in the history of the city at Fort Wayne, but I mean, how do you--do you see yourself as having a legacy or leaving a legacy behind (unclear)?  Or what do you think your legacy would be?
Speaker 2: I never thought of that.  Never thought of that as a legacy.  I like to think that I shared something.  I think I shared something.  And I think the kids were really excited.  I mean, what really got my attention was when kids were really excited about the fact that I was a firefighter.  That just--I mean it was just something about them being so excited about that.  "You're really a firefighter?  You really--is that your boot?  Those are your coats?"  I mean, it's just something about those kids, you know, get excited about it.  And when--one teacher actually had it as a question on a test.  I mean, that made me kind of wonder, "Wow, people just really take this stuff really far," you know, and all I'm thinking about is--it was a question on a test, you know, and the answer was "Genois Wilson is the right answer."  "Who was the first woman firefighter of Fort Wayne [Indiana]?"  That really drove it home.  I was like thinking, "Oh, maybe, just maybe, you know, you made history here."
Story_ID: 68055
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a slightly different question, but how would you like to be remembered?  I know it's a long way off before the people will just have to remember you, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  Well, I'd like to be remembered as someone who had compassion and cared and loved and could take a challenge without, you know, being upset if she failed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we thank you very much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --Genois.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Larry.
Story_ID: 68056
Speaker 1: When I got married in January to [Laurence] Larry Wilson, that's when I became Genois Wilson.  That's at my mom's [Bernadine Cokes Young] house, and they decided to make a real big deal out of it.  But we were just gonna get married (laughs).  And they--they decided to have food and stuff.  And in the background there you can see my brother standing there with the brown on, and you can see my mom with that light blue, and then you can see one of my brother's girlfriends standing there with the shades on and probably my son [Marlin Adams] standing up there with--right there in the foreground there to my left.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  'Cause he was very overwhelmed (laughs).  He was like, "What are you doing?  Getting married?  What's that mean?  My name's still gonna stay the same, right?"  (laughs).
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's when I became dispatcher for Fort Wayne [Indiana] Communications.  I was a fire dispatcher, but I could also dispatch police equipment, and they didn't have women uniforms, so I had got a guy's shirt, small, and tie.  None of it fits (laughs).
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  What year is this?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's Mom and me, and we're at a celebration where--this is Zeta Phi Beta group, recognized me that year as Woman Achiever.  So that was kind of nice.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  What year was it?
Speaker 2: And I think 1988.  It's probably on one of those clippings, 'cause I put one of those in there.  Is it on the back?
Speaker 1: I think it's on the back.  Hold on, 1988, mother and daughter.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That is a family gathering, and we're in Kansas, Missouri.  That's me and my dad [Leonard Young] next to me; my mom next to my dad; and my brother, Kenneth, next to my mom.  We were at one of those Cokes' family meetings.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's fire training.  That's 1979.  We are on--over by our coliseum in Fort Wayne, and we're training, figuring out how to lay out hose (laughs).  And it is cold.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: Can't think of what that's--that's Fire Prevention Week, and I think, Larry, if you'd look on the back, it should be a date.  But we are over at the Fire Museum, and we are actually--I think I was probably a captain there.
Speaker 1: It says (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh.  That--his mom--I'm guessing, since I was a captain, 'cause I don't have any chief bars on.  I am--it would probably be 1986, '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Great.  Next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --Dad.  Yeah.  I was going to say see if there's dates on there.  Ya'll testing my memory here.  Yep.  That's Father's Day at my house.  We're sitting out by the back there, and I got him a pocketknife that time, and he was just real excited because I fixed breakfast for him at my house, and he drove over and ate breakfast with me that morning.  This other guy there.  That's Marlin, that's my son, Marlin Adams.  And Marlin, we were having a celebration at one of our--what do you call them--one of our centers here.  And we were celebrating him coming home from the Marines, and we decided to make it into a--kind of a festive thing with the theme.  And I think we even had a little program.  It was fun.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Village--that's a class of a group of kids that won the poster contest, Fire Safety Contest, and that's the mayor at that time.  There's [Fort Wayne] Mayor [Walter Paul] Helmke [Jr.] back there, became mayor in 1988.  And then there's the fire chief, Bob Barnes; and then it's myself and my assistant who was the captain.  And that's all I can remember about them.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Spell Helmke, please.
Speaker 1: H-E-L-M-K-E.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  The name of the library here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think some of his kin.  That's me and my niece, Kendra.  Kendra graduated from high school that year, and that should have been, I'd say, 1990.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Verna (ph)--Doctor Verna Adams.  She was very important in my life.  She was my sixth grade teacher.  She was my mentor.  We took that picture last Christmas.  So we talk occasionally.  And, you know, it's was kind of fun.  We got together in one of the restaurants out near where we live.  We both live south.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: The top photo is Jan Kingsberry (ph) and Jack Bushure (ph).  And Jack and Jan were a part of the hearing impaired educating for the students who were integrated with the other students.  And Jan was a teacher, Jack was kind of the one that checked their hearing.  And down at the bottom photo, that's Jack and me testing one of the hearing impaired kids to see if he could pick up any of the audible sounds of the two detectors that I'm holding.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: That was just one of our pictures that I put in there.  Of course, you can see the bars (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: --are not bugles (laughs).  So I'm a captain there, so.  Platoon captain.
Story_ID: 68057
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a photo of the Fort Wayne [Indiana] fire women in 1986.  The one in the middle with the maternity dress was working in the Fire Prevention Bureau, they had placed her on light duty.  And the Fire Department was learning a lot about the complexity of having women and even when they're nursing.  So that was interesting.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: We were just kind of playing around there.  This is one of the educators that did the Fire Safety Program.  I supervised him, and right now I can't think of his name, but we're at the fire station downtown on Main Street.  And the photo just to the left below is the team of firefighters that I was in the Fire Academy with, and we all made it, except for--there was only one firefighter that ended up--that was in that academy--that ended up in some kind of an accident, a tragic accident.  We weren't sure, but it didn't have anything to do with the Fire Department.  And right--to the right of it is Dan Moresio (ph), another one of the firefighters that I trained to do Fire Safety Programs, and he sent a card of himself and his children, Anthony and Ashley, for that Christmas.  And down below there is a picture of--at the National Fire Academy, one of the other firefighters that was there for class.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That--
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Could you (unclear), please.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  The top two photos (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Just the mayor.
Speaker 1: --just the mayor?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Yes.
Speaker 1: The mayor--when [Winfield "Win" Moses, Jr.] Moses nominated me to be one of the Women of Achievement for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] that year, and then the photo to the left--to the right of that--is the woman that was the speaker for that program.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: Which one, this one?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  The other one was just-
Speaker 1: Article did that--our local newspaper did on women, and they were just showing women in various occupations.  As you see, the one at the top was--oh, she was a coach--female; she is the female coach for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  We just want to focus in on you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  --so just describe you.
Speaker 1: And then, of course, they had me in there where it's showing me in front of the Fire Safety Village.  And that's the Survive Alive House in the background.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Survive Alive House.  That's with the Fire Safety Education Team.  As you can see, that's in '94 [1994].  So you have the house where we trained the kids on how they escape a fire.  And in that house, we could actually create a smoke atmosphere, and we could actually create a similarity to what it would be like in a fire, the confusion.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Great.  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay. That was preschoolers that I'm talking to there.  I'm relaying to them about what kinds of things they can do to keep themselves safe and how they can help themselves if they're not safe if they do actually accidently burn themselves or if they actually end up in a fire and they can't find Mom or Dad.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  What year approximately?
Speaker 1: I'm guessing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --there's--those are not chief bars (unclear).  Those are platoon.  So I'm gonna say 1987.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Right.  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't know of these.  Should we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's a prop that we use for--to help the kids to learn.  Yeah, there is a glare in there.  It's too shiny.  Oh, pull this down.  Does that come down?
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  If you would step back so I don't see your shirt in it, please.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) background?
Speaker 1: You see my shirt?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  No, I'm talking to Larry.
Speaker 1: Oh.  You're too far away.  Step back, but you're okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a reflection (unclear).
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Yeah.  That's look good.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's where we're doing Fire Safety at the Fort Wayne library, and we had a prop to simulate what it would be like crawling through smoke, 'cause we wanted to create the--what do you call it--like, claustrophobic kind of atmosphere.  So we had, like, the tunnel.  And then once they crawled through the smoke, then we had them rolling and pretending that if they did catch on fire, what would they do.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Great.  Next.
Speaker 2: Now, this right here?  No, you want this one.  This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's a class.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: The second row--oh, say it again?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a class at the National Fire Academy in '76 [1976], and I'm in the second row there, the first one on your left.  And we were--I think what we were studying was the Public Fire Education, how to present programs and that sort of thing.  And those classes--that was a--I think that was only a one-week class.  We were only there for a week.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: It's funny how you're seeing all these people.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Top left, these are a couple of female firefighters, that we were just sitting around after a Women Fire Safety Conference that we hosted here in Fort Wayne.  That was in 1986.  And then on the right is one of my coworkers that I worked with in the Fire Prevention Bureau, Dean Early.  And down below, that's in the office of Safety Village.  It was kind of nice 'cause it was a brand-new office, and so we decided to take a picture.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: That's it.
