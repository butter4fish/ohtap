Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.   Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm Malcolm Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.].  That's M-A-L-C-O-L-M, H-E-M-P-H-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a middle name or a--
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Montjoy, M-O-N-T-J-O-Y, and I am a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind Montjoy?  It's an unusual middle name so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there is, yes, there is, yes, there is.  Actually, it's a surname.  My dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.], a relative of his in Kentucky, and in Kentucky now when I had visited there, and I've met relatives there.  They are a large group of people there who are Montjoys.  And I didn't do any research at all, but while there, I did find out that there was a number of Montjoys there.  And that was my father's middle name.  He was from Hickman, Kentucky.  A great number of them were very fond of my dad, but I never really found out just how the Montjoy in his name came to be.  But I'm very proud of it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 24th, 1931.  I was born in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm retired.  I retired from the Chicago Public Schools [CPS].  I've, I've been retired now for eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a number of things for the Chicago Public Schools, most of which I enjoyed thoroughly.
Speaker 1: Now, you were a physical education instructor, coach, and assistant principal, and principal, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's correct, yes, I was.  I started in, in the gym as a physical education instructor at Burke Elementary School [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] on the South Side of Chicago where I met my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill].  And from there, I went to a number of schools.  But we were substituting then, so you didn't have a choice.  So, wherever they send you, you went.  And for me, it was one of the most learning experiences I had because I got an opportunity to see what other people were doing in the gym.  And though I didn't always get a job in the gym, I went wherever they sent you.  And that may be kindergarten, it may be eighth grade, it may be education, special education, but my field was physical education, health and physical education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is May 31, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at 6936 South Euclid [Avenue], my home now for thirty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, we failed to mention--yes, we're just trying to mention the occupation.  If somebody's watching us later on, they'll probably want to know upfront something to watch out for.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were--were you the first black official in the Big Ten [Conference], or one of the first, right?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was maybe the third--perhaps Art White being the first.  A young man out of Detroit [Michigan] preceded me as the third.  But, no, there was another gentleman, Jim Robinson, who lived in Minnesota, and still lives in Minnesota, was there also.  But I think what they did then, as they sometimes still do, they, because each conference has a directory, and they had pictures in the directory, so it would not seem so obscene, they would have some pictures of folk who actually didn't work a full schedule.  Jim, as good as an official as he was, never really got a full schedule--
Speaker 1: So, but he was--
Speaker 2: --but they always had his picture in, in the booklet.
Speaker 1: His picture integrated the book.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So, there were four of us really, but two really first worked, and I guess I was the third to, to get a full schedule.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I just wanted to establish that before we went on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 284379
Speaker 1: Now, before we really go into depth, we ask five basically lightweight questions that are part of our routine and not, you know.  First one is and they all require just a short answer--these questions.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a favorite food.  I have a favorite meal, which would be string beans, boiled white potatoes, tomatoes, fresh onions, and big glass of iced tea, cornbread, peach cobbler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think beige probably, and I don't know why that's true.  But I guess because my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] has the house decorated in beige, but I, I like beige, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer, without a doubt.  Unquestionably, summer is my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like the outdoors and, obviously, in Chicago [Illinois], we don't get a whole lot of that, so when I can take advantage of the weather, I thoroughly enjoy it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I guess, as of, as of the last few years, Cancun, Mexico.  We have a little timeshare space there, so that we can go and spend a week and enjoy the warm weather.  And here, later, we've been able to take our children, their husbands, and our new little grandson, so it's a favorite spot for both of us at this point, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.  If I do, I'm not aware of what it is I say.  I'm certain that I say something with such regularity that people attach that to me, but I don't know that I do.  I don't think so though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know.
Story_ID: 284380
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history now.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] side of the family.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Surely.  My mother's name was Mary Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: H-E-M-P-H-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dickey?
Speaker 2: D-I-C-K-I-E [sic. Dickey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Mary Elizabeth is spelled the regular way?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 4--gosh, I can't think of my mother's birth year.  My mother's been deceased now for thirty, thirty-three years, yeah.  I can't think of her birth year.
Speaker 1: What do you--do you, can you get as close to it--how old was she when she passed?
Speaker 2: She--well, I'm, I'm seventy-three, and she was twenty years older than I am, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, if, if I was born in '31 [1931]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's about 1910 or 1911?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ten [1910] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, it had to be 1910 [sic. 1911].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, um-hm, she would have been, she would have been ninety-three now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Dyersburg, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Just Dyers--
Speaker 2: Dyers-, Dyersburg.
Speaker 1: Dyersburg?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.  I, I have it downstairs, but you need it for this.
Speaker 1: It's D-I-E-S-?
Speaker 2: D-, no, D-Y-.
Speaker 1: D-Y-?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's D-Y-S-B-U-R-G [sic. Dyersburg], Dye, D-Y-S, Dyesburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have it downstairs if, you know.
Speaker 1: Is it G at the end or G-H?
Speaker 2: G-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Dyersburg, Tennessee, okay.  And well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of--first of all, I mean, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: My mother was an only child.  Oh--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was an only child.  And her parents, my grandfather, was a barber, Steve Dickey.  He was a barber, as classy and old gentleman as you would ever want to meet.  He always worked in a shirt and tie.  He had a difficulty in speaking because we didn't--I don't know what really caused it, but he, he couldn't open his mouth fully.  But it, it didn't impede his speech, but it did when he attempted to eat.  And sometimes, he had difficulty putting the fork, and getting the food to his mouth.  A very, very classic guy, very, very classic guy.  He had a barbershop on, on 46th [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and I learned so much from him as a kid.  And I guess perhaps that was why I had little difficulty with the movie, 'Barbershop,' because I found out that when I worked in the barbershop shining shoes in that barbershop with my grand-dad, I learned so much from those old guys who came in there who told stories.  Sometimes they embellished a bit on them, I now know.  But, historically, they gave me such a perspective of, of life in the black community, the kinds of things that they were doing, the kinds of things that they experienced.  And I was totally in awe of those gents.  And my grandfather seemed to have been the kingpin of all of that because he was so knowledgeable.  And he was proud of the fact that he could tell them things that they didn't know.  And they would often take him to task, but they'd sometimes come back.  And a couple of guys would come to the barbershop every day, you know, and they'd get a haircut maybe every two weeks.  But they'd come to the barbershop every day, and every day they came, and it was a learning experience for us.  It was just phenomenal.  But that was my grand-dad.  He was a dapper, dapper guy.  I loved him.
Story_ID: 284381
Speaker 1: Did he [Hemphill's grandfather, Steve Dickey] talk about, or any of your relatives on your mother's [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] side, talk about where they came from?  I mean, did they talk about like--I mean, how far back in history did they talk about, you know, that you know?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I guess I'm, I'm like some of us.  When they're, when they're telling you those kinds of things if, at that point, you aren't really interested in it, you may tend not to absorb it all and see the importance of it.  So, some of those kinds of things that they talked about at home went past me, and I suspect primarily because I, you know, it just wasn't hitting me well.  But, no, they didn't really tell me a lot to say, you need to know this.  My grandfather had three brothers.  And their mother and father were such forceful people that each of them did something.  He had one brother who was a physician.  Another brother, who was a minister and soon became a residing elder, a very bright man, very, very bright man, and--
Speaker 1: What was he--a Methodist?
Speaker 2: Methodist, A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal.  Frank Dickey [ph.] was his name.  Also dynamite guy, fun guy, fun guy, if you were to meet on the street, or if you were in a room with him, the last thing you'd think him to be would be a minister, just a really, really down-to-earth guy, and much like my grandfather.  He was a dapper kind of guy, too, but you would never guess him to be a minister.  But once in a pulpit, you got a, you got a full, full-fledged Frank Dickey, yeah.  And the other brother was Albert Dickey, John Albert Dickey [ph.].  He was a physician, a fine physician.  I remember him well because he would come to Chicago [Illinois] and stay with us when they had medical conventions here in the city, or around the City of Chicago, and he was often a presenter.  So, I never got a chance to, to know much about what he did medically, but he was a fine physician because he came and presented here.  And they had one sister, Artie Dickey [ph.], and they, and Artie died.  She lived in Los Angeles [California] and she died quite early, but she would come in and visit us often also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, they were all, presumably, I guess, from Dyersburg [Tennessee] or--
Speaker 2: Dyersburg, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dyersburg, okay.
Speaker 2: Dyersburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as far you know, did the family always live in Dyersburg, or did they, or were they from some other place in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: I, I think Dyersburg when I, when I hear other people talk.  And they talk about my parents, my mother, in particular, they talk about Dyersburg.  I never heard any other place in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Now, where is Dyersburg in relationship to the biggest city?
Speaker 2: Dyersburg is, is near--I think, I'm, I'm guessing at this point, but I think it's just south, southwest of Nashville [Tennessee], but a small town.  I never visited Dyersburg, never had a chance to visit Dyersburg.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But just in--
Speaker 1: --so the family moved up here sort of early.  I mean, when your mother was still little?
Speaker 2: Yes--no, she was, no, she was high school, but she started high school in Tennessee.  I remember her, her having a sweater, a lettered sweater.  It was Bruce High School in Dyersburg, Tennessee, and she had this letter.  She played basketball, and I remember this big B on her sweater.  And I took great delight as a little boy in wearing her sweater, never knowing the significance of it, but it was fun to wear her sweater.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when they came to Chicago, she was still a teenager because she attended Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that's where she finished high school at, at Wendell Phillips.
Story_ID: 284382
Speaker 1: So, what was your mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] like, and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was just a fun-loving person, a musician, a very talented musician.  She, she taught the piano and later, the organ, and my mother passed away while playing for a funeral.  She played the organ and sang for Rayner's Funeral Home [A.A. Rayner & Sons Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois].  And they all called her Granny because my kids called her Granny.  And they were waiting for her to come to, to play, and there was a delay for the service.  And they didn't know where she was.  And they went to find her and found her in the ladies' room where she'd passed away.  And for a number of years--I don't mean months, but a number of years, I had a great difficulty just passing by Rayner's because I could internalize that whole situation.  I wasn't there, but I could just internalize that whole situation.  And I remember how horrific it was for me to go and identify her at St. Bernard's Hospital [St. Bernard Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], and how callous the police were when they came to bring her--and they put the cot on the floor, you know, and, and it was just awful.  So, I had a horrible, horrible time getting through my mother's death.  It was just a horrible time for me.  It was a horrible time for my--my oldest daughter [Gina Hemphill] was then just graduating from elementary school.  (Crying)  Could you stop for a minute?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Sure.
Speaker 1: Experience for me.  Certainly the demise of my mom was not cool.  But the way the police handled it, the circumstance on which she passed away just left a very indelible imprint on me as a person.  But she was a fun-loving person, just--I mean she'd sing and dance.  As a matter of fact, I have a picture of her now when she was a youngster dancing.  She had a top hat and she was dancing after the (unclear) just having--
Speaker 2: Really?  So, so she performed on stage and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --she was something, she was something.  She belongs to a group called the Petite Matrons.  And it was always great fun to, at the church, where they would get together and sing and play.  They all played the piano and they all sang.  And after church, we'd go to one of their houses to listen to them sing and play, and have great times.  It was always such fun to see these ladies and they'd, they'd laugh.  And one would get up on the piano, and someone else would come down and sit down and play.  And they'd sing.  It was just the greatest experience.  But my mom was, she was a dynamite sister, she was dynamite sister.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did music kind of run in the family with other musicians?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, with the exception of me (laughter).  No, my grandfather [Steve Dickey], the barber, played the, played the violin.  So, at church, when we'd go to church, my mother was playing the piano.  My grandfather was playing the violin.  My grandmother [Girlie Dickey] sang in the choir.  So, yes, music was always a part of our lives--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --always a part of our lives.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 284383
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your father now.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Surely.  Malcolm Montjoy, M-O-N-T-J-O-Y, Hemphill.
Speaker 1: Did he call himself Sr., you know, after you came along?
Speaker 2: That's funny, that's funny.  Someone said to him, so you're, you're Malcolm, Sr.?  He said, no, I'm Malcolm--he's Jr., I'm Malcolm.  He, he let that be known to everybody, that he was Malcolm Hemphill.  I was Junior, yeah, but seldom did he say Sr., unless he wanted someone to know that, that he was the father of that guy over there, who at that time, might have been doing something that he was proud of.  Yeah, so, he, he did, he did.  He was--and on, on documents, he, he would say Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: June 26th--that's not true at all--July 26th, and he was '08 [1908].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 1: In Hickman, Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Now, where is Hickman in relationship to--
Speaker 1: Now, I've been to Hickman and I'm not sure, I'm not sure, but--
Speaker 2: Is it Western Kentucky, Eastern or--
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm, I'm not sure [Western Kentucky].  I've, I've not been as an adult, but when I was a youngster, I went, oh, just a few times, just a few times.  And it was very interesting with my, with my dad, and the Montjoy, Hemphill thing.  When we would go to Hickman, there are a lot of Montjoys, and I noticed also that some of them were white, some of them were fair-skinned, and some of them were my complexion.
Speaker 2: So, you're still trying to make that out now when it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and I'm not really sure of, of the relationship of my, of my dad and his father.  He spoke of his mother quite often, and I did get a chance to meet her.  And I met his grandfather, but I never met his dad.  Now, he had a half-brother who I met, but I knew very little about him, very little about him.  But my, my father was a very outgoing man and when he came to Chicago [Illinois], he went to Wendell Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] also.  As a matter of fact, that was one of the reasons I went to Phillips because both my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] and father attended Wendell Phillips High School.  But he worked at just a variety of, of jobs.  He was--I recall going to a hotel downtown.  My mother took me and in retrospect, I realized she took me for a very simple reason, so that I would keep things in perspective and know what my father was doing to make certain that we, we got through the week, we got through the day.  And my father was, in fact, a bus boy at a hotel that I said I would never forget, but I've forgotten the name of the hotel.  But I recall going in, in the men's room, seeing my dad picking up paper.  And I'm not sure that he was pleased about my being there, but my mother wanted me to know that, that, you know, things aren't just happening because they fall from the sky.  Your dad's working hard, working very hard to do that.  And once he was able to, to get an in, politically, he was able to get a job at the stockyard, but you had to know somebody to do that.
Speaker 2: How did that work?  I mean, do you know how that kind of worked?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a letter, you got a letter, and somebody had to say--well, well, old Malcolm is not a bad guy at all, you know, he's, he, he's not, not a troublemaker, and he'll be all right.
Story_ID: 284384
Speaker 1: Now, who set that up?  The precinct captain or--
Speaker 2: Precinct captain.  And it's, it's so funny how, how things go the complete circle.  I--that may well have been one of the reasons my dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] got involved in politics.  And he, of course, ultimately became the precinct captain and the committeeman there at the, in the Third Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was well-respected, well-respected.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the precinct captain and committeeman of the Third Ward in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in those days, that's--
Speaker 2: You better know it, you better know it.  I just recall Oscar [Stanton] De Priest and [William Levi] Dawson and some of those guys.  You see, Dawson was a Republican then, as was my father, and he was funny about that because later in life when I would tease him--I said, "How do you, how do you justify a, a black man being a Republican, dad?  How do you do that?"  He said, "No, it's, you know, you have to understand the way life is."  So, when, when Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] got in all the big trouble and was caused to task for it, I questioned my dad then.  I said, "Now, how do you justify now, man?  How do you support this man?  How can you support Richard Nixon?  Look at all the things that he's done."  And he said to me then, he said, "Son, what you must understand is that what got Nixon in trouble was that he got caught."  That was the big problem with him--not (laughter) necessarily all the things that he did because somebody didn't do similar kinds of things, but just haven't been caught.  But he was, he was a very, very strong politician.  But party lines didn't really mean that much to him because he just, he had a point of view.  He had a philosophy and he followed that.   And whether you were Democratic or Republican, it mattered little to him because he just, he voted for the person.  But he wore, wore the fact that he was a black Republican on his chest, so he could provoke conversation.
Speaker 1: Now, at one time, I guess, now when did he become committeeman?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] so it had to had to been like '45 [1945] and that general area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was a Republican committeeman--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you're saying for, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, at one time, most of the black politicians were Republicans in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Many of them, many of them were, many of them were.
Speaker 1: I know A.A. "Sammy" Rayner, we just talked about who--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was a Republican.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.  And Sammy was--they were very good friends, they were very good friends.
Speaker 1: He was like the Sixth Ward alderman at one time or--
Speaker 2: What was he?  I think it was Sixth, I think it was Sixth Ward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Sawyer beat him.  I mean, when we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer, we asked him how he did it 'cause he doesn't, you know, Sawyer doesn't really talk that much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right--
Speaker 1: --and, and--
Speaker 2: --or well, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he said it was basically city services were used as a lever.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: They--let people know that if you reelect him--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I didn't know that, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: They laughed when he, you know, he said it.  It was a funny kind of--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) City services, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he said, you may not get the kind of, same kind of service, you know, 'cause we had a [Mayor Richard J.] Daley machine running in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't even know it.  But, yeah, Rayner, Rayner was, was a tough guy, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a strong, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very strong, and a strong family, strong family.  I, I still, I still unite with them.  We're, we're still close because of my, my father and Sammy's relationship, and my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] and, and the funeral home [A.A. Rayner & Sons Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois].  So, we've had very really good ties with the Rayner family.  They've always been very good to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've enjoyed, I've enjoyed their friendship over the years.
Story_ID: 284126
Speaker 1: We were talking about your father [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] being the Third Ward Republican committeeman--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I was asking you, who was the alderman during those days and you think it might have been [Oscar Stanton] De Priest?
Speaker 2: I think it may have been De Priest.  I'm not certain of that, but I do recall seeing him often.  And I had that opportunity because I worked in a drugstore on--in the basement at 46th [Street] and South Park, South Park- [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive.  And he lived just, just north of the drugstore and he would come in often.  And I would sometimes mix him a malted milk, you know, the malted milk from the big metal can, and put it in the machine.  And the guy I worked for reprimanded me once.  He was, he was the pharmacist.  And he said when Oscar comes in, you don't have to try to fill up the whole damn can with ice cream, you know, just make him a malt shake (laughter) like everybody else.  But he was just a nice guy.  He would chat with you.
Speaker 1: So you were treating him too nice (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but he was just a nice guy to me.  He treated me nicely and I treated him nicely.  I didn't know then if he knew my dad or not.  And, and I found out later that, of course, he did.  But I don't know that he even knew that I was, I was--they called my dad Mack.  Now, how you got Mack out of Malcolm, I don't know, but they would sometimes call my father Mack.  So, I don't know if he knew that I was Mack's son or not, but he was a nice guy.  But as you say, that it was not unique or, or unusual for a black man to be a Republican during those, those years.  You know, you just did what, what supported you.  And from our perspective because we thought that was, or we--they thought that was the case.  And what [William Levi] Dawson did kind of paved the way for, for most of the other politicians, and who just kind of followed that path.  And in the light, in the minds of some folk, they saw Dawson as a turncoat, you know, how could you do that?  How could you dare do that?  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, become a Democrat and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when blacks were traditionally Republican?
Speaker 2: Right, particularly in this city [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, obviously now, it's just extreme opposite, extreme opposite now.  But, but my dad was Republican in name only.  And he, you know, he just kind of boasted about that, and would provoke conversation by the fact that, yes, I'm a Republican, and then talk about that, yeah.

Speaker 1: How did your parents [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill and Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] meet?  Did they have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: They both were, were dancers, but, you know, I'm not really sure how they met.  That's an interesting thing you ask--I'm not really sure how they met.  But they both talk about the great times they had as youngsters going to the, to the parties and, and dancing, and just having a great time.  And they both belonged to, to the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and, and spend a lot of time in the church.
Speaker 1: Which church did they attend?
Speaker 2: Bethel A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois].  I was, I was baptized in that church and still am a member of that church.  And the pastor there then was A. Wayman Ward and for years, I didn't know what I was saying.  I didn't know I was saying Reberen [ph.].  I thought that's what he was.  He was Reberen.   I had no idea I was saying Reverent A. Wayman Ward.  To us, he was Reberen Ward, you know, he was, he was some, like, like my grand-dad.  He was, he was a flamboyant man.  He wore the big hats, had a huge pipe that he smoked, wore spats on his, on his shoes, a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate.  He was, he was something else, but that was our church.  So, he married, he performed the wedding ceremony for, he performed the wedding ceremony for my grandmother and grandfather, my mother and my father, and Gloria [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and myself.  He performed the wedding ceremony for all of us.
Speaker 1: How old was he when he performed the--
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, I don't know.  He was just, he was just, he was always there.  He was omnipresent.  He was Reverend Ward.  He was always there, yeah--just an outstanding man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something, that really, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is something that he would even still be in place in one church that, oh, that long or in that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, when, when my wife and I got married, he wasn't at Bethel.  He had, he had become the presiding elder, but he performed the ceremony for us because of the history of, of his family and our family.  And we had a bad experience there also because the then-minister, because of his own personal feelings about Reverend Ward, we wanted to get married at my church which was Bethel.  And he wouldn't allow us to do it because he wasn't going to be the person performing the ceremony.  So, I've been, I was baptized in that church.  My mother played the organ there.  My father was the president of the usher board.  And he would not allow us to have our wedding ceremony in that church unless he was the minister in charge.  So, we said, well, fine, if that's the way you feel about it, we'll go someplace else, so we did.  We went to St. Mary's A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois].  And Reverend Ward and Hyman Mills performed the ceremony.  Hyman Mills was the minister at St. Mary's Church, so he did the ceremony for us.  The two of them did the ceremony for us which was fine.  But I just couldn't, couldn't conceive of anybody being so small that he would allow his personal conflict with another person to interfere with two young people--
Speaker 1: Yeah, seems--
Speaker 2: --starting their lives together, but he did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hmm, yeah, seems like the whole thing would be bigger than, than that.
Speaker 2: Right, you would think that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You would think that, particularly wearing the collar, but that, that didn't, that didn't come to pass, yeah.
Story_ID: 284128
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to childhood.  And there's some standard questions we always ask and we--now, you grew up in the neighborhood around Phillips High [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], near Phillips and Forrestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and that--
Speaker 2: No, well, it, it--it's odd that you asked that.  I grew up on 45th Place.  That's between South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr.] and Vincennes [Avenue]--439, as a matter of fact, 439 East 45th Place.  I grew up there, and because of where I lived, for high school, I was to have gone to DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  But my parents [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill and Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] went to Phillips--both my mother and father went to Phillips.  And I played basketball, and I thought that they had, you know, good athletic teams at, at Phillips, so that's where I wanted to go because my parents had gone there, and I wanted to go there.  So, I, I laugh often when I, as the school administrator later, when I would, you know, kind of reprimand people for falsifying addresses to get to special schools.  And, you know, I said, you know, go to your neighborhood school, you know, that kind of thing when, in fact, I didn't do that.  I gave a false address so that I could go to Phillips.  I lived at 439 East 45th Place, but I gave as my address as 4225 South Prairie [Avenue], so I could go to Phillips.  And I remember going to school every morning just repeating in my mind, 4225 South Prairie, 4225 South Prairie, so that when they asked me my address, I'd be able to repeat it without saying 439 East 45th Place instead.  But, now, to show you how families can be, and extended families can be, the address I used was the address of one of the ladies who was a member of that group I told you about, the Petite Matrons.  That's the address I used.  I used one of their addresses to go there--Louise Cooper [ph.] was her name.  And to us, of course, you know, she was Aunt Louise, and that was the address I used to allow me to go to Wendell Phillips High School.  But prior to Phillips, I went to Forrestville Elementary School.  When I attended Forrestville Elementary School in, in those years, it was the largest elementary school in the country, the largest school in the country.  And they had us so clustered that the school was so large, you didn't go to school all day long.  You either, if, if you were the primary grades, grades, you went from nine to twelve, off from twelve to four.  That is primary and middle school.  Then when you got to be the middle school, you were allowed, you were allowed to go the full day.  You went from, from--no, I said nine to--it was eight to twelve, and twelve to four.  And then, the full day, you went from nine to three.  You got an hour off for lunch at twelve o'clock.  So, in fact, you went from nine to twelve, you'd go home or some place for lunch from twelve to one, and come back and finish the day at one to three.  But everybody in that school couldn't go the whole day because it just couldn't house everybody, it couldn't house everybody.  When the bell rang for recess, it was awesome to see all those kids come out of the building at one time, ripping and running, but the playground was huge though.  It was huge.

Speaker 1: This is the Chicago [Illinois] that Lorraine Hansberry writes about and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Though, though Lorraine would not have known that because she was younger, but I'm sure she must have experienced some of that also.
Speaker 1: It was the crowded, you know, and this is the, the result of not really letting black people out of a certain area.  And I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you couldn't go, no.
Speaker 1: --so they had you, everybody going to Forrestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or too many people going to--
Speaker 2: Too many--now, the, the school took up, the school, with its playground and everything, it took up the entire block, it took up, it took up an entire block.  If you included the playground, a small section that was isolated from the, the large building actually housed kindergarten.  The building was so large--I mean, the kindergarten was so large that it took very nearly an entire building to house kindergarten.  Can you imagine that?  And then, later, they had some first-graders in there.  That building was so large that later on, it became Dunbar.  That was the first Dunbar [Dunbar Trade School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] right there on the grounds of Forrestville Elementary School.  And, of course, we didn't know.  Again, it's the case of not knowing and what was going on.  We said Dumb-bar because we had no history.  We didn't know what, what Dunbar was, so we assumed that because the, the kids who went there were the kids who were going to use their hands, so ultimately, they were just not too sharp.
Speaker 1: They were dumb.
Speaker 2: They were dumb.
Speaker 1: So they went to Dumb-bar.
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause they went to Dumb-bar.  Little did we know that, in many cases, they were the bright ones, you know.  They were bright ones.  I mean who, who did the tailorings, and the auto mechanics, and all those kinds of things that they had there.  But it was just amazing to me--
Speaker 1: So, in those days, you didn't know who Dunbar was in the public schools?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, not, not during then, no.  Who was there to tell you, who was there to tell you?
Speaker 1: Were there black teachers?
Speaker 2: I did, I did eight years at Forrestville Elementary School.  I had one black teacher.  He was a phys ed [physical education] teacher, Ozzie Simmons, and he was a substitute teacher, he was a substitute teacher.  Now, mind you, what I just said now--not that you--I had, I had, I had two, I had two, Ms. Tate [ph.] and later on, a Ms. Tompkins [ph.].  No, there's another one, Ms. Marks [ph.], Ms. Marks.  Ms. Marks was mean, boy, she was a mean sister.  But Ms. Tate, I'll never forget because she was an A-B teacher but when you went in Ms. Tate's room, the door was closed.  And you didn't come--you'd come knocking on her door.  "I got a message from the principal."  You didn't knock on her door because she was teaching school for the whole period of time you were in there.  So, I got more from Ms. Tate than anybody in that building.  She was just a fantastic teacher.
Story_ID: 284130
Speaker 1: I want to go back a little bit, maybe to when you were just about, you know, home in the neighborhood.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Really distinct, you mentioned smells.  One of the smells you would get where I lived was the stockyards.  If the wind came from the west, uh, man, it's putrid.
Speaker 1: They were almost due west, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, they were like 55th Street [Chicago, Illinois], west of you--
Speaker 2: Right, west of, west of where I lived.
Speaker 1: --and you were like 45th [Place], but you're, yeah, but almost due west?
Speaker 2: Yes, but if you got a wind in the morning, particularly in the mornings, you'd get the stockyards.  And, of course, like most places where you live, and it's, it's consistent, you get acclimated to the point where sometimes you don't even know, you don't recognize the fact that, that what you're smelling is, is not, not really too good.  It's just something that you smell all the time, but that was something that you would smell.  I live in a block that I'm sure this was different than most blocks in the city.  And I say a block, I don't mean an entire square block.  I mean, between South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and Vincennes [Avenue] on 45th Place, there were fourteen of us--boys, whose ages didn't, didn't separate us more than two years--fourteen guys on one, one little street.  And my father [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] being the, the kind of guy he was, in an attempt to keep us out of whatever else that was that might have been negative in the surrounding area, he got us involved in every kind of sport there was.  We played football, we played softball, we went to, we went to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], to the Wabash Y [Wabash Avenue YMCA, Chicago, Illinois] to learn to swim.  He would have us down at Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And we didn't know then that Washington Park was such a dynamite place because they had two huge pools.  They were metric pools designed for the [1959] Pan American Games [Chicago, Illinois].  And they had the two actual swimming pools and a diving pool, so we got a chance to do all those kinds of things.  And my dad was, was very, very instrumental in kind of keeping us in line with, with the good and quality kinds of things.  So, we had a lot of, a lot of great athletes on that, on that block.
Story_ID: 284131
Speaker 1: As I said to you, I went to [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And all the other guys went to DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] with the exception of one other fellow who, for a moment, and I don't know how he was able to do it, got into Hyde Park [High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], but that didn't last but a minute.  But we had guys there, Eugene Gutter who went--Eugene was, Eugene was tall, a tall guy who was a very talented athlete, but we didn't know it.  Eugene was hearing impaired.  And he would, he would, you know, get by it with us, but he never let anybody else know that often he didn't hear what you were saying.  And in that he was tall--in school, they would put him in the rear of the room because he was tall.  So now, what you've done now, you've magnified his hearing difficulty, so not only can he not hear what you're saying, you've put him farther away than anybody else.  So, he doesn't hear you half the time at all.  So, Eugene was put back at one point because they said that he wasn't learning.  Well, hell, he didn't hear you.  He didn't know what you were saying.  And little did we know, Eugene was brighter than all of us--a very smart guy, a very smart guy, but he just couldn't hear.  So, when they were able to detect that, you know, it was much, much later in life.  But Eugene played basketball at DuSable, graduated DuSable, and went on to Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and played basketball, and was doing very, very well for some strange reason, as happened with so many of those guys on the street where I grew up.  He ran into a wall, got consumed by the neighborhood, and he died.  He died of all things--he died of malnutrition.  Now, here's a guy who, who was a bright guy, exceptionally fine athlete, but just got consumed by all of the negative things that, that happened to, to young guys.  So, when he came home, he had little to do.  And, and I recall when I started teaching school, I would still stop by 45th [Place] with my parents [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill and Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.], and run in and have breakfast before going to school.  And I would call on a couple of occasions, going by 47th Street. And he'd be out in the front of the restaurant, just kind of hanging out.  And I'd stop and say, "Gene, what are you doing, man?"  He said, "Oh, I'm just, just having a little fun, man.  Why don't you let me have fifty cents so I can get some breakfast?"  I said, "Oh, Gene, c'mon, man."  He said, "Let me have fifty cents."  I said, "Naw, man, I'll let you, I'll tell you what to do, I'll take you inside, we'll have breakfast together."  Well, I would have eaten already, but I'd go in with him.  I'd sit down, we'd chat a little bit, and I'd order the breakfast.  And he'd eat some, a little bit of it.  And we'd talk about all the things that could have happened, all the things that he could have done, had he stayed in school, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: So, he didn't finish Southern?  He dropped out (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't finish, no, he didn't finish.  He, he came home.  And, and shortly after, they called and told me and said, "Do you happen to know what happened to Eugene?"  I said, "No."  They (unclear) said, "Man, he died."  I said, "Oh, wow."  He died of malnutrition--found him in the vestibule on 47th Street.  He had tried--
Speaker 2: Was he drinking, you said?
Speaker 1: Drinking--
Speaker 2: Drinking.
Speaker 1: --drinking.
Speaker 2: --drinking problems.
Speaker 1: Just, just drinking.  And we had--there were at--all, all those guys, remember, there may, may be four of us alive today.
Speaker 2: Now, there's a photo that you had that we looked at earlier.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We, we do the photos at the end of the interview.  We will show it then, but there's a photo of these guys, of the guys on your block, right--
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-hm.
Speaker 2: --won a sixteen-inch softball tournament.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they're sitting there on the stoop and, and you say a lot of them are not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, they're, they're no longer with us.
Speaker 2: --around anymore?
Speaker 1: And they died--any time you die early like that, it's, it's an uncalled for death.  But when your, when your, your, your actions and your activities sometimes cause that early demise, it's tragic because without exception, they were all, all, good guys, smart guys.
Story_ID: 284132
Speaker 1: One guy would--Clint [ph.], Clint was a handsome guy.  And, and all the girls and the women loved him.  And he wallowed in that and it just got him going.  But he, he, he perhaps was smarter than all of us, other than Eugene [Gutter].  But I don't think he ever went to college--went to the [U.S. military] service, went to the service early, long before any of us.  We were still in high school, and then Clinton went to the service.  And I'm sure something negative happened because he came home early and got involved.  He was, he was doing some things over on, on Cottage Grove [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], 39th [Street] and Cottage Grove.  I think they then called it Dopeville, USA.  And Clinton was always over there and he was, he was always involved there, he was always involved there.  And then, another dear friend, Leroy Pittman, exceptional athlete, played quarterback at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], along with Rapier, Rapier Bond [ph.].  They both played quarterback at DuSable.  It's interesting two guys in the same block would go to the same high school, and both played quarterback.  And they did, and they both left and went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and played quarterback there, played a lot of, a lot of ball there.  But neither of them stayed, neither of them stayed.  And last time I knew, I, I saw my father [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] talking to, to Leroy--him, and he was, Leroy was a grown, grown, grown, man.  But my father was still trying to, to harness him, you know.  And, Leroy would laugh, uh, coach, you know, "I'm going to be all right, I'm going to be all right, coach."  And last thing I saw, last time I saw Leroy, he had a bandage on his wrist where he had walked out of the hospital.  He had the band on, you know, and he was just wandering down the street.  So, it, I, I don't, I really don't know if there is one factor or, or a number of factors that would cause so many bright guys, talented guys, who never had an opportunity to fulfill their, their goals to their optimum.
Speaker 2: Were their fathers at home and or--
Speaker 1: No, I recall Leroy and Eugene lived in the same apartment.  They were cousins, so Eugene's father [Monroe Gutter] was there.  I remember him well because he was a great big guy like Eugene, you know, so we always, we call Eugene.  His name was Eugene Gutter, so we call Eugene's dad when he came out, when he would come out of the house, we call him--here comes Big Gut, you know, here comes Big Gut.  He was a great big guy.  He worked the stockyards.  But to answer your question, no, I, I think not.  I hadn't thought about it, but I think you're right.  There, there weren't many fathers there, but, but then, you see, though you would love that to be the case, there's al-, always someone on that street who was following all of us, all of us.  Though they--he may not have been your dad, certainly wasn't your dad, or your mom, but there were things you wouldn't do because you knew Mrs. Pittman was around the corner there watching.  You'd go to the store, you know, Mrs. Lawrence [ph.] wasn't going to let you do what you had no business doing.  No, I recall a very, very specific incident.  There was a grocery store across the street in the basement.  The Newmans [ph.] owned the grocery store, so when you go to shop, your mother could send you to the store, or one of the other ladies, and they call you to go the store for her.  And when you go down to Ms. Newman's store, you could buy, you could take a dime and buy whatever they want.  If you didn't have the money, you'd order what they want.  You want fifteen-cent salt pork.  You heard what I said, salt pork.  You'd get the fifteen-cent salt pork, and if you didn't have the money, then they'd write it in the book, so that at the end of the week, your mother or Miss Whomever Else could pay her bill based on what Ms. Newman said her bill was.  And, of course, (laughter), you don't know what that would have been, of course.  But we would get--we'd go down to that basement and, and buy bags of candy, little bags of candy, little stale candy for two cents.  And the candy was so stale, it'd be stuck together.  But it was quite a street, quite a street I lived on.  We'd had, had fantastic fellowship.
Story_ID: 284133
Speaker 1: I recall having to walk to, to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] to swim.  And it's such a big park, we'd go down there to play softball, never played baseball, was afraid of the ball, got hit with the ball once, and that was enough.  My dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] played--I, I mentioned to you, my dad played semi-pro baseball.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, who did he play for?  Did he play in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: He played in Chicago and they would travel sometime.  I never got a chance to travel with them, but they travelled--not great distances, but they did travel.  But they had on Sunday, Sunday evenings at the church, they had big baseball games out in Washington Park.  The crowds would gather around, and my dad was the pitcher and a first baseman, so I got a chance to see some baseball.  But while standing there on the side, I once, I got hit with a foul ball and, man, did it hurt, and I never played baseball.
Speaker 2: Now, it's fun-, it's ironic because you became a baseball coach later on?
Speaker 1: I did, I did, and my dad's funny, too, because when I started, I started coaching--well, then in order to coach in, in the high schools of Chicago Public Schools [CPS], you had to be a physical education teacher because there were so few opportunities for you to coach.  And when I became a physical education teacher, I'll backtrack just a bit because when I was in school, there were no black phys ed teachers.  And they prevented that from happening because they wouldn't offer the exam.  So there were no black--imagine, there were no black high school physical education teachers in the City of Chicago--none, none.  So, someone said, oh, yeah, Mr. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.] was, or Mr. Gant was--Charlie Gant who was an outstanding athlete.  He was.  They were substitutes, they were substitutes.  They were never assigned.  So, how do you keep them from becoming assigned?  Easily--you don't offer the exam.  So, there were none, there were none.  So, all the coaching that we got, we got came from guys like Agis Bray and Charlie Gant, and my dad, and the other little guys who said, yes, you can learn this sport.  We're going to teach you the sport the way it ought to be taught.  And you're going to learn how to do it, if you want to do it--fine.  So that's what we did, and that's how we got a chance to, to get out there and play ball with, with other folk.  But we never had any, we never ever had any.  And it was scary, so when I finally got an opportunity because I'd taught at the elementary school first, and physical education.  But then when I got an opportunity to take the exam, when they finally did offer the exam, I guess I was with the second group of black phys ed teachers at the high school level.  A couple other guys before our group went through, maybe--I think, four--one of the Bonner brothers and [HistoryMaker] Larry Hawkins.  They were, they, they went through before we did.  And in my group, we had Carl Bonner and, and Robert Bonner.  There were five of us, I guess, who went through the high school exam at the same time.  So, in order to, to coach, you coach where the principal told you to coach.  And she thought that because you're a physical education teacher, you should be able to coach everything.  And, you know, that's certainly not true.  So, she told me that I was going to coach basketball and I was gonna be assistant coach for football.
Story_ID: 284281
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about the five [Wendell] Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] players that went on to play at Xavier University [of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Right [sic.].
Speaker 1: --and really set a record, a collegiate record for the most consecutive games won by any team ever, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --with Charlie Gant and Mr. [William] McQuitter, Agis Bray and--
Speaker 2: [Albert] "Runt" Pullins, and I don't recall the other name.  But there were five of them who left Chicago [Illinois], and going to Xavier to, to school, and set all kinds of phenomenal records, all kinds of records because they--I guess because they had played to go here in Chicago, too.  They knew each other.  And they had a common goal and, of course, they fought, they fought, because I, I recall very vividly that, that when, when they played as, as younger men, as adults, they played over at the Wabash Y [Wabash Avenue YMCA, Chicago, Illinois].  And my dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] coached them, and they had all kinds of teams.  And I want to tell you a story about that, too.  But when I went away to school, my, my first year and a half, I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  So, we played Xavier, and I was the freshman.  So naturally, I slept on the top bunk.  And I wasn't happy about it, but who am I to say--these guys have been around.  So, I remember looking up over my head and seeing scrawled on this presswood--
Speaker 1: This is at Xavier?
Speaker 2: At Xavier, at Xavier University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then, these barracks--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had us in barracks and it was hot.  Man, it was ever hot.  And I'm on this top bunk, you know, there was no such thing as air conditioning.  And mosquitos are all over everywhere, so I'm not a very happy camper.  But I got a big bang out of the fact looking up carved on the ceiling over my head was the name of Agis Bray, and Charlie Gant, and McQuitter whose first name I can't think of, and "Runt" Pullins.  And I don't recall who the fifth person was.  But they had a phenomenal team and broke all kinds of records down there, all kinds of records.  But they were, they were, they were great guys.  And my father's sixtieth birthday--a, a friend of mine, [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates, his wife said she was going to have some, some men by to celebrate Harold's father's birthday, okay, (unclear) birthday.  So, I asked my dad if he wanted to go.  He said, "Well, yeah, I'll go."  But in my mind, I'm thinking, "What, you know, we'll go over here to Harold and Maxine's [Maxine Pates] house, and have some good food" 'cause Maxine is heck of a cook.  So, we got there.  All these men down in the basement sat around talking, and it was amazing to find out that they knew each other.  They'd worked at the stockyard together, the post office together, or they'd shared other kinds of experiences together.  It was great to, to hear all those guys share stories.  So, I got that, I didn't get the idea--my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] got the idea.  She said, "Why don't you do something like that for gran-," my father?  I said, well, great.  So, she did that.  And I was smarter then, than I was before that because when we had Charlie Gant and Agis Bray, and [William "Iron Man"] McGinnis, had him, had those guys sitting here in this front room.  And I decided--I was in school then over at the center [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], so I went down and got a tape recorder.  And I put the tape recorder under that piano, and I taped their conversation without them knowing it.  If you could hear the stories those guys told about what happened then when they played ball, and how, how the white guys would call them all kinds of names.  And, and even when they were made to shake their hands, they'd spit in their hands first, and then shake their hands.  And they told all the kinds of stories they went through when my dad coached them with the YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Association].  So, they said, one thing with Mr. Hemphill, you don't have to worry about him spending a whole lot of money because they had these uniforms.  And he'd gone some place and gotten uniforms.  And none of them said Wabash Y.  They always had some letters missing, and then it would say YMCA.  So, you know he'd gotten the uniforms from somebody else because they couldn't afford the uniforms.  And he said they were that, that heavy material.  And it would, once you got wet, when you perspired, he said those jerseys were so heavy, man.  He said everybody, at least five pounds more, they never would have weighed.  But they told us some great stories, and I've got it on tape, I've got it on tape.  I almost lost it.  My daughter was in school then--thought it was just a blank tape, and I almost taped over it, yeah.  But I've got it, the audio, audio is not really good, but I--it's just something I'm gonna always cherish, to hear that again.
Speaker 1: That sounds important, I mean, you know, we need to have a copy of that at The HistoryMakers.

Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to see any Negro League games when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I did, I did.  Again, on Sundays, many of those games, as I recall, were played on Sunday afternoons.  In my house, it was a known fact there were a number of things that happened on Sunday, but none of them took the place of church.  So, whatever I was going to do, we went to church first.  So, I recall a number of Sundays where we'd, we'd go to church.  And my grandmother was a baseball fan for some strange reason.  And of course, my dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] was.  So, we would go to, to the park, to Sox Park [Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois], to see them.  And I saw guys like, like Satchel Paige.  And I think one of the most phenomenal baseball players that I ever saw was Goose Tatum.
Speaker 1: Really?  He's a baseball player?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a first baseman.  He had a glove, he had a first base, he had about that big.  And you'd want to get to the game early enough, so that you could see them warm up.  And they would deliberately throw the ball in the ground to him, so he could scoop it up, you know.  He'd drag the glove, or he'd grab--drag the glove all around the ground.  You'd see the dust flying, and he'd always come up with the ball, and toss the ball up in the air, and catch it back here, back hand, but he was fantastic.  But I saw a lot of baseball, saw a lot of baseball as a kid over at Sox Park.

Speaker 1: When you were in high school, you played basketball, and did you play--
Speaker 2: No, I just played basketball.
Speaker 1: Just basketball, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just played basketball.  Had some great years playing basketball at Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, were the rules different in those days?  'Cause I know we've heard, we, we've talked to some people that played when they had lightweight teams, heavyweight teams, and all sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, did, did, were you--
Speaker 2: And see, earlier, we mentioned about Bingham [ph.] and Charlie Gant and those guys, then they had lightweights.  They had lights and heavies, okay.  Then, when I, when I was playing ball, we had juniors and seniors, excuse me.  The assumption was on the part of the many, many minds, excuse me, that juniors meant your, your year in school, and seniors meant that you're, you know, you were a senior in high school and junior high.  But it had nothing to do with it--it had to do with height.  You started out, you were 5'7".  Anybody 5'7" and under could play juniors.  And 5'7" above played seniors.  Now, you could play seniors at 5'7" if you were an outstanding ball player.  The coach would take you and put you on the senior team.  You know, not that juniors were any less, ability-wise, but sometimes they would do that.  But I played both juniors and seniors.  I don't mean simultaneously, but at some point in my career at Phillips, I played juniors.  I played junior basketball, and I played senior basketball, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we had some good teams, but we weren't world-beaters, we weren't world-beaters.  We had, had, had some good teams.  And we were in what was then called the, the Central Division.  And it got to be the point where we had to, we were satisfied with our season as long as it would be DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Englewood [High School; Englewood Technical Prep Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  And they were the other two blacks who was, so we had bragging rights during the summer when we'd go to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] and play.  So, we were, we were the best.
Speaker 1: Now, what made the difference in those days?  I mean, I would think--you would think when the school the size of Phillips, I mean, with many students, many black students and, you know.  Well, nowadays, you know, black people dominate basketball.  So, you'd think that, that would happen with that many black students, but did--were, was basketball as big a deal in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It, it was not as big a deal as it is today certainly.  But some schools have sports that, that you identify with folks with football.  The [Claude] Buddy Youngs, and those kinds of guys, you know, you, you went to see Phillips play for the city championship or the semis or something, but they always had great, great football teams.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, was Buddy Young ahead of you or--
Speaker 2: Yes, Buddy, yes, Buddy finished in, in '43 [1943], yeah.  But Buddy and, and not, not Patterson, but Sherman [J.] Howard and those guys, who are name athletes who came out of Phillips, and went on to play professional football, so that it was just the history of, of football and track.  Now, when Buddy was in school at Phillips, Buddy and a fellow named Rainer Thomas, Rainer Thomas, who's, who is really quite ill now, but enough (unclear) athlete who played football and ran track, they won the state championship.  They had three guys and they won the state championship--outstanding team.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Buddy Young's a legend.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah
Story_ID: 284284
Speaker 1: And they had a principal there then who was wise enough, and many principals don't understand that today.  They try to separate athletics and academics, not understanding how one impacts upon the other.  And you don't--there's no such thing as the jock and the student, you see.  And that's the, the misconception that they had. But Ms. Bousfield Lutt [ph.], Ms. Bousfield was--Maudelle Bousfield was her name.  I mean, when you came into that school, the first thing you did was to go to an assembly program.  You learned the words to the school song.  You understood that you went to Wendell Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  There was no such place as Phillips--absolutely no place called Phillips.  It's the Wendell Phillips.  And if you left out of there, you knew the words to the school song, and you knew that you attended Wendell Phillips.
Speaker 2: Did they talk about who Wendell Phillips was and why the school was named for Wendell Phillips?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I mean, there was, there was no, no attempt to give us any sense of, of black history and or pride--none.  But she--I suspected sometimes that some of the students didn't know that she was black because she was a very fair-skinned lady and, but she was around the building.  She was certainly around the building a lot and you, you knew that she was the principal, and there was no fooling around.  And because you played on an athletic team, it meant there was more expected of you than most other folk because you not only represented the school, at that school, but you represented the school outside of the building at other schools.  So, she was very supportive of athletics.  I just wish so much that the principal would understand that now and be as supportive of, of the athletic teams as they ought to be, but they seldom are.
Speaker 2: So Phillips had a--the approach to was pretty, was developmental in terms of the students then, I guess, at Phillips.
Speaker 1: Indeed, indeed, indeed.  Just a--it was a great experience for me.
Speaker 2: I know some of the other people in town here.  And I only know a few, but I, you know, we're talking earlier off camera about Dr. Cliff Washington.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and Mitch--I can't think of his last name now.
Speaker 1: Mitch Watkins.
Speaker 2: Mitch Watkins, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mitch, didn't go to Phillips though, Mitch went to U of C [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], but Wellington Wilson.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Wellington Wilson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who ended up being--he retired as, as a president of Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois] left--
Speaker 2: Was [HistoryMaker] Larry Hawkins--
Speaker 1: Larry Hawkins was there.  Larry was a semester ahead of me.  We played basketball, never together because when, he was playing seniors, I was playing juniors.  But I was a big guy on the junior team--big, being tall, 5'7".  So we scrimmaged them, so I learned a lot just by getting beat up by Larry at practice.  But, yes, Larry, Larry was a great basketball player at, at Phillips.  And I was a great student.  I had a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--just a great, both academician and athlete also.  There were a lot of people who, who came out of--and I think that one thing that, that the students there unfortunately don't know.  There's a hall of fame there at Wendell Phillips.  And if they took the time to walk around that building and see the pictures of the people on that wall, and know what they did, some of the pride that once was--would still exist at that school.  And, because there are a lot of great guys who've, who've come, and, and women, who've come from that school.
Story_ID: 284285
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And it isn't at all to take anything away from DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] because I, I--they have always boasted rightfully so, about their music history, their music, their bands, and they're the kinds of things that Walter Dyett did with so many of them.  And they've had outstanding musicians who've come from there, you know, the, the Johnny Griffins and Gene Ammons, and many, many others who have come from DuSable.  But as I said early on, some schools have certain kinds of things that, that you attach to them.  And for DuSable, it, it was, it was their music, and for Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], athletics, not so ready--either the two from academics.  And we joke about the fact that some folk also don't know that, at one point, in an attempt to make certain that black folk didn't spread out, Phillips burned, Wendell Phillips burned.  And when the school burned, there had to be some place for the kids to go.  So, while they were rebuilding Wendell Phillips High School, they built yet another brand new school, and they built this great school.  And some of the people who had gone to Phillips went there.  And that school was called New Phillips, and the school on 39th Street [Pershing Road] was called Old Phillips.  And Old Phillips continued to exist once they did the repair.  And New Phillips is DuSable, so that's how DuSable came into existence.
Speaker 2: About what year did this happen?
Speaker 1: I wish I could tell you.  And I, I knew that was going to be the question.  I wish I could tell you, but and I knew that, I did know that because I found a yearbook of my dad's [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] in the basement of the house where he lived, and I was cleaning out the house.  And I have that yearbook, too--I'll show it to you.  It's 1926, and he was still at Phillips then, so it had to have been after that time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, we can--it's easy to find.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think anybody watching this to find out, but it's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  I think one other that--
Speaker 2: You know, it's passed down.  I think we've heard this once before from somebody but I--
Speaker 1: Did you really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, once before, but I forgot it actually 'cause we, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so we told, you know, you, you guys here.  You're the New Phillips.  You aren't the real core.
Story_ID: 284286
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], now were you involved in--what were you like in high school?  What kind of a person were you and as a kid?
Speaker 2: I graduated mid-year, so it was kind of different for those of us who did, to go the way, go to high school in January, begin your high school career in the middle of the, of the actual school year.
Speaker 1: You mean, your college career, you mean?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Oh, both, okay.
Speaker 2: --both, both, both.  Is that your question of high school?
Speaker 1: Well, I was asking about your personality growing up.  What were you like--what kind of personality did you have?  That's what I was--
Speaker 2: I was an only child, but it wasn't a negative for me because living on the street with, with fourteen other guys who were my age or very near my age, I was never out, never out of touch with--it's a lot of people, of the guys, that we always had something to do.  So, I never felt like an only child, but I, I was, I was fun-loving.  I had a lot of fun, I had a lot of fun.  I wasn't, I, you know, it's, it's interesting--my father [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.], as I said, he was the, was a committeeman and, and the--he was right there.  And everybody knew Mr. Hemphill because he was always involved in something.  So, I had to kind of be careful because I didn't want to be Mr. Hemphill's little boy.  I wanted to make certain that, that I was one of the guys, which I certainly was.  So, we played everything, we played everything.  And I felt that--I guess because I wasn't a troublemaker.  But I often found myself in, in leadership roles, the captain of the softball team that you saw.  I was the captain of the basketball team in, in high school.  And I was the president of my high school class.  But it wasn't because I was an academician.  I was, I was popular and I did well enough in school not to cause any real problems.  But I had, I had, I had some good times, but I was never lonely.  As an only child, I was never lonely.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I had a favorite subject but, naturally, you know, I say naturally, but I always enjoyed athletics.  But probably later on, what I enjoyed at, at an early age, I enjoyed the kind of history that we were getting and some English, only because I didn't realize that I wasn't speaking English, you know, (laughter).  And I found out, wow, is that what I was saying?  I had no idea that's what I was saying.  And when they put in print what I was saying, I thought, is that what I was saying when I should have been saying this?  You're talking about 'The Star Spangled Banner,' how we have no idea of what, of what we sing when we sing that song.  You people seldom know the words, seldom know the words.  Even today, you see people who forget the words, but even if they could remember the words, they wouldn't know what the words are--couldn't pronounce the words.  So, when it was brought to my attention is some of the things we were saying.  Really, that's not, that's not a word, that's not a word.  So, I had a great appreciation for the language, not that I necessarily had any ultimate goal, but I did enjoy the fact that now I know what I should have been saying rather than, than that.  And I, I learned that, too, when I, I taught school because we substituted a lot because we didn't have assignments.  And my filled-in physical education, I had to sub wherever I could, and whenever I could.  And I recall asking a little girl--I put something on the board, and I left blank lines for them to fill in those voids.  And the little girl, who was a white little girl, got them all right.  And I asked her, "How, how did you know that was right?"  And she said, "Well, it sounded right."  And that made sense to me because she didn't know why it was was, as opposed to were, but that's what she had hold--that's what she had heard.  She had heard that at home all the time.  So that's what, that's how she knew how to speak English, where sometimes we don't because we just have never heard that.
Speaker 1: Right.  If you don't hear it that way, it doesn't--
Speaker 2: You don't hear, right, no.
Speaker 1: You have to learn it as if it's something new, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I, I enjoyed English for that reason, yeah.  But I had some great times--
Story_ID: 284287
Speaker 1: Can I backtrack a minute--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --something you asked me about why I, why I--how I ended up coaching baseball?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I--because the principal told you what you taught, and what you coached.  And she told me that I was going to coach the basketball team 'cause she called me.  I was to coach basketball.  And then, there was going to be a second sport, and I was going to be the assistant football coach.  Well, I was the assistant football coach, and I was working with a guy, Jim Peeples [ph.], whom, who I knew and, and we got along great, so it was fine.  But then, when the baseball coach left, there was no one to coach the baseball team, so she gave me the baseball team.  And I can't say to her, I'm not going to do that.  You can't do that.  You, you coach that sport.  So, I was coaching at Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  And, at that time, we had five thousand students in that building--uh, just, just kids everywhere.  I mean, fantastic young people, fantastic young people.  And I'd tease them then because I said, "You know, they talk about you so bad, they talk about you so bad because of where you live," and we laughed about that.  So, I was coaching the baseball team with these kids.  And there was a boys' club on the West Side.  It was then called the Midwest Boys Club [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Club, Chicago, Illinois].  And two friends of mine, John Everett and, and [Wilford] "Moose" Bonner, worked after school there.  They both coached and taught physical education also, so they would tell me who the athletes were because they got them all year long.  So, when I started coaching, I knew the guys and knew who could and who could not play.  So, we played baseball and I had the team.  The kids were doing well.  And one of my guys who was Nathaniel Humphrey would say, "Well, coach, you know, we need to try to do this."  So, I'd come home sometime.  My dad [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] say, "Well, how'd your team do?  I saw yesterday in the paper that you guys won."  I said, "Yeah, we won."  He said, "Well, how'd you do today?"  I said, "We won."  So, this went on for quite a little bit until we got ready to go to the semifinals, going to Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois] to play baseball.  So, we--I came home and he said, "Well, how'd the team do?  Did you, did you do okay?"  I said, "Yeah, we won.  Dad, we won, man, we won."  He said, "Those kids win in spite of you, don't they (laughter)?"  He knew that I really didn't know a whole lot about coaching baseball.  I could watch a game, I enjoyed it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I haven't played softball for so long, but I didn't really know what I was doing when I started coaching baseball, so he was right.  They won a lot of games in spite of me, in spite of me, so I had great fun with those guys on the West Side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're going to get to that, you know, catch up on your career, you know, as we go along.
Story_ID: 284288
Speaker 1: Let's get you out of high school here now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: When you were a senior, did you know exactly what you wanted to be, you know, or where you wanted to go to school or, or if you were going to college or--
Speaker 2: Had no idea, had absolutely no idea.  I mean, you just flowed--I just flowed.  Again, it was that situation with me graduating mid-year, graduating in January.  Well, I was, I played basketball, as I said early on, and I was the president of my class [at Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And, as a job, as a responsibility, the guidance counsellor would meet with all of the seniors to find out what they were doing, as opposed to having met with them before, to let them know what track they should be headed in, and what their interests might be.  But that was never done.  So, I just remember saying to my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] sometime before, long before graduation, when she said, "Well, you know, what, what are you planning on doing?  Boy, what you are you going to do, what are you doing to do?"  I said, "I think maybe I'd like to be like papa--I'd like to be a barber."  And she said, "A barber?  Anybody could be a barber."  So, I said, well, "My grandfather [Steve Dickey] was, your father was."  And she didn't take to that too swell.  But at that point, that's really what I thought about.  I didn't think about--I mean, this was in my junior year maybe.  But I remember being, being called into the office by--I wish I could think of her name.  I have a blank because I should have a blank because the only time I saw that woman was a week before graduation.  And she came in and asked me what I was going to do, and what school I was going to attend when, in fact, she should have been laying the groundwork for all of that--had done none of that at all.  So, my mother wanted me to do something other than being a barber.  So, she thought the best thing for me to do would be to go and be a dentist.  And I had no real interest in being a dentist, but that was the reason that I went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] because Meharry [Medical] College [Nashville, Tennessee] was across the street.  And my mother thought that I should be a--it would be a good idea.  Why don't you try that?  And I, you know, that wasn't going to work, that wasn't going to work at all.  So, when I left high school, I left high school really having no real idea of what I was going to do.
Story_ID: 284142
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about you going to college.  Now, you're going to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it--why--so you chose Fisk because of Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Meharry College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Meharry College was the largest medical school at that time.  At that time, there were more physicians, more black physicians who were practicing, who had come from Meharry College than any other college.  So, you had a greater opportunity to getting into Meharry if you were a graduate from Fisk, which, of course, is right across the street.  And the joke, of course, was that's why the guys went, but the girls went so they could get one of the doctors from across the street, yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember people saying that.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  It often happened, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was not an aspiration of mine.  And it, it--I, I just didn't, I didn't stay, I didn't stay.  I wasn't doing, I just wasn't doing well academically.  I was having fun, but it--there, there was no, there was no light at the end of the tunnel for me at, at that, at that school for what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Now, you said you played basketball with [HistoryMaker] Wilson Frost--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and there's somebody else you mentioned, too?
Speaker 2: Carl Bonner (background noise).
Story_ID: 284143
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about you playing basketball with [HistoryMaker] Wilson Frost who became--
Speaker 2: Right.  When I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I did play basketball.  Wilson Frost, or as we called him Squint, and Carl Bonner, they were seniors, and I played with them for, for a year.  And it was good because I knew them both from, from here in Chicago [Illinois].  And then to go away to school and be with some-, somebody from the city, somebody that I knew, made it a lot easier for me to make that transition.  It was difficult.  It was, in retrospect, it was more difficult than I think that, that I was aware of then.  Again, there's that mid-graduation that I keep making reference to, that I, I had an adjustment to go through.  And it's much more difficult in college than it was in high school because when I went to college, having graduated at mid-year [from Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]--when I get to school, I'm in classes with people who had the first half of the session already.  If I go into a class like, like zoology, like I did, they've gone through half of the semester already.  And now, here I am--they're starting out.  I don't know what the heck they're talking about, and to compound that--
Speaker 1: So, you had to start college the second semester, in the second--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated January 26.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't, like wait until the next fall.
Speaker 2: Till June--no.
Speaker 1: You just went right--
Speaker 2: I went right away, I went right away, as was the custom unless, unless there might have been--not that it was in my case--unless there might have been some extreme financial situation where you needed to work in order to pay for that first semester.  Then, of course, some folk did do that.  I was fortunate enough that my parents [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill and Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] were able to send me to school that, that early, but it wasn't extremely expensive then.  So, I was able to go away to school.  And there was no scholarship, you know, there wasn't a scholarship.  They paid.  My parents had to, had to work that, that same job that I'd made reference to--my dad having to, to be involved in another, a number of ways to finance my, my education.  But, yes, I graduated mid-year, and I went away to school.  January 26, I graduated.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated in 1949?  Was in '49 [1949]?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --January '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I remember graduating then, and then by, by February 2, I was offered a basketball trip.  I hadn't even met all of my classes.  I was gone--playing basketball.  So, I was lucky to be with guys like Carl Bonner and, and Wilson Frost, who kind of guided me along.  But, you know, here I am, I'm in school.  It's my responsibility to do the kinds of things that I needed to do.
Story_ID: 284144
Speaker 1: But I have a friend, she's a friend now, and I realize that she was a friend then [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was--her name is Billie Adams [HistoryMaker Dr. Billie Wright Adams].  She was Billie Wright then, Billie--she's a physician.  Well, Billie was a graduate student then, and she was a graduate assistant in the same zoology class that I spoke of.  And I went to one class.  And then, the next thing I knew, I was gone again to play basketball.  When I came back, we had a quiz.  And, of course, I had no idea what they were talking about.  I saw this frog, and all I thought was, man, is it putrid!  So, after I'd bombed this quiz that she gave, and she had been to a couple of basketball games, and she called me into her office.  And I recall very vividly--she and the primary professor whose name was Collier [ph.], she sat me down and she said, "Well, Mr. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], you're from Chicago [Illinois] right?"  I said, "Yes."  She's asking me some basic kinds of things and said, "Well, what do you want to do?"  And I mumbled something.  I'm not sure which--I never wanted to say that I wanted to be a dentist because I didn't really want to be a dentist.  But I told her that I was going to major in, in pre-dent.  So, she said, "Well, we need, we need to talk about you and basket--."  She said, "You had a great basketball game night before last, you know. Couldn't see a freshman come in, you know, you seem to be having a great time on campus.  But we're going to have to do something about this, this zoology class."  And she really, really helped me because I think she saw that, that I was torn between getting involved in something that I wasn't particularly interested in and, and athletics.  And because she had a sense of athletics, she saw that right away, and really, really truly helped me, so that I wouldn't say, "Well, the heck with this, I'm not going to get involved with this."  She's a friend of mine today.  And she has season basketball tickets to the [Chicago] Bulls.  And she takes me to games today, only because she says, she thinks I know everything about basketball because I appreciated basketball, you know.  And I said, well, I guess I still owe you from 1949 when you kept me from flunking the zoology class.  But she's great.  But I, I had, I had really no idea about, about my future.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's one of the great doctors here in the City of Chicago now, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, she's one of the great pediatricians.  And one of the things that I tease her now about is that she no longer has that ticket, but she still buys tickets because she takes her students, the med students, the students that she's training, and she takes them to the games.  And she does all the kinds of things that, that you wouldn't necessarily expect someone in her position to do, but she has that kind of interest in them and she does it.  I tease her also because I tell her that she takes me now because [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates is not in the city.  And, and so, I know that Harold is her very favorite.  So, she jokes and we, she jokes about that but, but she's great.  She really helped me.  I'll never, never, ever be thankful enough for her about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 284145
Speaker 1: So you were at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] for two years?
Speaker 2: For a year and a half.
Speaker 1: A year and a half, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was at Fisk for a year and a half.  And, well, left--my, my intentions were to go to either Lincoln [University] in Jefferson City, [Missouri] or I even thought about going to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] because I had some friends who were at Tennessee State, you know, Eugene [ph.] and Leroy [ph.].  They were there playing football, so I thought about going, going there, and doing some things there.  But I have a cousin who was on staff at Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  When I attended, when I transferred Fisk and went, went there, it was Arkansas AM and N, Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal.  It is now the University at Arkansas at Pine Bluff.  So, my cousin was a part of the music staff there.  And she was dating the basketball coach, so she said to him, "I've got a cousin who, who wants very much to come to school here.  We need to kind of talk to him and see if he might be interested in really coming down here to school."  And there I went, and it was really a good move for me, really a good move for me.  I, I enjoyed it and made great friends, really, really great friends from East St. Louis [Illinois] and St. Louis [Missouri], and in Arkansas just around--had a great time, joined the fraternity there.  And I hope you don't ask me which fraternity because I could only be a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] (laughter), but I had great fun there.  I had, had, I still--one of my very dearest friends was there.  I didn't know he was in school there, Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.], who, who now lives in Connecticut.  I didn't know Darwin was in school there, and he was there playing football.  And, and I had not seen him since we were little guys.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he became a great corporate CEO.  We interviewed him two months ago in Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Did you really interview Darwin?
Speaker 1: Right, Darwin Davis, right, uh-hm, Darwin Davis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was a senior vice-president of, of the Equitable [Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, yeah, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: I (unclear).
Speaker 1: --I can see him.  His picture is of--he's got his football picture from--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --University of Arkansas AM and N--
Speaker 2: AM and N, right--
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's right, uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a, he's a dear, dear, friend, dear, dear friend.  Our oldest daughter [Gina Hemphill-Strachan] lives in New York.  She's with NBC Sports.  And he's in Connecticut, so they, they stay in contact often.  I mean, you know, it's just a drive over for dinner and have a great time.  He kind of looks out for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, small world--it's getting smaller.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, smaller, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Smaller, yeah.
Story_ID: 284146
Speaker 1: The days I spent in Pine Bluff [Arkansas] was, was good.  It was unique and different.  And it was not as, as, as stark, a reality as it was when I first went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] because the few times I was South, I went with my parents [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill and Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] when I was either going to, to Kentucky, seldom Dyersburg [Tennessee], so I didn't have any knowledge of the South.  So it was kind of like, why can't I go here?  No, I'm not going to the (unclear).  I've got go around to the back door to get into this movie.  No, I'm not going to do that.
Speaker 2: So, Nashville [Tennessee] was a cultural shock (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was, it was, oh, it really was because we would go--when I first, when I got off the, got off the train, just going to the--on the train, there was a point that you could no longer ride in that, in that part of the train.  At Popular Bluff [sic. Poplar Bluff, Illinois], you had to get off, and go to another section of the train.  Because from that point on, you couldn't ride in that section of the train at Popular Bluff.  So, I didn't know why somebody was coming to wake me up--, "Wake up, boy, wake up, boy, now, you got to go back to the other car."  Yeah, I was--what, what is this, what is this about?  And then to get off the train, I don't know where in the heck I am.  I got to catch a cab.  And I don't have, but x number of dollars.  I got to catch a cab to go over to the college.  And to see the signs, it says, colored, white, you know--what do I know?  I don't know anything about that.  So, it was, it was really strange for me.  And then, to, to go to the show, there was, there was a fear right there on Jefferson Street.  You could go to the show right there, of course, but if you were to go downtown to, to the theatre, you had to go around the back, and go up to the balcony to the movies.  And I thought, naw, no, I don't need to do this.  And it was funny sometimes when we'd go up there.  And when you got ready to leave, you may throw popcorn down on the folk down below, you know.  It was fun, but you had to get the hell out of there quick, you know, before the usher or whomever else might come up and get those college guys.  But they--some of the people though were--they held Fisk, Fisk in, in high esteem because of the academia there, so they did look upon the Fisk students as, you know, a little above and beyond most other folk.
Speaker 2: Now, you're referring to the white people in there?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and some of the black people also.
Story_ID: 284147
Speaker 1: But my, my great-grandmother, my mother's [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] grandmother, my grandmother's mother lived in Nashville, Tennessee.  Her husband was a minister there and he passed away.  And my great-grandmother would catch the bus and ride to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] when they had speakers that she wanted to hear.  And I was trying to get somebody to sign my card, so I wouldn't have to go.  And I looked up once, and I was coming out of the, the auditorium, out of the chapel, and I see my great-grandmother coming down this walk.  So, I said, "Well, well, momma, what are you doing?  Where, where are you going?  How did you get here?"  You know, she said, "Well, I caught the bus."  I said, "Well, where are you going, grandma, where are you going?"  She said, the reverend somebody other or, or she would name a name that I'd never heard of.  She knew that person was coming to speak at Fisk University.  And she'd catch the bus, come down there, and walk those extra blocks to go, and hear this guy speak, you know.  I thought that's--man, man, and see, that was the person that I should have been really sitting and talking with 'cause--and I later did.  Such a bright, bright woman--never had, never had any, any formal training at all, but she had a memory like that, man, and she could name you names and speakers that she had heard.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Burris, Mary Burris [ph.]. That's how my mother came by--Mary Elizabeth.  She was Mary Burris.
Speaker 2: She was your great-grandmother?
Speaker 1: My great-grandmother, dynamite sister.
Speaker 2: So, as you were ducking the lectures, she was trying, she was coming across town and--
Speaker 1: She--I'm ducking the lecture.  She's breaking her back trying to get there.  I'm trying to get somebody to sign my attendance card, so I don't have to be there (laughter), so I could go down to the, to the Jubilee Hall [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] or something.  And she's trying to get there, and she would get there, and tell you who they were, what they spoke about, and she'd sometime come over to chapel to hear the [Fisk] Jubilee Singers sing.  They were, they were world-renowned, and she'd come there and I'd see my great-grandmother, man.  I spent more time with her then than I had ever had an opportunity to spend.  You know, I'd, I'd catch the bus and go out to her house and sit and talk with her and have, have Sunday dinner because on, on Sundays, you know, you only had two meals.  So, you know, you'd often getting hungry anyway, but I knew I could always go to Grandma Burris' house, get some fried chicken, man, some mashed potatoes and gravy, the whole bit.
Story_ID: 284148
Speaker 1: Such a bright woman.  When she came to Chicago [Illinois] on those few occasions that she did to spend time with us, it was just good to sit and talk with her.  I recall on one occasion, we were sitting in, in the room. And I, I was sitting on the, I was sitting on the Duofold, and there was a picture on the wall on the mantle.  So, she said, "Buddy, that looks like, that looks like Old Bethel [Church, Detroit, Michigan]."  You know, the, the plate had a picture of a church on it.  She said, "That looks like Old Bethel in Detroit [Michigan]."  I said, "What?"  I said, "What are you talking about--Bethel?"  She said "The picture there on the mantelpiece--that looks like Old Bethel in Detroit."  Now, this picture has been on up this mantle--I don't know how long, you know, what do I know?  It's, it's a picture my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] would put, put pictures, and things like that on the mantle, you know, and all those kinds of things.  I went over and picked that picture up, and turned it on the backside--Old Bethel, Detroit, Michigan.  She (laughter), she could just see the picture on the plate and she knew what it was.  So, she then started telling me who the pastor was there and what he was doing, and how his congregation was trying to get rid of him.  I said, "How do you know that?"  She said, "Well, you know, you talk to people and, and you find out information like that."  So, she's very knowledgeable and very--just, just one of those, one of those grandmas that I wish everybody had, you know.  She just was full of knowledge and just--personality and she's, she searched it.  She searched it, but she never had an opportunity to, to get it by way of the normal process.  She never had that opportunity--a great woman.
Speaker 2: I'm glad we went back and picked that up.  That's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the one who figured that.
Speaker 1: Grandma Mary Burris.
Speaker 2: How long did she live?
Speaker 1: She lived (laughter), she lived to be ninety-two, I think it was.  And when she would come here, my, my girlfriend, my now-wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill], then girlfriend, would come over and talk with, with her, too, because she enjoyed the conversations, too.  So, she said, "Ms. Burris," --she said, "Well, you don't have to call Ms. Burris, honey."  She said, "Oh, no, I will."  She said, "Well, you, you always seem to be in such good health.  You don't have any problems."  She said, "Well, I do that because I drink the good healthy water, okay."  So, the good healthy water--she'd put garlic in the bottle, in a milk bottle.  And every night, she'd pour a big glass of garlic water, and she'd drink this garlic water and she said that, that cleansed her system.  And it, it gave her years of her life, she said.  Now sometimes it, it was tough to kind of hug and kiss Grandma Burris early in the morning, but it (laughter), it kept her here a long time, yeah.  So, we joke about the fact that Grandma Burris always drank that garlic water.
Speaker 2: Well, people say that garlic is really good for you so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't doubt that it is, you know, but you have tablets now.  You don't have (laughter) to drink garlic water, but it--I, I suspect it does have a lot of medicinal merit to it, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's something. Well-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 284149
Speaker 1: Now, when you were at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], did you--you know, Fisk had this outstanding academic reputation.  And some of the professors there are really--I don't know.  Was Charles S. Johnson the president when you were there?  Was, was he still there, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was the president there, he was the president there.  His, his, his home was right, right alongside Jubilee Hall [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and Jubilee Hall was historic also.  It had the, the big oval out front, and the hall was, was just a monumental structure.  And his home was just, just on the other side of that, but I never got a chance to really meet him, meet him.  I would see him sometime, but he, he travelled a lot but, you're right, they had very well-respected professors there.
Speaker 1: I mean, Arna Bontemps was a librarian there, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right, hell of a library there, too, hell of a library, too--just not with the equipment, but, but the structure itself was just beautiful.
Story_ID: 284150
Speaker 1: Now, now at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] now, when you were at Pine Bluff, so things worked out pretty, pretty well.  You had like some sort of, you were used to the South by the time you went to--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I wasn't used to the South but, but I was, I was less foreign, I was less foreign to the South than I was.  There were still some problems that I had but, again, it was that situation where you were on campus, and everything that you needed was right there.  You know, you had a meal card.  You had some place to eat and sleep.  You, you had, you had the academic structures there.  You had the good professors.  So, there wasn't a lot of going out to the city kind of thing.  But, again, it--they knew you somehow as--oh, he's from the college kind of thing.  Whereas at, at--in Nashville [Tennessee], there were other colleges and universities in the vicinity.  At Pine Bluff, there was the University of Pine Bluff like Arkansas, or AM and N College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  So, I guess they just knew because even when we had nerve enough or an occasion to go into the city to the stores to buy things, you were usually treated pretty decently.  You could hear them say, "Yeah, them boys from the college." As if to say--well, okay, you know, let them alone, they're all right.  They're not going to cause any problems--that kind of thing.  But it was always that sense of knowing that, that you're some place that's, that's a little different from where, where you have come to spend the most of your, the bulk of your life.  But it was, it was still difficult, but I enjoyed it though.  I really did, I really did.
Speaker 1: So, you majored in physical education?
Speaker 2: I majored in health and physical education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And one of the reasons I did that because, obviously, I enjoyed academics, as well as athletics.  But Carl Bonner, who is a dear friend who, unfortunately, is not well now, was a phys ed [physical education] major.  And I thought about what I wanted to do, and I knew that I was going to enjoy that, so that was the route I took, and have never been sorry about it a day in my life.
Story_ID: 284151
Speaker 1: Just one other question about Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]--what kind of ball team did you all have?  What kind of (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Uhh, mediocre, mediocre.  We, we didn't tear down any walls or win any conference championships, but we had, we had, had decent teams.  We were always competitive but, and the funny thing, one of the things I learned when I went there, rather than when I was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], there was something about the officiating that was strange to me because people from your campus could be officiating the ball game, or if not, your campus from the nearby campus.  And I just thought that was strange because it just didn't come across well because when you went away, the same thing happened, and officiating left a lot to be desired.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that the officiating, the officials were homers for the teams that they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --exactly.  We won the--
Speaker 1: And the home team got the call.
Speaker 2: --we won a couple games and we had no business winning.  Yeah, we had no business winning, yeah.  I remember the coach who was a big guy from Boston.  He was from Boston, Massachusetts, Bernard, Coach [Roland K.] Bernard.  He was, like "Henry--you better call that game right, or you will never be in this town again."  Well, he lived in Little Rock [Arkansas].  We were in Pine Bluff [Arkansas] (laughter), you know.  We have never been in this town again.  But it was just that kind of situation that I thought was a little, not too cool, not too cool, but it happened to, on most other campuses that we went to.  And I think sometimes, and I'm guessing at this point, because I don't know.  The, the officials were sometimes biased, but they were sometimes working games with which they were not qualified.  They didn't have the training to do that because there was no source of training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were official by designation, but not by training so?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's very well put--by designation, and not by training.  But because even as, as a senior when they, they would have the, the state championships, the prelim to a state championship there on our campus.  We were the state school, so they would come there--the small high schools would come there.
Speaker 1: The black schools?
Speaker 2: The black schools, the black schools, exactly.  So, they had the state championship play-offs there on our campus.  So, one of the classes we took would be sports officiating, so the officiating experience that we had, came as a result of taking the class.  Not really getting, because the, the guy who's training you, who's teaching the class, hasn't had a whole lot of experience officiating.  He's teaching the--a class that's in his curriculum, all right, so he's going by rule 1-A, rule 1-B, and, but having had no real experience himself or herself.  So, we had an opportunity to work part of the state championship games--never having officiated before in our lives.  I worked, I worked--see, and you, plus--I think of this now--we're talking state championship basketball.  And I mean we worked all Saturday, I mean all day Saturday, and we'd get, get like four dollars a ballgame.  Man, we were getting over good, we're getting over good.  I could just see hamburger, you know, Sunday, I might not have some burger.  I might, I might take my girlfriend [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] out and have dinner, you know, have a full hamburger, if she had one and I had one, too.  But, I mean, we got four dollars a ballgame, we worked basketball games all day on Saturday, all day.  But it was just something that we did because we were part of a class in sports officiating.  And they had no one else to do it.  They would bring some other guys in, and that was it.
Story_ID: 284152
Speaker 1: When you came out of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]--I mean, out of--
Speaker 2: Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: --Arkansas at Pine Bluff now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is--what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953], okay.  And you decided to come back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  There was never any doubt in my mind that I was coming back to Chicago, yeah.  There was never any doubt when I came--when I, when I graduated high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I didn't know where I was going to go, or what I was going to do.  But when I graduated college, I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and where I wanted to do it.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't tempted to stay in Pine Bluff [Arkansas] or no?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I wasn't.  I'll share--it isn't my, it isn't my--originally, but I won't name his name because he's a very well-respected man here in the city.  He said he's from Arkansas.  He said, "Yes, he was from Arkansas, the land of opportunity.  And as soon as he got the opportunity, he got the hell out of there (laughter)."  But I didn't have that feeling about, about the college.  But I, I had great fun, I had great fun.  I, I learned a lot.  I met some great friends who are still friends of mine, so it was a good experience for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  But I knew that Chicago was going to be my ultimate place of livelihood and where I wanted to live and, and fend for myself.  I actually liked my high school coach, Oscar Brothman, was influential also in terms of choosing the field of health and physical education because I just knew that that would be something I would be good at and I wanted to do.  Now, I can't say that he was a great physical educator himself, or any of the guys were at that point because they didn't teach physical education.  They were what I called now, and what my, my professor at the University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff, said, "Never let anybody call you a gym teacher. You are a physical education instructor.  You teach health and physical education.  The gym is where you dispense your ware.  The gym is there.  It's not your subject area."  And I say that in those days.  They were gym teachers because when the bell rang, and you would run upstairs to the gym, they would have two big cans of basketballs, and toss the basketballs out on the floor.  And then, you'd run for the basketballs and everybody would run and play and shoot and, you know, and do whatever else you do.  If you played well, you played on this end of the court.  If you're a mediocre player, you played on the far end of the courts.  And that was your phys ed [physical education] class for the day.  When it came close to the end of the period, the teacher would come out, blow the whistle, "Bring the balls in."  You'd throw the balls in and you'd put them in the can.  Or he'd blow the whistle again for some other guys who'd stayed longer.  That was your phys ed class, which is ridiculous, which is ridiculous.  And I suspected that's why we have now the situation that we do have when there is the total demise of physical education as a, as an outlet for kids, as an opportunity for kids to combine academics with, with athletics and physical education.
Story_ID: 284153
Speaker 1: So, they now have almost eliminated physical education from the Chicago Public Schools [CPS], high school where you now only have two years, where as the state code at one time said you had to have four.  But now because there are some people who, who, unknowingly, who foolishly believe that all there is to physical education is throwing out some basketballs for the boys, and for the girls, jumping rope, you know, and sometimes playing volleyball.  And then, when they, when Title IX came into existence, and it was required that girls be given the opportunity--not that they had to play--but the girls be given the same opportunity as boys.  Then, they decided to have co-educational physical education and they did.  So the, the well-informed administrators at the central office decided to have this big meeting of all of the city physical education teachers.  And they brought us all to Dunbar High School [Dunbar Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] to have this big meeting to tell us how we're going to implement this new program called co-education physical education.  Well, I knew we were off on the wrong track when they met us at the door, and they had a female administrator at one side, and a male administrator on the other side.  And they would say, okay, the women over here, and the men over here.  Now, I said, "This is absurd."  Now, you're bringing us into one, one auditorium to tell us about co-ed physical education, but you have the women sitting over here, and the men sitting over here.  So, it was, it was off, right from the onset but--
Speaker 2: Sounds like a lecture to Nation of Islam or something?
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  It was just--didn't make sense, didn't make sense, no--not then or now.  And now, there's some, some schools where the principal has pretty much the run of the building.  Some principals now haven't even decided that they won't have physical education at all.  They may have ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Some principals say, okay, I'm going to have two years.  But before you had to do that, it was a design that you had to, had to petition to have a very, various individual person to petition out of physical education, so, he or she could take a class that they needed to go to college.  And that's why you got out of taking the class, but not because, you know, you didn't see a need for physical education.  But principals just don't understand sometimes.  And even at the elementary school level where they say to a phys ed [physical education] teacher, "Ms. Smith, the seventh grade teacher is out today.  So, you go and cover Ms. Smith's class.  And we don't have any physical education today because you're going to be subbing." And that was that. That's how they did that because they saw no importance to the phys ed program.  And just crazy, and we could say to them, well, "If, if I should get sick tomorrow, and can't come in, will you take Ms. Smith out of her class, and take her to teach my phys ed class while you stop that class?"  And they will say, now, "Don't be ridiculous, don't be ridiculous, you know, these are the minor classes, and we can do without those things."  And that's the way it's treated now.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so even from those days, the days you're talking about, it was an attempt to--I guess, reduce the status of a physical ed, the physical education teacher--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and is a certain amount.  I don't know if educators even--the ones you talk to today--even tend to reduce the status of a physical education teacher.  I mean, it's a, it's just something, it's something--I guess it's a protracted fight, I guess, about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's still going on, I guess, and--
Speaker 1: And consistently so, consistently so.  And, and it's done, as you say even today, even today.  Just, just to backtrack a bit, I think that sometimes physical educators, or gym teachers, have to take that upon themselves.  That's on their backs because if you run that kind of program, then that's how you're going to be perceived, that's how you're going to be perceived.  Now, when you, when you run a top-flight program, then, of course, your principal, and all the other administrators, you know, can back you and, and be proud of what you do.  And, today, I find that it's truer at the elementary school level than at the high school level.  When I do some things, consultant-wise now, now that I'm retired, and I go into some of the gyms, I, I just want to kind of shake my head and, and walk out in disgust.  I mean it's just bedlam, and little instruction is going on.  So, it's no wonder, at some point in time that people perceive you in, in the way that they do.
Story_ID: 284154
Speaker 1: You started off substituting and, and teaching physical education in the elementary schools, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I started out substituting, period.  And I did substitute as a physical educator, too, because before I could take the exam.  But when you subbed in Chicago [Illinois]--well, there were two kinds of substitutes.  There was a day-to-day substitute who was someone who, who had worked at school today, and then go sign out and go home, and wait for the next morning for somebody to, hopefully, call you to tell you to go someplace else.  That person was defined as a day-to-day substitute.  There were other people who were--what were they called--tenured comes to mind.  I don't think that was it, but, but they were, they were subs who could be sent to a school in a vacancy.  And often, that vacancy was in, in your major area if you went into a high school, or if you went into an elementary school, you know, you had that position for over a period of time.  But, as you say, I was, at that point, working day-to-day.  And, again, it was a great learning experience for me because when those chances came--I had a lady downtown who knew what my interests were in terms of physical education.  So, when there was an opportunity for that to take place, she would send me there.  So, I got a chance to teach classes where teachers left lesson plans.  And I saw what they were doing, and I learned a lot, I really learned a lot from that.  And, two-fold, I learned some things that I never would want to do, and I learned a lot from people who would--were running positive programs.
Speaker 1: Now, one thing that I, you know, when I look over the resume of things to be done is we go chronologically through all this.  One thing that stands out is that you, you always emerge in some sort of a leadership position in the schools that you are involved in, and in the activities you're involved in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And as, it seems to me that there is a certain--I mean there's a leadership aspect of teaching physical education that is--I guess, leadership can be developed in other classes in school, but there is a certain amount of leadership that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --that's developed in the physical education environment that doesn't emerge in other places.
Speaker 2: I concur with that.  And I think that, I think that, in fairness to administrators, I've been, I've been demeaning them, to some degree.  But in fairness to many of them, they recognize that.  At one point in the City of Chicago, at one point in the City of Chicago, at the elementary level there, if, if you, if you could pick any one field--physical education had more people who were at--in top administrative positions than any other field--principalship.  So, the fact that I, I've had some leadership situations and leadership, leadership positions, I'm proud of certainly.  But I think that it could hold true with a number of other physical educators as well.  I'm proud of the fact that, that I've been asked to do some things that have, have said that someone had confidence in me as a leader.  And I've tried to, to do that, to the best of my ability.  But, in most instances, I've just, I've just fallen into those positions and I've enjoyed doing them.  And I'm vain enough to believe that when I've gotten those positions, that I've done them well and, and there have been a number of people who have benefitted from that.  I've just enjoyed teaching, and I don't necessarily mean just in the classroom, but whenever I have an opportunity to teach folk, I, I've just, I almost waddle in it, when I can see the, the result of what I've, I've done.
Story_ID: 284155
Speaker 1: You taught in various elementary schools from '54 [1954] to '60 [1960], and then, then you went to Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] in 1960, right, to get a position (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was different about the Marshall High School appointment?  I mean, you know, coming from elementary school to high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wanted to coach, and we just thought that there wasn't going to be an opportunity for quite some time because there were no black coaches in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And when they did offer the, the exam, there were those of us who studied for the exam together--the, the black guys who got together, maybe six or seven of us.  We got together and we, we had long study sessions.  We had to go over to the Wabash Y [Wabash Avenue YMCA, Chicago, Illinois] to go over apparatus work.  And a couple of guys had difficulty swimming because, you see, other than Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], and perhaps maybe one or two other schools, many of the black colleges and universities [HBCUs] didn't have swimming pools.  So, how then do you, do you finish a curriculum in health and physical education--never having had an opportunity to teach and/or learn to swim, you know?  They didn't have a pool.  As large a university as a University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] is, they didn't have a pool because the university [University of Arkansas] in Fayetteville [Arkansas], excuse me, (coughing) had just putting it--had just put in their second pool.  So, there was, there, there was no need to have another pool.  And we had no place to go to swim unless we went out to the, to the park district, the black section of that, and swim on very particular days.  So, when I, I did get the chance to go into a high school, I jumped at the opportunity.  And I never would have guessed that I would have a chance to go to Marshall High School, who had just won the state championship the year before, had won four previous city championships--
Speaker 1: Now, was that the first black high school to win the state championship in the City of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Marshall, you said, they had like five thousand students at one time?
Speaker 2: When I was there, they had, at one point, they had fifty-four hundred students.  The school was so large that you couldn't, you couldn't ring the bell, and expect a student in the four-minute period that he or she had to go from one class to the next.  If he had to go from the old building to the new building, he could never get there if he had to go up a stairs, that people coming down also.  So, they had to devise a system whereby you went up the stairs over here, and over there, you went down, 'cause if you were going up and down, they wouldn't get there.  So, it was a huge school.
Speaker 1: How was the discipline in the school that huge with that many students?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if, if it had to do with the times, but we didn't have the, the real discipline problems because there was a greater respect for, for teachers then, than there is now.  And I'm old-fashioned enough to believe that some of that respect that you got, you earned first by the way you looked.  I could never think of going into a classroom with a sweatshirt and blue jeans, and that's done today.  And when, as the teacher you want to become the student's friend, as opposed to that student's teacher, I think that sometimes you lose the respect that, that you do.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're talking about not being the student's friend, but be his teacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, I think that you can be friendly, but you don't have to be the, the friend of the student.  You could be the teacher, and he or she should be the, the student.  And there's a kind of respect that you really ought to have to communicate what you want to do.  And you don't get that often when you're, when you're wearing dirty blue jeans and, and sandals.  I don't think that's how it's done.  I got in trouble as, as a principal because that was my position then.  And I took exception to teachers who came to school dressed as I define as an unprofessional manner.  And when a teacher said to me, "Well, Mr. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], what does that have to do with my subject area or how I impart it?"  And I said, "Well, I think it has a lot to do with it.  I think you ought to dress like a teacher."  And he said, "How does a teacher dress?"  And I just had to say, "Well, I could only say, not like you.  And I just think we miss a lot."  But we had fifty-four hundred students there, you would think that just the clashing of bodies going and coming would cause some problems.  But I don't think we had a lot, not a lot in terms of the number of people that we had there in the building.
Story_ID: 284156
Speaker 1: Ran into some just outstanding young people.  I found myself often having to defend them when I would come back home on the South Side--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you can't explain what the West Side, South Side thing is in Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 1: It's just unbelievable.  And sometimes, the kids on the West Side would say, "Well, okay, see you later, Mr. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.]--going over to God's country, huh?"  I said, "Aw, please, get out of dodge, you know."  But, likewise, they would say about the kids on the West Side, "Are you gonna over to the crazy colored folks from the West Side?"  And it was just amazing to me that I'm there with them every day and, and they were just such great kids.  I had an opportunity--I was recognized by my, my graduate school for having achieved, and some of the young people got wind of the fact that another friend of mine, Grady Jordan--we were both being recognized.
Speaker 2: This was in 1970, right?
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970], yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970], right?
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, so we were recognized
Speaker 2: No, no, no, oh, oh, in '81 [1981], you know, honored in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Was it '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: You were honored in '81 [1981], yeah
Speaker 1: All right, yeah,
Speaker 2: You and Grady Jordan.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, '81 [1981], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My fault.
Speaker 1: No, that's all right.  But, so we were recognized as, as having done well--having achieved.  And some of the kids, some of the kids, some of the former students got wind of that and, and came.  And I saw them when they came in.  I waved and waved and waved.  So, when I spoke, I gave them an experience that I had when I--they talked about my having gone to Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies].  And I talked about what a great time I had and how much I learned, and I did very well.  And I said, I had one class to finish, and I put it off for as long as I could, and I want some of your folk who are here to stand and, and they did--many of them stood.  And I said, oh, here's Dr. Nichols [ph.], the Ph.D. from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and here's McMurray [ph.], who's a principal over at Niles School [ph.].  I just named a number of people who were there who had done so well.  And I said, "Okay, here are those crazy colored folks from the West Side that you all have been talking about all these years."  And I said, and this fellow, Jim Pitts, Dr. Pitts, I said, I would finish this program with straight A's, but he gave me a B in tested measurements.  And he said, "That's how you got that B--I gave it to you (laughter)."  But I had such wonderful times with those young folk [at Marshall High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], and people just didn't understand how, how fantastic they were--just as people, as students and as achievers.  And they just never really received the, the recognition that they deserved.  I had a great time.
Story_ID: 284157
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] until '73 [1973], right, '60 [1960] to '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, to '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to the Manley, the Manley High School [Manley Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And Manley High School, at one point, was an extension of, of Marshall.  Marshall was so large, it couldn't house all of the students, so part of those students went to Manley.  Manley was, excuse me, an elementary school, so part of the students from Marshall, the incoming freshmen, who couldn't get into the building, had to be sent to Manley High School.  So, when I went to Manley, there were still some elementary school kids there, but the high school also.  But I went there as, as an assistant there at Manley High School.
Speaker 1: An assistant principal?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, 'cause you were an assistant--you started, you were a teacher first at Marshall, then assistant principal--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --then acting principal, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  And, you see, they, they wouldn't give the exam either, again, right.  Oh, they didn't give the exam, but, somehow or another, they threw the exam out.  Yeah, you paid to take the exam, take the exam, and then, they threw the exam out.  So, I then went to Manley as a, as an assistant principal--had a good time there.  If there was a bad time in my teaching career, it was one year I had at, at Manley that, that won't be spoken of about again.  But I had a bad experience at--
Speaker 1: But, what happened (laughter)?  You know, man, what happened (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Why was it bad (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, why was it bad?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Maybe I, I shouldn't, I shouldn't delve into it.  It was not a good experience for me.  It was not a good experience for my district superintendent who, from my perspective, thought me--saw me as a threat.  And he was someone, whom I had respected over a long period of time and, and it didn't work out for me with him.  And it was just not a good year for me and my family.  And it was the year that I lost my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] also.  And it was, as they say in the hood, wasn't very cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it had nothing to do with the kids there, had nothing to do with the kids there.
Story_ID: 284158
Speaker 1: And both of these schools, as I recall, in, in the later, latter '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] were big basketball powers.  They had like a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Manley [High School; Manley Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], they, you know.
Speaker 2: Both of them, both of them.
Speaker 1: Didn't they both win state titles or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, Manley didn't have a team when I got there.  And I brought a young man there, Willie Little, who played basketball for me at Marshall.  And he was teaching at the elementary school at Calhoun [ph.].  And we needed a phys ed [physical education] person and a basketball coach.  So, we talked and he came.  He came frothing at the gibbs, to get an opportunity to coach, and he did.  In the first year, he did well.  The next year, he took the team downstate and lost the first, second game, I think it was.  And the next year, he, he won the state title.  With a school like Manley High School right there on Polk [Street], and to bring those kids down like, it was, it was, it was really, really a social experience for those kids and Manley to go to the state tournament.  And not many of them could go.  We had to, we had to rent buses to take them--see, we were playing in Champaign [Illinois] then.  It wasn't in Peoria [Illinois].  We were playing in Champaign.  We had to take buses to get them there and then, try to find some place for some of them to stay.  And they, they took the old gym, which was Huff Gymnasium [Huff Hall] where, where DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] played, and they put cots down, and they stayed there.  And then, some of them had to come back, but it was really an experience for them.  And Coach Little has passed on now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a coach at Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois] at one point, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yes, a coach at Kennedy-King now.  When he died, he was coaching at Kennedy-King.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he died unexpectedly, right, so--
Speaker 2: No, not really--
Speaker 1: Not really--
Speaker 2: --he'd, he was ill when he was at Manley.  He had a rare illness that was respiratory.  And at a point, I recall when he recognized--and he called me and he was, he was crying because he didn't know what was happening with him.  He said he couldn't, couldn't make a muscle and, and he was just, just withering away.
Speaker 1: So, he'd been sick for a while?
Speaker 2: He'd been sick for a while, he'd been sick for a while.  But he did a fine job, just a fine job with, with coaching the basketball team there at Manley High School.  And just very recently, they named the gym there at Manley for him.  They had quite a ceremony over there.  My wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and I went and I spoke.  And there's a big picture of him there, and it was a very small gym, a very small gym for the team to have done it well--to have done as well as they did was, was quite phenomenal.
Story_ID: 284159
Speaker 1: In my years, as a, as a coach and teacher, one of the greatest athletes, if not the greatest all-around athletes that I've ever known, was Wayne Stingley.  Now, most people know the name, Stingley, as it relates to Darryl Stingley, and his, his unfortunate accident while playing with the [New England] Patriots.
Speaker 2: Right, he was hit by Jack Tatum and--
Speaker 1: He was hit by Jack Tatum with a vicious, illegal hit, for which he boasted about how great a hit it was.  I taught Darryl in elementary school.  I taught him--I was his phys ed [physical education] teacher when he was in grade school at Gregory Elementary School [John Milton Gregory Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  And I knew him as a little kid, and he was a great little, little athlete then.  And when he came to Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], he was an outstanding athlete, but he followed his brother, who was Wayne Stingley.  And when I got to Marshall, as I said, I was coaching frosh-soph basketball, but I assisted with the varsity basketball team.  So, we're getting ready for practice one day, and Wayne comes--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, pause, Stingley, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I, when I first got to Marshall, I was coaching frosh-soph basketball, and I also coached, assisted with the varsity team.  So, I was standing at the door and Wayne said, "I'll be back, I've got to go."  I said, "No, no, no, you can't leave, we're about to practice."  So, he said "I'm going downstairs to the track meet.  I've got a high jump."  So, I'm just an assistant, so he left.  And I said to the then-athletic director, Bosco Levine [Nathan Bosco Levine], I said, "Bosco, Wayne just went downstairs about some kind of track meet downstairs."  He said, "Yes, he runs track."  I said, "Oh, okay, fine so, fine."  So, he left and went down and jumped once.  The track meet was downstairs in the small gym.  He went downstairs and jumped once.  He came back upstairs.  He said, "When somebody comes to the door to get me, would you call me?  I'm passing up on my next three jumps.  I'll just go down and jump the last jump."  And the guy, "Tell Stingley, you better come down here, come down here."  He went downstairs, jumped again, won the high jump, two jumps.  All right, I said, man, this guy is something.  I'm watching him play basketball.  He's shooting left-hand jump shots and all that kind of foolish, but he wasn't the start on the basketball team.  He was the sixth man on the basketball team, but, mind you all, this is a state championship team.  And they've got, they've got, they got all, all-Americans on this team.  So, Wayne was the sixth man, and sometime did start--outstanding basketball player.  Then we get to football--I've been told by the principal that I've got to be the assistant football coach.  So then, I'm assisting Jim Peeples [ph.] with football.  And here is Wayne Stingley again--he's a quarterback.  Not only is he the quarterback, he's punting and kicking extra points.  I said, this guy is unbelievable.  I believe him.  His mother was always at the games.  She's yelling and screaming, "Come on, Wayne, come on, Wayne, come on, Wayne."  And my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] would always joke about the fact whenever she'd come to a game, there was this lady, Ms. Stingley, who was always yelling, come on, Wayne.  So, at the end of the, the school year, we get ready to have a little picnic for the kids in the swimming pool.  So, we prepared some sandwiches and pop and stuff for them in the swimming pool.  So, he came over to me and he said, "You want, you want to go down and back once?" I said, "Wayne, you do it very well, man, as a football player and a basketball player, but leave well enough alone."  And I said, "You, you don't want to do this."  He said, "Well, let's, come on try it, let's give it a try, old man."  So, we did this--we jumped in the pool.  And the kids all standing around, "Oh, oh, oh." So we jump in the pool.  So, we go down a length and I get there, I make my turn, and I start back, and I don't see him.  Now, I'm not going to embarrass him, but I want to make certain I beat him.  So, I breathe from my left side, but I don't see him, so I look over here, and I don't see him.  So, I think he's so far back, I'm now, go ahead now.  I'm just going to blow him right out now.  So I do--I just give it a kick, man, I'm splashing like wow.  So, when I touch, I turn back to, to see him.  He's standing out of the pool, reaching down to help me out of the pool.  He spanked me something good and unreal.  And I'm not a bad swimmer, I'm not a bad swimmer at all, but everything he did, he excelled at.
Story_ID: 284160
Speaker 1: And I didn't find out 'til later that he was also a fantastic gymnast, but we didn't have that at, at Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  But I've never encountered an athlete who did so many sports so very, very well.  And most folk think of, of Darryl Stingley, who is also an outstanding athlete.  He played basketball for us too, played football, as you well know, and did some of everything.  As a family, I think, and there was another brother, whom I later met, but didn't really know.  And I was told that he was probably as good, if not better, than all of them.  But just never really followed up on it--it got kind of pushed aside there were some other kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Now, what happened to--was it Dwayne or Wayne?
Speaker 1: Wayne--
Speaker 2: Wayne--
Speaker 1: --Wayne Stingley.
Speaker 2: --okay, Wayne Stingley.
Speaker 1: Wayne Stingley came back, after he finished Northeastern [sic. Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, Illinois], coached here in Chicago [Illinois] for a spell at, at CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois], coached.  He was assistant football coach and did some other kind of coaching there.  He was never able to get the basketball team because in those days, when you got one of those spots, you stayed, you know, you stayed.  But that's where he taught for a while.  And, then, he got a McDonald's franchise and left the system.  And now is in Phoenix [Arizona] I think it is, and he has six McDonald's.  He came in, came in--no, last year.  They have a hall of fame induction at, at Marshall, and he was inducted to the Marshall hall of fame there.  And I was emceeing the program for them, and I shared that story with, with him.  And they all laughed and said, "You got it right, Wayne."  And would you believe his mother was there, yeah, his mother was there, and, of course, Darryl was there.  It's just great, just great to see those guys.
Story_ID: 284161
Speaker 1: Well, speaking of great athletes, there are two stories I want to ask you about.  Well, one is, one has been like you know, a big part of your life.  That's Jesse Owens.  You married Gloria Owens [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was a daughter of Jesse Owens, the great Jesse Owens.  How did you all meet, and did you know that she was related to Jesse Owens when you met her?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, I started--my first assignment was at Burke Elementary School [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and I was in the gym there.  I was the phys ed [physical education] teacher there.  There were two of us--a lady, Mrs. Wilson [ph.], who was very helpful to me as a beginning teacher, as I was.  And my, my gym was on one end of the corridor, and her classroom was on the extreme opposite end of the classroom of, of the hallway.  And a kid came down and, and said, Mr. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], can you come down?  Ms. Owens needs help with a pencil sharpener.  The pencil sharpener was broken.  So, I, I went down, and I hadn't seen her before.  And I went and repaired the, the pencil sharpener just by taking the shavings out and dumping the shavings in the wastebasket, and putting it back, so it would turn.  And I noticed that this lady was a very attractive lady.  And I thought, wow, this is a--she's a tough lady.  So, we got to be friends.  And, and there was no lunchroom, so we had lunch in the library.  So, all the teachers ate, and we got a chance to meet.  And one day, she invited me by to come by and have dinner.  And I did, and I went there, and I walked--as a matter of fact, I walked.  She lived on 69th Street, and I walked to her house to have, have dinner.  And I met her mother [Ruth S. Owens] and her two sisters [Beverly Owens and HistoryMaker Marlene Owens Rankin], and we were having a nice time.  And before she came out then, that we're going to have this steak on--we're having it on a tray.  We're sitting and there wasn't any room to eat it.  And this man walks through the door, and I see him and I think, "Wow, wow, this is Jesse Owens."  And then, like the oaf, I'm thinking, "Ohh, man, ohh, no, Gloria Owens--Jesse Owens."  And he came in and he's--calls everybody chap.  And he says, "Hello, chap, how are you, how are you, how are you, what's your name?"  I told him my name.  And, "Yeah, do you teach--what's going on?"  I said, "Yeah." We chatted a little bit, and he went on back in the back room.  And she came out and, and she said, "Did you meet my father?"  I said, "That's your father?"  She said, "Yeah."  I said, "Oh, man, that's awesome."  And we had been out a couple of times, you know, I picked her up.  We went out and came back.  And I was working with her every day, and I never knew her father was Jesse Owens.  But he was, he was quite a guy, quite a guy, had, obviously, lots and lots and lots of stories.
Story_ID: 284162
Speaker 1: I had an opportunity to travel with him [Hemphill's father-in-law, Jesse Owens] a lot, went, went to the Olympics with him, went to that tor--
Speaker 2: Which one did you go to?
Speaker 1: We went to, to Munich [Germany], the (unclear) games, where they massacred the Jewish athletes.
Speaker 2: Was it '72 [1972] when the--
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972]--
Speaker 2: --I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, yeah.  It was quite an experience, quite an experience.  But, and my, my oldest daughter went with us, and she's a tall young lady.  And at that time, in her life, she was having some difficulty with her height.  And another friend of ours, Willye White [HistoryMaker Willye B. White], Willye, Red White, who was a sprinter and, and broad jumper.  Willye and I were friends and have been friends all these years.  So, Willye brought her along into the village where the athletes stayed.  Well, her grandfather [Jesse Owens] got her the pass, and got her a little uniform and everything, so she wore this.  And she was in the village, and Wilma Rudolph, who was also quite tall as, for a woman, just took a liking to her.  So, Red and, and Willye, Wilma Rudolph, just took Gina [Hemphill] around, and she was all over everywhere, you know.  And some, at one point, she was signing autographs because people thought that she was an athlete.  And I had to drag her out of there, you know, it was funny.  But, yeah, he provided an opportunity for, for us to experience some things that certainly we would not have a chance to do, had it not been for him.  And it was so ironic that some years later, that, that daughter, the oldest of our two wonderful daughters, carried the Olympic torch into the stadium in Los Angeles [California].  And my mother-in-law [Ruth S. Owens] didn't know--no one knew it was a big secret.  And she carried the torch in, and it was funny then to see her at that point to legitimately be signing autographs for having brought the torch in, but--
Speaker 2: This was in 1980, right, in Los Angeles, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, yes, it was--
Speaker 2: The 1980 Olympics [sic. 1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, California].  Now when did you and your wife meet?  What year was it?
Speaker 1: That was my first year of teaching.
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960]?
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry, '53 [1953]--
Speaker 1: --fifty-three [1953], '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: --fifty-three [1953], '53 [1953], right, you're right, yeah, '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We, we met in '53 [1953].  We got married in '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's not true--I went into the [U.S. military] service in '55 [1955].  We got married in '57 [1957], November 17th.
Story_ID: 284163
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about you going to the [U.S. military] service.  So, you went into the service in '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had been teaching for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was drafted, I was drafted into the [U.S.] Navy.  And, at that point, that was an experience also because in those times, the only black man you'd see in the Navy was either cooking or hanging, hanging over the side of the ship chipping paint.  And there was a surge of, of black sailors who came into the Navy, having been drafted, and many of us had finished school.  And they weren't accustomed to seeing that.  So, because I was a college graduate, and had taught school for a year and a half, I was put into an office.  And, lucky for me, I knew how to type.  And I can tell you, the only reason I know how to type was when I was in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], a bunch of the athletes got together.  And we decided we were going to take cooking and typing, and doing some other kinds of things where they had all girls.  And we were going--so a buddy of mine took a typing class, he and I took a typing class.  He played football, I played basketball.  We took typing and learned how to type.  And it came to, to good worth when I went into the Navy because I could type, so I was in an office.  So, I got a chance to do some clerical kinds of things, and some personnel kinds of things, and administrative kinds of things in the Navy, even though I was there just for--I was going to be there just for two years.
Speaker 1: Now, you played basketball in the Navy, too.
Speaker 2: I played basketball.
Speaker 1: There's a photo on (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played basketball in the Navy.  I was aboard ship on the USS Hector [AR-7].  And I did some swimming with--while I was in the Navy, too, but that was before I, I left and went to San Diego [California].  But, again, it was that situation where they assumed that, that, you know, you couldn't do those kinds of things.  And, and I was happy to do it just to get off the ship, and to do a little travelling in the, in the area.  We were in Japan, and we played against other ships, so we'd go to different sights and, and play.  And we had a good team, had a really good team.  We won, we won the--whatever it was called then--we won that, and the, the officers aboard ship, it was funny.  They were so, so stereotypical sailors because they'd get off ship.  And then, they had to go get beer-drunk, and come to the basketball games and yell and scream, "Come on Hector, come on, Hector, let's go, guys, let's go, guys."  And, of course, we, we were fortunate enough to do well, but it was fun, it was fun.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed getting off the ship and playing ball, too.
Speaker 1: It was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My Navy experience was, was an experience that I, I'd benefitted from, but, but I could have done without it.  I really--'cause I wasn't, I wasn't, I was, I was in the Navy with guys.  I had taught school for a year and a half.  And I was in the Navy with young guys who, who had lied about their ages to get into the Navy.  So, I'm now thrown into an element where some of these guys could have been my students--see, I'm eager to get out, and they're lying to get in.  So, it was kind of different, it was kind of different, and being a black sailor, wasn't, wasn't the best thing going.  Believe me, it wasn't the best thing going.
Speaker 1: You're still like a pioneer, in those days you said?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 284164
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about '54 [1954].  This is the year before you went in [to the U.S. Navy] is the year that the first Chicago [Illinois] public high school sent a team downstate.  I think that really was a speck in the wind--the DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] Panthers?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The team was led by Jim Brown, was it, was it?
Speaker 2: It was coached by Jim Brown, Coach Jim Brown.
Speaker 1: Jim Brown, and the star player, or one of the stars was Charlie Brown [HistoryMaker Charles Brown]?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) yeah, they, they, they were all stars.  Well, I don't mean all-stars, but they would each, in their own right, a, a star.  You mentioned Charlie Brown, "Sweet Charlie" Brown.  There's Paxton Lumpkin.  Dennis [Karl Dennis and Brian Dennis], whose last name I can't think of, and Curley Johnson.  Bryant Dennis [sic.], I think it was, had an outstanding team, so much so, now, mind you, at that time, I was teaching over at Gregory Elementary School [John Milton Gregory Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] on, on the West Side.  I didn't own a car, but I would sometimes try to get out of school early.  We had a double shift situation.  I'd try to get out of school early, so I could find a way.  A friend of mine who taught also, Herb Willie [ph.], he had a car and he'd pick me up, and we would fly out of school, trying to get to DuSable, so we could get in there to see a basketball game.  To see these guys play it, they were just that good.  I was sneaking out of the, out of the building after my last class to get there to see them play--outstanding team, outstanding team.  I mean, they did, I mean, they talked about Chicago basketball being, wild and furious, and just freelancing, but it was--they played a good, good sound basketball.
Speaker 1: Now, the way they lost this championship game downstate, and has been disputed, you know, and, and batted around, debated.  And they're supposed to be, from what I understand, happened, I guess, in the last four minutes of the game.  There are all these travelling violations called on Charlie Brown, you know, who, who had this long shot--this, the day before three-pointers, but he would just put up this long shot and it was, it was going in.  And every time it went in, they called travelling on it.  And from what I understand, the last four minutes of the game are missing.  I mean, they have a film of the rest of the game except for the last four minutes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When it's, it was probably bad.  Well, there's been accusations.  It was bad officiating.  Charlie Brown kind of, he indicates that it might have, it probably was that, but he doesn't try to get into that discussion.  But there's a--what do you think happened?  I mean, did somebody that--
Speaker 2: Well, to, to, to Charlie's credit, and I, I know Charlie very well.  I, I knew Charlie when he was a little boy.  He couldn't, he couldn't play with us because he was so little.  But he had big, long arms that we'd let him come down and play.  But, anyway, I didn't see that game, but I did go down there to see.  Then, you played in a place called Huff Gymnasium [Huff Hall, Champaign, Illinois] which was very small.   And if you didn't, if you weren't able to get a ticket, there was no sense in you going down there because they were scalping tickets like, like, you know, like you couldn't ever pay for.  But in my mind, in my mind, the one official was overtly biased without stretching the point to say cheating, but it was, it was, it was just disgraceful.  It was disgraceful, and I don't know why some of that doesn't still linger in the minds of some of those, some of those athletes.  Shellie McMillon was the other person I was trying to think of.  I don't know why it, it didn't have such a deleterious impact on them as the individuals because when you do those kinds of things that's so deliberate to young teenage kids, I don't care if they're black or white.  It's got to be a lingering, negative impact in their lives, in their minds when they go through the, the rest of their lives knowing that they've been deprived of an opportunity, not because of the lack of skill, but because of what someone else did.  Charlie wouldn't say that, and I respect him for it, but I don't have any reservation at all about saying it.  It having played, having coached, and having, having officiated bad news, bad news.  Now, I don't know how true it is, but I've read accounts of the fact that the one particular official, that they make reference to, often ended up not too swell, you know, living a questionable life after that, sometime after that.  I've only read a accounts of that I don't know, I can't speak to it, but I can speak to the fact that, that one particular game left much to be desired, left much to be desired.  But that team was so good, I'm telling you, I mean, we did everything we could to go and see them play.  You know, they were--it was a great team, it was a good team.  And I think that was--their demise came as a result of somebody else making a determination that they weren't going to win that ballgame.
Story_ID: 284165
Speaker 1: You were talking about Manley [High School; Manley Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I think, before we changed tape with, and Willie Little's teams there at Manley.  And, and also now, you were--you were the assistant principal at Manley, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then in 1980, you were transferred to Hyde Park [Career Academy; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] as assistant principal, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that point in my career, I was, I was ready to stay closer to home.  I wanted to spend more time with, with my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and my kids [Marlene Hemphill and Gina Hemphill] who were, who were high school people then.  And they both attended Kenwood High School [Kenwood Academy, Chicago, Illinois], which was a neighboring rival school, and I really wanted to get close, close to home.  And I was ready to do some other kinds of things.  I really, really wanted to do what I ultimately did do, and that was to go to the central office in, in health and physical education as administrator there.  But I did choose to transfer to Hyde Park, and I had a nice time there, had a very nice time, but good staff, good staff, some outstanding students, some really, really truly outstanding students at, at Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: Now, Hyde Park, they said--well, I've never, this is by reputation--the City of Chicago [Illinois], Hyde Park, at one time, was an elite kind of a school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and served Hyde Park basically.  And I think by the time, by the late, by the mid-'70s [1970s], I guess, people started referring to the area that Hyde Park served as Woodlawn, rather than Hyde Park--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because of the change in demographics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I thought that was strange when I came here in '77 [1977]--some people saying, well, Hyde Park High School is really in Woodlawn now--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --where it used to be Hyde Park.
Speaker 2: Hyde Park.  Well, see, I, I never knew that until I, I saw when they had the special programs over there.  And I'd say, yeah, Woodlawn--it says Hyde Park.  Why is, why is it Hyde Park and Woodlawn?  But anyway, it, you know, that was the case.
Speaker 1: So, it was a black community spread from Woodlawn to that part of Hyde Park.  It just made this part of, of Hyde Park--Woodlawn, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, in people's minds, at least, and not on paper.
Speaker 2: At least that, but, you know, when, when I was, I was a kid, they didn't have many, many black kids at Hyde Park at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: I got a friend, [HistoryMaker] Conrad [Walter] Worrill, was one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Conrad, right, Conrad.
Speaker 1: Leon Harris and some other people were.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, Leon, I don't know.  But knew Conrad wasn't, but that, I knew a few, but there were, there were just a few though.
Speaker 1: Leon Finney [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Leon D. Finney, Jr.] was there.
Speaker 2: Right.  I didn't know that until later either--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause he got involved in, in the Woodlawn Project [The Woodlawn Organization (TWO)], yeah.
Story_ID: 284166
Speaker 1: I was the assistant principal at Hyde Park [Career Academy; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] also.  I had some good years there.  Weldon Beverly [Jr.] was the principal.  Weldon, I, I met when I was at, at Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] in school.  He played basketball at Texas College [Tyler, Texas] and we met there.  I found out he was from Chicago [Illinois], I was from Chicago, and we met.  And, and in those days, because of, of the finance involved, when you went to a school to play, you played two days, played back-to-back days, so that you wouldn't have to go there, then come back, and go--they come to you.  You played them two days.  You play them usually Friday and Saturday.  And that's how I met Beth--
Speaker 2: Tell me this now.  Now, I have heard this, you know, a lot from--well, during the '80s [1980s], people have said it and that had, you know, parents whose sons and daughters went to Hyde Park.  It was a good school for girls, it was a good school if you had a girl.  I think gang situation made it almost impossible for a boy to have a good experience at Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: That was later.
Speaker 2: Was that later?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because there was the time of the Blackstone Rangers [Black P. Stone Nation], so that's true.  When I got there, it had diminished greatly.  The, the hardcore gang element wasn't really there.  But that is true because we, you know, we lived in the neighborhood still.  So, it, it was very definitely true.  It was, it was a job and a half to get a young man through there because you, you either belong to the gang, or you got, you got jumped on, you got jumped on.  But it was a good school for girls for that reason.  But boys caught, caught a tougher time of it.  And it, it's unfortunate, it's always unfortunate when, when the gangs determine who does or does not go to school.  It's always a problem.  But when I got to Hyde Park, the gangs were still there, but not that, that overwhelming hardcore gang thing that did exist before that.  And the thing that always amazed me was with a school like Mount Carmel [High School, Chicago, Illinois] in the proximity of Hyde Park--
Speaker 2: Across the street.
Speaker 1: --across the street.  They practiced on the field across the street, as did our kids from Hyde Park.  But our kids could try to come from across the street to get back in the building after practice, and would get jumped on by the gangs, you know.  But usually, traditionally, gangbangers didn't fool with athletes.  I mean, I mean, you had a, a rite of passage.  You didn't, you didn't have it to worry about, but they never once bothered those guys from Mount Carmel.
Speaker 2: Which were mostly white guys
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, if it's so bad, why aren't you jumping on them?
Story_ID: 284167
Speaker 1: We were talking about Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Career Academy; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  But I wanted to backtrack a little bit to the MOA.  What was the Minority--what is it called--the?
Speaker 2: Metropolitan Officials Association [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Metro-, and no Minority in it, or is it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Metropolitan Officials Association?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said--
Speaker 1: When, yeah, when did you--was that started?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960], and you've got that information there with you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I was at Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], I told you, I was the frosh-soph coach, and I assisted with the, with the varsity team.  And in those days, you would go downtown for a meeting.  And they'd post all of the games, and then the two coaches involved in that game would decide who they were going to have to officiate that game.  The games were never one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or a game six who had--we got, we got Marshall-Crane [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].  All right, so before it gets to game six, I'm the Crane coach, you're the Marshall coach.  So, we discuss who we want to have, so that when they call our game, which is game six, you or I can just tell him, "Okay, I want Dutch [ph.] and I want Lucindy [ph.]."  You give the names of the two officials, and they put those two names up there and then, those two people who'd work the ballgame.  I went to this one meeting because the then head coach, Harvey Hartenstein, could not go.  He was, he was ill, and could not go to the meeting so Dr. Lolly [ph.] sent me to the meeting.  I went to the meeting.  And as they got to a game, I would give names that they weren't familiar with.  I would say, Art White, or Ben Lewis, or Carl Bonner, and the other coach would always say to me, "Well, who is he?"  I don't know him, I never had him.  You never had him?  So, what does that mean?  This is somebody I want to have on the game.  No, and the guy who was--and it's a shame, I can't think of his name.  He was a coach at Crane High School then.  They called that game out.  The guy said, "Well, he's not, he doesn't belong to the, to the association."  So, I said to him, "What are they talking about--the association?"  He says, "Well, I guess, you got to be a member of the COA [Central Officials Association].  Does he belong to that, the association?"  I said "I don't know."  And he said, "No, he's not on that list."  So, Sid Novak, who was a coach at Crane, Sid Novak said, "Well, what do you mean, the list?  You mean, he can't, he can't work because he's not on that list, on their list?  No," he said, he said, "Well that's us, that's BS. Hemphill [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.] says he's all right, then I want him on my game."  So, Sid Novak, who was then the coach at Crane High School, was the first guy in that whole group, and the--it was the [Chicago Public] Red-West then.  He was the only one in the group who would hire a black official.  And that's how we got him in that way, but I'm not going to be there again.  So, there's not going to be another opportunity for a black official to work.
Speaker 1: So, let me just get this straight.  There were--you could nominate anybody you wanted to from the Chicago Public Schools [CPS] to be, to referee the game, or did they have to be employees of the public school system or they, could they, they--
Speaker 2: No, no, they need only to be a referee, and these guys would not hire you unless you belong to this association.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you become a referee in general?  I mean without--I mean, was there a way to--
Speaker 2: Not then, not then.  You refereed if you were decent, and they--the coach knew you, you knew the coach, so they hired you, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it wasn't an approved pool of people?
Speaker 2: To them, there was that approved pool, and that pool belonged to this association.  And that association was called the--
Speaker 1: COA.
Speaker 2: --the Central Office Association [sic.], the COA.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's not--it wasn't ironclad?  It had to be, just had to be with those people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wasn't written, it was never written.
Speaker 1: Never written.
Speaker 2: Never written.
Speaker 1: It was just practiced?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 284168
Speaker 1: So we said, well, how do you become a member of the COA [Central Officials Association]?  And they said, well, you must have three sponsors.  And those sponsors must have had X number of years.  So, they used a grandfather clause to keep black folk out of officiating so we talked about that.  But, fortunately, at that time, there were a couple of guys who were, who were coaching-[HistoryMaker] Larry Hawkins, Moose Bonner [Wilford "Moose" Bonner], and a couple of guys who were doing some, some park league kinds of things.  Jerry Butler was then over at Tilden [High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] coaching.  So, they said, "Well, if you have to belong to an association, why don't we start an association?"  So, I said, "Well, that makes sense, okay, fine."  So, I talked it over with a couple of other guys who were officiating.  And we decided then, if they won't let us in their association because now, here I am--I'm coaching.  I'm hiring people that I--I hired a guy.  He came to the gym at Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] to work.  But what I was doing then, I was preparing to, to officiate, so I would go to their meetings.  You can't tell me I can't come to the meeting if it's an interpretation meeting.  So, I'd go to the meetings, and it was some of us who'd go to the meetings and just suck up all the knowledge that they had.  And they had good rules interpretation meetings.  So, this official said to me, who came to Marshall High School to work, he said, "There are black officials in the COA."  I said, "There are none."  And I gave him credit because he came back to me a couple of weeks later to say, "I apologize to you.  I didn't know that there were no black officials in the COA.  I saw them at the meetings."  I said, "I was at a couple of your meetings, at your rules interpretation meeting because it's open to the state.  You can't keep me out of there.   I was there even."  He said, "Were you?"  I said, "Yeah, I was there."  So, there were none.  And they had the run of the mill of assignments for the City of Chicago Public Schools.  So, we decided, we'll start our own association.  So, we did, and at that--when we got started, we trained guys, we trained guys based on what we knew, and how we could get informed and experienced officials to train guys to, not just to work basketball, but to work football and even baseball, but it's primarily football and basketball.  And I don't know about now, but for years, we were the largest minority.  Okay, and for years, we were the largest minority officials association in the country, in the country, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean you--it spread from Chicago [Illinois] to the country?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, there are other cities that do have minority officials association, but of them, we are the largest.
Speaker 2: We are the largest, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Number-wise, we are the largest.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We are the largest.  And now, now, we, we've got guys, particularly in, in basketball and football, who, who've gone from, from park district ball to the NBA [National Basketball Association].  We've got two guys now working the NBA basketball.  We've had guys--we got one guy now who's still working NFL football.  We've had three who have worked NFL [National Football League] football.  Now, we have women.  We've had, maybe four years ago, I think it was, we, we sent three women to the state playoffs to Peoria [Illinois]--three of them.  They're all-time first, all-time first.  I'm very, very proud of, of the things that the association has done.  I think that, at today, there's some things that I would like to see happen.  But over the years, I think that we've, we prepared more people to do better in the arena of officiating than anyone else has ever done.
Story_ID: 284169
Speaker 1: Now, in 1974, you, yourself, you were chosen to become an official in the Big Ten [Conference], right, a basketball official?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that came as a shock to me really because I, it wasn't something that I really aspired to do.  But I was approached by a dear friend, John Everett, who was retiring principal at Simeon [Neal F. Simeon Vocational High School; Simeon Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois], who's, who was then working football, Big Ten football.  And I was doing high school ball when I could because I was still coaching.  But he said, "Why don't you, why don't you come on, and, and try for the Big Ten?"  Man, I think they, they, they, they would give you an opportunity to do that.  And I said, "John, I'm not really that interested in it."  So, I finally filled out at an application, sent it in, and, and it was looked at.  And I was called and asked to come and referee a scrimmage over at DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois].  And I did, and I didn't think I was really that good--that, that Sunday because I'd, I'd had an exciting Saturday night.  And the scrimmage was that Sunday morning, you know, and I, I was readying myself to go to church.  And John called and said, "Man, they, they want you over at DePaul, you know, get on over there."  And I did.  And the supervising official then was Herm Royal [ph.], and he came down after I, after I, working--chatted with me.  We talked and, you know, asked me if I might be interested in doing that.  And I said, "Well, let me get back with you."  He said, "Get back with me?"  He said, "Get back with me tomorrow then."  So, I came back and talked to my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] about it, and she was excited about it.  And my daughter, who was a basketball fanatic, jumped at the idea.  So, and I thought it would be a good opportunity so I, I did it, and it was good.  It was good for me and I think it opened the doors for some other guys to come in, too.
Story_ID: 284170
Speaker 1: Now, what's all involved in--well, in being an official, you do a lot of running.  I mean, that's one thing that comes to mind.  I think that it's more physical than people think.  You got to really get up and down the court, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it is.  It's very, it's very physical--of course, depending on the level that you're working.  But at Division I, which is the Big Ten [Conference], you really need to be in shape.  And when I started, there were only two people on a crew, so you worked two-person crews, and you really needed to be in shape to do that.  And also, you needed to understand that it was an avocation, and not your vocation.  It should not be, and I contend that even today, it should not be your prime source of income.  I find that when that's the case, you do dubious kinds of things to get there, okay.  And so, I think that you need to be the person who does this because you enjoy it.  And certainly, there's a certain amount of income that you can derive from it, but it should not be your prime source of income.  It should not be that.  But, yes, you need to be in shape, and you need to be rule knowledgeable.  And the rest kind of, kind of flows, kind of flows.  You kind of stay out of the way and I, I give an example.  A friend of mine, who's a big guy, but unless you're really an experienced official, or someone else, you don't even know he's on the court because he's just that good.  He stays out of the way and does his job, as opposed to being the game, you know, you're all over everywhere.  You don't need to do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, personality-wise, does it take a certain kind of personality, or certain kind of control to be an official?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And I know that, I'm not naive enough to believe that the reason I made Division I basketball, the MCC [ph.], and the, and the American, and the Big Ten was not just because I could officiate a basketball game.  I know also that, that they looked at me, a person, as a person who had a job.  I even suspected they may have considered the fact that I was a married man, and I would cause them less problems than someone else would.  And I knew also that there were perhaps some other folk, who were black, who could officiate as well as I could.  But those were certainly factors, I'm sure, that they took into consideration when they hired me because they felt that I wasn't going to be a problem for them.  I could officiate, but I wouldn't embarrass anybody either, by my behavior off the court.  Okay, I, I, I wasn't doing drugs.  I, I spoke English, and I wasn't going to embarrass anybody.
Story_ID: 284171
Speaker 1: I think probably later in my career, I caused some problems for them, and I'm not sorry about that.
Speaker 2: What kind of problems were those now?
Speaker 1: Well, I was one of very few black officials in the conference [Big Ten Conference].  And during those times, we, we--some of us--wore big fat hair.  And I even wore a little, a little hair on my chin, and no one ever said anything to me about, about my hair, but there was something mentioned about the hair on my face.  And I just refused to do anything about it until somebody said something to me about it.  And they did have the guy, who's the crew chief, say that it might be best if I cut the hair off, even if I didn't wear the beard.  So, I acquiesced, but they didn't ask me anything about my hair.  So, later on, when I refused to take the, the verbal innuendos that some of my, my colleagues would thrust at me, and I spoke out, you know.  I wouldn't go to, I wouldn't go to Sambo's for dinner after a, a game.  And when they started telling the jokes, the ethnic jokes, I would never have any part of that.  I would often leave the room.  And they said, "Well, you know, you're not a fun guy."  And I would just say to them, "No, I know that the Polish jokes that you're telling now, when I'm not in the room, I know that they're black jokes.  If you do that now, I know what you're going to say when I'm, I'm not here.  So, I just, soon you're not telling me any of those jokes."  So, I got to be a kind of the odd ball sometimes.  And it didn't bother me at all because the then-supervisor said to one guy, "If you cut off your moustache, you'll get a good schedule from us."  And we were at a conference. And not thinking, I said to some of the guys, "Let's go down and have a beer.  And because there's black officials there, there are some things that we haven't count on.  We needed to just kind of chat about."  And this was a regional meeting, and we did.  We went down and had a couple of beers and sat around and talked.  And this guy said to me that--not me--but he said, you know--I won't say the guy's name--he said, "But he told me I could get a schedule if I cut off my moustache."  I said, "Man, you'd be foolish to do that.  If you look in that room, and notice all the people who have moustaches, other than Figueroa [ph.], do you know that every person who had a moustache was black?  Did you notice that at all?" I said, "If you cut off your moustache, there's no telling what they'll have you cut off next."  All right.  Yeah.  And now we're in a room with all black guys.  Come a white official over there.  But the comment got back to the supervisor.  And the supervisor had another guy, a black official, who will remain nameless--I was at Hyde Park [Career Academy; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] then--call me on my job to say, "Malcolm [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], the supervisor feels that you had a meeting with all the black officials.  And, and you're causing a little problem."  So, I said, "The problem, man, is that he's using you to call me to deal with this?"  I said, "Ed, I don't believe you're calling me about this, man.  I don't believe you're doing this."  So he said, "Well, I'm just doing what he asked me to do."  And I said, "Well, fine, you did that, and that's that."
Story_ID: 284172
Speaker 1: So, the guy--I found out who went back and told him that that's what I had said.  And as fate would have it, he was a young official, brand new official.  As fate would have it, the first game he got, they stuck him with me.  And I was the chief, I was the chief referee on that crew, and he didn't know what to say to me.  He, this brother, didn't know how to deal with me then.  He thought I was going to hold it against him.  And I just told him, I said, you know, "What I said, it was true.  If you let him dictate to you how you, how your appearance is--if it isn't negative, you're not sticking up anybody, and it's ethnic.  Black guys wear moustaches, man.  Now, you have him cut off your moustache.  If that's what you need to do to get a ballgame, then I have less respect for you."  And he apologized to me.  He said, "Well, I, you know, I--that's not really what I said."  I said, "You didn't have to go back and say anything to him at all.  Why did you find need to go back and repeat what I said?"  And I said it, and I mean it today, and he apologized.  He's still working, he's doing a good job--good official.  But he wears a moustache now, though, yeah.  But I enjoyed the fifteen years I did in the Big Ten [Conference].  Some things were good.  Other things, I, I, I had to just kind of hold my breath because I knew that they, they kind of saw me as a kind of a different kind of guy.  But I was going to always be a different kind of guy because I wasn't going to do, I wasn't going to come down the highway after the ballgame drinking beer, and throwing the cans out the, out of the car.  I wasn't going to do that, I wasn't going to do that.  And I was just kind of different, and I caused some problems for them.  And the supervisor didn't like it, and he didn't have the, the guts to say anything to me.  He got another brother to call me to tell me that I was a rabble-rouser.  And I said thanks (laughter), thanks.
Story_ID: 284173
Speaker 1: Are there any good stories from these days?  I mean, as an--were you ever really on the spot?  I mean, referees always seem to be on the spot in one game or another.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you had some colorful coaches in the Big Ten [Conference]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --led by, I guess, Bobby Knight [Bob Knight], being the most colorful one--if you can call him that.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, I've, I've had, I had some good experiences with, with a lot of coaches.  Having coached, it was surprising to me in some instances to be on the court officiating a basketball game, and listen to coaches talking to me and other officials and their players, and realize how little they knew about rules.  You know, I'm thinking, oh, this is a Division I basketball coach.  And he's yelling and screaming at, at me and my partner about a rule.  And I'm saying, how could you not know that, that's not a rule?  How could you not know that kicking has to be deliberate?  How could you not know that? So, you know, you just kind of go with the flow with them, and let them go ahead and do that.  But people say to me, how did you work with fifteen years in the Big Ten with Bobby Knight?  I bet you had some horrendous run-ins with him.
Speaker 1: That's the question (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Actually, one of the best guys I had--when he yelled and screamed about a call, or a lack of a call, it was probably there.  If he said something to you about a rule, he knew it, he knew it.  I wouldn't want him coaching my son, but he knew basketball, he knew X's and O's, he knew rules.  And as crazy and bizarre as he conducts himself often, sometimes it's a show.  And other times, I realize that's, that's, that's Bob.  I know he'll, he'll do that.  A case in point, a very personal kind of thing--over the years, I've had some, some cardiac difficulties and arrhythmia, which I get an irregular beat.  And a very big ball game, [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana]--and my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and many of my in-laws went to Ohio State.  So, there was always a big game, and when it was on television, they all watched it.  So, the big ball game, at half-time, I got ready to get up to go back onto the court.  And I started to get an irregular beat.  It was frightening--boom, boom, boom, boom.  So, I said, "Whoaa, better check this out."  So, I went back out and I sat down.  And my partner said, "Has it stopped?"  I said, "No, man, it's still acting crazy."  So, now, I realize the camera's on me, and Knight is over here.  It wasn't Lute Olson--it may have been Lute--no, I can't think of his name.  The coach from Ohio State was here.
Speaker 1: O'Brien or Randy Ayers or--
Speaker 2: I don't recall his name--no, no, I'll think of his name, but, but they're all standing over me.  So, I asked the cameraman, I said, "Please take the camera off because I know my kids are watching this on television."  He said, "Okay, fine."  So, the, the trainer from Ohio State comes over.  He said, "Listen, take a deep breath, and just push down as if, as if you're having an elimination, just take--do that, push down."  And I did that and, and boom!  It started to regulate.  So, I said, "Wow, I'm feeling okay."  So, Knight is standing over me, and he's looking--his eyes are bulging.  So, he says, "Malcolm, are you all right, are you all right, all right?"  I said, "Yeah, coach, I think I'm all right, I'm all right."  He said, "Listen, this is just a game, it's nothing more than a game.  Don't jeopardize, jeopardize your health over a blankety-blank, blankety-blank, blankety-blank basketball game."  I said, "Well, coach, I, I think I'm okay."  He said, "Are you sure you're all right?"  And I can see the, the, the look on his face that there is this feeling for me as a person.  He says, "Let these other two blankety-blank work the rest of the ball game.  Don't jeopardize your health."  I took a deep breath.  I said, "I'm fine, I'm fine."  So, then, he kind of caught himself, and he says, "All right, then, let's go, let's go on with this damn ball game, plus I don't like the last call you made it on Blob anyway.  Let's go."  And for a fleeting moment, he allowed himself to show his empathy and sympathy for another human being.  So, I've always held him, held him in, in respect for his feeling for me as a person.  But as a coach, I never had any real problems with him.  I was on a, a game, a tournament at Indiana, where we had to kick him out of the gym at his, at his own gym.  We had to kick him out of the gym because he got his third technical foul, but I don't doubt that he may have just done that, you know.  He was winning by thirty some odd points, you know.  He's going to play tomorrow night anyway, so it didn't matter, so what the heck?  You know, I've caused a little fuss out here.
Story_ID: 284174
Speaker 1: So, it was, it was trying sometimes [officiating in the Big Ten Conference]. Some coaches were good.  Other were un-, un-, unwittingly poor.  I had some problems with some of my colleagues who, who made comments that I didn't think were necessary, who would do what they thought to be funny kinds of things if, if I might have been sitting at my locker shining my shoes.  And if I got up to go to the john--when I would get back, I noticed that they put their shoes by my locker for me to shine their shoes, you know, those kinds of things.  Coming back from one trip for the guy, he had, had a few beers by that time, and wanted to know--I asked him could we change the music on the radio because going down there, we had listened to the, to the hillbilly music.  Could we change it coming back, to listen to something else maybe?  And he'd had a few then, and he, he wanted to know if I wanted to listen to some nigger music.  So, at that point, you know, I just kind of took a deep breath, and realize--I've got this man driving the car and I've got to get home.  So, I just told him, "No, I just, just play what your wife likes, and we'll be all right."  So, he repeated it to somebody else when he got back.  I couldn't wait to get home, man (laughter), to tell my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and said, why--I got him back, I got him back, so I'm sure he won't say anything like that to me again--ever, ever, never, again.
Story_ID: 284289
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you coach?  I mean, did you--I'm sorry--did you referee?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I refereed--oh, I would guess, overall, maybe, maybe, plus twenty years.  I did Division I basketball for fifteen years.  And I did the other at the high school level, and at some boys' club kind of situations.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever get a chance to do the [NCAA Men's] Final Four?
Speaker 2: No, I never did, never did, never.  As a matter of fact, as far as I ever got was the first round in the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  They do it differently now, but I worked, I worked the NIT [National Invitation Tournament] maybe three years, and I worked NCAA only twice.  And I never got past the first round but it was exciting.  It was interesting to me because the first, first game I had was in, in Tennessee at, at Vanderbilt University [Nashville, Tennessee].  That was the, the host site.  And it was so funny to me to go to Vanderbilt where I, I couldn't walk on that campus there when I attended school in Nashville [Tennessee] at Fisk [University].  And we went there and got ready, and we, we had our, our pregame conference, had a snack, and went to our rooms.  And when I came down, I had my bag.  We were going across to go to the game.  And the clerk at the desk said, she saw me with this bag.  So, she said, "Are you leaving him here?"  I said, "No, I'm, I'm going to referee the basketball game."  She said, "You got to be kidding me."  I said, "No, I'm, I'm one of the referees."  She said, "That's going to be on this television."  I said, "Yes, it sure is."  She said, "By God, I'm sure going to watch it."  So, it was funny.  You know, we had, had a good ball game, had a really good ball game.  So, coming back, we were leisurely coming in.  She was still at the desk.  She said, "By God, I saw you, you sure did a fine job, you sure did a fine job.  Now, now you come back now, you hear?"  It was so funny because we often say that, that's what southerners say, but she said that.  And I just kind of reflected on the fact that here I am at Vanderbilt, refereeing a basketball game, when it seemed just like yesterday that we had to have special consideration to come over here because we tried to find a place to swim.  And there were those rare occasions when they would let some group of us, a class, come over and, and swim because Fisk, obviously, had no swimming pool.  So, I never had an opportunity to work, work beyond that.  I would have liked to have done that, but never got that chance.
Story_ID: 284290
Speaker 1: --Did you ever referee a Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] basketball game when Adolph Rupp was there?
Speaker 2: No, I never did.  But a friend of mine did--the, the fellow I made a reference to earlier on--Art, Art White did.  And I talked about the fact that it was really, really, really tough to work there.  He did it twice and he said, he was, he was--it was awful, said he was awful.  And the fellow who, who used to coach at Nevada [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and stuck a towel--Tarkanian--stuck a towel in his mouth all the time.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Jerry Tarkanian?
Speaker 2: Tarkanian, Tarkanian, exactly.  Art said he was one of the worst, one of the worst that he'd ever been around, one of the worst bigots he'd ever been around.  He couldn't understand how those kids played for him.  And I read an article, after Art died, that Tarkanian was talking about games and officials.  And he mentioned Art and said, "I understand he's dead.  He probably thinks I was his friend, but I couldn't stand him."  I wonder, I wish he'd just choke on that towel, yeah.  But I had some good times working those couple of games that I worked with the NIT [National Invitation Tournament] and, and the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament, but I never got a chance to go much further than that.  Then, they, they chose individuals--sometimes now they choose crews to go to the next round.  But I was never fortunate enough to, to get that.  I can't think of his name either, but there were, there were only two guys who did, when I was working.  Only two guys who, who did, only two black officials who worked, worked those rounds, beyond the first round.  So, I don't know if that was just by chance or, or ability or, or ethnicity having some, something to do with it.
Story_ID: 284291
Speaker 1: Here's a question--this question comes to mind.  I read so much about sports and, you know, watching guys play, even in pick-up games and so forth.  Has basketball become--are people more conscious of a band of rules, or getting around the rules these days than they were, or is there any difference?
Speaker 2: I suspect that when, when, when we evaluate and assess basketball as it's played today, there are so many things that you have to take in consideration that you're, you're talking about the money that's involved around it, not just while they're playing professionally, but even the kids, kids.  I had a neighbor of mine tell me that his son was, his, his, grandson was number six in the nation.  I said, "Quince [ph.], how old is your grandson, man?"  He said, "He's eight."  I said, "How do you rear an eight-year-old kid, how do you do that, how do you do that?"  But people, past coaches, et cetera, do those kinds of things, and put those kinds of things on kids' shoulders.  And as a result, people at all levels change--how not only basketball is coached, how it's recruited, and how it's officiated.  Now, from the officials' point of view, there are rules, but then, there's such a broad area of, of gray the official deals with, that you don't see the kind of consistency that I think you should.  The, the professional game has just altered how basketball is both played and officiated.  Now, years ago, when you talked about dribbling a ball, you talked about dribbling the ball--your ball, your hand had to be on top of the ball.  Now, if you ever see carrying--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not really called any more, is it?
Speaker 2: --you don't see that.  And they talk about, "Oh, he has a great crossover."  What do you mean, crossover?  He carried the ball over there.  He took his hand on the ball and brought it over here.  Sure, he left somebody over there, but he carried the ball.  That's not dribbling, that's not dribbling.  You talk about Shaq Attack.  You're beating up on a man, you know, all do it before it's called, but I don't blame the officials.  They tell him that's how they want it called.  When you can legitimize putting your forearm in someone's back, and then there's a point at which you can no longer put your forearm in his back.  If you can legitimize putting your hand in someone's back, and say that's okay, that's, that's a game that, that I, I'm not too familiar with.  But that's the way it's done.  And it's, it's--I mean, the official isn't deciding--well, I'm not going to call that.  The book allows you to do it, the rule book allows you to do it.  So, to say that basketball is different, certainly, you know, I'm, I'm an older person.  And I don't expect it to be the same as it was when I played and/or started officiating.  But I was expecting to see some semblance of, of basketball, as we've known it over the years.  And I don't see that anymore.  And the thing that really makes it exciting is that the athletes are better.  I don't care if you're talking about how good those guys were back then in the earlier years.  They were very good, but athletically-wise, these, these guys are unbelievable when you're looking at guys who are six feet tall turning around doing 360 dunks--please, that's scary.  So, you'd make adjustments, and that's that gray area that I speak to, that players are allowed to do certain kinds of things because the rules and, and the perception of what a player is doing will allow them to do that and to get, to get away with it.  I can't speak to the legality of it but, you know, it's exciting, so that's what people want to see, and so they allow you to do it.  They write it into the rules.
Story_ID: 284292
Speaker 1: Now there's, every now and then, you know, watch a game on television with one of these great athletes.  And they make a move, and it seems as though sometimes they're, they're taking more steps than they ought to, or doing something, you know, turning--it's carrying a ball or something like that.  They seem to do it so fast that (laughter), and they create that gray area, you know, where--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.  Well, again, kids, young people are doing things that, that we're not accustomed to seeing, haven't seen.  For instance, I'll, I'll give you two examples, and I was one of them.  I jumped out of my seat when I saw Michael Jordan go up once.  It's clear in my mind that he was going to dunk the ball, had the ball in his right hand, he's about to dunk it.  And the defender came over, and he brought the ball back over his left hand, and laid a lay-up with his left hand.  Now, I say, "Uh, man, how can you do that?  How could he have done something like that?"  And another buddy of mine said, "Listen, man, the next PE [physical education] class in the morning, those kids will have down pat, 'cause they're going" and, sure enough, you know, sure enough, you know, they were doing it then, they were doing it there.  And I had a similar experience when I was officiating.  They used to have a black college tournament here in Chicago [Illinois], a great turnout, great teams.  They brought good teams here from, from the South.  And they played during the holidays, during the Christmas holidays, had it over at amphitheater.  Early on, they had it at St. Anselm's [School, Chicago, Illinois] gym.  It brought all the great teams.  So, I was working a basketball game.  It was on New Year's Eve, and we were going out to a New Year's, New Year's Eve party.  I was trying to make certain that I got the first game, so I could get home in time to go out.  So, Winston-Salem [State College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] was playing, and everybody was talking about this guy who was unbelievable.  I had not seen this guy the night before, so I have this game.  The game is going well, and it's a big guy.  They have a big guy who went to the boards, could get up the boards, and had outlet pass to this guard.  And this guy would get the ball, man.  He was coming down the court and I had the side line.  I was the lead official and he did some, and he brought the ball back around his back, and he spun around back there.  There's a came back around that the defendant came all the way across in front of him, almost knocked me down.  And he's brought the ball back over here.  And I had never seen it, so I raised my hand, blew my whistle, and I called it travelling, you know (laughter).  So, he took the ball, bounced the ball, and threw the ball back and said, "Travelling--how is that travelling, man?"  So, I said, "Man, listen, I have never seen that before and I said (laughter), it didn't look right to me (laughter)."  And it didn't look right at all and, you know, it was Earl "The Pearl" Monroe.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Earl "The Pearl" Monroe and--
Speaker 1: They called him Black Jesus or something--
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he brought that ball around, and somehow, got it behind his back, and then he would spin around, and bring it back.  The guys are falling on the floor.  And, of course, as you well-know, all the kids started doing, and they call it doing the Pearl, doing the Pearl.  But then, you had to wonder, was he carrying the ball then, or are they carrying the ball now?  You don't know, you don't know when there's that gray area I speak of often.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's a, it's a, an interesting thing that they've, they've done with basketball.  And, clearly, clearly, the black athlete has caused them to do some of the things.  As you well know, they, they widened the lane.  Okay, then they, they started doing other kinds of things with the count, and other kinds of things to, to--I think make the game more popular, or keep the guys from doing the kinds of things that they're doing and, and get away with it.  You know, thus, the three-point shot.  Now, they're talking about altering the three-point shot because now, it's too easy, it's too easy, even though the little guys are not sure of the three-point shot, or the big guys are shooting now.  So, it's a game that, that's transitioned into excitement certainly.  But from my perspective as a, as a coach and an official, I think, and at some point in time, it leaves a little bit to be desired because I'm old enough to still be able to appreciate the Oscar Robinsons, and the kinds of things that they did without having to do the things, and some of the things that are legitimized now.  So, it's a different game.
Story_ID: 284293
Speaker 1: You were a principal.  I think your last assignment with--or did you work for the--
Speaker 2: No, my last assignment, I was a, I was--well, they changed the name of the title.  Early on, it was a supervisor, and then they changed it to coordinator.  It's coordinator out of the Office of Health and Physical Education [ph.] and that was my last assignment.  And, administratively, that was the job that I always wanted to have because though I thoroughly enjoyed athletics, I really, really had an affinity for health and physical education.  So, it was the job I really wanted, but certainly at that time, the athletic program was out of that office.  So, we had coordinated all of the sporting events that occurred with the Chicago Public Schools [CPS].  When I was in that office, I had, I coordinated the, the basketball program, the baseball program, girls' tennis, boys' tennis, and boys' swimming, and girls' swimming.  So, I had my hands full, but it was good, it was good.  It was another situation where I was thrown into, to learning something though I, I swam, I never swam competitively, and I learned because I was the coordinator.  I learned how that was done.  I learned how to set up the, the events with the help of the committee who kind of helped me.  But I was always there so much, so that at the end, end of the first year that I coordinated the swimming program, they gave me a plaque and honorary membership into the [American] Swimming Coaches Association because they said that they had never had a coordinator who, who came to the events.  See, I'm--they just put it on paper and sent it, sent it there, but, of course, I, I enjoyed the races.  I enjoyed, enjoyed what I was doing.  And, finally, I had an idea about what I was doing.  Pretty early on, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did you retire from public schools?
Speaker 2: I've been gone now eight years.  And I was, it was, I got credit for some of my service time, so I, I was there for forty years.
Speaker 1: So, you retired in '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and with the exception of the one year I had at Manley [High School; Manley Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I just had a wonderful, wonderful time.  I reflect on, on some of the young people I see.  I see people out now, and when they come to me and speak to me, and tell me who they are, where they've been, what they're doing, and I even read an article in the paper once.  A young man said that, that he was, he was lucky enough to have somebody to come to his defense or, or otherwise, he would not have finished high school.  And he went on to talk about the, the experience he had.  And I was that person and I don't even, I didn't even remember him.  I certainly remembered the incident, but he said that he was about to be kicked out of school for cutting school in a fight or something else that he had been involved in.  And, but that I, I asked that he be given a second chance because he wasn't really a bad guy.  He said he went on to finish high school then.  As a matter of fact, ended up being the assistant over at Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois] when Willie Little was there.  So, it makes you feel good when, when people come to you and say thanks, and you had a part in the success of what I've been, and what I'm doing now, and to say thanks because I go to a lot of funerals, too, of, of people I know that, that could have been better, could have been better, as, as people, could have been better as husbands and, and wives, but they just got sucked up by the system.  But it's really a great feeling to, to run into some people, and to end up being colleagues with some of my students, you know.  I told you the story about Jim Pitts.  Here's a student of mine, who eventually, becomes my teacher, you know, it's a good feeling, it's really a good feeling.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, there are many, but I think that of them, I wish, and I don't, I don't mean to imply that we need to live in a utopia.  But I would like for, for us to just be able to walk down the street without being fearful of, of your, of your, your, your life, that of your loved ones.  And I know that much of that will come, not necessarily of our own making, but because of, of what some other people can do and, hopefully, at some point in time, will do, that we take education and do with it what it can, what it's meant to do.  And it's just not for jobs, but it's just to expose you to so many kinds of things that, unfortunately, many of us don't have at home.  So, I would like to think that those communities that we talk about, the Jackson Park Highlands [Chicago, Illinois], be the same as Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois], and Bronzeville be the same thing as, as Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], that there be that kind of thing.  And that may be farfetched, but I would hope that we would have that for the black community that I, that our youth would stop beating up and, and, and profaning each other.  I would hope that that will be the case.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I wish that I could have had the foresight to plan my future earlier than I did.  I don't know that it would have altered my station in life, but I think I, I would have prepared myself better to do it with greater ease.  What I've done thus far, both socially and, and economically, I'm proud of.  I've enjoyed it all, and I want to continue to enjoy it all.  But I think that if I'd prepared myself better, I, I, I would have, I would have done that earlier, and with greater ease.  And I know that I was fortunate, and much more fortunate than many of my friends, to have had two parents who had my best interests at heart, not just in mind, but in action.  I mean, I knew that no matter what I did on Saturday night, even as a young adult, no matter what I did, and where I went on Saturday night, I knew that on Sunday morning, I was going to be at church.  I knew that.  I knew that every day, every weekday I got up, I knew that I was going to school.  I knew that, I knew that.  I knew that every activity that I had, and that I participated in, that my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill] or my father [Malcolm Hemphill, Sr.] or both would be there to support me.  Now, I'm, I'm, I'm just so aware of the fact that that, that that situation, that so many young people don't have, black or white, and I do know that because that was the case in my situation, without being too vain, I know that, that was the bulk of my success.  And I still have that support now with my wife [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and my darling two daughters [Marlene Dortch and Gina Hemphill-Strachan] who just have always been very supportive of me.  And I just can, just continue to be very thankful that I've had that kind of experience and that kind of support because I think that, that it makes it a lot easier to be successful if I can consider myself as being (unclear).

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider at this particular juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I love youth, I love youth, I love teaching, and I'm experiencing it today.  I would like for my legacy to be that everything that I've done as it deals with young people.  I would want them to know, and I think they do know, that I've done it with their best interests at heart.  I know that sometimes they may not have felt that, but I've been told by many of them, in fact, that they want to thank me for what I did.  At the time, they didn't care much for me about it, but in retrospect, they've said, "Thanks, thanks, coach, I really appreciate that, you know.  I really do, man, I really appreciate that."  And I've, I've sat, and I've had conversation with them.  I've had cocktails with, with some of them by here and by their houses, at their weddings, and when I can, when I can accept the fact that, that they know that what I've done was not always planned, but just a natural affinity that I had for them as young people.  So, I feel good about it.  And every day I run into one of them, they make me feel better about it.  And I'm just very happy about that.  I would like for them to know that.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't asked that you'd like to share with us before we ask the final question that we haven't--?
Speaker 2: Hmm, I can't think of anything.
Story_ID: 284297
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is--our last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person who didn't do everything right, but who did those things in the right way in an attempt to, to achieve a goal.  Again, I say that, that sometimes I didn't do it right, sometimes I didn't do it right.  But in rare cases, if I had to do it over again, I don't know that I would do it much differently because I know that when I did it, I thought I was doing the right thing.  I was doing then what I thought to be right.  And I don't know that, even today, that those things weren't right.  The manner in which I coached, the manner in which I taught, what I do, what I did, and still do for my, my children [Marlene Dortch and Gina Hemphill-Strachan], I'm just very proud of it.  And I think that, that, and I hope that, I hope that they feel that because they're both very successful young ladies, I hope they will feel that, that they are where they are today, not only because of their innate abilities, but because of what their mother [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and father had to do with, with guiding them to the point where they are in their lives today.

Speaker 1: This is a picture in 1956 while I'm in the [U.S.] Navy.  We're just on a little leave off of the USS Hector [AR-7].  The fellow to my immediate right played basketball at St. Mel High School [Providence St. Mel School, Chicago, Illinois].  And the fellow, the farthest left, was from Texas.  I don't remember his name, but nice guys.  We played basketball together on the ship team.  And this was a picture we took after one of our basketball games.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is a picture when I was in the seventh grade at Forrestville Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].  I was patrol boy.  I was lieutenant of the patrol boys.  And I was very proud of that, and I got an award from the then-principal, Mr. Carter [ph.].  Everybody remembered Mr. Carter because he wore a brown suit every day.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next (unclear).
Speaker 2: Was it the same brown suit?
Speaker 1: Oh, we always thought--one of the happiest days in my life, this is a picture of our wedding in--November 17th, 1957.  And this is at the reception.  This picture was in the paper.  I think this shot came from the Chicago Tribune.  There was a similar picture like this in the Jet magazine, but this was the picture of our reception.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next, please.  Okay, go ahead and move to your right, sir.
Speaker 1: This is a picture at [HistoryMaker] Marlene [Owens Rankin] and Stuart's [HistoryMaker Stuart Rankin] house.  We were there.  We, we had an opportunity to get a video game for their son, little Stuart.  And as you can see, we took over the game and had big fun.  We hadn't had that experience in knowing anything about the TV game to make sure that's how to do it and they never got it back.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: You're going to play basketball?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is another picture from Forrestville Elementary School.  This picture--I was in the eighth grade.  And at that point, I made captain, I was captain of the patrol boys, uh, one of the largest elementary schools in the country, and I was the captain of the patrol boys.  I wasn't too happy that day.  My, my [maternal] grandfather [Steve Dickey] had a barbershop.  And the day before, the fellow in the chair next to him, cut my hair and he, he gave me a cut that I didn't care for.  He cut all the hair off the side of my--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.  Any time, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This shot was at the old DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois] Alumni Hall.  It's a big ball game they had that fit other ball games there.  And it was one of my earlier ball games.  I was nervous, nervous, nervous.  And as it turned out, they were playing Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois], I think it was, and it was the intercity rivalry game.  And I was the cause of Coach Ray Meyer's having a technical foul called on me 'cause on outer bound situation, I gave the ball to the wrong team.  And he came onto the court and had to be given a technical foul because of an error that I had made.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.  Any time, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is, this is a picture from that same game.  And that's why I ended up calling the technical foul because my mind was no longer on that ball game, but rather on the technical foul.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.  Any time.
Speaker 2: This is a very recent picture.  We were at a black tie affair.  And Gloria [HistoryMaker Gloria Owens Hemphill] and I were eager to get out because I had recently had prostate surgery, and happy to have recovered.  And the beard you see me wearing was as a result of my having been in the hospital for so long.  And I didn't shave, and I used to wear a beard like that, so I thought I'd see how it looked.  And I didn't get a vote of confidence, so it didn't stay very long.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.
Speaker 2: This is the guy of the hour.  This is Lou Allen Dortch, Jr., our grandson.  This is at our place in Union Pier, Michigan.  We're in the pool.  And I'm trying to convince him that water really isn't that bad.  That's Little Lou.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  One second, please.  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And this shot is at Marlene's [Marlene Dortch] wedding.  It's a great day, a great day, just happy as a lark for her.  And the young lady sitting behind her is Deborah Ray [ph.], a friend of the family, who's very supportive of all of us at all times.  And this is a wonderful day for Marlene and her husband, Lou.  I'm just a proud dad.
Speaker 2: Of course, it just occurred to me.  Well, it doesn't make sense of anything, so but, can everybody run fast in this family?
Speaker 1: I, I joke with her, I joke with her because--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.
Speaker 1: --I, I said, I don't know if you can run.  I've never seen you run (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of Gina [Hemphill-Strachan] at her wedding.  We're, we're just so happy for her because she's such a wonderful lady and so deserving.  And we're so happy that she's doing so well now and has a great husband.  And as you see, I'm still wearing the beard because it's very shortly after my surgery.  And I got an okay to wear the beard for the wedding.  Do you know if there's a picture up on, on the piano--my youngest daughter and my mother [Elizabeth Dickey Hemphill], they're together.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll find it.
Speaker 1: It's a big one, it's a big one.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll find it as I'm putting this on backup.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my senior year in high school at Wendell Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  The picture was used for the yearbook.  And I was fortunate enough to be the captain of that team.  And as a result, I was able to have this picture of myself in the, in the yearbook, wore the big number eleven.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.
Speaker 2: Early yearbook picture from, from my early days at Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  The hair wasn't quite so big then, but it was getting there.  It was the yearbook picture for the phys ed [physical education] department.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I thought this, this is a younger picture.  Your mother with you--
Speaker 2: See, I'll, I'll tell you a story about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looked real contemporary --
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please.  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother and our youngest daughter, Marlene.  I had it done this way because a young person came to my office one day to, to give me a picture.  She said she had a picture of my mother.  She brought the picture in and I looked at it and I said, the picture looks sort of familiar.  I've seen this picture before.  And then, I looked on my wall in my, in my office.  And there is the picture of my daughter and I realized then this startling similarity between the two.  And the '80s [1980s] were much the same.  My mother on this picture was nineteen.  My daughter in this picture was eighteen.
Speaker 2: You're right.  The difference is in the bangs, I said (unclear).
Speaker 1: Uh-hm, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next, please.
Speaker 1: Do you have--

And, unfortunately, all but three of them are deceased.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Here's the young guy you mentioned in the narrative though.  Is that him?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, Eugene Gutter.
Speaker 1: Eugene Gut-, Gutter, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Bob Knight from Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana] and myself at a game, at Indiana.  For some strange reason, he felt a need to send me this picture three days before the Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] game, yeah.  It's signed (unclear).  "Malcolm [HistoryMaker Malcolm Hemphill, Jr.], good luck for the rest of the week.  I just happened to bump into this picture in my desk drawer.  I thought you might like it."
