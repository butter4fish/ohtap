 Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, January   29 , 2014, and I   m interviewing Holly Wilson for the Oklahoma Native  Artists interview collection. This collection is sponsored by the  Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program  at Oklahoma State  University. Holly, you   re Delaware and Cherokee, known for your  small-scale bronze and mixed media sculptures, figures that you often  capture in sort of dance-like movements to express shades of emotion.  You show in multiple galleries, many of which don   t particularly have a  Native focus, and I look forward to learning more about your work  today.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma. I grew up initially in Lawton, and then  we moved to Cherokee, North Carolina. My dad taught at the Indian  boarding school in Lawton and then got transferred to the Cherokee  Indian boarding school. We lived up there for a couple of years, and then  we moved back to Lawton. He finished there until when they closed the  school, and then he started working for the military. We did summers in  Colorado while he was getting his master   s.  Wonderful places to be. So you mentioned what your father did for a  living. How about your mom?  Initially, my mom was just a housewife, and then when we got into  junior high, she started selling real estate. She did that until she just went  back to being Mom. She always did crafts and art-type things, and they  built on the house incessantly, is the best way to put it. (Laughs)  Brothers or sisters?  5  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  I am one of five. I have an older sister, Alicia Wilson, Alicia Sams. Then  there   s me, and then I have my brother, Robert Wilson, and then there   s  April Wilson, and then there   s now Nicole Mu  oz, so all five.  What was your relationship with your grandparents on either side?  My dad   s parents passed away before I was born, and then my mother   s  side, I only knew my grandmother. We didn   t know who the grandfather  was. She told history, interesting lady, a little dark. (Laughter) That   s the  best way to put it.  In terms of the Delaware and Cherokee, are they on different sides of the  family?  No, it   s all through my mom   s. My dad   s side, they think, is Chickasaw,  but it is untraceable. He was born in Idabel, Oklahoma. They burned all  kinds of records that would prove any Native American heritage, so with  his, there   s no tracing back through. With my mom   s, she   s Delaware,  Bob, and then Cherokee through the matriarch side.  So you were back in Lawton at what age?  When we moved back the final time, I started Kindergarten. I think  that   s, like, six, roughly, these days, seven.  They   ve got a lot of different intertribal influences there. Were you, sort  of, aware of those growing up?  Our growing up was interesting in that because my dad was white and  my mom was Indian, I refer to us having a fit in two worlds but  belonging really in neither. Because of the history that my mom grew up  and just the Native experience that she had, she worked very hard to  shelter. We got all the awesome stories, and the beadwork, and the  artistry, but they really kind of sheltered our   . We went to powwows  that had to do with the school. We went to donkey basketball. My aunt  likes to refer to it as,    You grow up white-Indian,    which I think is  funny, but she had had such a hard time that they were very cautious as  to what we were exposed to and how much you did outside of that.  In Cherokee, my dad taught, and he was the white teacher. We had  friends, but most of our friends   it was very select. We actually lived on  top of the mountain at the high school, and so we were one of these  houses   there was like six in the ring. Then it went to the ceremonial  burial grounds. We were separated from, you know, the regular  reservation just because of our location. It was kind of different. It was  6  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  kind of odd. (Laughs)  What are your earliest memories of seeing Native art?  It would have to be the beadwork my dad did because even though my  dad was white, he picked up beading in Cherokee. It was one of the  things that   and I don   t know the legitimacy of it, but he brought  beadwork to some people that had forgotten how to bead or they had lost  the tradition. He could sit down and count out, draw a picture  of   because he did a peace pipe, and he did this beautiful drum thing.  He could count out, draw it out, and then that would be the last time he  would look at it again. Then he would just do the beads by memory.  That would be the first connection, is watching him bead because he was  in charge of the science club and the art club and the dance club. He  would take them to dances, and the kids that didn   t have dress, outfit,  regalia, he actually made it for them. Like they couldn   t afford bone  plates, so they would do reeds and do those up. Whatever it is they  needed, he figured out how to make it so they   d have something to wear.  So really creativity on both sides. (Laughs)  Yeah, very much.  Did you have any other extended family members who were artists?  I don   t think so. My dad was a painter, originally. I mean, he painted in  Idabel. He had murals. I remember there was some painter that came  from Idabel. It was like he had more talent in his little finger than this  man had, and the guy   s a reputable painter. It was that whole age where  it was,    Get a real job. Support your family,    so he stopped painting. In  fact, I have one of his paintings in my house. Whenever I think of art, I  think of my dad first.  Did you meet any Native artists growing up?  I don   t remember any. My mom and them talk about people that they  knew and about artists they knew. Like I remember hearing Woogie  Watchetaker and different names like that, but I don   t know how much  was story-told or how much they ever met, which is kind of an odd  because they   . At the boarding school in Lawton, there were so many  people from different tribes that I would hear stories because they   d sit  around and play cards, and all the stories intermingled. So, like, my  cigar figures really are the Stick People. That   s an Osage story; it   s not a  Delaware story. I have a hard time because it   s all kind of a dream when  you think of growing up there, if that makes any sense. (Laughs)  7  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  What were your art experiences in primary school?  None. We had no art in primary school that I remember. I remember  theater and P.E., and making art at home. My parents were always  building on a house, so I used a table saw in fourth grade. If we were  going to paint a room, we   d knock a wall down and very physical kind  of art making, a lot of stuff with sticks and creating shrines and odd  things in the woods because we backed a creek in both Lawton and     That   s what you did to play.  Yeah. I played more making odd nature creatures (Laughs), is the best  way to put it, but no art that I remember at all growing up in grade  school. I made a turkey once, I think. That was the extent of it.  How about middle school or high school?  Actually, I was going to add one thing. The one thing I do remember is  my mom   s stories of   I used to get up with my dad when he was taking  architecture classes in Colorado. I   d wake him up at five, and I   d have  his pencils and coffee cup, and I   d sit and draw with him. I have little  drawings from just drawing with him because he was studying  architecture. We   d draw in the mornings, and that was, like, the only  thing I remember. I always made storybooks and images like that, and I  have those still, which is kind of amazing.  Junior high and high school, junior high I took Mrs. Moody   s art class in  seventh grade. I remember she   d walk around, and she   d rub her pencils  through her rings, and you   d hear,    click, click, click, click, click.     That   s the only noise you were allowed to make because it had to be  very quiet to make art. (Laughs) You had to be very serious to make  your art. You   d hear,    click, click, click, click, click, click, click.    It was  all perspective. That was seventh grade, so eighth grade, I wasn   t going  anywhere near it. Then in ninth grade I had gotten hurt, so I got to take, I  took art. I was doing gymnastics, but I got hurt, so I took ninth-grade art.  It was Mrs.   oh my gosh, Mrs. Pitchwer? No. I can   t think of her name.  She was such a dear. Mrs. Carter  Hers was the opposite. She was in the  attic, kind of like the stepchild art teacher. It was loud music and    Let   s  express ourselves     It was like,    I love art     (Laughs) And we learned.  That was the first time I learned printmaking, and I actually sold a print  from that year. The first thing I ever sold in my life was a print I did.  It   s a circle, and it has a bird, my birds, breaking out of the circle with  these strange things. That was where it was like,    I like this     (Laughter)  It was like real different perspectives on what is the appropriate way to  create art.  8  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  So they had a little art sale at the     They had where you could submit, you know, like competitions. I got  into some competition she submitted at the state or the   it was at the  building, the Education Building. My piece was there, and somebody  asked to buy it, so I sold my first piece for, like, twenty-five dollars.  That   s not bad for a ninth grade. I was pretty excited. In high school  after that I took art at least one, if not two or three times. By the time I  got in there, I took Mrs. Brown, and she was a nice blend between the  two. I did sculpture, plaster, no clay. Well, no, I guess we did do clay,  and printmaking, and batiking, and it was all   and then photography.  When I got to do photography, that was it. I was entranced. Then I went  to Quartz Mountain  Oklahoma Arts Institute  my senior year. At the  end of my senior year, I got in for drawing and photography. It was a  real tough choice because the instructor for painting was   I can   t think  of his name. He died. Big, Oklahoma native artist. Not R. C. Gorman,  younger than R. C. Gorman, but I can   t think of his name. This is  terrible. Beautiful stuff, though. I can   t think of his name. His art   s all  over Oklahoma, though. Then there was the photographer person who  had no idea, but photography was real. You could go out into the  mountains and take pictures, and go to villages, so I chose that instead. It  was wonderful.  What a great experience.  Thank you.  So how did you end up at the Kansas City Art Institute?  This is my favorite story, and I always get told,    Why do you tell this  story?    I got a scholarship to go to Cameron, actually, University. I went  there, and I failed all my classes. (Laughter) Art, every class of art, I  failed. I had Benson Warren and Kath erine  Liontas, and I just was  not   . It was not what I thought art school was going to be like, studying  art. I was not committed. Instead I   first I failed all those classes, and  then I did a Christmas speech class. In the spring I tried theater or  something. I got smart, and I figured out how to withdraw. Then I went  back to Quartz Mountain. I said,    I want to do art, but this isn   t working.  What do you recommend?    David Blust, who I can   t even tell you how  awesome this guy is, he   s out of Tulsa. He was the darkroom tech.  While I was there, my camp counselor was Shana Parke and Bobby  Harrison, who now are ParkeHarrison, really very well-known  photographers. Amazing stuff. They said,    You should go to Kansas  9  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  City     She was a recruiter for Kansas City, and he was a student there. I  said,    Okay what do I need to do?    They told me how to apply, so I  applied. I actually got in like a month before school, which is funny  because I had no money. Earlier that spring I originally was going to  apply to the Chicago Art Institute. I went to some people that were  professors, (I won   t say who) and I said,    I want to go to the Chicago  Art Institute. Would you give me a letter of recommendation?    They  says,    Well, we   ll give you a recommendation, but you   re not good  enough to get in.    I just let it go.  That was in the spring semester. Then finally by summer, I as withering  and dying inside, and that   s when I met Bobby. They were like,    Oh,  yeah, you   d be great,    so I went. I pawned my camera, my lenses, every  piece of jewelry I had to get a hundred bucks. My sister and I drove  from Oklahoma to Kansas City. I worked as a waitress, so I got a cheap  hotel because it was through the Holiday Inn that I waited tables. We got  a twenty-five-dollar-a-night hotel. We did the interview, and they   re  taking us to a nice meal. I   m like,    So when do you find out if you get  in?    She goes,    You got in  I   m sorry. Yes, you   re in, you   re in, you   re  in     Then I had to figure out how to get twelve thousand dollars in a  month. We did parent plus loans, student loans, and then I got some  scholarship money from the BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It was a  lot of shuffling, and then that   s how Kansas City happened.  That   s a great story.  Thanks.  I read that you had a ceramics focus there, but it sounds like you were  sort of on a photography track.  Well, I got in on photo, and I did their freshman year, which is legendary  in freshman years. It   s a school that the first semester is, like, you try  drawing, and it   s all   we called it art boot camp because the whole idea  is to wash you out. Those who weren   t committed pretty much withdrew  or quit within the first semester. Then the second semester, you got to try  things. There was a performance thing, there was photobook, and then I  got to expand a chair to, like, three times its size, which was awesome. I  originally was going for photo, but in that environment I realized that  they were going to strip photography down and make me learn  photography. For me, photography has always been, I   m capturing  fleeting moments that aren   t planned. That   s how I photograph. I  thought,    I can always take pictures, but if they strip my soul away, then  I   ll never have it.    So I said,    I   m going to keep this here.     Instead, I got very interested in sculpture, so I enrolled, actually, in the  10  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  sculpture department. Then it was very,    We will move this big board  over here.    If you didn   t walk around going,    Ararararawr,    you just  weren   t really recognized. I thought,    I don   t have to make sculpture and  have this.    A friend of mine, my roommate, was doing ceramics, and I  loved it. They did the figure. They were making pots. They were making  sculptures. I was like,    I   m going to go do that.    I   d made one clay pot  in my whole life, which is really funny, and I fell in love with it.  The first time I was there, I had to make a whole bunch of pots, and I  was like,    I   m done making pots.    Then we got to make figures, and that  was where my true romance began, is with the figure. I have a ten-foot  sculpture, I think, behind the Delaware tribal complex, sleeping  somewhere. It was my picture of myself. Right now at the back of my  parents    yard is an eight-foot sculpture I made in graduate school.  I finished my degree in ceramics there, and when I went to graduate  school, I realized I wanted to learn how to make things be more delicate  on a single toe. The problem with clay is you   re fighting the weight of it  and the fragility of it and all of these things, and that   s when I took a  jewelry class and fell mad   (I   m probably jumping your subjects there)  I fell madly in love with metal working. I made these tiny figures that  are only about this big in jewelry. My MA was ceramics. I finished  making large clay figures and plaster. Then when I did my MFA,  because I separated them so I   d have more time to experiment, I  switched to sculpture. Then I learned the foundry. That   s where I left  photography altogether, clay, and then to bronze. The funny thing is  photography is always there, but photography has always been   . Like,  my first time showing photography was actually at the Heard Museum  that I showed prints. And I   ve gotten in     This last year?  This last year, yeah, and I sold one of the pieces for the first time. I   ve  been doing photography since high school, which is funny. It   s always  the backstory. A lot of my pieces begin in photo, and then they come to  life in metal or encaustic. It   s always, typically, how I capture a piece  because you get that fleeting moment that you get in photography. Then  you can have that to look at and build on. Did I mess you up?  So did you go immediately on from undergrad to graduate work? Did  you work in between?  No, I applied to about six grad schools and got turned down by every  one of them first. (Laughs) It   s kind of like the way my world goes.  (Laughs) Then it turns out later that I got a less than admirable letter of  recommendation from my professor because I wasn   t a real   I   ve never  been a,    Here   s what you should do.       Yes, sir.       Yes, ma   am.    I   m  11  Little Thunder  Wilson  like,    But why?       Why    gets you in trouble, but my mom and dad are  always like,    Why? Why? Why?    I took a year between undergraduate  and graduate. I went home to Lawton, and I got my real estate license. I  sold real estate with my mom while I went through Cameron again, this  time to get my teaching certification, the ol    back-up plan. I got certified  K through twelve, and I went through all summer to the next summer  and finished that. Then I sold real estate at the same time, which is kind  of funny.  While I was there I met a woman who was dating a professor from  Stephen F. Austin State University. They were like,    Oh, you should  chat with them.    They all knew each other. She was doing a show. So I  says,    Well, I did clay and was   .    She   s like,    Well, he went to Yale,  and he went to Harvard.    No, Yale and then Alfred  University , big,  clay god places. I said,    Oh, this sounds great.    I got an interview and  got in down there, and that   s when I found out about the bad letter  because they were all,    You   re a troublemaker.    I   m like,    No, I   m not a  troublemaker. I just don   t swim with the fishes all the time.    That   s  where I started, and I did my MA first for one year, got my MA in one  year. Then you had six years to do your MFA, and I did my MFA. I was  there for a year and a half, but I took a full six years to work on my  MFA, partially financially, but I was showing at the same time, too.  So you were selling a little bit, earning a little bit.  Yeah. When I was in Kansas City, they always had a show at the end of  each semester, so I started selling art in ceramics right off. I would sell  most of my pieces to collectors in Kansas City. My big coup de gr  ce in  Kansas City is I sold to Lennie Berkowitz at the Garth Clark  Gallery ,  which I thought was really funny, the little figures that irritated my  professor to no end. Then he was like,    Oh, I always loved those,    and  I   m like,    Yeah, sure, whatever.    (Laughs). It   s just one of those  funny   I love this story. Some people are like,    Are you bitter?    I   m  like,    No, they   re funny because they   re life.    That   s how it happens  sometimes.  Then when I got to MA, I went down and decided I want a real gallery.  When I was in Kansas City, I had gone to Leedy-Voulkos  Art  Center    I think it was still the Leedy-Voulkos gallery. It was when Jim  Leedy and Sherry Leedy were still married. They had a huge massive  space. It was awesome because they had contemporary stuff going, but  they also had student spaces. I said,    Jim, if I clean this up, and I paint it,  and I sheet rock it, can I show some art here?    He said yes. That was my  first, on my own, solo show in a real gallery. Then when I went to  graduate school, I said,    I   m going to go get a gallery.    I went down to  Houston because my graduate is in Stephen F. Austin State University in  12  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Nacogdoches, Texas.  I knew I was going there because I couldn   t spell Nacogdoches. It   s a  tongue twister, too. I go to Houston with a friend of mine during my  MA, and I had my little sheet of slides on the day of slides, and my little  r  sum  . I just started on cold quit. Knock, knock, knock.    Hello, my  name is          All right, thank you.       Hello my name is          Thank you.        Hello my name is       Some people were nice. They were like,    Well,  the work is interesting but you need more shows and then more shows.     Then I got to the last gallery, and it was Goldesberry. They were like,     Well, when you get the work, let us know. Bring some down. It   s  interesting.    They went on about their business, and I was like,    Oh, that  was exhausting. Let   s go have pie.    (Laughs)  I went to an opening that night for somebody that taught at the school,  and I saw them again. He said,    Well, where   s this work?    I   d had my  first show with Leslie Powell in Lawton at the Leslie Powell Gallery,  and it was actually a Native show. It was my MA body, and they says,     Well, when you get that back, let us know. We   d like to see it.    When I  got the show, they actually came to Nacogdoches. They drove two hours  up from Houston, and they took most of the work back. I had a show  right off, and I sold really well. I was with them pretty much all the way  through, until they closed their gallery. I started   is that like    98? No, it  was further back because that was when I moved to Houston. It was  early    90s, sometime in there. There was a little break where I stopped  showing between, in like 2000 to 2007, and then I started with them  again in 2009. That was my first, like,    Dun dun dun, you were at a  gallery.     Yeah, that   s great. I know that really helps sustain you     Yeah.     that relationship. So was that your first Native show, then, that you  had done in     Lawton.     that you were doing in Lawton?  Yeah.  How did that come about?  Leslie Powell, oh gosh, I don   t even remember. She contacted me, and  she was having as show. I can   t remember. It was like Native Ties,  13  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  something to do with Native artists. It was me, and I remember Gerald  Cournoyer because I was in graduate school. A couple other artists were  chosen to be in the show together. It was when she was still above the  little chapels. You had to carry your art up those steep stairs. She has  been a champion and such an awesome believer in my work from the  very beginning. Then I had a show at the military base, Fort Sill, at their  arts and crafts center. I had a show there, too, but none of them were  representation. That was the first time I   d ever had a show, like in a  gallery, represented by.  Right. How did you know how to price your work?  Kansas City was real specific. I have to say Ken Ferguson and Victor  Babu and George Timock were very about the business of art, which I  feel so many people didn   t get the business. To even graduate, you had  to have a sheet of slides, you had to have an artist statement, you had to  have a bio, and you had to have a r  sum  . With the sheet of slides, you  had to have the name of the piece, the material, the size, the medium,  and the price. They really talked to you about pricing and what work is  worth, and we went and saw galleries. We went to, like, Jun Kaneko   s.  Then when I was in my senior year, me and a friend flew to California  for the Advancement of Ceramic Sculpture Conference.  It was in its second or third year. That was at UC-Davis. The neat thing  about that is that it was before it had transferred. When we first went, we  heard Viola Frey speak and Stephen De Staebler and all these amazing  artists. It was seeing their work, and then seeing the pricing and the  galleries, and then comparing the age of how old you were as an artist,  and the material, and then valuing it that way. When I first started selling  with them, we talked about pricing, so there was the assistance of the  gallery, as well. Like I said, with Ken and them, we were talking pricing,  right off, in the gallery.  So you really got a good business base there.  Yes, yeah.  When did you move into lost-wax casting. Was it in graduate school?  Yeah. Graduate school I took jewelry casting instead of taking how to  cut it and solder it. That was the boring stuff. I was like,    I don   t want to  do that. I want to do the casting part.    So my lost-wax casting began in  jewelry. Then I went upstairs to my MFA and did it in the ceramic shell.  What I do now is actually reverted back to the jewelry method where I  use investment casting, so it   s still lost wax, but it   s using jewelry  casting investment instead of the ceramic shell.  14  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  What do you think your attraction   you sort of explained that there was  this very macho sort of attitude on the part of the big-sculpture people.  (Laughs) What else do you think draws you to working on a small scale?  Well, I love   it   s weird you say that because my work is starting to get  multiples. My love about the smallness began originally from   it   s the  size that fit in the kiln, the first kiln I had. A friend of mine gifted me  this tiny beehive kiln, which I still have. The kiln itself was only about  that big, and so the inside only fit a coffee can. My first pieces I was  making were only the size of a coffee can, but even before that, I was  making smaller pieces. They were a little bit bigger, though, but what I  liked about them is the intimate quality of them. You had to get up and  interact with them, and there was such an intimate conversation that you  had with the work.  At the same time, sometimes scale can be deceiving. If you make it, like  I   and it   s really weird I have this thing. I love big art, and I love little  art. Three-quarter size art? I   m good with life size, but three-quarter size  art is just,    Oh, there   s something wrong with that.    I need it, for me, to  be either life, really small, or really big. It   s always just kind of stuck  with me. What I   ve started doing is making multiples, so that, like, on a  wall, you   ll have two figures or three or four figures, and they   re still  small. I have one that   s in progress that   ll come out next year that   s  actually twenty-two foot long, but the figures are only this big. It   s the  same kind of idea of that intimate quality, and it   s something I can do  myself. I don   t have to founder it out.  And also each of your pieces is one of a kind.  Yes, huge thing. In clay you made a piece, and that was it. Each piece  has its own life. This is the part that I always   . You have to judge your  audience because some people are like,    What?    But I feel like each  thing I make has its own spirit, and I give it a life. It has its own story. I  don   t make editions. In fact, I don   t even have molds. I make my wax,  my bronze wax, just like I do my clay. I build it directly in wax, and then  I sprue that and cast it. If I lose it, it   s gone. I don   t go back and remake  it, and I don   t make more. I have molds that I   ve made from the pieces,  so I have these rough face molds, and I have rough hand molds.  Everything gets refined. I have the faces because I realized I wanted to  start doing a series with a certain look or sisters or twins. That   s a big  thing I   ve started on. I have that, but none of them are identical, and  none of the stories are ever identical.  You   ve noted that your sculpture sort of talks about the fragile nature of  life and the human body, and I wondered if you could expand on that a  15  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  little.  Well, so I have two phases of work. I have pre-kids and post-kids.  (Laughs) Pre-kids was all about actually dealing with my heritage in a  very direct way with elders, very much these kind of spirit figures. Then  I got married and moved to Chicago. I started working design and this  whole other, and my work stopped production. I just started working,  trying to work out who I am, where I am.    Well, since graduate school   s  over, what am I going to do now?    Then I had my son. It was really  interesting because right before my son, my work started to shift. I had  my son, and it changed everything in my work because my mom had  always told me stories about, you know, you don   t leave your toys out at  night because of the spirits, and what you did or didn   t do culturally  when you had children.  Listening to her is almost like the wind. It   s like,    That   s interesting,     but it didn   t make any sense. Then you have kids. I had my son. Sure,  I   m just like a Nervous Nelly and a helicopter mom, but it really  changed how I saw the world because I felt like I became not just the  guardian of him but, like, the guide, what I did or how I chose, and the  fragility of that relationship, and then the fragility of his own life. It  made me realize that that   s there all the time, but it   s just the blinders  because I was this single person. I never saw outside of myself. Now I  hear my mom   s words, and it makes sense. Some of the things may be  told as things that truly happened and why you watch for things, or  they   re just that cautionary tale to help guide you. That   s where the  work   it has to do with my culture and stories that were told, but it also  has to do with how I raise my children, and how I watch for them, and  how I see the world through their eyes sometimes, that kind of thing.  It seems like a lot of your figures are women, and I might be not seeing  the whole range.  No, most of them are women. Most of them are actually little girls. In  that even with my son, when I had him, I was still making little girls.  The only little boys I have in the work started from a geode piece. The  little girls kind of are my story of myself, as well as the story of my  daughter, and the story of woman, and the story of female. I was telling  someone something I was working on, and they were like,    You just  don   t really seem like an activist.    I   m like,    I think activists come in  many shapes and sizes and different voices.    For me, it   s about growing  up.  My mom grew up on the boarding school. Her mother was a cook, and  they lived above the kitchen. For my mom and dad and for my mom, in  particular, it was very much what you can do. You can do anything you  16  Little Thunder  Wilson  put your mind to. It was a really interesting thing watching. I tell people  now, I feel so bad because as a parent you want your kids to succeed,  and it   s hard to see the lessons not always lived up to or passed. Then  even thinking they said we could do anything we wanted, we could do it  all, and that   s not really the truth because in doing everything, something  suffers. It may not be suffering to the point that they wither and die, but  there   s always this give and take of what you can and can   t do. I  watched my mom try to accomplish all of that and then instill in me that  belief I could. I think the best gift was being able to step back and go,     No, I have to succeed at what I love only.     They always said,    Whatever you do, follow what you love, and you   ll  figure out how to make a living or a life out of it.    I wanted children, but  I also wanted to be an artist. I was doing design work, and somewhere  we had that conversation where it was like,    I can   t do it all. Something  has to stop.    That   s why we moved back to Oklahoma, not that it was  slower paced, but I could not, I was not going to make myself remove  from the job that made the money, willingly. It was a way for me to  break that cycle and then say,    Here   s what   s important.    The little girl  is me and so many, and my mother, and my mother   s mother, and my  daughter, those things.  I   m really struck by   it totally makes sense your interest in   because  they   re seasoned. They   re very seasoned faces, and they   re very  seasoned bodies. They   re not pretty, and they   re not necessarily  youthful. Do you see them as being of any particular ethnicity?  You know, it   s interesting. I don   t. In fact, I don   t even work from  pictures of people. Like when I   m talking to somebody, and my husband  gets mad at me sometimes, says,    Turn off the x-ray     I study faces. If  there   s something I just love about a face, an epicanthic fold, or a way a  nose turns, they   ll turn up in the work. This got me in trouble in  undergraduate. My work is very much a building of faces from an  inventory of life. When I first started making figures they were kind of a  brown color. Then I started doing black patinas. I   ve been asked,    Are  they brown? Are they Native? Are they African American?    I   m like,     They   re anything you want them to be because they   re not even real  people.     They don   t have ears, which most people have never picked up on. They  don   t have ears, and they don   t have belly buttons. They don   t have  genitalia, which I find really amazing. It   s on purpose because if you  have ears and genitalia and a belly button, you   re human. You   re born  into this world. Ears let you hear. The genitalia defines you as male or  female. In my figures, especially in the ones that don   t have any clothes  on, the only way I want you to know that it   s male or female is in their  17  Little Thunder  Wilson  body posturing. That   s the connection I want you to get is I want you to  feel that sense. I got that from watching my son and my daughter  because their movement in the world is so different from each other.  That   s why they   re not one thing or the other.  So you do explore tribal motifs. Sometimes they   re overt, but a lot of  times it seems like belief systems or values that just kind of get threaded  into the work.  Yeah. There are certain characters or specific stories like my birds,  especially. All my birds are shapeshifters. It   s funny because people are  like,    Shapeshifters are bad.    I   m like,    No, they   re not.    My mom told  me a story when I was growing up that her grandmother, which would  be my great-grandmother, was visited, when they lived on the farm, by a  midwife. She wanted her to come and train with her, and the father and  the sons were like,    No, no, no. She is staying here, and she   s cooking  and taking care of us. That   s her job.    There was no wife, or she   d died.  My great-grandmother wanted so desperately to go to school and to go  learn this. She would   ve traveled around and done all these things, and  they were like,    No, no, no.     The midwife leaves, and she comes back. She goes,    I   ve come again.  She needs to come and train. That way she can go and do.    They were  like,    No, no, no.    It was in the day where they had the fire in the front,  and the man was like,    Get off my property  No, no, no     She stepped  into the fire and rolled into all these shapes and turned into all these  animals, and then stood up and again said,    I would like to take Grammy  Num Num       is her name, which is really funny,       with me.    They  were like,    Go  Go  Go     She turned into an owl and flew away.  Then she comes again, and she asked one more time. They were like,     No, you need to go away.    They actually shot at her when she flew  away as an owl and wounded her. Well, in the months to come, each one  of them befell a horrible event. One of them ended up falling and  shooting part of himself, getting his gun trapped. Another one got a  thing on his face. Then when she came back, they were like,    Yes, yes.  Please stop whatever, and we   ll let her go.    They let her go and be  trained as a midwife, so then she was able to travel, you know, when  someone needed to deliver a baby. It was just the greed of the,    No,  you   re going to stay here, and you   re not going to be educated, and  you   re not going to be trained.     The shapeshifter, she was a    witch    or a shapeshifter. It wasn   t in a way  that I ever interpreted that story to be a horrible thing. Then also, birds  are the messengers from the spirits that come down. I see that they can  be tricksters, and I see how there can be bad things. I know that each  18  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  culture has a different interpretation, but I   ve always felt that it is what  you make of it, and what is it that the message is taking. In my birds, if  you look at them, they   re encaustic birds. They   re built in encaustic, all  of it. Then anything that really comes off, I cut and cast. The key is all of  the eyes are human eyes. They   re built with the epicanthic fold and the  eyebrow ridge and the human pupil.  Then all of them have human hands. You have to get real close because  at first they look like bird hands, but they   re holding the branch in their  human   s hands. For me, it   s that moment that you caught them shifting,  whether it   s shifting to a bird or shifting as a man or woman. It   s that  moment. Some of them, I feel, are hung because both worlds are  seductive. Which world do you live in? The world of man? The world of  spirit? I feel like shifters have this wonderful gift, but at the same time,  they have to leave. In all stories you read of shifters, the otter and all  these different animal stories, they   re saddened as much as they   re  happy to go to wherever it is they are because they   ve made loves and  attachments and it   s hard to make those shifts. That   s my birds (Laughs)  or almost any animal. If you see an animal, normally that animal, if it   s  not its spirit animal, it   s the idea that they   re a shifter with a message.  In your work?  In my work, yeah.  We talked about Santa Fe Indian Market briefly before we started the  interview here, but tell us about   you did your first Santa Fe Indian  Market last year.  Yeah.  What was that like?  Oh, it was amazing. I mean that   s the first time I   ve ever seen all that  many different Native people and their work together. It   s interesting  because I was an undergraduate, and my mother had asked me to show  my work in Lawton at an Indian show that was happening at the armory.  This is real pivotal in that it was in    88, and so she took my work and put  it on the table. It   s my old spirit figures and whatnot. She remembers the  guys going,    That   s one bad hombre. Those are some crazy looking  figures.    They liked the work. As we walked around and looked, it was  all these beautiful pieces of art, but the guy goes,    Well, let me show  you what I really do.    Then they would pull the art out from underneath  the table, and they would show you what they really made. It saddened  both my mom and I, and it made me think,    I don   t want to do that.     19  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  The problem twenty years ago, twenty-five years ago, is if you said you  were Native American and you made art, you were pigeonholed into this  very second-class society of what people expected Native artists to  make. I veered far away from anything that had to do with cultural  markets because of that experience. So Santa Fe, I was real hesitant  because my work has stories, and my work has a feeling, but my work is  not what people would think of as Native American art from just a  magazine cover. A friend of mine, Shan Goshorn, in the Urban Indian  Five, she went the year before, and she was like,    You really need to do  this.    This is different than what she thought it was going to be. She had  a wonderful experience, so I applied and got in. I did win a ribbon for a  sculpture, Second Place. It was awesome.  I was very tired, but it was neat because I got to see things that I  probably would never have seen in all of my life on my own. I applied  for this year. One of my goals when I go this year is to take the time to  walk the fair, which last year, as much as I wanted to, I didn   t take as  much time to look at what was there. What I did do, I went to the Heard  in March last year, and one of the things I did is I looked up all the  artists I could find online. I didn   t get to do that with Santa Fe just  because of timing. It was really nice, and the same thing is to try and  walk the fair just to meet some of the different artists, to see what is  being made and what   s out there.  It   s very energizing.  Yeah, it really is.  How important are commissions to your work?  (Laughs) I laugh hysterically. I am a terrible commission artist. The  reason is commissions are awesome, and I   m supposed to be thrilled to  get a commission. I should be so excited that people want to commission  my work, but I have a strange relationship with commissions. I am  thrilled, I am honored, but they stop my production so fast and so hard  because I start worrying about what people think of the work and what  they   re expecting.  I have a series called Paper Wings, and it   s this idea of, again, a shifter  where it   s a person half bird and half man. The masks aren   t   some  people refer to them as the plague mask. I   m like,    No, the plague mask  covered your whole face, and mine are actual masks.    You use them as  personas. Anything that   s got a mask is a persona. If I need the ability to  fly, you would wear the mask of the bird to be able to fly above a  situation, or the strength of the bear so you would have the strength to  protect yourself.  20  Little Thunder  Wilson  I made one, the first one, and had the show. Of course, it sold, and  people were like,    I want that.    I had two commissions. I says,    I will do  a commission,    and it   s the first time I   ve ever had the commission, and  I says,    but the presumption of it is that they will never look the same.     They will have a mask, they will have wings, they will be on this thing,  but the figure itself has to be distinctly different because I think each one  has to have its own life. That   s the only way I   ve managed to do  commissions. But I try and go,    No, let   s not do that, no.    I think if it  was something like taking a small piece and making it larger or doing   I  think they would be a lot more attractive to me. I   d rather just have the  freedom to create whatever is needed for my soul, I guess, is the best  way to put it. I   m a very bad commission artist. (Laughter)  What   s been one of the best or worst comments you   ve gotten in  response to your work?  Oh, wow. The worst is when they look at it and they go,    Now that   s  interesting,    or,    Isn   t that kind of funny,    which I find odd. I know that  shouldn   t be bad, but it   s in a snarky kind of way. It   s like,    You didn   t  get it, but that   s okay,    because there   s enough art for everybody. I just  kind of step back because, like you said, the figures, though they are  modeled off of a child   s frame, they   re not children. They   re this idea  that they   re old spirits, and that   s why the faces and the bodies are very  different.  I think the best compliment would be when somebody can actually tell  the story or they feel the emotion of it. I   ve had people actually tear up  on a couple of the pieces because I   ve started   I never told the stories  because every piece is built from a story. No piece is ever made without  a story happening first or it being in tandem with a story. I   ve always  kept the stories to myself, and so now I   ve started kind of letting some of  the stories out. I think my favorite thing is when people see the piece,  and they go,    I completely understand that emotion.    What I   m trying to  do is just like in my photography. I want my sculptures to capture that  moment of an emotion, that moment of an excitement, a sadness, a  choice.  I have a piece where the little girl   s head is down, and she   s against the  wall, and her arms are kind of draped. It   s on this beautiful half circle,  and it   s called Should I Stay or Should I Go? The piece was actually  originally built when my mom was in a coma, dying. I felt like her spirit  was trapped. She could heal, but to heal she would be trapped in a shell.  So it   s your body saying,    Do I stay? Do I go?    You don   t want to put  that on a wall in a gallery, but it also lays into the idea of anything in  life, you have a choice. It   s a bad situation. Do you stay? Do you go? Do  you cut and run? What do you lose? What do you gain? Though they are  21  Little Thunder  Wilson  very personal to me, I think they have a very universal meaning for most  people in society.  There   s some wonderful nuanced emotions in your work, just from the  Web. Let   s talk a little bit more about your process and techniques. You  do mixed media sculptures that combine   you   re sort of working with  combinations of materials, even with your bronzes.  Yeah, I am not a purist. I only went to bronze (and this probably makes  most bronze people cringe) because of what its material can do. I  originally   all my sculptures were seated unless they were really large. I  wanted the sculptures to stand, and my biggest thing was on their tippy  toe. I just wanted that tiny toe connecting them to whatever it is. I use  materials based on what the materials represent, so Paper Wings  originally was built from a table leg. These table legs at the Indian  school, they cut them, (my mom and dad got them when the school  closed) and they cut the table legs down to make coffee tables. They had  all these little eight table legs, little pieces. They had the old brass caps,  and you could see where they had been worn and the life had been in  them, gorgeous oak.  She gave them   she goes,    I know you have some purpose for this.    I  said,    I do. I don   t know what.    I carried them around for years. It drives  my husband crazy because he has to move all my junk. (Laughs) Then I  took this table leg, and I just really loved the idea of the negative space  of this leg. Here   s this leg, this table. You know it   s a table or a chair  coming out of the nothingness, and here   s this figure. It   s kind of like  when you   re, certain times of the day or night, and you feel these things  from the side of your eyes, or this other sense. It   s that idea of here   s this  negativeness, and here this thing that doesn   t belong that   s in this other  place. That   s where those things began.  I have a series of little girls with dresses, and there are two of them. One  of them is on a branch, reaching, and as she   s hanging off the side of this  branch, looking around, there   s a bird sitting on the edge of the branch,  watching her. It   s one of the birds, the human birds. It   s almost like it   s  looking and going,    You got yourself into a mess, didn   t you, little  thing?    There   s no conversation, but the look on the bird   s face. The  bird   s made of sterling silver. It   s interesting because I call them birds of  burden. Birds, anything that   s precious has a value attached to it. The  value is that you have to care for it because if you didn   t care for it, it  wouldn   t be a burden to you and it wouldn   t be precious.  Things you love in life, though you love them (and some people don   t  get this) you still   . Like I have two gorgeous children who I love  dearly, but I also have to know where their woobies are, and what is  22  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  their favorite teddy bear, and what is the song they have to sing, and  where   s this shoe, and where   s this toy. You have to have your hand on  so many things, so they became birds of burden. The silver birds are  made of sterling silver because it   s a precious metal. I have another one  that I love that I probably should   ve   it   s a little girl, and it   s called  With Her Burdens, specifically. She has seven birds. They   re tucked in  her arms, and they   re rubbing her cheeks. It   s that idea that she   s having  to care for all these burdens. She loves them, but at the end of the day  they can drive you nuts  (Laughter)  You mentioned you work often from photographs, so does that take the  place of any sketching before you pick up     No, they kind of go in tandem. Sometimes I   ll just have an idea, a flash.  I   ll see something in life, and I   ll do these really cryptic sketches  because I   ve never considered myself a very good drawer. In art school,  and even in high school, I could make things, but I just   my dad could  draw, my sister could draw, and their paintings, and I thought,    Aw, I   ll  never do that.    I can, which is really kind of funny, but I never  considered it my forte. I use photos when I   m actually out somewhere  and I see that exact moment, and I can just capture, capture, capture.  Then I   ll bring them home, and then sometimes the two become one.  Really there   s no one or the other. Sometimes I   ll sit down and just  innately start working and see what comes of that and let the  subconscious take over in those moments.  What about titles for your pieces? Are they     Oh, they   re huge. Yeah, nothing is ever untitled. The titles are the tiny  tidbit to let you know, or the story. I have a series of figures that are  falling off the walls. I love how the swimmers would hang on the wall,  and then they just, there   s that moment where they release and they   re  in. That   s where I first started doing the research, looking online for  swimmers. It was because I felt like in my life where I was at, I had to  decide if I was in or out with what I was doing. I feel like there becomes  that moment where you have to release what you   re doing and fall in. I  think I lost the train of thought on that. I know it had to do with falling  figures. What was the initial   .  Well, we were talking about titles, but...  Oh, yeah      you   re interested in those moments of     Threshold, one of the pieces was called Threshold. Sorry, I knew there  23  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  was some way to get back there. Another one was called Blind Faith  because the titles represent that meaning of these figures and what  they   re doing. Some people go,    Oh, they   re running up the wall.    It   s  like,    If that   s what you want it to do, that   s fine,    but it   s that idea  where the title has to give you that. For me, it gives you the rest of that  story. Visually, you see it, and you get that. It   s like the Should I Stay or  Should I Go? That sums it up. I love hearing that at shows.    That totally  makes sense. I get that.    To me, the title and the piece is hand-in-hand.  Sometimes I can   t finish the piece until I know either A) the base, the  material, or the title. They all have to come together in a moment to  make them all work.  Would you need to know what you   re going to do for the base, you   re  saying?  Yes. I had a piece that I refer to as Mother, and I worked on her for eight  years. She   s at Bonner David  Galleries  right now. It was really funny. I  began her in Chicago, and it was just a simple study of a woman. She  was just beautiful. I took her home, and I had these gorgeous little boat  forms, and I sat her on there just to get her out of the way. Then I was  trying to finish her, and I kept trying to figure out what to put her on. I   d  take her off the boat, and I   d move her around. I put her back on the  boat, and I realized that was her base. It   s weird. Until I understand the  whole story of the piece   . I   ll rush things sometimes because I   m like,     Ah     and I regret because it doesn   t make sense. It   s really funny  because they normally don   t sell. Then I   ll finish what they were doing,  and then the piece all comes together and makes sense.  Okay, so we   ve talked a little bit about kinds of research that you do for  your sculpture, and part of it, it sounds just like it involves being around  your children.  Yeah, and then part of it, also, is I   ve started for some of the work I   m  doing now. I have a piece I   m working called Bloodline. My political  activism is very,    Shhhh, quiet.    I   m working on a piece called  Bloodline, and it   s tracing my heritage all the way through my family.  Before my mom died (actually it happened when my dad died) I realized  that if my mom were to pass, she   s the last one who has all our stories.  She   s the last one that has all our history. You know, young people,  you   re busy living life, and you don   t slow down. We started going  through all the records she had and who the people were. It   s really  interesting because it   s different history. It   s like this is the one that got  chased out of Missouri because they were horse thieves, this family. The  history is really, it   s littered with these beautiful stories about the people,  as well.  24  The piece is about twenty-two foot long. It   s this locust tree that fell  down by the kids    school. I was just,    Oh, this wood is beautiful,     because the heart of it has this beautiful pink flush to it, and then it has  this golden color. I, of course, lugged all these pieces of wood home. My  husband loves me. For mother   s day I bought myself a chainsaw,  (Laughs) which I thought was perfect because he got a grill. I cut the  wood horizontally down the middle of the tree. It actually will mount on  the wall, and you can see the life of the tree through the lines but on a  vertical, going up. It   s an exhibit that happens in 2015 in Oklahoma  Contemporary, and I   m super excited. All across the top, each section is  cut. On top is these cigar figures, and the cigar figures are, again, my  reinterpretation of an Osage story about the Stick People.  The Stick People would run along the side of your car. This is how old  the car story is because they said,    your running boards.    They would  call your name. Or they   d be in the woods and they   d call your name,  and they   d summon you. If you went, you would vanish, and you   d die. I  always wondered what they looked like, but of course nobody   s going to  tell you because they would   ve been dead. But the idea of these stick  figures   . So in graduate school (I   ll circle around, I promise) I started  dating a guy who was smoking cigars. He would put the cigars out, and I  thought they were these gorgeous little dresses. They just looked  feminine, which I thought was amusing that a man is smoking  something that has a dress on the end. Then I started playing with sticks,  and I thought,    If I were a Stick Person, I would have a cigar-shaped  body,    this tobacco, this idea.  I took the stick figures, and I reinterpreted it to be cigar figures. There   s  the tobacco for the cigar, going back to the idea of our culture and what  tobacco represents for different people. Then the sticks from nature,  actual cast sticks, and the top of the heads are actually flat silhouettes.  From one side, there   s absolutely nothing. They   re just the shadow of  the figure. The other is this relief of the figure. On top of this twenty-two-  foot tree, each section is a generation. The research I did with my  mom helped me find   originally it was just me and my siblings, and  now it   s my children. Then it   s me and my siblings, and then it   s my  mother. Then it   s my father, and then it weaves between the two.  Anybody I have an image of, I   m working historically from the image  for their detail, and also their height and placement.  There are these walking cigar figures across the top, and the act of the  way the light hits them, they cast a shadow on the wall. The shadow is  the memory because memory is intangible. The picture is not the  memory; it   s the emotion you carry. The piece has the life of the tree, it  has the life of my family, my blood, and then it has the memory of my  people cast in shadow. As they go farther back in time and there   s no  25  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  imagery, they become less detailed, but they don   t become less  important. Then the other thing I found interesting is there was a  reference to children of the mist, children who died. I know this is also  in Scotland, and my heritage is got Scottish, both Campbell and  MacEwen, mixed in with the Delaware and the Cherokee. I   m  wondering how much of that is a crossover. Children of the mist are  children who died at birth or right thereafter.  So all the way through this history my mom kept reading, and the  writings that people wrote about their children is even if the child died  before birth, they referred to it as    the boy.       We lost a son.    The family  still had five kids, even though only three lived. I found that very  intriguing all the way through the history, so any of the pieces that the  children didn   t live, their head piece is dipped in wax. It   s all like they   re  behind a mist or a shawl. Then their head is pointed down, but they   re  still counted. They represent things that matter still. That   s kind of where  I do the history. Then, just reading the different stories, I love the stories  that are like the written mythology stories.  I have a series I   m starting that I put in for next year. Got my fingers  crossed. It   s also going to happen at this same show. It   s called Native  American Superheroes because I feel like there   s this stereotype of what  Native Americans are. I want to take stories like, say,    The Three  Sisters    and tell a story about the Three Sisters in a contemporary setting  in how we are today. They become superheroes. That   s the awesome  part. There are going to be three women that are created to look like  beans, squash, and corn, but what they   re fighting is sugar because sugar  is a killer for all society. It was all about the mix of the three, and how  they grew, and what their powers were to fight something like sugar.  Then I   ll make a sugar crystal monster, so here will be these  superheroes. That   s how I work with mythology or I tell my story, is not  through just telling old stories, but how do I take a story and then  interpret it in a way that it has meaning and power for me. That   s my  take.  These sound like wonderful pieces. So this exhibit you mentioned, the  Oklahoma Art Museum?  It   s Oklahoma Contemporary which used to be City Arts.  Oklahoma Contemporary which is in Oklahoma City.  Yeah, it   s Fairgrounds, and it   ll be probably one of the last shows  because they   re building a new building. I originally had presented this  idea of this exhibit to Joy Reed Belt at JRB  Art at the Elms . She was  like,    I think it   s just too big for my space.    She got me in touch with  26  Julie Maguire, and I got to present my whole concept, which I   m excited  because it   s actually five components. The sticks, the trees, one. The  superheroes, one. Another one is falling figures. It   s a whole bunch of  falling figures, so it   ll end up taking a span of like twenty feet. They   re  all still tiny figures, and it   s under the influence of gravity. It   s really  talking to the idea of people say,    Well, I didn   t have any option. I was  drunk or I was   . It was culturally what I had to do.    It   s that idea of  making choices.  Then there is my first step back into life-sized clay figures. I   m really  excited, and this is something that started with my mom and my dad, just  kind of reconnecting with them. They gave me buck skin and porcupine  quills, and I have a bear skin that my dad and them hunted. It   s funny  because the dog got it, so instead of it being a big bear, it   s a whole  bunch of little bear pieces. One of the things I   m doing is I   m making  Native American masks, my interpretation of animal masks that are  personas. Each of the seven figures representing the Seven Directions,  and at the same time the seven tribes of the Cherokee, will have a mask  that represents a persona of strength. They   ll be like the porcupine.  There   s going to be a deer skin. There   ll be a fox. There   ll be a bear. The  bear, though the mask is a bear   s face, you   re going to see the  herringbone stitching. You   ll see the scars on the face and how it was  healed, and that idea of the fragility of even a bear. The figures are all  done in white porcelain, and they   ll have glass eyes, and so it works.  My mom always talked about animals and that idea that white is the  spirituality and the specialness in that spirit. For the exhibit, the children  represent portals between the two worlds. When you look at the eyes,  you see through the eyes, the window to the soul, and you see the portal  between the two worlds. They   re in real masks made from real materials,  and then they   re going to be positioned through the room and then all  around the room. In October in Oklahoma, you get the birds and the  grackles and the starlings. They   re an invasive bird. They came from  Europe. They   ll take over a nest, and they   ll plant their eggs and kill the  babies that are native. It   s kind of my political stance for how, as much  as I am happy for who I am, it was a violent way that it came. Then the  birds are swarming in a tornado form around the seven figures, and then  the masks will come off.  I   m photographing my children in them, and that   s another series. It   s  called Native in America. It   s the misperception of what Native children  have the ability to do. They go to the mall. They go to movies. They  read books. They go to libraries. They   re in public schools. Each one of  them will wear a mask. They jump on trampolines. They swim in pools.  Then I   ll do large-format photographs in heightened color of them in the  masks, interacting in daily life. Then the whole thing, the educational  27  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  component, I   m really excited. It came from a birthday party I did for  my son. We   re going to have students come, and we   re going to tell  them stories from history and then ask them questions about it. They  have to come up with a story using something that has a spirit figure,  like, what   s an animal of power for you, and what would you be if you  could be something.  Then I want them to write a story in today   s time so it makes sense to  them in today. Then we   ll put them in a book. Then we   re going to make  the mask, and they   ll be photographed. I always loved the old  photographs where they   re, like, on a burlap. They   ll be their self before  and then their spirit self in the mask We   ll photograph them, and then  that   ll be put in a book. They get to learn about the history, create a  history, create a mask, and then make a book, and then take that story  with them. That   s the show. Don   t tell anybody. (Laughs)  Wow, that is a major undertaking. Is that one of the biggest solo shows  that you would   ve     Ever.     ever had?  Yeah, with the five components. My goal is to try, once I have more  work done, is to start soliciting for a museum show. It has such, I think,  a touch on,    Here   s today   s contemporary,    yet at the same time, you   re  interlaced with the stories. You   re torn because I can   t change what  happened, I can   t be happy about it, but I am who I am. Can we take the  history we   ve learned and then change how we deal with our society? I  think that is my role as a Native artist or as an artist as a whole, is how  can I bring attention to things that are wrong and find a way to address it  to where we can make a change?  I   ve been working on this show, probably, doing sketches and research  and idea working since before my dad passed in 2009. I think my first  write up of it was, like, in 2006. We moved here in 2005, and there was  that feeling. It started with that picture I took of my son, one of these  feelings of, you know, when the birds are going, and really wanting to  make these life-size figures and have you have that feeling. The life-size  figures are actually children. They   re not really big people. Then in the  space, you   ll be able to walk in around the feeling, all those birds. That  was one of the reasons we got a bigger space is I just didn   t have  anywhere to work congruently in wax and clay and stuff. It will be the  biggest thing I   ve done, and I   m pretty excited. That is set to open May  5 of 2015. I have just over a year to work on that, and it   ll run through  all of August or to the end of August.  28  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  I hope it gets to travel. It definitely needs to.  Thank you.  So what is you   re creative routine? You sort of talked about creative  process here throughout, but what   s your routine? Do you work in the  day? Do you work at night?  Well, it   s funny because I used to be the night owl. When I had the kids  and they weren   t in school, it was mom is mom. I was a human chair and  whatever we needed to do. I   d do little things, and they   d do them with  me. I have all these amazing photographs of them in the studio, making  things with me. Like my son cast his first bronze at five, and my  daughter has some we just haven   t cast in wax. He used to sit across the  table from me, and he   d build Play-Doh figures while I built wax  figures, so that was that. It was real staccato. Then I   d get them to bed,  and I would stay up until two or three, working, and then get up the next  day and go.  Now that they   re in school, my routine is I try and get up at five and do  computery junk. My husband   ll go,    No, its five thirty,    and I   m like,     I   m working on five     Then I get the kids up and get them to school,  and depending on the weather, I either go run, (I   ve started running,  trying to find that healthy place in my life) run and walk. Actually, it   s a  wounded gazelle run, walk. Wounded gazelle run, walk. (Laughter) I  come back, and I work until two thirty, and then I go pick them up. Then  it   s just mom time with them. When my husband comes home, it   s catch  up.    How are you doing?    Then I shift back out, depending on  deadlines. I   ll do stuff, and then I shift back in for dinner. Then kids go  to bed, and depending on deadlines, I   ll shift back out.  Before, I was in the house. It was easy to kind of step into the room, but  I felt like I was always being seduced back out. Even though I worked  time, I   d do laundry or something stupid, not that laundry is stupid. It   s  so nice being separate because I even caught myself when I came home  from the studio, my husband was like,    What? How long was that  commute? Oh, two minutes across the yard     I really felt that division,  which is awesome. I don   t try and do anything. I don   t go shopping or  any   not like I like stores, unless it has hardware. I don   t blow the day. I  use it just for the studio, and the new space is nice because I now have  stations. I can start investing, or I could run an encaustic. I could do a  painting. I can work on this. Things can be happening at the same time.  As you get congested one place, you just pick up somewhere else, and so  your flow continues to roll.  29  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Looking back on your career, which has many more years to go, what  was one fork-in-the-road moment when you might   ve gone one way but  you went another?  When we moved from Chicago. Initially, because I hadn   t started  showing again, the debate was my husband goes and stays home, and I  stay because I was successful. I was a lead designer and art director at a  real estate company. We did the Donald Trump tower and ran photo  shoots, and there was big fancy meetings and good money. It was either  I stay home with the kid   because I was still working full time, but I  was doing it from home. I   d go in one day a week. I had my son, and it  was just like I was working sixty-hour weeks, and I wasn   t sleeping, and  it was like we had to give. The discussion was if we move to Oklahoma  then we could be   I was very pressured to try and get back my family  for myself, and a connection back to my community, which I   m really  glad because I then lost my parents shortly thereafter.  I wanted my kids to know their grandparents, and I wanted them to  know their cousins. I wanted to not worry about gunfire (Laughs) in our  neighborhood, and I didn   t want to pay sixty thousand dollars for them  to go to a decent education. That was the fork that at first we were like,     What do we do? Wait a minute.    Now we   re like,    It was the right  decision,    because the connection back to my family, back to my roots,  and just to focusing on making art. He   s made me promise I will never  work in corporate America again. In fact, I have been banned from any  regular job-job, ever. That   s nice because you don   t normally get that,  that support. He goes,    You   re not nice when you   re not making art.     (Laughter)  What has been one of the high points?  The high points. Seeing my kids work with me. That   s honestly     I mean, there   s winning awards, there   s selling art, there   s getting a  gallery, but I think my favorite   I love this, and this is really my  favorite thing. We   ve had shows. I love them out in the studio, but I love  when we go out. We have a show, and they go,    That   s me     It is,  because I will make a piece, but then I   m not   it doesn   t have to be  exactly right. I had some lady go,    Well, that clavicle   s not right.    I   m  like,    She doesn   t even have freakin    ears. Of course, the clavicle   s not  right.    I try and get close. Sometimes I   ll have the kids positioned. I   ll  go,    Stand like this.    I have all these crazy photographs of them doing  this, and they   re like,    Are you done yet, Mom?    Then I   ll take a 360   degree  photo because I love the way they   re   my son is thin. My son,  thank God, does not have my metabolism. He has my husband   s.  They   re both like this big, and you can see their collar bones.  30  Little Thunder  Wilson  He goes,    Look what I can do.    He can bend over and show you every  vertebra on his back, every rib. The kid eats and eats and eats, but he   s  just, he   s a butterfly or a hummingbird. I think a hummingbird would be  better. It   s wonderful to get all those angles. My daughter   s still thin, but  she has a little more curve. It   s wonderful to photograph the two of  them. They come out, and they love to sit and make things. I won   t make  it for them. They have a box of wax pieces, and they build what they  want to build. My son is finally getting to where I   ll let him touch the  hot iron to things to seal it, but with the wax being so hot   . They love  to come out here and make things.  It   s a wonderful experience because I feel like my dad did that with me  when I was three. I drew while he drew. It   s a connection. It   s amazing.  I have photographs of them. My favorite image   we were talking about  things that we remember, and my favorite thing is   she didn   t talk until  she was three. We had to go and start speech therapy. It was interesting  because she would take her shirt and put it over head like it was cuffs.  She had this long, banshee hair. She   d be in her cowboy boots and a pair  of shorts. She   d get my big sketchbooks, and she   d throw them down.  She   d sit squatting on one side, and then she   d frantically draw on the  other. She is amazingly talented. I   m not teaching her anything. It   s just  being in the environment. If she wants to know something, or he wants  to know something, I   ll explain it, but I   ve never drawn it for them or  erased it. I want them to create whatever they create because I feel like I  was always afraid of things, and I don   t want them to be afraid of. Just  go with your gut; see where it takes you. I think that   s the best reward.  How about one of the low points?  The lowest point, actually it   s not been the work, making the work. It   s  been sometimes the reaction to the work like the sale or no sale. It   s  funny about the Heard and Santa Fe, because the response was I  should   ve sold my booth seven times over. I mean, the response was  amazing. People were in awe of the work and not in like,    Yeah, I   m so  good.    I think my work is so different that people have a hard time  knowing what to do with it, is the best way. I also wonder sometimes if  it is such an honest look that some people don   t want to look at the  mirror because it   s not always happy, fun.    It   s not cupcakes,    as my  husband says. He goes,    You don   t make cupcakes. You make beef  stew, and not everybody can handle beef stew, hearty stew with potatoes  and stuff.     Last year was really upsetting because I didn   t know what was  happening for my work. I wasn   t going to change it. That   s the beauty is  we make just enough to not go on vacation, but just enough that I don   t  have to go get a corporate America job. I sell enough to cover my costs,  31  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  but it was really kind of   I was shocked. I didn   t know what was going  on. The response was, I have people who were just in love with the  work, but it wasn   t selling like you would think being in love with the  work would sell. Luckily, at the end of the year I realized I   m laying  seeds. That   s what I   m doing. I   m going to continue to work. The  response is what I need, but the sell is not what makes it. I touched all  these people   s lives, and they understood what I was doing. At first, you  get so caught up because you   re worried.    I got to buy more metal. I got  to buy more investment. How are we going to do this?    But it was just  that connection. My low point was just not quite getting it, if that makes  any sense there.  Totally. We   re getting ready to take a look at your work. Is there  anything we   ve forgotten to cover?  I don   t think so. I   m sure I   m crazy as a bedbug, but that   s about it.  (Laughs).  Well, we   re going to pause a minute and talk about some of your pieces.  Okay, we   re looking at one of your sculptures on a stand here, on a  base. You want to tell us about her?  Her name is How About No? It   s kind of derived from two points. One is  watching my daughter. You can kind of see how the hands are in the  back, and how little kids   ll kind of put their feet in the ground and stick  their chest out and say no. The other reason is it   s built on an idea about  me saying no because I said yes, yes, yes. I   ll say yes until I don   t sleep  at night and behind on my schedule to appease other people. My  husband was,    How about you start saying no?    This is kind of that  marriage. Also a great example of that working between seeing myself  in my children and trying to change some of the habits I have and  showing them how to change their habits. She   s bronze. My  construction   s really simple. I try and find the easiest way to put things  together. The whole thing is bronze, and this is textured from a wood  and then built, so it   s actually all created.  This is the silly part, but it   s the happiest part. They all have ruffled  panties. (Laughter) My great-grandmother used to go to town, and she   d  always go,    Oh, wait. I have to go get my good pelaches.    Pelaches is     underwear    in, I think, Cherokee. I always think of her when I make  sure everybody has their good town underwear on, their pelaches.  (Laughs)  That   s so funny. Great. Okay, would you like to tell us about these  pieces?  32  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  Little Thunder  Wilson  This is a series of figures that are what I refer to as my cigar figures. If  you look at them, this body is made from a cigar. I make a mold of them,  and then I pour wax. The legs are actual sticks. This shows you the face  where it has the detail, and the side is his silhouette. It comes from the  story. Here   s one where you see the tiny little delicate feet, and then they  go into a base. You can see how they   ll have toenails and knuckles and  ankle bones. It   s the idea of how far a person has walked, the distance  they   ve carried. All of the sticks are made from real sticks that are cast,  and that is part of the cigar which goes into the bloodline piece that I had  spoken about previously.  Wonderful. Okay, how about this piece?  This is Threshold. She is from the series about the fallen figures, and the  difference is this one actually has a dress. Most of the fallen figures  are   not that they   re androgynous, but they have no clothing on. This  one I wanted that feeling of that female form and the dress. It   s that idea  where you have to release to go to the next level. Sometimes it   s scary,  and so Threshold is that. I love to look words up and find their meanings  and all the different things they represent.    Threshold    is described as  the place between two places, so it   s not anything specific. With her, you  see where she has let go of the wall, and her face isn   t scared. It   s more  accepting of,    This is what I   ve decided to do.    In my life I feel like I  have many times where I   ve had to let go the reins of control and fall  into what it is. It   s a controlled fall in that you know you   re choosing it,  but it   s still a very scary moment when you know that you can   t control  how you might land. So that   s what they represent.  Do you mind showing us how it hangs because it   s got     Yes. This is biggest hitch at the moment. Any wall, sheetrock or wood,  it   s just a part of the pin, and of course she has nice pelaches, too.  (Laughter) Then the pin goes in, and it works on the pivot of the weight.  The weight of the body, which is about two pounds, actually holds it in  place in the wall, so it   s completely free standing. What I love is when  you get the shadows on it. You get the negative space around her so it  has that, but then you get the shadows around it.  They   re a big part of the total look. Well, thank you so much for your  time today.  Thank you. I   m honored that you chose me and came out. That   s pretty  exciting.  -------  -------
