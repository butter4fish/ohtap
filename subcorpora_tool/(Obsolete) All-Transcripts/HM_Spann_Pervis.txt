Story_ID: 13327
Speaker 1: I was born in the city part of Itta Bena [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Now, you know, 'cause that's the same place that [former Washington D.C. mayor] Marion Barry's from.  There's several--Just that little town has--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Has turned out quite a few people.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Jerry Rice played football there.  Went to college there [Mississippi Valley State College, Itta Bena, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Hmm.  So what are--Can you speak of your--some of your earliest--or your earliest memories?
Speaker 1: Of what?
Speaker 2: Growing up.
Speaker 1: Oh.  I started--Well I don't remember when I didn't work.  So I can truthfully say that maybe I've worked all my life.  Because I didn't know anything, but just to work.  My daddy [John Henry Spann] left home when I was just, I guess, five or six years old and moved away for economical reasons.  He moved to Gary, Indiana to work in a steel mill.  So I stayed there with my mother.  And so when time come to pick cotton, we started picking cotton.  And, you know, to me I just grew up there.  It was just a way to grow up.  I didn't know anything about what they did with the cotton.  Except they weighed it up and took it away.  I didn't know.  I don't know who was getting paid for me picking the cotton.  I just picked cotton.  I guess when I got around ten or twelve years old when they gave me my own sack, I could go and pick cotton.  Anyway, I learned how to be a great cotton picker, a great field worker.  And didn't mind doing it.  Because it was just the way of life as far as I was concerned.  It was the--something that they said, "Do." I did.  And so I think my mother took the monies that I was making from picking cotton and bought my clothes, and bought food and stuff of this nature.  And that integrated into what my daddy was doing from the steel mill.  We did--We got along alright, as far as I know.  We got along alright.  Just another job.  Any job that they gave me to do was another job.  Mom [Augusta Banks Spann] said, "Go plant a garden." I plant the garden.  She said, "Go and dig the peanuts." I dig the peanuts or whatever it was, I did them.  And one thing about my mama, you didn't talk back to her.  she said, "Do," you did.  She might tell you when to stop, but you better get to doing .  So this went on until I guess the time when I begin to reach out for other little jobs.  You know, because I was always good at working because I was doing--had been doing it all my life.  And there was a theater up town, in the little town.  They had a theater where black folks went upstairs; white folks was downstairs.  But the folks that owned theater eventually opened up a  new--another theater down the street.  And it was called the Dixie Theater.  So they had a black theater and a white theater.  And the black theater, since it was newer than the white theater, looked better.  And when I got fifteen years old, the lady that owned the theater, since I had been working there for her--And truthfully and this--honest to God, I didn't know nothing about stealing anything.  You know, if I found a dollar on me from somewhere, I didn't know where it come from, I'd give it to her.  And say, "It gotta be yours  'cause I--I had no other place to make none lately."  So I had that kind of mentality.  So I think for the little things that I did for her, I gained her confidence.  And she thought anything was to happen around there, they would know about it.  'Cause this guy here, this guy going--he's going to school.  He's working a day job.  He works for me at night. And throughout the course of time, she put me in charge of the theater.  She says, "Okay, you manage the theater.  You in charge.  You manage it."  "Manage it!  I'm the popcorn boy.  I don't know--I'm the popcorn--I'm the floor sweeper.  I'm anything it take to keep the building clean."  But I didn't have to go to the field too much more to pick cotton 'cause I was working in the theater.  And they had what they called a country radio, which--was a sound truck.  You put the speakers on top of the sound truck and you drive round through the country.  And everybody you see out in the field working or wherever you see them, and you let them know what's playing tonight in the theater.  And they would more or less get in the--their car or whatever means they had for transportation and come to the theater.  And to me, that was my little world right then.  I didn't know no world.  I didn't have no girlfriends.  I didn't have no hang out buddies.  I hung out on somebody's job.  And that's how I always had money.  I got to the point where I was working.  I'd just go to the field and pick cotton for three days.  And you would get--During that time I was getting three dollars a hundred.  Now sometimes I'd pick five hundred pounds of cotton in one day.  So I got more money than I know what to do with it.  So I start putting it in the bank.  I put the money in the bank, and then I'd get paid at the theater. I'd put that in the bank.  I had no girlfriend and had nothing to do with it.  So one day after I worked and got a lump sum of money, a guy sold me a '37 [1937] Cadillac.  And I was the only guy that owned a Cadillac--only guy that owned a Cadillac, except one guy--one white man owned a new Cadillac.  But I had a '37 [1937] Cadillac.  And it, you know, it gave me instant credibility with all my friends.  Everybody want a ride.  I didn't have no license no way .  But driving that car back and forth from Greenwood [Mississippi] to Itta Bena, nothing to do around. Because see, there comes a time between chopping cotton and picking cotton.  You call it--they call it, "You lay the crop by."  The crop just stay out in the field and grow.  Well I didn't chop much any longer because I was working for the theater.  So I'd wait 'til the times to pick cotton.  Then I'd pick cotton.  Because I was given--let's say if I go to field, I'd pick 300 pounds.  That's three times three.  If I pick 500 pounds, I had a bonanza of a day.  Nothing to do.  Pop cost a nickel.  You know, I never had a drink in my life.  Even until this day, I never had a drink.  Never smoked a cigarette in my life.  Even until this day, I never smoked.  Need--I guess I need not say that I never dealt with any drugs of any kind, any kind.  If the first--only time that I ever had dealing with a cigarette, I took some dry leaves off a fig tree and rolled them up, and put them in a piece of paper and tried to smoke them.  And I thought that was the nastiest stuff that ever, ever existed in the world.  And that was the end of my smoking.
Story_ID: 13328
Speaker 1: You described growing up, but what was family like?  And what were you--Were you really the baby in many ways--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--family life growing up was whatever Mama [Augusta Banks Spann] said it was gonna be.  Mama said, "You go to field, you pick cotton," you go to field, you pick cotton.  So Mama didn't tell you what to do, you got up and found out what you're gonna do that day.  Now after I got to the rightful old age of fourteen and fifteen, especially on those summer days whereby you set a cotton--The work in the field had been--The crop had already been laid by. meaning you don't have to do no more work in the field.  So you come--I come to the theater and I sit around and get the popcorn all ready for the night.  This something to do--something--some work to do.  Didn't keep no hours because we did--we--from the time that you went in there, you just worked until the show or 'til you went out in the field.  And went out in the sound truck and talked to the people and tell them who's playing.  For an example.  Do I have time for an example?  Okay.  For example, the first live show that we ever--that I ever saw there was a cowboy named Tex Ritter.  Yeah.  A lot of the older folks would know about Tex.  And he came to town for a personal appearance.  So we had to go out in the country in the sound truck and say, "Tonight live at the Dixie Theater in Itta Bena [Mississippi] , see Tex Ritter live!  First time ever in Itta Bena.  Tex Ritter Live!"  So that night it was people all standing on the outside, every--So my first appearance on stage when the MC [master of ceremonies] came in says, "And right now, ladies and gentlemen, that cowboy, Tex Ritter!"  And he pushed me out on the stage.  Tex Ritter pushed me out on the stage (laughs).  Then, he came on out, and had a little joke.  So that was my first appearance in show business.  I was pushed on stage by Tex Ritter.  And what did I say?  Nothing.  I know nothing to say.  I was just there.  But it worked out.
Story_ID: 13329
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you?  And did you--Were you an introspective person?  You know, you appeared to be--to have been a quiet person.  Sound  right?
Speaker 2: Yes, very quiet.
Speaker 1: But I'm just wondering what kind of person?  And what was also going on up inside your head?
Speaker 2: I was more or less even tempered.  Mild mannered.  Didn't believe in humbugging, things of that nature.  Grew up more or less--didn't get involved in many fights or things of that nature or arguments.  Because didn't have no girlfriends, because I always thought girls were too delicate to be doing a lot of the things that the boys be trying to do to them.  I didn't--now you're laughing, I'm telling you the truth (laughs) okay.  I just thought that way.  So I didn't experience women until I was twenty years old.  Some of my friends had two kids  when I found out what it was all about.  And when I found out there--what it was all about, I was so delicate with the women.  You might would call me the softest individual that you ever seen, when it come to dealing with the women.  It was after I'd gone into the Army, before I really got into what was going on out here.  They were doing a lot of things out here I didn't know nothing about.
Story_ID: 13330
Speaker 1: So, so you had a pretty protected childhood in many ways (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But the community was small.
Speaker 2: The community was small.  The mental capacity of the people there was small.  Because when I was fifteen years old, just before I turned sixteen, there's a guy came to town, from way down in Mississippi around Biloxi, some place in there.  His name was A. B. Preester (ph.), and he had been in town for a day and so.  And some people had told him about me--a white guy.  So he walked up to me one day, and I was like coming out a little café.  We'd call it restaurant here.  Café and he says, "Spann, your name Pervis Spann, right?"  I said,  "Yes, sir."  He says, "I understand that the people around here like you for some reason."  I said, "Well, I don't try to do anything for them not to.  So I guess they like me."  He says, "Well I just been granted a contract to build a black college.  Have you heard about this black college coming to Chicago--coming to Mississippi--Itta Bena?"  I said, "Yes, I heard about it."  He says, "I don't know nobody here.  I just got here."  He says, "I wonder if I could get you to hire me some men."  "When do you want them?"  He told me, say, "I want them like Monday."  This was like on a Tuesday of a week, like Monday.  He want six men.  He says, "I want you to hire them for me."  So I picked out six particular people--six particular guys.  And told them that he was going to be out there and how much he was going to be paying a day.  I think he was paying seventy-five cents an  hour.  Well, they were working in the field all day, about ten hours a day, was getting two dollars and fifty cents and three dollars. So this man gone come in and give them seventy-five cents an hour.  Ooh that was big money for them.  So everybody showed up--well everybody showed up, but a couple of the old people didn't want--didn't wanna--see the man wanted me to be the boss of the workers.  And I had had a little experience as far as digging foundations and things.  Because I worked on the gas line.  On the pipeline, where you dig them straight holes and things.  So he told them, says, "Listen! Alright, Pervis here, young Mr. Spann."  And that's the first time a white man ever called me "Young mister" in life.  "Young Mr. Spann will be the boss.  You will do what he tells you to do!  And now, if y'all got any problem with that, you've been working out here now for about twenty minutes.  You come and I'll pay you your money and let you go if you got any problem with Pervis Spann being the boss."  Everybody fell in line.  We started digging trenches.  And a couple of the old guys didn't like it, because they figured that they were older and they should be--should've been put in charge, and everything.  So he'd come by and tell me just what to do.  We'd do it.  And we got it done.  We did it.
Speaker 1: Now the other question I have for you, how old were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: I think about sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen.  Okay.  And that was even after you--'Cause you started working at the theater at about fourteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere in there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They never would fire me.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What, oh.
Speaker 2: No job that I ever got, ever--I go on record had never fired me.
Story_ID: 13331
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds or smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) None.
Speaker 1: Now Pervis!
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No sights, no smells.  No smell of being in the field picking cotton.  No smell of popcorn and (unclear)--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) If I'm cooking that popcorn, of course! (laughs)
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.  But I'm saying (laughs) no but I'm saying--,
Speaker 2: (Laughs) None other than that (unclear).
Speaker 1: No but I'm saying nothing about the sun? Or the--You know, being outside or--?
Speaker 2: The sun come up every morning.  If I had to go cut somebody's lawn, I'd go mow the lawn.  I smell the grass from cutting the grass.  Other than that, if I'm doing the popcorn, I smell the popcorn.  Oh  there's one thing, maybe a sound.  A compress, a compress.  That's where they press cotton from a big bale into a little bale.  And that's after it's ready to go, hit the truck; hit the road.  It's shipped to Germany or some place.  But I didn't do much work in that. Because I wasn't heavy enough.  They needed the grown men with a little more meat on the bone could move those big bales around.  I wasn't too good at it.  I grew up like a pole.  Like a beanpole.
Speaker 1: So what was the sound of the compress?
Speaker 2: It had a horn.  Old horn they'd blow down there letting you know what time to go to work.  [low noise with voice] Ooooo ooooo like a ship, something like that.  Other than that, nothing.
Story_ID: 13332
Speaker 1: Was there music around you at all?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Music.
Speaker 1: Yeah, music besides--I mean--Because I thought that was cute when you said, "You know, it was a country radio."  'Cause I thought, "What can it be?"  You know, it was a human radio.  But that's what you were saying.  But was there music around at all?
Speaker 2: Only jukeboxes.  Or when we'd go out and play the music, riding around through the countryside.  A lot of places wouldn't be no houses.  You just play music.  And then, start talking about what was happening at the theater.
Speaker 1: And what about radio?  Did radio--Was there radio?
Speaker 2: Radio was very--We had a radio station we'd listen to, WLAC Nashville, Tennessee.  It was on one of them--What I really learned was a clear channel station.  Which mean you--even though it's in Nashville, Tennessee at nighttime, it'll come through just as good almost down in Mississippi as it would in Nashville.  And that's the situation with a lot of radio stations now.  You'd be listening to a radio station out of New York.  And you'd be riding down through Oklahoma.  That's what we call clear channel.  It's on a clear channel radio.  And they have to skip waves--it skipped waves from one place to another.  Every two hundred and fifty to three hundred miles, the signal will come down and be just as plain in Oklahoma as it does in some place in New York City [New York].  But--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And do you remember listening to the radio yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what--Were there any favorite you had?  Or what was played on that station you were able to get?
Speaker 2: Well we--They had the Muddy Waters out of Nashville, WLAC.  Muddy Waters, Louis Jordan, B.B. King, the Bobby ['Blue"] Blands.  They had all those--Fats Domino.  People of that nature, used to listen to that's the stuff that they would play.  Then they'd played the 'Gutbucket Blues', we called it.  The John Lee Hookers, things of that nature--they played on that station.
Speaker 1: So those sounds influenced you even back then.  Why?
Speaker 2: I'd listen to them.  I'd listen to them.  But I was still trying to make up my mind. Well I didn't really like jazz, okay.  I didn't like jazz.  So I didn't really listen to the jazz.  When I did get to the point where I could listen to jazz, I'd listen to Gene Ammons, people like--.  But that was after I got here.  You see, you can venture to say that I didn't like no jazz, down home. (laughs)
Story_ID: 13333
Speaker 1: I mean home was actually a very positive experience.  You're not like some people who said that, "The South was just a horrible place." And, you know.
Speaker 2: Well to each his own.  To me the South--I didn't know the prejudice, 'cause I was too far out to believe that it was prejudice.  Nobody never told me nothing.  I never had to go into the bathroom--in the black bathroom in Itta Bena.  Because I never had to use the bathroom until I got home. The white folks lived on one side of the town; we lived on the other side of the town.  When they wanted some'n from us, they'd come over.  When we wanted somethin' from them, we'd go over.  We didn't have to go socializing.  Wasn't no socializing to do, integrating to do, as far as--If you wasn't in school, wasn't no integrating to do anyway.  You had a job, you go to it.  It was just that way with me.  I never encounter any prejudice of any kind, not while I was in Mississippi.  And, of course I got up, I'm going to me a job some place.  And all white folks I think, glad to see you go to a job.  And since I didn't--wasn't taken girls out, they didn't have to worry about me with the girls.  Therefore, as far as I was concerned, there was no prejudice in that little place that I'm from.
Speaker 1: You know that's a--I think that's a different experience in many ways.  You know, from what people typically think of.
Story_ID: 13334
Speaker 1: Just one other question about the theater.  What things did you learn in that whole, you know, while you're operating the theater?  Were there things that you learned about business or just operation?  Or things that are still with you today?
Speaker 2: Well I learned how to cook hot dogs, popcorn, hot dogs.  I learned how to use the vacuum cleaner, to clean the floor.  I learned how to run the projectors.  So with--If one of the projectionists didn't show up, I would run the projection.  Or whatever it was to do around that theater, I did it.  I sold the tickets. Now you can ask, "How can you get from here to here?"  You know, we had it so designed that some slow nights we let the projection run.  The projection would run almost a half a show without you starting the other machine.  So you sit downstairs and sell the tickets in that particular time.  And then I never will forget, when I got ready to leave there, I went to the bank.  I got money from the bank and shipped all the furniture and stuff to my sister over in Battle Creek, Michigan.  And--So I got ready to close my account out at the bank there. And the young lady says, "You want me to give you a cashier's check?"  I didn't know nothing about no cashier's check.  I didn't no nothing about nothing, you know.  I'm a little country boy.  As country as you--green as grass you've ever seen.  So she says, "Well Pervis, we hate to lose you as an account.  You got seven hundred and some dollars coming."  So a great, big white guy standing over there saying, "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What kin--Wait a minute (laughs). Wait a minute! You mean to tell me this little nigger got more money in this bank than me ?!"  She said, "Mr. Mahoney, I don't know how much you got in your account.  I didn't check.  But he got seven hundred and some dollars in there."  And she--you know, I would always mind my own business, and just do my little thing.  Got the money and went on paid the man for the freight, shipping the furniture.  And paid the man for--business like.  I did it as business.  'Cause I'm doing business or--at the theater.  I'm learning how to do some things that's gonna get you ahead.  And put that stuff on the freight train and shipped it to Battle Creek, Michigan.  Me and my mama [Augusta Banks Spann] got on the train.  She said, "Son we ain't got no money."  I said, "Momma come on, son ain't gone never do you wrong.  Come on.  You've got enough money."  So I bought a ticket, put her on the train and she says, "Where you get all that money from?"  I said, "Mama I work all time.  I work all time.  That's all I do."  I had no girlfriend, nobody to spend no money on.  I would've liked to have had a girlfriend to spend some money on.  But I wouldn't know what to do with the girlfriend if I had her, since I had never had experience woman.  Okay.  So I left there, came to Chicago [Illinois].  Next day got up, caught a train, went on over to Battle Creek.  I had a sister here in Chicago.
Story_ID: 13335
Speaker 1: What motivated moving to Battle Creek [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: [mother, Augusta Banks Spann] Her sister--her daughter was up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My sister, older sister.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Your sister was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.  And so you stayed in Battle Creek, how long?
Speaker 2: I don't know, just a few days.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I had to--just a few days.
Speaker 1: And then, you moved to Gary [Indiana] then, to be with your father [James Henry Spann] to get a job?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I came back to Gary and started working at--working doing construction work at Youngstown Sheet and Tool in East Chicago, Indiana.
Speaker 1: So how did you find being in the North then?  After all this time in the South in this sort of cloistered environment and much larger place?
Speaker 2: Well my daddy[James Henry Spann] was working out in the steel mill with me.  I'd get paid--I got paid big money out there.  As far as I was concerned, it was big money.  And I would take the money and head directly to the--used to put my money in the post office.  I don't know if anybody else ever did that or not.  But I did it during that time when I first got here.  Because I didn't know--I had never been to one of the banks.  And my brother, he was kind of--he was kind of greasy with the money.  He didn't know how to count (laughs).  So I couldn't trust him with no money.  I did once or twice but--And they was paying you several hundred dollars a week out there, doing construction work in the steel mill.  And that was--construction workers get paid big money right now.  Huge money right now.  I don't know what they get there--Some of the better paying jobs 'round.  So I started putting money in the post office.  And I stayed out there until they called me to the Army.
Story_ID: 13336
Speaker 1: I mean you went from a little town [Itta Bena Mississippi] to a big city.  And I'm wondering how that experience was? You know, and being in the North.  That's all I'm saying.  I know you're making more money.  You're happy.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then I wasn't by myself 'cause my brother moved in with me soon as I got here.  And he had all the city, the city smarts.  And I just played a waiting game.  If we go out--When I, at nineteen years old, if I go out to a lounge--and so I didn't drink anyway.  So I'd buy him whatever he want and he'd tell me what's going on.  We'd go to a little club like the 708 or whereever it was.  He would tell me what's going on.  That's all--so forth.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now when you went into the service, you got--Did you get enli--you got drafted?
Speaker 2: Drafted, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is--back in the--is this '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It's part of the Korean War.
Speaker 2: '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: '53 [1953], okay.  And so where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: I was stationed in Atterbury, Indiana [Camp Atterbury].  What they do, they create these camps during the war.  And after the war is over they dismantle them.  And that's what I think happen to Atterbury after a year or two.  Then I was sent to Fort Carson, Colorado to take mountain--cold weather and mountain training.  And do a little boxing with the boxing team and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: And so were you--did you do anything there--?  How long were you in the service?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years.  Did you do anything as it relates to radio, there?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 13337
Speaker 1: So why when you came out, did you wanna go into communications?  And why did you wanna go to that school?  You had the GI Bill? Is that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was going to--Yes.  I started going to electronic school on the GI Bill.  And Oscar Brown, Jr. mama husband [Oscar Brown Sr.] ran the school.  Midway Broadcasting--Midway Television Institute.  Midway Television Institute. And she ran the school.  And it was a good school.  You really learn things by going there.  After a few years--No, after a few months, they teach you how to build radios and build televisions.  And during that time, most of the television repair people were white.  And they didn't wanna come out in the black community to repair televisions.  And you wind up with a whole bunch of business.  It was good!  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got--oh, okay--You got into--okay.  You--well okay. So you came out of the service and then went to the school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're learning--You're not only--Were you learning broadcasting or were you learning more repair--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Repair then.
Speaker 1: More repair.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The broadcasting was a final thing.
Speaker 1: Okay I gotcha.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you were fascinated by this, because you were good at your hands or you could make--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved repairing the televisions.  And I even went into repairing of air conditioners and washers and--Oh that was really something.  It was really something. Just to sit there and says, I can make this work.  Can't nobody else around here make this work, but I can.  I know what's wrong.  Because it's--whatever it is, you know.
Story_ID: 13338
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you did you mother [Augusta Banks Spann] see something special in you?  Did she ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: No.  Mom tried to beat the hell out of me (laughs).  And because I wouldn't run from her, and I wouldn't dare, you know, say anything nasty to her, anything of that nature.  I've always tried to be the gentleman.  From my youth up until now, I've always tried to be a gentleman when it come to the female sex.  Okay.  Always.  My mom was that way.  I have never yet in my life used physical force on a female.  Never.  And I did a lot of other things.  I boxed.  Had some real good fights.  I boxed while I was in the Army.  Good fighter.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I was gonna go into prize fighting as a means of making a living.  But a crazy guy came along by the name of Muhammad Ali (laughs).  That crazy boy.  Couldn't fight that.
Speaker 1: But you loved your mother a great deal didn't you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I loved her.  Still do.  I go visit her grave I think more than all the other folks in the family combined.  Out of eight kids and all the other grandkids.  I would go visit her more than anybody.
Speaker 1: Now when you--so you're working--you're working at--No, no.  When you came back from--you get--In the service, you say, "You had been fighting."  You were doing some whatever.  Boxing.
Speaker 2: Boxing, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were--And when you came out, that's when you went to radio school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay and you worked there.  And you were making good money.  Did you think at that time--Did you go back to  the mill to work?  Or you came back directly to Chicago [Illinois].  You  didn't go back to Gary [Indiana] did you?
Speaker 2: Well, I came back to Chicago.  But I was working out there in Indiana.
Story_ID: 13339
Speaker 1: Now Pervis, how did you get started in radio?  Because let me just ask you, around this time that you get back, Al Benson is very popular at this point.  Right?
Speaker 2: Extremely.
Speaker 1: Was he popular when you left?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But I wasn't too much--I didn't have no interest really in radio.  You know, when I first left.  While I was in the service, I came back.  And my brother-in-law had a tape recorder.  And then I started listening to the tape recorder, listening to myself, listen to them.  Listening to them.  Then one night when we were out, there was a guy by the name of Rick Riccardo called 'Rock with Rick'.  Rick Riccardo had a beautiful voice.  You know, good delivery and everything.  And he was out hitting on the girls.  And my wife was there and her friend.  They were all young.  Everybody young, you know.  Just going in a club.  Robert's Show Club on 66th and King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].  And he was up spinning.  Bought him a drink or something.  And was woofing about how much money he made a minute.  And he said, "That he made thirteen dollars a minute."  Now remember that--'cause I was making $13 a day in the mill at that time.  Thirteen dollars a day.  And I remember that so vividly.  I said, "What!"  Then the next day I turned him on.  I said, "What is this man doing for them to pay him thirteen dollars a minute, and I get thirteen dollars a day?"  So then I borrowed the tape recorder from my brother-in-law and began to use it.  Now at the meantime, I'm going to school of electronics down on 47th and Cottage Grove [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And since I'm going to school down here, let me on my spare time put it on this tape recorder.  And I started doing that.  So when I finished the school down--the repairing of the televisions and the electronics, that gave me the feel that it takes to--Because, you know, transformers are basically alike.  During that time, most of the tubes except there were either dials or (unclear) or things of that nature.  You know all of them.  You know where they go.  You know what they do.  But now I gotta figure out how--What do I do to get behind this mic?  When I finished the school of electronics, I went to broadcasting school.  Just a little make-up school down on Wabash, called Midwest Broadcasting School [Chicago, Illinois].  And I went.  And by me coming out of Mississippi, my diction was bad.  My delivery had to be poor.  You know, everything was bad.  Okay.  But I came out.  I started working at it.  It was only about four black guys, all men, no women in the school.  And the rest of them was all white males.  So when I came out, they were getting ready to graduate us.  So I went over to a little station out in--Well, it wasn't a little station, WGES, which was the biggest thing going as far as black folks are concerned.  I went over there and talked with my friend Richard Stamps.  He thought I was over there to buy some airtime for a little television shop that I had opened up to repair televisions.  But then I got around to telling him that, "No.  I'm looking for a job."  He said, "Well you won't get no job up in here.  You may go out to WOPA.  And there's a man out there by the name of Mr. Michelle.  Talk with him.  Big Bill Hill is the man out there.  But you may talk with Mr. Michel and he'll give you a job maybe.  I don't know.  Go out there and talk with him."  It was Saturday around 12:00 or 1:00.  And I went out there and caught him in the office.  He was cleaning up his papers, (unclear).  Got in.  So he says, "What do you want?"  I says, "I'm looking for a job."  "A job doing what?"  I said, "Well I'm looking for an announcer's job."  "Well we don't have no jobs available."  I says, "Well," he said, "I tell you what you do, come back to see us some--later on.  You said you just getting out of school down on Wabash?"  I said, "Yes sir."  "Well come back and see me later on."  "Okay."  So that Monday about 10:00 [a.m.] I was back there knocking on the doors.  When the woman took me into his office--up to his office, he said, "Wasn't you just here the other day?"  I said, "Yes sir.  You told me come back later.  This is later.  I was here Saturday, this is Monday.  This is later.  You didn't tell me how later."  So we talked.  So he said, "Okay.  Well we'll see what we can work out for you at some time or another."  So I went back two days later, Thursday.  He said, "Man [chuckle] come on in.  Let's talk.  Otherwise I'm gonna be bothered with you everyday.  Come on in and let's talk."  So we went on inside and talked.  And he said, "Have you ever sold time before?"  "No sir."  "Have you ever been on the air before?"  "No sir."  "What have you done before?"  "Nothing.  But I can do it.  I'm never gonna be able to do it unless somebody give me the opportunity to do it, sir."  So he said, "Well come back up here tomorrow."  I went back up there the next day.  And he told me, he said, "Son li--I tell you what I'll do.  I'll sell you some time."  He was in the business of selling time too.  He says, "For fifteen minutes, I want you to--I want seventy-five dollars."  But it's fifteen minutes a night.  That means I had a bunch of nights.  So eventually, I went out with my little personality and started talking to people.  The first guy I talked with took the first fifteen minutes, which was on a Monday night.  He gave me seventy-five dollars.  The next night, the next guy give me fifteen minutes, seventy-five dollars. (laughs)  So that's a $150 I got already.  And I just went on like that.  Before long, Mr. Michelle called me in the office.  He said, "How do you sell them accounts?"  I said, "I get seventy-five dollars a show."  He said, "Well that's all I charge you." (laughs) "You didn't tell me what you charged them, sir.  I'm getting the same thing that you charged me."  So he says, "Well you come up here one day next week.  Me and you got to talk."  So what he did--(unclear)  had that whole midnight slot, from midnight 'til 4:00 in the morning.  And he says--He got mad with McKie [Fitzhugh].  And he's says--told McKeefe, said, "We're pulling the whole program from you.  We're giving it to this guy, this Pervis Spann."  Then McKie got mad with me.  I created more enemies.  Huh, what do you do?
Story_ID: 13340
Speaker 1: Pervis, I wanna talk like--Al Benson was where at that point?
Speaker 2: WGES.
Speaker 1: He was at WGES.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Well that's where you wanted--No, WOPA right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he was how old when you were doing this?  'Cause you're--At this point you are [calculating] in your twenties still.  You're still in your twenties.  So how old is he--He's an older gentleman at that--Or maybe he's like in his forties?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was fifty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--can you--do you think your--did that--does he remind you of home?  His way of--no?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he--can you imitate Al Benson?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs).  When you got your slot at, you know, this (unclear).  Okay, you're selling.  Did you know what kind of  slot you wanted to have or what kind of music you were going to play?
Speaker 2: I liked the blues and I wanted to play the blues.  But so when I--I had been listening to Big Bill Hill, which was also on WOPA.  And was a very popular disk jockey in Chicago.  Extremely popular.  So--And he just about more or less ran [W]OPA except for Al Michelle the manager.  And Al Michelle was Jewish and he liked money.  He didn't like (laughs)--He says--he told me one day, I was giving--'Cause I started giving--I came over to WOPA  and started playing B. B. King records, 'cause Bill Hill wouldn't play them.  And--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And why wouldn't he play B. B. King?
Speaker 2: 'Cau--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) 'Cause they had a run-in.
Speaker 2: Personal reasons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I got you.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now are you--you didn't know B. B. King at this point though?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: B. B. King and I came from the same--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I know. The same town.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you grow up--around the same time?
Speaker 2: No.  B. B. King is older than me.
Speaker 1: He's older than you.  That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you get started.  You have--Your slot at that point and time is how long when you first get started?
Speaker 2: Well when Al Michelle get rid of--got rid of McKie [Fitzhugh], I got four hours.  You know, a long time.  The same time I'm on now.
Speaker 1: That's right. And when did you--So how was that experience?  Was there any sense of like first--you know even talking in the microphone and not being able to see people?  And--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, because I picked that up I guess from talking down in Itta Bena [Mississippi].  When I was telling them folks, "Come up here and see Tex Ritter," or whoever we got.  You know.  And I knew it would work.  Then I got out, I'm on tape recorder, learning how to mix some words together.
Speaker 1: And so you continue to do that at WOPA for how--for actually how many years?
Speaker 2: I started in 1959, '60 [1960], '61 [1961], '62 [1962].  Then I left April 1, '63 [1963].  But I was still on [W]OPA on tape.  When I was with both of them 'cause Michelle, he was about to go crazy with me leaving.  All that money I was bringing in to him over there.  Then coming over to WVON.
Story_ID: 13341
Speaker 1: See when we were talking the other day, and I was saying, "Well how did you end up coming to WVON?"  And you were saying that--or how even the association with. How did you come to be associated with WVON in the first place?  You had built an audience?
Speaker 2: I had built a tremendous audience over at WOPA.  But when Mr. [Leonard] Chess came to me and said, "I want you to do my all night program on WVON."  I didn't wanna leave Mr. Michelle with nobody.  So I left tapes over there for about a month--with me doing the tapes on both stations.
Speaker 1: And Leonard Chess didn't have a problem with that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you come to know Leonard Chess?
Speaker 2: Well Leonard Chess--while I was playing blues records on OPA, and we got to be good friends.  If you're playing records, you always become great friends of the record companies.
Speaker 1: Now what kind--What was  Leonard Chess like at this point and time?  What is he like?
Speaker 2: I only knew Leonard Chess from the business side.  You know, since I didn't drink, I didn't go to the [race] tracks with him or do anything.  The only thing I did was went to work.  And so when I met with him, it was just like meeting the  insurance man, or anybody else.  You know.  In business you own the station.  "You want me to do X, Y, Z, I'll--That's what I'm gonna do."  Exactly what you tell me to.
Speaker 1: Now what was the time period from the time that you--that he--that Leonard Chess contacted you and WVON opened on April 1?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a long time.  It--sometimes it takes three months, two months or a month and a half or something like that, depending on situations.  And by Leonard Chess buying the station from a [U.S.] Congressman by the name of [Richard William] Hoffman, it didn't take him long to get it through the FCC.  So you figure two and a half to three months.
Speaker 1: And do you--so when you--but you were attracted over there because of what?  Because--I mean because [McKie] Fitzhugh  had really been kind to you right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  He had been a--he hadn't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fitzhugh was never kind to me.  But I was one--I was a guy that if you told me to do something, I was gonna do it anyway.  Regardless of what the ex-party--the third party think or how they feel.  I was gonna go do it.  But by that time, I wasn't a little boy no more.  I'd been boxing.  I'm 6'2" and hit as hard as a mule.  But scared to fight--Scared to get in the ring with Muhammad Ali (laughs).  So I, you know, I wasn't a pushover.  It's just that I had my little ways of doing things.  My ways of doing things is that, "It gotta be done a certain way.  Let's do it that way.  But let's do it that way!  Let's not play games with it.  Let's just do it that way."  So Mr. Chess knew where he stood with me.  You know, he never brought the foolishness to me.  The cursing and the swearing and the stuff of that nature. He alw--when he'd come to talk to me, he'd come to me and say, "Pervis will you do so-and-so for me?"  That's all he'd say.  And I was gonna do it anyway.  And I did it.
Speaker 1: So  was there a plan to open on April 1?  Or was that just happenstance?
Speaker 2: I came along during that time.  See Rodney Jones, my friend, he was the program director.  And somebody had pushed--had picked April 1 because that's April fools day.  And the folks would turn their radio on and here all this stuff and April Fool (laughs).  So at midnight, that night, April Fools day, we opened.  I was on both stations.  Then at 5:00 in the morning, the gospel man came on.  At that time it was not Bill Dock Lee.  It was Elder Bud Riley.  Bud Riley was an old preacher at some church.  I don't know.  So he stayed there for a little while until they got Bill Lee to come in several months down the line.
Speaker 1: So now did you feel that, you know, you were part of something sort of special?  Or it was just this was another business thing.  You had had it with Fitzhugh.  I'm just asking.
Speaker 2: Fitzhugh--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No dealing with Fitzhugh whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was dealing with the station that he was on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right, right.  I understand.  I'm sorry.  The station.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who owned the station (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was--The manager there
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Was?
Speaker 2: Al Michelle.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Michelle.  So that's what I'm saying.  Mich--I didn't mean Fitzhugh.  I'm sorry.  It was Michel.  So Fitz--Michelle, you didn't--You just wanted to make for a transition.  So you made sure you didn't cut off your ties there.  And you had this going here with WVON.  Plus you have a station that is owned by a guy who owns a record company.  It's blues and (unclear) blues anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 13342
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you were part of something special though in a way?  Or, you know, this group over here that he had--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Assembled?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  'Cause there all black disc jockeys.  And then we're playing all black music more or less.  You know, unless some white (unclear) up in there.  You know.  A white blues singer.  So I felt that it was going to be something good.  Because I figured  in time, they would--[W]VON would take all their listeners.  And we did.  Took all of them.
Speaker 1: And this--can you just share some anecdotes about those early days?
Speaker 2: I did with that the other time I was over there.
Speaker 1: Come on.  No!  Just some anecdotes.  And you weren't sharing them.  You were sitting there.  It was Herb Kent that was sharing.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: Give me three or four.
Speaker 2: See my cold is working loose.
Speaker 1: I know.  Do you want some more water?
Speaker 2: No.  That's--what happening?
Speaker 1: You're dying?
Speaker 2: I can't get that lucky, could I?
Speaker 1: (Laughs) You know, tell me.  Just tell me.  I mean I could--I could--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You don't never get tired of listening do you?
Speaker 1: Just tell me some.  Just some anecdotes.
Speaker 2: Just--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh gosh!  This is ridiculous.  I need to think of a different questions about anecdotes.  Tell me some stories.  (laughs) It don't mean you're gonna tell me.  Tell me some incidents.  You know just like, you haven't--I mean some of the things like you and E. Rodney, you're good pals right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you had--you had already--you'd been working together already before.  Right?  No he was--Where was E. Rodney before this?  He was--I'm getting confused.
Speaker 2: He was on--
Speaker 1: He was on another station.
Speaker 2: He was on the 1390 [AM] which is--I'll tell you the name of it  just a minute though.  But he was over there.  But they fired him, because he was too black.  Now he had the good baritone voice and everything.  But he was too black.  Because they wanted more white listeners.  'Cause after they sewed up the black listeners, they wanted to reach out and get the white listeners.  And between the white and the black, they would have the most listeners than any one-radio station in the city.  But behold, WVON came on.  And with that rough voice of Rodney's and  a few other folks and at night I played blues all night long.  Hey, we had the pulse of the city.  Took it all the way to number one.
Speaker 1: And how long did that take, to take it all the way to number one?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna say about the third rating period we was number one.  Number one.  From zero to number one.  Try--
Speaker 1: What--and so you--okay.  So--Who was running the station at that point?  Who was managing?  Who had he put--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He had a white guy named Frank Ward.  Frank Ward was the manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then--okay.  And what--Frank Ward was the manager for how long?  And then who--And did Lucky replace him at that point?  Or was Lucky (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.  it was Frank Ward.  Then when Frank Ward was moved out, it was another white guy moved in.  Another white guy--His name is not coming to me right now.  Then a guy named Bell.
Speaker 1: So what--How long did Lucky--Was he under the--he was under them.
Speaker 2: No.  Lucky hadn't made it in here yet.
Speaker 1: Oh he hadn't.
Speaker 2: Lucky didn't get in here  'til--
Speaker 1: '60 [1960]--.
Speaker 2: '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Eight!
Speaker 2: Lucky was way down the line.
Speaker 1: Oh!  Oh wow!  Okay.
Speaker 2: Lucky was still working at W--
Speaker 1: The other one.  That--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) [W]YNR.
Speaker 1: Right.  Wasn't that where he was?
Speaker 2: WYNR.
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause that was where E. Rodney Jones was.
Speaker 2: That's where he came from yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They used to call  it 'Winner', WYNR.
Story_ID: 13343
Speaker 1: So how did you start really the concerts?  So you're--you've built quite a name for yourself right now at this point, right?  Everyone knows--Are you know as 'Pervis Spann the Blues Man'?
Speaker 2: From the beginning.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Are we on?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Do all lawyers do like you?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I have--I went in the concert business way back in 1959.  Was it '59 [1959]?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: 1959 and 1960.
Speaker 2: '59 [1959], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: So how did it get started?
Speaker 2: The concerts got started--So it had to be going good in 1960 'cause it really got going good when I came to Big Bill--Bill Hill.  I didn't know how to put on concerts.  I'd never put on a concert.  The only thing I'd ever put on was a little old dance for a little social club we had.  And Bill Hill had been putting on concerts.  But Bill Hill and B. B. King had fell out [over] the affections of some female.  And therefore, Bill Hill wasn't playing any B. B. King Records. So finally me and B. B. being just said, "Let's get on with it.  Let's do it."  So when I got--When I got to B. B. King and told him I wanted to do a show on him in Chicago [Illinois], I never even told him B. B. King--Bill Hill was gonna be a part of it.  He said, "Okay.  Fine.  I ain't been there in a long time."  The only thing he know, he hadn't been in Chicago [Illinois] for a long time.  And Bill Hill had been the one that would bring him.  So he agreed to come for me.  And Bill Hill and I agreed to work the show together.  Bill Hill had no problem in making the money.  But he just didn't think that he wanted, you know, he's egotistical.  His woman was his pride and joy.  Don't let this get out  'cause this (laughs) this get back to Miss Hill 'cause she still living. (laughs)  This is my only thing now.  So I got with B. B. King and told him.  He said, "Okay.  Me and you'll be partners.  We'll pay the band.  We'll pay B. B. King and that'll be it.  We'll be partners."
Speaker 1: This is you and Bill Hill.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he and I have never had no run-ins.  'Cause I really didn't have no run-ins with people.  I just do my thing and go on and do the best I can with it.  So I went over to the Ashland Auditorium, which is located at Ashland [Avenue] and Van Buren [Street] and talked with that man up there.  And he said, "Okay, how many people you hold?"  He says, "We get 3500 in here."  "Okay."  So I went back and told B--Big Bill Hill 'cause he's the lead man.  He knows how to run it.  I don't.  So we started advertising.  He done it during the day on his show, and I'm doing it--that was before--that was before [W]VON [AM, Chicago, Illinois] come into play.  So when a day before the show all tickets--Tickets selling out everywhere.  We were charging, I forget.  I think it was--It was either three dollars or five dollars.  But anyway, the folks were coming in there so fast that night.  'Til the girl didn't have time to put the money up.  She was just getting them tickets and taking the money and putting it on the floor.  And she was just stepping on the money.  She said, "Come in and look." (laughs) Until we got 3500 folks in there.  So five times thirty-five [hundred] come to what?  Whatever it is (laughs).  That's how much money we took in that night.  And Bill Hill had never seen anything like it in his life.  And you know I had never seen it like that.  Well then Big Bill Hill was walking around there patting himself on the chest and "Look at what he had done."  You know.  But it's the--What really happened was people hadn't had no blues in Chicago in years.  And all these southern folks from Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana wanted to see the blues at that time.  And we packed it out to the brim.  It took my secretary the next day 'til about 10:30 in the morning to count the money.  To get it together before it could be presented for recount.  We did good.  We did it good.
Speaker 1: That's thousands of dollars.
Speaker 2: A few thousands.
Story_ID: 13344
Speaker 1: So what did B. B. King--he wasn't upset that [Big] Bill Hill was involved [in promoting his concert]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He wasn't.
Speaker 2: Money, money.
Speaker 1: Money.  So it was right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--,
Speaker 2: And he--from then on he started getting his records played again [on the radio in Chicago, Illinois] by both of us, you know.
Speaker 1: So you really were responsible for bringing them back together in many ways.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Now--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But he still wouldn't come in to work for Bill Hill.  But it worked out.
Speaker 1: So did you--then did you and Bill Hill then do a series of concerts after that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We started off doing one.  But then what happened, the next concert--we had the next--the next concert we had in, we lost money on it.  And Bill Hill wouldn't come up with his part of the loss.  So I said, "Well he didn't come up with his part of the loss."  So the third one, I didn't include him no more.  And that--he was mad with me from--'til he died.  Because--"Hey if you're not gonna play fair--."
Speaker 1: When you said, "He wouldn't come up with his part of the loss."  What does that mean?
Speaker 2: We lost money together.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh! So he would--I see.  Okay, okay I got you.  So anything that required--He couldn't come up with extra.
Speaker 2: Could not.  I didn't say he couldn't.
Speaker 1: He would not.  He would not.
Speaker 2: He wouldn't.
Speaker 1: Now this is what I'm saying.  So you--this is more, this is more--this--you found a goldmine in many ways.  'Cause nothing--you know, selling time and having a radio show wasn't generating money like these shows.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: One helped the other.  But they weren't generating money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So who were some--What was like some of the other shows that you did during that period?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a friend  whom I used to play his records all the time, by the name of James Brown.  I called James Brown one day and told him, "Come on in and do a show."  So I wanted to know how much it was gonna cost me.  He said, "Well I'll tell you what.  We'll just split the money.  Whatever we take in.  I take 50 percent and you take 50 percent.  I pay my dues, you pay your dues."  And that's the way we did it.
Speaker 1: Now how had you met James Brown?
Speaker 2: I just had been talking with him.  And, you know, by being on the air--call in some time and talk with me, you know.  We had no doubt about it gonna be a packed house 'cause it was packed.  It was packed from the first day I said, "James Brown is coming."  That's all you'd hear on the telephone, "James Brown coming."
Story_ID: 13345
Speaker 1: But you were known as the 'Blues Man'.  And, you know, I look at someone like James Brown, you know, he's known as the Soul--I mean when did soul get started?  And what's blues?  And does it even really matter?
Speaker 2: Doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's whatever you call that.  It's in that frame so, you know, it works.
Speaker 1: Now what is the relationship between, you know, your concert promotions and Leonard Chess and all of that?  Or is it everyone is sort of doing their own thing.  Leonard Chess never wanted to--never--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he--Was he sort of hands off?  He let everyone sort of do their own thing?  Or was it--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.  If that's what they wanted to do.  If that's what they wanted to do.  Leonard Chess had some input in one promotion that we had for this radio station [WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinois].  And that was when we had Marvin Gaye and Sam Cooke and all of them together.  We had 60,000 people in for that.
Story_ID: 13346
Speaker 1: Had 60,000 people in for that concert with Sam Cooke [sponsored by WVON-AM radio, Chicago, Illinois].  That's the last--that's going in my book too.  That's the last concert [1963-1964] that Sam Cooke ever did in this lifetime.  He--we had it at White Sox Park [also known as Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois], and had 60,000 people there.
Story_ID: 13347
Speaker 1: When you got started.  I mean when you--you pretty quickly learned the ins and outs of promotions.  And there's the venue.  There's that part of getting the venue and working out those deals.  And then--You know, why do black people--some say, "Black people didn't go past, you know, south of 23rd [Street] or whatever?  Or you know, they didn't go downtown yet."  The venues that you're talking--people say that sometimes.  They say, "People didn't come--"  But you're talking about major (laughs).  Don't look at me that way.  I mean I've heard that from the years that I came into Chicago [Illinois].  But I'm saying that you're talking about major venues. Were there issues about, you know, negotiating deals with them?  Were you ever ripped off by the, you know, the locations where you, you know.
Speaker 2: Now what you wanna ask me?
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Well I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (laughs).
Speaker 1: I'm trying to ask about the business of doing.  You know.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: What you learned about the business of doing, you know, concert promotion basically.
Speaker 2: Well, I learned so much from so many of the venues that I dealt with.  For an example, if I was gonna go to White Sox Park [a.k.a. Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois], the first thing I wanted to know, what's the capacity?  What you gonna charge me?  Do I have to pay you any percentage of anything?  So--and they would tell me point blank what I have to do.  And I just insist on them putting it in writing.  You know, tell me what you're gonna do.  I don't mind doing it, but y'all gotta tell me what you gonna do.  Soldiers Field [sic, Soldier Field Stadium, Chicago, Illinois], same thing.  Soldiers Field was extremely, extremely rude to me.  But I survived that too.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Not 'til I write the book.
Speaker 1: Okay fine.  Okay.  And (laughs) okay.  Then what--okay.  But were they all--were people doubting sometimes that you could bring in that many people?  Or were they not wanting to have that many people around?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  I have put on shows in the Omni [International Complex, later CNN Center], in Atlanta [Georgia] with a blues show and packed it out.  Never been heard of before in Atlanta, a blues show in the Omni.  Then the same thing when I went to Memphis, Tennessee.  They had 11,000 people in the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee.  Left town, went out and did a whole bunch of dates.  Come back.  Twenty days later, played the same thing with the same act and packed it out again.  Then  Nashville, Tennessee we had the--I think the thing hold 9500.  We packed it out at Nashville.  Then we went over to Jackson, Mississippi, 9500 folks in there.  With B. B. King and Bobby ['Blue'] Bland.  A few folks--When you need the names I'll give you all the names.  Don't worry about it.  Then I went over to--I went over to [thinking] a place right on the border down there called Tampa, Florida.  Tampa-St. Pete [St. Petersburg, Florida].  Tampa, Miami, back up to Mobile [Alabama], or up to New Orleans [Louisiana], Dallas, Texas, all those places.  Those are just a few of them.  Many places like if you wanna go East then, you have to take in--you have to start in Cleveland, Ohio.  That big arena out there in the--it's in a little suburb of Cleveland.  But I just call it we play in Cleveland.  And then I--Dayton [Ohio].  No--we went into a place in Buffalo, New York.  I sent a show into Madison Square Garden [convention center, New York, New York] through another friend of mines that's a promoter named Teddy Powell.  See, we had this undeclared loyalty to promoters in the area.  Therefore, when I got ready to go into Atlanta, except for a couple of times, I called a guy I know by the name of Henry Wynn.  And he was a promoter there so I make a little deal with him on the money situation.  Now a lot of these towns I'd just go on into and just (unclear).  But Detroit [Michigan] was one of my good--Cobo Hall [convention center]--Oooh!  We could--we just--I used to play sometime Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis [Missouri] the same night--three different shows.  Three different shows.  Had my crew in St. Louis, I stay in Chicago and send another crew to Detroit.  More than one time I did this, you know.  So if anybody ever ask you, "If I ever put on any shows?"  I've been out here.
Story_ID: 13348
Speaker 1: Let's say with some of the talent.  Do you have, do you have a favorite like B. B. King story?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I got one--Johnnie Taylor.  I've got some B. B. Kings too.  But, you know, Johnnie Taylor.  You always got Johnny Taylor.  Johnny Taylor--I had a show in Detroit, Michigan.  And I had the Dells, the Howlin' Wolf and Johnnie Taylor.  And with them, you have a constant battle about who is going to go on stage last.  The Dells, or Johnnie Taylor.  So what I did, I had planned on putting Howlin' Wolf on stage last.  But I hadn't told nobody.  'Cause, you know, it's up to me to send them.  So I sent the Howlin' Wolf up before the Dells and Johnnie Taylor.  The Howlin' Wolf goes up and little do they know, that the Howlin' Wolf is more popular than either one of them.  He's in that what you call underground blues circuit.  And they got in there.  So a creative genius--"The Howlin' Wolf!"  And I brought him on that stage.  And he came out on the stage.  Every white person in there stood up when the Howlin' Wolf hit that stage.  Every white--then the black folks started (laughs) looking around at them.  All these white folks.  Then they began to get up.  "Well maybe these white folks got something going here."  They began to get up.  And the Howlin' Wolf, from the time he left that stage, everybody in the entire--I had 10,000 people there standing up with, "More!  More!  More!"  Well, we gotta get them off the stage.  I went back and I asked them other guys, I says, "Y'all sure you wanna go on?"  (laughs)  'Cause everybody was standing up applauding, having fun.  And after the Howlin' Wolf left the stage, the show was over.  Who ever just went up, just went up.  You know, just--The folks didn't pay them no attention no way.  So that's the thing you got to look at when you're putting on a lot of shows.  And take a lot of them old blues artists, you think, "This ain't nothing.  We're gonna run over him."  No.  I've seen it happen too much.  Too much.  They wanna close the house down when people like the Wolf sing, Muddy Waters.  Oh Muddy Waters, Muddy Waters.  If Muddy Waters get up before you, you might as well not go on stage.  'Cause he done took the house.  He done tore the house up.  Muddy Waters will do that.
Speaker 1: Now what about James Brown?  You have a famous James Brown story?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  You've known James Brown a long time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You've got enough.
Story_ID: 13349
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the importance of the station [WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinois] during that period.  Why was it--What was it doing that was important?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just doing what black folks thought it should do.  It was playing the music folks and hearing the music that they wanted to here.  They were dancing and--Herb Kent was giving all the hops and things every Friday and Saturday night.  Herb Kent giving hops at different places.  Pervis Spann and [E.] Rodney Jones were giving concerts all around.  And then Rodney a lot of times would just do--I'd be doing something at the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois].  Rodney would do a record hop on the West Side.  We--the city [Chicago] was just opened up for whatever we were doing.  You know, what really stopped the--stopped us from really doing all these things, through the radio station, that old music that they put out there.  That old disco stuff.  That old disco stuff.  That killed the black record sales more or less.  If they ever wanna tell the truth about it.  If they don't wanna tell the truth about it, then go on back there.
Story_ID: 13350
Speaker 1: So who came up even with 'The Good Guys'?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't really know.  But [E.] Rodney [Jones]--this came up before [WVON-AM general manager] Lucky [Cordell] got here.  So it's--Rodney--Herb [Kent] was too drunk during that period.  He didn't (laughs) know who was a good guy and who was not.  It might have been Bernadine C. Washington.  'The Good Guys'.  It might have been some of them. You know.  But (laughs).
Speaker 1: Well who developed the logo?  'Cause it's just as pretty and creative?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: That looks like a woman's touch there.
Speaker 2: Well,  we had the women, we had them more or less of a promotional department up there.
Story_ID: 13351
Speaker 1: [Some]time you go in there and you make $50,000, sometime you go in and you lose 50 [thousand dollars].
Speaker 2: Because you didn't have the audience there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Was that the only reason?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When you didn't have the audience.
Speaker 1: We didn't have the audience.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But when you made that money like that, did people around here know you were making money like that? (Pauses) Not really.
Speaker 1: If it was their business.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Okay.
Speaker 1: You don't be telling folks your business.
Story_ID: 13352
Speaker 1: You came back and bought the very station [WVON-AM, Chicago, Illinois] that really sort of--really catapulted your career in a way.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, it was your richest time.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you feel about that?  I mean--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Great.
Speaker 1: Okay great (laughs).  But what were your desires?  Was it to bring back, you know, what was the community?  The, you know, no okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you see I wasn't--I was not in control of what direction that the radio station was taking then.  That was done by E. Rodney Jones.  And E. Rodney Jones was more or less looking out for black people and Rodney Jones.  And that's all I'm gonna say on that part .  But Rodney Jones did a good job in what he was doing.  But Rodney had some habits that are not up to snuff as far as I would like for my child or my children to pattern their life after.  You know.  Even though you may be the program director, you may be the music director.  A lot of folks use different means of getting their stuff played on the air.  And I didn't--I never was in for that.  So I'm not gonna talk about my partners.  Leave my partners alone.
