 Paustenbaugh  O   Neill   Today is  July 15, 2010. I   m here in Marshall, Oklahoma at the home  of Hugh O   Neill. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh from the Oklahoma  State University Library and we are here today speaking about Angie  Debo, who was a long-time friend and neighbor of Hugh and his late  wife, Ramona O   Neill. Before we start talking about your relationship  with Angie Debo, I wanted to ask you a few questions about your own  life, to set the context for our later conversation about her. I was hoping  that you could tell me a little bit about your early life: where you were  born, the family you were born into and how you ended up here in  Marshall, Oklahoma.  I was born in Enid, Oklahoma the second day of January, 1930. I have  lived in Marshall, Oklahoma my entire life. I am the exception to the  rule in the present-day and age of this mobile society. In all these eighty  years, with the exception of my two years service in the Army, I have  moved just exactly one city block. I was born one block east of where I  live now. We moved here when I was sixteen in 1946. I   ve lived here  my entire life. I   m a farmer. My father was a farmer, that   s where I  learned it. My father told me one time, said,    Son, you always want to  remember: you can   t make it all just farming wheat. You have to have  something else with it.    My father was a cattleman. I don   t care for that  business, so I went into the insurance business. So, I   m a farmer and a  retired insurance agent. I retired from the insurance company   oh, a  couple, three years ago after fifty years with the insurance company.  That   s about the size of it.  I have only a high school education. The biggest mistake I ever made in  my life, my father wanted to send me to school and it would have been  paid going. He wanted to send me to Notre Dame University. I have a  cousin who is a graduate of Notre Dame. I told my father in my infinite  wisdom that,    Dad, I believe I   d rather take the money for the education  and put it in the farm.    Biggest mistake I ever made in my life. I   ll never  5  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  forget what my dad told me. He said,    Son, you always want to  remember: they can take those farms away from you sometime. They  can never take an education away from you.    So now, here I sit, eighty  years old, wishing I had that degree that I had the opportunity to have.  So tell me what Marshall was like growing up.  Marshall was a good town   you understand I was born in 1930. Right  after that was the worst part of the Depression, but when I was eight,  nine, ten years old (this would have been 1938,    39, 1940) Marshall was  a good town. We had two grocery stores, three produce stores. A  produce store is in those days, all farmers almost always separated the  milk with a hand separator and that gave you the cream on one side and  the skim milk on the other. They used to feed the skim milk to the hogs.  Now I go to the store and buy skim milk because of my heart condition.  But anyway, that meant about once a week   they didn   t come to town  every day, maybe once or twice a week, and they would bring the cream  to town to sell and they   d bring the eggs to sell and that   s what the  produce houses did. They bought this, you see. So we had three of those  and we had an M.D., doctor, here. We had a drugstore with a  pharmacist. We had a shoe repair shop. This didn   t last long, but at one  time, we had five automotive filling stations at the same time. That  didn   t last long; generally two or three always.  I could go on and on. We had a Masonic lodge, an Odd Fellows lodge,  bank, post office, had two different automobile dealerships, a Chevrolet  and a Ford. My uncle, my mother   s brother, was the Model T dealer here  back in 1915-16. This was before my time, of course. And my dad told  me that he used to go to Oklahoma City and there was an assembly plant  down there and he would drive Model Ts from the assembly plant back  to Marshall. That   s digressing from what you asked me, but anyway, we  still had the dealerships, you see; a Ford and a Chevrolet dealership and  we had a farming machinery dealership, two barbers. Anyway, what I   m  trying to tell you is it was a very good small town at the time, and now  as you can see, it   s totally derelict. You go through Main Street, the  buildings are falling in, the windows are knocked out. The only active  business in town is the co-op elevator. You can   t even buy a loaf of  bread or a bottle of milk in Marshall. I go to Enid about once a week  with a list about a mile long with my coolers and everything and I buy  my groceries for the following week, once a week.  So when did that decline start to happen?  Alright. It was still a pretty good town when Mona and I were married in  1954. It was still a good town. And then it started probably in the 1960s  just gradually going down. But my father was very prescient. I  6  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  remember that he used to tell me   and of course, my father died in  1956. You know, this has been long ago when he must have said this,  but he could see already that these small towns were going. And he said,     Son, what is killing these small towns is simply good roads and good  cars,    because in the early day, if you   ll ever notice   this might be of  interest to you sometime   from Enid, follow the railroad and you come  to Fairmont about eight miles, Douglas about eight miles, Marshall  about eight more miles, Lovell about eight more miles, Crescent about  eight more miles and finally eight more miles, you   re in Guthrie, give or  take a mile. Alright. You had to have a town about all that distance  because if someone lived out in the country four miles away, that was a  long way with a team and wagon, you see. Well now, you can get in  your automobile and drive thirty-five miles to Enid in forty-five minutes  on a nice, paved road and that is what   s killed your small town because  you have a much larger selection of merchandise in the large town,  better prices and so on and so forth and you can   t compete.  What about schools and churches?  Well, there   s one good reason why you   ve lost both of them. It   s simply  a matter   my dad told me in the early day   you want to remember now,  my father was born in 1892. He said,    Son, in the early day, you farmed  a quarter section, 160 acres if you wanted to make a living; if you  wanted to make a little money, you farmed a half section, 320 acres.    He  said,    Now son, it   s gotten to the point to where you can   t hardly make a  living off a half section.    Well, it has gotten to the point now to where  you can   t make a living off a section. You have to be a farmer that is  farming maybe 1500, 2000, 2500 acres. This is a result of  mechanization.  I remember that Dad told me that my grandpa O   Neill used to have a  man that lived with him year-round, worked for him, he made fifteen  dollars a month board and room. Then if you needed anybody to work,  there were people standing in a line to work on the farm because there  was a family on almost every quarter section and these people had large  families. It would be nothing unusual to have eight, nine children. My  mother was a family of eight children. Alright, that meant you had a lot  of kids going out looking for a job, and if you wanted to hire somebody  to help you scoop wheat or stack wheat or shock wheat, or whatever,  plow, all you had to do was just wave at him, and boy, here he came.  Well, it got to the point where these people couldn   t compete with the  fellow that was farming a large section, so they   d move away. That left a  vacant place. Pretty soon, you could drive two or three miles down the  road without seeing a house. At one time, I can remember, there were  houses on every quarter-section, just about. A section of land, you   d  7  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  have four farm families living there. I asked my dad one time if you   d  have a team of mules, about how many acres a day you would plow. He  said,    About three acres a day, son.    But he said,    Your uncle Ed  Grassmann had big mules and they could plow about five acres a day.     Well, now you can take your tractor and plow forty acres a day, no  problem at all. So, machinery has replaced manual labor. Alright, the  manual labor had to go elsewhere for someplace to live and that   s  exactly what   s killed the small town. The schools and the small town  have suffered from exactly the same thing: a lack of personnel. They  didn   t have customers, the schools didn   t have students, and that   s  what   s done it.  So in its heyday, what was the population of Marshall?  Never very big. Back about 1927-   28, they had an oil boom around here.  There   s a place about five miles southwest of Marshall called Roxana. It  was just a boom town, you know. They hit oil out there and it was big  stuff. They had one well that came in, I think, at three thousand barrels a  day. But it didn   t last very long. It lasted until maybe 1934-   35. I asked  my mother one time, I said,    How big was Marshall at the most?    I  thought she told me about six hundred or something whereas now, it   s  way less than two hundred.  So that boom in Roxana, I had read that the original quarter section that  the Debo family had was right in that area and that if they had held onto  it, that potentially they could have made a lot of money. Was that  something that Angie ever mentioned to you?  She did mention this. The farm was just three miles south of Marshall,  where  I- 74 intersects with highway fifty-one, and you go a mile west.  It   s on the south side of the highway and Angie said that exactly, that  Mr. Debo sold the farm and moved to town. He had one of the produce  houses I was telling you about; buying and selling eggs and this was his  business. She said they discovered oil on the place, but she said,    You  know, I never heard my father make one complaint or one comment  about it.    Wasn   t bitter about it at all. Angie told me that one time.  Well, that   s a great attitude if you can do that. (Laughs)  It   s wonderful  That   s the reason Angie brought it up. It spoke very well  of Mr. Debo. By the way, a lot of people heard about Dr. Debo. I asked  Angie one time, I said,    Angie, should that be Debo   de-bo   or Deebo    dE-bo  ?    Of course, in German, you almost always pronounce the first  syllable positively. And she said,    Well, actually Pat, it ought to be  Deebo, but I guess Debo is alright.     8  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Right, and that   s what you hear more     And that   s why it should be Deebo, that   s what Angie told me.  But you hear the other pronunciation much more commonly in  Oklahoma.  You do, but Angie said I guess the other was alright. It didn   t feel that  important to her, but actually, if anyone ever asks you, I can give you the  information from the horses    mouth it   s Deebo.  Deebo. I think you should pronounce people   s names the way they want  them pronounced. So when did you first become acquainted with Angie?  What were the circumstances?  This is remarkable. It was when I was a sophomore in high school,  which would have been probably 1943, either    42 or    43. It was during  the Second World War. There was a teacher shortage because a good  many of the male teachers had been drafted into the armed services.  There were sixteen million people under arms at one time and Angie  was working in the library over at OSU, Oklahoma A M College at that  time, and they were short a history teacher. Out of pure patriotism,  Angie was always a great patriot of Marshall, Oklahoma. This was her  home and that was it. There was Marshall and then there was the rest of  the country. So Angie resigned, came over here and taught history in the  Marshall High School for a couple of years during the war just as a  patriotic duty.  Alright, at that time, it was mandatory that the first two years in high  school for the male students if you were a freshman or sophomore, you  must attend and enroll in vocational agriculture. I had the first year of it.  The next year was when Angie was back and she was teaching two  classes in history. The one was European History and to save my soul I  can   t remember what the other was. I don   t think it was Oklahoma  History, however. So I went to the school superintendent and I asked  him, I said,    Would there be any possibility of you making an exception  and letting me take two courses in history because Dr. Debo is going to  be teaching them, and relieve me from the obligation of being in  vocational agriculture?    He complied so very fortunately, and that is  where I became acquainted with Dr. Debo, taking two courses in history  the same year because I saw the opportunity. I have a copy of (I   ll show  it to you later) Prairie City that Angie gave me at that time and her  dedication in that book, she signed it,    To the boy who knows and loves  history.    Signed,    Angie.    So that   s how I became acquainted with Dr.  Debo.  9  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  I had actually heard that story before and I think that that   s really  remarkable that at that age of being a high school sophomore, when  most high school sophomores could care less about history, you saw this  as a wonderful opportunity.  Back about 1938, 1939, I was eight or nine years old, they had a library  here, it was called Will Rogers Memorial Library. At that time you had  the WPA  Works Progress Administration  and people always talked  about leaning on the shovel, you know, but it was also for intellectual  people. Angie worked on this program for writing the book about the  history of Oklahoma, The Guide to Oklahoma, that was WPA. They had  the library open here either two or three days a week and they paid an  old gentleman to be the librarian, WPA, and he had a college degree  from some college back in Tennessee. I forget which one it was. In those  days, a college degree was a much rarer item than it is now. So anyway,  I went down there, face hanging out, to look at this new library, you  know, and I   m eight or nine years old. This old gentleman, Walter Orr,  O-R-R, was his name, was the one that introduced me to decent  literature. I asked him,    Mr. Orr, what would you suggest?    and he  would say,    Why don   t you read this?    I   ll have you know that when I  was nine years old, I read Xenophon   s Cyropaedia. That was when I  was nine years old.  Years and years ago, I was looking in the north cemetery   that   s the one  two miles north of town where Angie   s buried. Mr. Orr   s buried up there  and I couldn   t find his stone and I inquired; the Odd Fellows at that time  had the cemetery. I said,    Is it a possibility that Mr. Orr is buried in an  unmarked grave?    They said,    Yes.    They showed me where it was. I  went to Enid and I bought a stone and I put in on his grave because I  thought,    You know, Mr. Orr, I owe you a debt. I owe you a debt I could  never repay.     What a wonderful thing   Certainly. I told Angie. She was just delighted about it.  Yes, that   s a great story. Did you have any siblings?  No ma   am, I   m an only child. I have never decided whether they took  one look and decided we can   t do any better than this, we better quit. Or,  whether they took one look and decided, oh God, we don   t want any  more like that  (Laughter) I   m afraid I know the answer.  I bet it was neither one. So you mentioned Prairie City and the fact that  you have an inscribed copy that says,    To the boy who loves history        10  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  Yes,    knows and loves history.        Knows and loves history.    That came out in 1944 and Angie called it  her gift to the community of Marshall. Do you remember anything  special happening in Marshall at the publication of that book?  No ma   am, I don   t.  I just wondered what the local reaction might have been to it.  The local reaction would have been,    Well, what do you know? Angie  has written this book about Marshall, and boy, this put Marshall on the  map.    I can think that a great many people in Marshall loved her with  affection, but I   m not too sure that very many of them appreciated her  intellectual capability, you know. This is the thing.  So they might not have been readers of her work, but they appreciated     All the people of Marshall   there   s not many of them left now, but most  of them knew Angie.    Oh, I know Angie.       Which book have you read  lately?     They   d  look at you like a tree full of owls and that   s it, you  know. They had no idea that anybody that lived in Marshall would have  their obituary in The New York Times.  Right. Also in 1944 her father passed away, Edward. Do you remember  anything about her parents, Edward and Lena?  Yes, I remember Mr. Debo, but just casually. I was acquainted with him,  that   s about the size of it. He was a rather   not a diminutive person, but  he was oh, probably five feet, eight, nine inches tall, stocky sort of a  person. I remember Angie   s mother, Lena, dark haired and tall and  slender and wore horn-rimmed glasses or something. But actually, as far  as being acquainted with either one of them, you ought to remember, I  was just a small boy and they were a year or two older than I was, you  know. So that   s about the size of it. I remember them by sight, but I  can   t say that I was acquainted with either one.  I want to go back to your being a student in Angie   s history classes as a  sophomore in high school.   I   m going to read this quote  from Shirley  Leckie in her book about Angie Debo  to you and see what you  remember about this. She said,    Hugh O   Neill, who later became her  neighbor, was one of her students. After the class discussed the  Protestant Reformation, Angie noted that they had studied the movement  from the Protestant point of view. There was another perspective. Since  O   Neill had been raised a Catholic she asked him to share his  interpretation so all sides would receive a hearing. In this way, she  11  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  taught her class that history depends not only on the facts in evidence  one marshals, but the position one takes and the questions one asks.     This is true. I remember very well that Angie had me stand up in front of  the class and give them the other side of the story.  How did you feel about that?  Oh, in those days, I was an unreconstructed Irish Catholic. I was glad to  convert these atheist Protestants, you know? (Laughs)  The heathens. (Laughs)  So I gave the information with enthusiasm. I remember that just like  yesterday.  I think that must have been a remarkable experience to have as a  teenager to realize     It was      yes, that history is usually told from the point of view of the victors but  there   s always some other side to the story.  It   s just like, of course I   m an unreconstructed Confederate, and the  Yankees always refer to the Civil War, and we always refer to it as the  War Between the States. There are two sides to it.  That   s right. Or in some places where it   s the War of Northern  Aggression. (Laughter)  Right   So, during the years that Angie wasn   t living in Marshall, those years  when she was over in Stillwater working at OAMC, did you have much  contact with her? You were still fairly young at that point.  No, I did not. I did not. The relationship really bloomed when Angie  moved back and resided permanently here in Marshall. Then she was at  the end of the block and what a wonderful opportunity and of course,  Angie remembered me from class and I remembered her from teaching.  And it just grew like top seed, but it did not really commence until she  came back. When she was working over at OSU, I had very little contact  with her.  So how did you initiate that? I   m assuming you were the one that  12  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  initiated it? That you just went down to her house to chat with her?  Well, you will remember now, Doctor, this is a little small town.  Everybody knows everybody. Unfortunately, you know everybody  else   s business and he knows yours. But anyway, I   m sure that what it  was, and I don   t remember exactly the first time, but I   m sure it was a  matter that we visited and I went down to ask her about something and  invited her up to the house and Angie came up and we had some dessert  or something and it just grew like top seed. I   ve always considered those  the most wonderful experiences of my life.  Oh, I   m sure. What a wonderful thing. In 1958, they had a recognition  day for Angie here in Marshall. Do you remember anything about that?  I do, it was remarkable. Yes, yes, yes. They had a big crowd. The high  school auditorium was full of people. Eisenhower was President, you  know. Some Republicans had sent word to the President, which you  could do if you were in the right party, and get a letter congratulating  somebody. So anyway, somebody had set it up that Eisenhower had sent  a letter to Angie Debo congratulating her and of course, Angie was  standing in front of the crowd. They made this presentation of this letter  from President Eisenhower. Angie laughed. Said,    Oh  Isn   t that  something  And I didn   t even vote for him     Right in front of  everybody. Of course, she   s just like I did. You know, we both voted for  Adlai Stevenson, you see. But I remember that like yesterday. She just  laughed and said,    I didn   t even vote for him      So did she seem to be really pleased by this recognition that the town  had for her?  I   m sure she was. Mona was a very perceptive person and Mona  commented that Angie   she didn   t mean this in any excessive way, but  Angie was just a little bit vain, maybe to the extent that maybe you and I  might be a little bit vain, we   d feel pleasurable if someone would  congratulate me about something or tell some third party that oh, he   s  not a bad fellow. I figured well, I   d feel pretty good about this. But to  me, when I say she   s vain, I don   t mean me and no one else; it   s just one  of those things. So I think Angie appreciated it. Yes, I think so.  So other than the speech and the gathering at the high school, do you  remember any other detail of the event?  No.  But it sounds like it would have been a pretty typical kind of recognition  event for that time period in a small town.  13  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Exactly. It would have been a very   yes, yes, yes.  I know that shortly after that, she was finally able to travel outside of the  United States. She went to Europe and I believe it was in that trip that  she finally went to Russia, a place that she had studied and had a great  fascination with. Do you remember hearing her talk about that?  Exactly. I can give you a very good anecdote. She was in Moscow and  of course, there is a huge library, like our Congressional library, the  equivalent in Moscow. Angie refused to go into the library and look at it  because it had censored books in there and she thought that any censored  library is not much of a library. She refused to honor it by her presence.  Very interesting.  I remember Angie telling me that just like it was yesterday.  Well I guess by that point she was considered a very unusual person for  Marshall, but my guess is there weren   t too many people from Marshall,  Oklahoma that were traveling to what was then the Soviet Union or  other eastern bloc countries.  No, most people went to Guthrie or Enid and considered it a victory.  (Laughter)  And then in 1960, she was able to travel to Mexico. One of the things  that I remember reading that fascinated her about Mexico was the fact  that it was a predominantly Catholic country, which would have been a  new experience for her. Did she ever discuss that with you, with your  background as a Roman Catholic?  No ma   am, she didn   t. This is probably digressing a bit from the intent  of the question, but she did not. But I can tell you one anecdote that she  told me about it. It   s rather indelicate. But anyway, Angie said that she  went to Mexico and they   d always been forewarned about     Montezuma   s revenge.    Alright, she had an attack of Montezuma   s  revenge and what caused it was this: she said she was very careful not to  drink the water, not to eat any fresh vegetables uncooked. She was being  very careful to avoid this malady, and what it finally turned out to be,  she had a glass there that she was drinking, I suppose bottled out of it or  something, but it turned out that the maid who was taking care of hotel  room was rinsing out this glass that she saw sitting there with tap water  and that   s what gave Angie Montezuma   s revenge. So anyway, that is  not very delicate, but that   s the one thing that I remember. Angie just  laughed. But as far as saying anything about them being in a Catholic  country, or a different culture   you know, if she did say anything, I  14  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  don   t remember.  I know that your wife was the one that told Angie that John F. Kennedy  had been assassinated and I don   t know if you went over there or she  came over here that evening, but that she had written in her diary that  one of the things that was comforting about that event was being able to  share it with such good friends. Do you remember anything about that  night?  I don   t. That   s a terrible thing that I don   t remember. I   ll tell you  something about that day though. My grandfather O   Neill was a life-long  Democrat. He used to say that,    I attended the first democratic  precinct meeting ever held in Marshall Township. I worked for the party  my entire life. If there are any political plums, I think I   m entitled to  them.    Alright, my father then spent a good many years as a  Secretary/Treasurer of Logan County Democratic Central Committee.  When my father died, they picked on me. I spent a good many years as  the Secretary/Treasurer of the Logan County Democratic Central  Committee. Alright, consequently, what do I receive in the mail one day  soon after the election when Kennedy was elected? A full color portrait  of not John Kennedy, but the Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson. So this is  fine. In those days, I was a convinced Democrat. I told Mona one day, I  said,    I   m going to Guthrie today and I think I   ll take Johnson   s picture  down there and find a frame for it and hang it.    This is the day John  Kennedy was assassinated. I went to Guthrie with Lyndon Johnson   s  picture. I didn   t have the radio on in the car. I came back and Mona told  me what had happened. I had gone to Guthrie with a picture of the Vice-  President of the United States and I came back with a picture of the  President of the United States. That actually happened. That   s the one  thing I remember. Maybe that   s why I don   t remember the other.  What an amazing coincidence.  That   s what I   ve often thought.  This is really digressing, but what was the reaction of the town of  Marshall to that event, do you recall?  Yes, I think probably shock and dismay. I   m sure that there were some  people that were dyed in the wool prejudice people   prejudice against  him   well, I mean the Republicans to start with, but prejudice against  him because of his religion. I can remember whenever John Kennedy  ran in 1960. It was unbelievable the anti-Catholic hysteria. Just like Al  Smith back in    28, same thing. So probably, there were a few people  who secretly thought,    Well, let that be a lesson to him.    But overall, the  reaction here I think was much like it was in the rest of the country. Just  15  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  the horror that they could imagine whoever he was, that the President of  the United States was assassinated.  I know that one of the things that happened as a result of Angie traveling  overseas is that she became interested in bringing international students  to the town of Marshall so that they could meet real Oklahomans. Do  you recall anything about some of those meet and greet opportunities  that she set up here in Marshall?  I don   t remember the lady   s name, but I remember one time one of the  student   s was from Hong Kong and she spent the night with us and  stayed here. The programs that Angie had for these students   Mona  could tell you, I couldn   t. Mona   s gone. But Mona was involved with  that and knew all about it and assisted with it in some way. I   m sorry I  can   t enlighten you. I don   t remember. I remember the occasion of it  going on. There were various students that came over. I do not  remember what programs Angie had for them. I   m awfully sorry.  That   s okay. I just thought that that was interesting that she saw the  value in doing something like that and     Yes, it is  It is. It   s just remarkable. I thought at the time it was and I  don   t remember how many came over, but it wasn   t just one or two. It  was quite a few students that she had over here.  Right. Yes, I   ve seen pictures of her with students over here at like a  dinner or something that looked like it might have been in a church  basement or a town hall or something like that.  Exactly.  In 1966, Angie finally was able to travel to Africa and to Egypt and one  of the things that Shirley Leckie recorded in that book is that you and  Ramona had paid for her side trip to Egypt and that she had brought  you a stone from the Valley of the Kings? I know that by this time you   re  really good friends, but how did that whole thing transpire?  Alright. I   m going to show you that stone this morning. I have it.  Anyway, Angie was sitting in the living room there and Mona was a real  chef. Mona was a cook par excellence of particularly fancy desserts and  when Angie would come up   I don   t know how often she would come  up. Probably at least twice a month, generally on some Sunday evening.  Sit in there, and we   d have dessert and Angie commented one time, she  said,    You know Pat, this is the only place we can be catty    and just  laughed. But anyway, while Angie was up here that evening, she was  telling us about her proposed trip to Africa and going through her  16  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  itinerary. She went to equatorial Africa first and worked her way back  up through Europe, and she mentioned she was going to be in Cairo. I  said,    Well, Angie, you   re certainly going to the Valley of the Kings.        Pat, you know, my budget only goes so far.    I said,    Angie, would you  have time?       Why yes.    I said,    What would it cost?    She knew what it  would cost. I just wrote her a check and handed it to her and I said,     Don   t let it ever be said that Pat O   Neill didn   t let Angie Debo go see  the Valley of the Kings.    So Angie laughed. She said,    Well thank you,  Pat.    She said,    What do you want me to bring you back from the Valley  of the Kings?    I said,    Angie, I want one pebble from King Tut   s tomb.     And she brought it back to me and I still have it. I   ll show it to you  directly.  That   s great.  I   m a dilettante really in a good many different things. One of those is  ancient Egyptian history. You could see my collection of books, so on  and so forth. I just couldn   t imagine anyone getting that close to King  Tut   s tomb and the Valley of the Kings and not being able to see it. So  anyway, she was delighted and that was it.  I thought this was kind of funny. In 1968, she started working on one of  her books, A History of the Indians of the United States, and according  to Shirley Leckie, she placed an ad in the newspaper asking people to  please not call her or call on her before noon. Do you remember that  and do you remember that she would get frequent interruptions with her  writing?  Well, she put this ad in the paper, I well remember. I   d forgotten. I  remember now that you   ve reminded me and most people, so Angie  said, abided by it and didn   t call her because they realized that she was  working. If there was any interruption that amounted to anything, I did  not hear her ever complain about it. She told me in years prior to this  when her dad was still living that when Angie was writing, she would  tell her mother,    I   m writing today,    and her mother would agree not to  interrupt her for any reason whatsoever. But she said,    My dad just  didn   t quite realize this.    When he would come home from the store,  why he   d visit with her, one thing or another, but she said,    He just  didn   t quite realize.    But she said,    My mother completely abided by it.  Just don   t interrupt me while I   m writing.    So her mother understood  this, but her dad didn   t quite understand that. She wasn   t complaining,  just told me. Said,    He just thought well, I don   t know what all that is. If  I want to talk to my daughter, I guess I can.     Well I think if you pursue what people sometimes call    the life of the  mind,    I think it   s really difficult for other people to understand what a  17  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  solitary process that is; that you need to have long periods of not being  interrupted.  Exactly, most people   the less intellectually gifted they are, the more  likely are not to realize this.  Right. Another thing that happened in 1968 is that you and Angie,  unbeknownst to each other I understand, received a questionnaire that  was sent out by the American Civil Liberties Union. Tell me what the  result of that was.  Alright. Angie and I were sitting right in there with Mona one Sunday  evening. Angie said something about the American Civil Liberties  Union, the ACLU, and I looked over at Angie, I said,    Do you mean to  tell me you belong to that communist outfit?    She looked over at me and  said,    I suppose you do, too?    I said,    I do,    and I showed her my card.  (Laughter) At that time, there wasn   t an Oklahoma affiliate of the  American Civil Liberties Union because it wasn   t that large of  membership. There was a representative. The representation was the  Reverend Frank Holmes, pastor of the First Unitarian Church of  Oklahoma City at Thirteenth and Dewey. Frank had a doctorate in  divinity from Harvard University; quality person. So if you had  problems, you could contact him.  They finally decided that they had enough membership to organize an  affiliate in Oklahoma. Angie was on the first board of the Oklahoma  affiliate of the ACLU and it was on her recommendation, probably the  most terrible thing that ever happened to the OCLU, I am the first  secretary of the Oklahoma Civil Liberties Union because Angie  recommended me for the job. It was a wonderful opportunity to become  acquainted with some fine people. Among other people I became  acquainted with as member of the board was Edith Harper, Edith  Gaylord Harper. Those kinds of people. So years after Angie died, Edith  established an annual award, the Angie Debo Award. I don   t remember  now what it   s for, I   m sure you   re aware of it. And there was a banquet  to celebrate this, I think to present maybe the first award or something.  And a man called me up and he told me, he said,    Mrs. Harper has asked  me to call you. She said I don   t remember the man   s name, but that man  introduced me to Angie Debo and I want you to invite him to the  banquet.    And like a damn fool, I didn   t go. But there you are.  So anyway, it   s kind of a small world, but that   s the kind of relationship  that Angie and I had, you see. However, I think I came   as this old  country farmer, maybe not as bad as I might expect. Frank Holmes, I  remember one time, was giving a report to the board and was  referencing the minutes and he said,    I like Mr. O   Neill   s minutes.    And  18  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  I thought,    Well, coming from Frank, I appreciate that.     I don   t know if you   re aware of this, you may be, but around 1990, Edith  Gaylord Harper funded the microfilming of the Angie Debo papers.  Somebody told me. I maybe overheard the amount. I   ve heard that it was   50,000, is that correct?  Yes,  55,000, that   s right. And she did some other things to help us. She  gave us a challenge grant so that we could raise money for our Women   s  Archives, of which the premier collection in that Women   s Archives are  the papers of Angie Debo, so I didn   t realize that their relationship  started with the ACLU in Oklahoma. That   s really interesting.  I introduced Angie to her.  That   s right. You   re the reason. So I guess we should   ve thanked you for  that gift too, that we got. (Laughter) Do you remember any of the  activities of the ACLU at that time that you and Angie were involved in?  Not really. There weren   t any earth-shaking things like Constitutional  questions or anything like that. It was a matter of maybe someone being  inadequately represented even in a criminal trial and such and so forth.  Or maybe their individual rights had been violated primarily in legal  transactions; you know the type of thing, maybe court proceedings, that  type of thing. I wasn   t on the board too long; two or three years,  something like that. I don   t remember, but there wasn   t any earth-shaking  Constitutional question that was interesting stuff at the time. I  remember that we had pretty open discussions at the board meetings,  uninhibited discussions is the word I   m trying to find. I was always a  conservative. I thought that the ACLU should concern itself to definite  violations of a person   s First Amendment rights, or definite violations of  his right to a fair trial or one thing or another. Whether it   s a matter of  civil liberties or not and capital punishment, I thought that is outside the  pale.  The ACLU, every once in a while, was taking issue with some religious  oppression or something. I   ve come to the point now to where I   m a  Jefferson Circle member of the Americans United, but I wasn   t at that  time and I   d always tell people on the board, my opinion is that may be  very well or may be a slight violation somewhere of someone   s rights,  but it   s not a matter of incarceration or not. I think maybe it   s better not  to stir some of these people up. You get them too stirred up and they   re  going to come out and it   s going to be even worse than it is now. Right  now, I will be all in favor of going after these people. So what I was  doing was advocating that, do the essential things, but let   s just don   t get  19  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  out into the area where maybe it   s politics or personal or general policy.  Whereas others were thinking we should do this. So what it was, I  represented the conservative opinion that we should restrain ourselves  from becoming involved in issues like capital punishment or gay rights  or that type of thing. I wasn   t interested in some gay person being unable  to marry and that was violating his right. I was interested in some person  being arrested and being coerced by the police and unjustly imprisoned,  that type of thing. But, one thing we did, a whole bunch of us, we agreed  to disagree.  That was going to be my next question actually. It sounds like you and  Angie may have been involved in conversations where you didn   t have  the same point of view, so what was that like? Was she gracious in  agreeing to disagree?  Angie was a pure, pure intellectual and you can agree to disagree and if  we ever had a disagreement, it was always on the most friendly, friendly,  friendly basis. There   s only one thing that I never let Angie know and  I   ll just lay it out. At that time, I was a racist of the first type. And of  course, she would be interested in the rights of the coloreds, so on and so  forth, and at that time, I just didn   t say anything. So there you are, but  outside of that, if we disagreed on anything   alright, this will give you  an example. I told Angie one day, I said,    You know, I   ve been a life-long  democrat.    But I said,    I   ve changed my registration to  independent. I   m so sick and tired of the       I said,    I was involved with  politics in Logan County for so long I saw the petty backstabbing and so  on and so forth and personal aggrandizement and this type of thing that I  became so disgusted with them that I thought,    well, plague on both your  houses.       I said,    I realize that you give up your right to vote in the  primary.    That   s the only thing, but I said,    Still, as a matter of principle  I   m done.     So we got to talking about the elections and voting for people for public  office and I commented, I said,    There are times, Angie, I   m so  disgusted with the people on both tickets that I just don   t feel like  voting.    I   ll never forget what she told me. She said,    Pat, you always  have to vote for the lesser of evils.    She said,    One of them is going to  be elected and you have to vote for at least the lesser of evils.    I said,     Angie, you   re probably right.    But I said,    I just once, Angie, would  like to be able to go to the polls and vote for someone in place of just  voting for the lesser of evils.    Angie laughed. She said,    I know how  you feel.     By the way, this might be of interest to you. We were discussing one  time who was the worst president the United States had ever had. Angie  said it was either Ulysses S. Grant or Warren Harding, and so help me  20  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  God, I can   t remember which one was the worst. It was either Harding  or Grant. But I remember she said Grant was so terribly corrupt. I   m  inclined to believe, and this is purely surmised, she may have said that  Grant was even worse than Harding, but I   m not sure. So anyway, I  can   t tell you who Angie thought was the worst president, but I can tell  you who she thought the two worst were.  Well, I don   t know if you saw this firsthand, but I had heard that when  the ACLU would send a speaker out that frequently they sent Angie and  that people were really surprised when the sweet, little old lady showed  up from the ACLU. Were you ever a part of a crowd where she had been  sent to speak and did she connect with that kind of audience? Do you  think that because she did not have that rebel rousing type of demeanor  that people responded to her arguments and her line of thought?  I think so. I think very definitely so. I think that in the first place, when  she went to these meetings, probably the personnel at the meetings were  probably a little bit more intellectually capable than the people you meet  on the street and I think that they soon saw, whenever she made her first  few remarks, that she obviously was a person of quality and intellectual  capability and I think that they definitely connected with her. Yes, I  think so. I think so. In other words, it wasn   t a matter of her speaking  above their head or anything like that. I think, yes, they were simpatico.  I also wondered if it was just that she wasn   t what they were expecting,  that that also may have changed some people   s minds that   you know,  she looked like maybe an aunt or a grandmother rather than some  radical that they had envisioned in their heads.  Doctor, I just couldn   t tell you because if I told you it would be purely  surmised on my part. I don   t feel like that I can honestly tell you. I don   t  know.  So I know in 1974 that she sort of had a parting of ways with the ACLU  and it was related to their decision to use bingo as a fundraising  activity. Do you recall anything about that?  No, I don   t, but it sounds like Angie alright. Angie was raised a  Methodist. And she always used to talk about taking the pledge and until  the day she died, no liquor. And so I can imagine that bingo would   ve  been along the same line.  No gambling, huh?  Yes. A good friend of mine, she was born in 1946   she   s a widow.  She   s being remarried the twenty-fourth. She lost her husband about  21  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  seven years ago and another fellow   they knew them about all their  lives   nice, compatible deal. But anyway, they   re being married in  Hennessy. That   s where she lives as does her future husband to be. And  they   re being married in the   I don   t remember which church in  Hennessey; probably where he belongs. They   re having the reception     of course, the marriage itself just for, they all have grown children   and  then for the reception, I   m invited. They   re having it in the parish hall of  the local Catholic Church over there. So this is all very fine. Well, I had  to laugh because Janet   I know her real, real well. Mona and I and her  husband were all friends for years and years and years. So anyway, she  and her former husband belonged to the Methodist church in Enid.  That   s where she still goes. He is the one that   s coming down to  Hennessey to marry them. They   re having their reception in the parish  hall of the Catholic church over there in Hennessey for this reason:  they   re going to have champagne and wine and whiskey and you  couldn   t have this in a Methodist institution, so although that preacher is  coming down from Enid to marry them, they   re having to have the  reception in Hennessey so they can have a little liquor without violating  the Methodist regulation. This is funny.  It is. (Laughs) We   ve spent a little bit of time talking about Angie   s  involvement with the ACLU. I know starting in the late sixties, she began  to take a real interest in not just the historical Native Americans, but  their current plight today and she became involved, like with what  became the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Were you part of her  network of people that worked on these issues?  No. I was vaguely aware of it. Mona was very intimately involved with  it, but not actively, I don   t think. I mean it   s the type of thing, Angie  would be up here, we   d discuss it and she   s doing this and we   d discuss  it, but as far as actively helping write people and so on and so forth, no  ma   am.  Okay. Well I know it became a big part of her life and     It did. I remember her being involved with these people in Kotzebue   Alaska  and what have you. And what   s the name of the northernmost  port in     Barrow?  Barrow, yes. She was at Barrow. I remember her talking about that, very  much so.  I saw a certificate (in fact, I think we have it framed in the Angie Debo  Room) that shows that she flew over the North Pole, I think as part of  22  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  that trip.  That   s one I didn   t know. I don   t remember if I did. Hallelujah, you   re  telling me something new   Well, I just thought it was interesting. It was one of those relics that was  presented by the airline and now no airline has that kind of customer  service anymore where they would do something like that.  I remember Angie used to take the local newspaper from Kotzebue, The  Tundra Times.  She had it delivered here?  Oh yes. Oh yes, she took the weekly, The Tundra Times, to see what was  going on in Kotzebue.  Okay, very interesting.  This is true; The Tundra Times, yes.  Her interests spanned far and wide.  She had a catholic interest in almost everything.  Yes. Well, just a very curious mind.  Well, catholic I mean with a small    c,    yes.  Right. What do you remember about what Angie referred to as her     public hanging   ? Having her portrait hung in the Capitol?  Oh  I can remember very well whenever Charles Banks Wilson was  coming over here to paint it. Of course, I was never down there when he  was doing this because I didn   t want to interrupt, but I knew when he  came down. He spent quite a few different days coming over here to  paint. So anyway, when it came time to hang her portrait in the rotunda  of the Capitol down there, a good many people from Marshall went and  I   ve often thought these people   she   s a local celebrity and boy, it   s  Angie Debo, Miss Angie and so on and so forth   we   re going to go  down and all that. And I know not one of them had ever read one of her  books or probably couldn   t read them at any rate. But anyway, they were  all down there and this is good and Angie always referred to it as her     hanging   , her    public hanging    and you   d just laugh.    That   s my public  hanging   . Yes, I remember that very well, very well. I was there.  23  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Well, I   ve seen pictures of the day and she had this really wide smile on  her face.  She was absolutely delighted. Just thrilled, delighted. I think  it was  one  of the greater events of her entire life. Well, you can imagine, she was  finally receiving the recognition that she had worked so hard for for so  many years and had been denied it. Finally, she was receiving the  recognition that she was entitled and should   ve had in years past. But I  think Angie was delighted.  Well, it seemed like in the last ten years of her life the recognition sort of  poured in. Pretty much it looked like several times a year at least that  she was receiving some award. And I know one of the awards, since  we   re on that topic, that she received right at the end of her life was  Governor Bellmon came over and presented her with the Award of the  Distinction of the American Historical Association     The Outstanding Scholar.  And that she was the first woman to ever receive that award. Were you  part of that gathering at her home?  Oh, absolutely. It wasn   t at her home. Her home is small, you see.  Raymond Bryson, who was the executor of her estate whenever she  died, lived in the west part of town. He had a large home out here.  That   s where it was. Of course, Mona and I were invited and there was  probably fifteen, twenty other people and Governor Bellmon drove up  here and presented it to her because she wasn   t able anymore at her age  to go someplace for the presentation. He drove up here and presented it  to her in Raymond Bryson   s living room. I remember that very, very  well.  Do you remember anything that she had to say at the time?  Not really, no. It just seems to me that she made a comment like she did  about Eisenhower. I think she told Henry Bellmon, thanked him so much  for him coming but she hadn   t even voted for him. But I   m not sure  anymore. I may be making that up, but I kind of think she said that to  him, but I wouldn   t swear to it.  I think she told him that he was the only republican she ever voted for.  Maybe that   s the way it was  Alright, maybe that   s    Oh, you talk about  a dyed in the wool democrat  Angie was, you know. Of course, not  particularly I don   t think democrat, but she was just a dyed in the wool  liberal. And it so happens that most democrats were liberals, outside of  24  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  Huey Long. (Laughter)  I know that Angie had a lot of frustrations in her work. For example, I  remember reading about one instance where she had had an article  commissioned by the American Heritage magazine to write an article on  Geronimo and then the focus of the magazine changed. The editorial  board changed. When she submitted the article, the editor said,    We   re  not interested in this anymore    and sent her a small check for her  trouble and that eventually did become the start of her research on her  book on Geronimo, but it seemed like she had a lot of frustration in her  work. Did she ever talk about that?  Occasionally she would mention it. Like, as an occurrence when it  happened, but never, ever, ever, ever bitter about it, or complaining  about it, if that   s what you   re trying to find out. No, she wouldn   t say,     Oh, now look what they   ve done to me now.    No, no, no. She would  just tell me what happened then   well, it   s unfortunate. That was it.  Sort of very matter of fact about it?  Exactly. That   s the word: matter of fact, that   s it. I don   t think I   ve ever  a single time heard Angie actually complain about something. I suppose  little old things like maybe when we needed some rain and it didn   t, but  as far as anything that affected her livelihood or professional work, I  don   t think ever. By the way, you mentioned in the last few years of her  life, she was commencing to get awards that she should have had in her  life before. Also, finally, the money started coming in from her royalties  and one thing and another. She wasn   t a rich woman like somebody like  Sarah Palin, for instance, but she finally had enough money coming in  that she could live comfortably and didn   t have to worry about the  grocery bills. Most of her life, you know, she had to live very, very  frugally and was just barely making it and she told me one reason that  she left all of her research materials to OSU   you want to remember she  has her doctorate from OU.  Right.  You know what Angie told me one time? Said,    I left it to OSU because  they gave me a job when I needed it.     I know she was very appreciative of that.  And that   s why you have her. One of the reasons  Right, and she got her summers off to do research with a full salary.  25  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  Oh really?  Yes, I think that that was highly unusual for that time.  Ah-ha  Wonderful, wonderful.  It was a great investment in someone.  Yes, it was   Well, I had a question that I was going to ask you later on, but you gave  me the perfect segue into that. I know sort of by necessity and by  temperament that Angie was a very frugal and scrupulously honest  person and like, for example, I had heard that even when she was really  having difficulty making ends meet, if she had unexpended funds from a  grant that she would return those to a granting organization. Are there  other examples you   re aware of of this waste not, want not philosophy  that she seemed to have?  Could you clarify the question just a little bit further?  Well, I guess examples of her frugality. I   m not looking for something  that   s an unflattering example.  All I know is that she was very frugal and watched her expenses. She  had to. I can   t give you any particular example of it but I can say this.  Back in 1940, she bought a refrigerator from Montgomery Ward. We  used to call it    Monkey Ward.    And until the day she died, she still had  this same 1940 model Montgomery Ward refrigerator. She laughed one  day and told me this and this is the truth. You   ll find it hard to believe,  but it   s true. That had been so good. Mind you, since 1940, she had  never even replaced the light bulb inside that refrigerator. It was still  working. But that will give you some idea that whenever she got  something and it worked, she wasn   t the type that had to keep up with  the Jones    and buy something new just for the idea. If she bought  something and it was serving the purpose, so be it. So I can tell you that.  That will give you some idea of how frugal she was. But as far as being  tightfisted or miserly, anything but that.  Right, no. And I never got that impression from anything that I knew  about her. She was very generous. I know that your wife typed a  manuscript for Geronimo, and I don   t know if that was the only book  that she was involved in in that way, but Angie said that it was really  Ramona   s perceptiveness, that she was almost a co-collaborator in the  work. Do you know much about that and how that working relationship  came to be?  26  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Well, in the first place, Angie had the highest respect for Mona   s  intellectual powers. Ramona was a highly intelligent person and one  thing led to another because we had our semi-weekly discussions, so on  and so forth, over coffee and dessert and these discussions went into a  great many things such as Angie   s books, her philosophy, so on and so  forth. They weren   t talking about the price of cattle and the price of  wheat and is it going to rain tomorrow or not. So that gave Angie good  insight into Mona   s capabilities. And then whenever she was   you  know, I   ll be honest with you, I don   t remember for sure whether Mona  typed more than one manuscript or not. Of course, she typed the  manuscript for Geronimo. I   m not sure whether she typed another  manuscript or not, may have.  Among other things, Angie went to Fort Sill to do research, you see.  Mona   s the one that took her. So that   s the thing. And I don   t remember  which book it was   I   ll bet it was on that one alright that Mona was  typing the manuscript and she came across a phrase that didn   t quite suit  Mona. She asked Angie,    Angie, do you want to say this?    Angie looked  at it,    Oh no.    So Angie used to laugh and say,    Well, Ramona caught  me one time.    So it was that type of a relationship. It wasn   t just a matter  that she sat there and mindlessly typed it. So like Angie said, she was  almost a collaborator. It was that way. You have missed the greatest  opportunity in the world that you didn   t get to meet Mona.  Yes, I   m really sorry.  She had forgotten more than I   ll ever know about anything.  Well, I   m glad you   re here and we can talk to you. In October of    76,  Angie had surgery for colon cancer and it seemed like she spent a lot of  her time after that in either discomfort or actual pain. Do you recall her  philosophy towards these physical struggles that she had to deal with?  I don   t think she ever verbalized it. I can tell you, it didn   t seem to make  any difference at all in her public activities or her private relationship  with us. If she had pain and discomfort, you couldn   t discover it. I  remember that the surgery was done in the Stillwater hospital and the  doctor told us that whenever they removed the deal he showed us how  large it was, and he said,    Ordinarily we don   t expect to excise all of it.     But he said,    At her age, something else will kill her before it does.    So  as far as I know, it certainly wasn   t what killed her. But whether it  actually caused her any real discomfort   if it did, she didn   t let on about  it. That   s all I can say. She didn   t let on. So as far as anything obvious is  concerned, she made a full and complete recovery from it and it was no  longer giving her any problem. But whether it was or not, she was  keeping it very well concealed. She was not the type of person to wear  27  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  her heart on her sleeve. She wouldn   t go around and do like I do and  comment,    Oh, my back hurts today,    or    I   m hurting.    You never heard  a word out of Angie. If she was suffering, it was suffering in silence.  So were you the one that took her over for her surgery and brought her  back over here?  Yes.  So you were really her family towards     Oh yes, we were  That   s right, we were that close.  Yes, it sounds like it.  Yes, we were. But, I remember whenever I   this was in the wintertime,  I don   t remember   there were two or three different times I took her  over to the hospital, so I don   t remember if this was the time she had the  cancer surgery or not, but I do remember one time she was in the  hospital and I was bringing her back and it was in January or February,  dead of winter, and there   d been a terrific ice storm; however, the  highways were clear, but it was one of those storms where all the trees  just looked like a fairyland out there. We were coming back and I was  never so surprised in my life. I looked out there and I said,    Boy, Angie,  isn   t that beautiful?    You know what she said?    I don   t think so.    I said,     You really don   t?       No.     So I mentioned that to Mona later, I said,    I cannot believe that.    You  know what Mona said? She said,    I think maybe her eyesight is failing  and she doesn   t see so well.    Alright, I can elaborate a little bit on that.  Angie was interested in astronomy. She told me when she first went to  the university that she was interested in possibly pursuing astronomy,  but she said,    I soon found out that it had a great deal of mathematics  involved with it,    which she didn   t feel capable of, so that was the end  of her astronomy, but she had a life-long interest in it. Angie and I used  to discuss the constellations and all this, and you can see my telescopes  and what have you, and whenever she would go home, when she was up  here, I would always go out to the front gate with her and she walked a  block south and when she left her house, she would leave her porch light  on, knowing that when she came back it would be even darker and she   d  have the porch light. I would watch her walk down there until she got up  inside the house and turned that porch light off. Then I knew Angie was  safely home.  Mona told her one time, mentioned I was doing it.    You mean Pat   s  doing that?    She said,    Yes, he does that all the time.    It didn   t matter if  28  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  it was cold or snowing or what have you, I did it. But we would go out  there and sometimes you   d have the most beautiful clear sky. I said,     Angie, would you just look at the stars.       Oh yes  Wonderful     You  know what   s funny? She told Mona one time,    I never let Pat know, but  I can   t see the stars anymore.    She wouldn   t let me know it. So that   s  quite possible that may be the reason Mona made that comment.  Right. Oh, that   s sad though. Again, going back to Shirley Leckie   s  book, I heard from that book that once you were recovering from a  serious illness and that Angie brought you what sounds like a pretty  unique gift. Would you talk about that?  Alright, you better believe it  It was when I had my first heart surgery.  I   ve had three bypass surgeries, would you believe it or not? I   ve had  nine bypasses and I   m still here. Oh boy   And you look really healthy.  Well, thank you. Anyway, I was in the hospital and of course, still in the  hospital recovering after the surgery; she went to all this trouble to take  little pieces of cellophane and little old tiny pieces of paper like this   I  wish I could remember some of the exact examples, but there were little  aphorisms, humorous aphorisms. Something from Mark Twain,  something from Irvin S. Cobb, that type of thing. Wrapped each one of  these up and put a rubber band around it and put them in a little old  bottle with the instructions:    Take one daily.    And each day, I would  take one out and read it and laugh. Angie did that, absolutely. Sure did. I  remember laughing like yesterday.  And now they say that laughter is a good cure for what ails you, so she  was way ahead of her time.  Yes, she was  Yes. But I remember that like yesterday.  Well, I just thought that was wonderful.  It is wonderful   So again, pulling a quote from Shirley Leckie   s book, she quoted you as  saying,    There is the right way, the wrong way and the Angie way of  doing things,    inferring maybe that she was very methodical and set in  her ways. Can you give me any examples?  Alright, alright. The quotations list is not quite complete.    There   s the  right way, the wrong way, the Army way, and the Angie way.    And in  the Army you do it the Army way and with Angie, you did it the Angie  29  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  way. An example: Angie loved to raise roses and right north of her  house she had some nice roses. Well Mona and I got into the business     of course, you know the place looks like the devil now, but when Mona  and I were able to do it, we had beautiful rose gardens around here you  wouldn   t believe. And of course, in the process, if you   re going to have  those, you have to learn how to do it. And I would suggest this to Angie,     We ought to spray with this or do this,    and    Oh yes, that   s fine.    But  I   d go down there, she hadn   t done it because that is not the way Angie  did it. That   s the way we   re going to do it. Of course, I never said  anything. She was not set in her way to the point of being offensive  about it, but she was just kind of like I am. I like to do things because  that   s the way Grandpa did them. I live in the past too so maybe we were  just a little bit sympathetic with each other on that. But oh yes, that   s  right. Once she made her mind up a certain way to do something, that   s  just the way she did it.  I thought it was interesting that one of the ideas that Angie frequently  expressed in the latter part of her life was this idea that our treatment of  Native American people was a matter of national good faith. Is that an  idea that you all ever discussed?  Oh yes, I think so. We   d talk about her interest in the   not just a matter  of the books that she   s written about them, but the efforts that she made  for the rights of the Native Americans. She had the longest, largest  mailing list you can imagine   probably you   ve seen it   that she  corresponded with, even when she was eighty and ninety years old. She  corresponded with these people every time something of interest would  come up to affect the Native Americans, whether it was a policy of the  Indian Affairs Bureau or whether it was possible legislation and you  would start sending out these   I think there were thirty, forty some-people     and urging them to do this. Angie was interested this whole  time and yes, we talked about it very, very often. That was sort of a  compelling thing with Angie: to see justice for the right of the Native  Americans.  Well, I know that she produced a newsletter that was basically Xeroxed  and then sent to her mailing list and I wondered in her later years how  she was able to do that. Was that something that Ramona would help her  with?  No, I don   t think so. I don   t believe Mona helped her with that. How she  was doing it, I couldn   t tell you. I wish I could.  I know that throughout your friendship with Angie, you were a source of  emotional support and encouragement for her. Did she do the same  thing for you?  30  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Well, I think I   ve already given you one example about those    take one  everyday    notes.  Right.  Well yes, certainly. I remember that whenever I went to Oklahoma City  for my first heart surgery in 1982   that was this time with the notes, you  know   Mona told me how concerned Angie was. She said,    You know  sometimes, Mona, they don   t wake up.    So Mona told her that I was  making it alright. She said,    Oh, Angie was so relieved and delighted.     Well, I know you had that one really wonderful example of that but I just  wondered if that was just a stand out example of the way that she always  was towards you. I mean, it sounds like your friendship was so genuine.  Exactly. Mona   s and my relationship with Angie was not an  acquaintance at all. It was a friendship of the deepest type. I can never  forget, you know they did this   I forget the title of it, but the PBS        Indians, Outlaws, and Angie Debo.     Yes, alright, yes   I have a copy of it here. But you know, I have never  witnessed it. You know why? It   s just now getting to the point where I  could witness it and watch it and handle myself. I always have felt that if  I saw Angie talking, it was going to get to me, you know. But anyway,  that very morning that she became ill with her final illness, they had  made an arrangement with Raymond Bryson   s home out here   it   s the  larger place. And I wasn   t going. I don   t know whether I was invited or  not, but I wasn   t going. They were going to have this showing for Angie.  This was a pre-television showing. Angie had not seen it, but they had  the thing and they were going to have it out supposedly on a video  viewer or something and going to have this showing for Angie. She  became sick that very morning and wasn   t able to see it. They took her  to the hospital in Enid. I was out of town on business of some kind. I  came back and Mona told me, said,    Angie   s in the hospital.    I said,    Oh  boy, is that right? Need to get a ride up to see her.    So it was after  supper. Around here, I   m still a farmer, we have dinner and supper, not  lunch and dinner.  So anyway, after supper, I went up there. Angie was in the bed. I walked  up to her and said,    Hi, Angie.    She looked up at me and she said,     Pat?    You know, she always called me    Pat.    To my wife and my very  close Army buddy friends and Angie, it   s always    Pat.    Everybody else  that knows me, it   s    Hugh    but if you   re very intimately acquainted, it   s     Pat.    She always called me    Pat.    I went in. She said,    Pat, I know  you   ve come up here a long ways to see me, but I   m afraid I   m going to  31  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  have to ask you to leave.    My jaw dropped like that and I said,    Well,  alright, Angie.    I reached down and kissed her     And that was the last time you saw her.  I left and she died that night.  Why do you think Angie loved Marshall so much?  That   s a good question. Why would anybody? (Laughter)  Well, I never had the advantage of seeing it in its heyday, but you said  earlier when we first started talking that there was Marshall and there  was the rest of the world for Angie. What was so special about this place  for her?  I really don   t know. Angie came here when she was ten years old. She  came here in either    98,    99, or 1900. But of course, she went to school  here and went to church here, so on and so forth and she was baptized  here   I   ll go into that in a minute. But it just became   I couldn   t tell  you why, but it was one of those things that it just became engrained  with her that this was her roots and always I think, if you ask Angie  where home was, it was never in Stillwater, it wasn   t in the Texas  panhandle. It was Marshall, Oklahoma. And as to why it became this  way, I don   t know. But she never spoke of it. I don   t think she thought it  was necessary. Just,    I   m from Marshall,    and that was it and everybody  realizes this. And as far as she was concerned, wherever she was, she  was Angie Debo from Marshall, Oklahoma. Why? I couldn   t tell you.  This may be of interest to you. You know the street that goes right on  the east side of my house is Oklahoma Avenue. The street that goes on  the north side of my house east and west is known as Lake Street. And  Angie said,    You go straight west      right at the west edge of Marshall  was a large lake at that time and the street was right   if you went clear  out there would go to the lake, so they named it Lake Street. Alright, you  go to the northwest part of town, and there was just a little old kind of a  path that went from the street that goes on the north side of Marshall  down through this pasture to this lake. And that is where Angie was  baptized. One Sunday, they all went down there and of course they  baptized her by immersion. You know, it would make you a better  Christian if you   re wet all over, I guess. But whether they immersed or  her or just sprinkled her, I don   t know which it was. But anyway, they  took her out to the lake to be baptized and that   s where she was baptized.  Now I   ve got another story to tell you to go along with her religious  stuff, but you   ll laugh about this. This is fascinating. Two blocks north  32  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  of my house here, you go down through a little hollow. The street is nice  and straight, you go two blocks north and then there   s a little hollow at  the intersection, and then it goes back up again. Alright, when Marshall  was founded, it was founded about a quarter of a mile north of where it  is now. You may not be aware of this. They called it Old Marshall and  then the fellow that homesteaded this quarter section here sold it to  developers and they platted it where Marshall is now and they were  probably in cahoots with the railroad. The railroad came down here.  They should   ve built the depot up there where the town was already. Oh  no  They built the depot down here where it was platted and if you  wanted a railroad, you   re going to have to move the town down there.  Believe that or not, that   s what they did  So anyway, they moved  everything down here, and the Methodist church to which Angie  belonged at that time is just right caddy-corner across the intersection  from Angie   s house down there. The building still stands there. It isn   t  much of a building anymore. Angie used to say,    I think that   s the oldest  building in Marshall,    because that Methodist church was in Old  Marshall and they moved it down here to where it is now.  Here   s the best part of the story. Angie told me that they were moving  this thing on Saturday and they got as far as that low place in the road  two blocks north of here on Saturday night and weren   t going to move it  until the following Monday. They weren   t going to do any of that type  of thing on Sunday. Angie attended Sunday school in that church in the  middle of the road two blocks north of here. (Laughter) Told me that  herself. That   s the truth if I ever told it  Yes. Every time I drive through  that street up there, I laugh. I can just see Angie going to Sunday school  up there. How old Angie would have been at the time, I don   t know.  Grade school, I   m sure. That   s the truth. She used to tell that and just  laugh.  What a funny story   Yes, well that   s a true story.  I know that after Angie   s death you received at least one letter of  condolence from her friend Dr. James Scales. Did you receive other  letters of condolence?  That is the extent of it, I think. Dr. James R. Scales was one of the finest  people in this world. Another one of those people, Mona and I had the  opportunity   living in a place like this, no intellectual facilities or  anything, you know   we met so many fine people just like   alright,  look at your position at the university. I   m having this opportunity to  visit with you. Ordinarily, I   d be lucky to find some guy that raised  wheat across the road from me, you know. So anyway, Dr. Scales at the  33  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  time, he used to be the president of Oklahoma Baptist University at  Shawnee and this time, when we became acquainted with him, he was  the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at OSU, and ended up as  the president of Wake Forest University. Alright. I   ll never forget one  Sunday, Angie invited Mona and I and Dr. Scales and Mrs. Scales down  at Angie   s for Sunday dinner. First time I met them, or Mona. Angie was  famous for her dumplings. She could make the best chicken and  dumplings any human I have ever seen. Just flake. And so anyway, why  that was just fine. Alright, this is leading up to the point, getting this  letter from Dr. Scales. He said that he had read in The New York Times  that Angie had died. That   s when he was president of Wake Forest. He  was eating dinner in the cafeteria at Wake Forest and among other  things, they had chicken and dumplings on the menu and he said,    I ate  chicken and dumplings out of memory for Angie.    And that   s the truth if  I ever told it.  That   s a nice story.  Oh, I   ll tell you about one time. Dr. Scales was here and he and his wife  had never seen a hockey game. And you wouldn   t think you   d have  hockey here, you know, but for a while, they had a hockey team in  Oklahoma City and I remember Mona and I and Dr. Scales went down  and saw a hockey game.  Well it   s interesting the people, as you said, that have come across your  path.  You go by here and you see this old bald-headed Irishman in the middle  of nowhere. You know what my father used to call this?    Poverty Flats,  Pennsyltucky.    (Laughter) But, you know, I   ve had a wonderful  opportunity to know a lot of wonderful people, almost all of them  traceable to Angie. She was a wonderful thing in our life.  Well, it   s amazing how one individual can have such a profound  influence in someone   s life.  That   s right. It is just a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing.  Yes. So, she   s been gone for twenty-two years     1988, yes.  So as you   ve pondered about your friendship and thought about her over  the years, what are the things that really stand out in your mind that are  the essence of Angie Debo?  34  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  So many things. She was such a wonderful person. I have never heard  Angie gossip about anyone maliciously at all. I have never known her to  make a derogatory statement of any degree against any person at all.  You know, there must have been people that Angie didn   t like. If that  was the case, you didn   t hear it. She was a person of absolute integrity.  If Angie told you something, that was the end of it. You knew it was  right. She was a person of a very genteel personality, refined, and the  thing that I probably   and Mona too, I think I   m speaking for Mona, as  well   the thing that probably attracted us to Angie more than anything  else was her intellect. You could never visit with Angie that you didn   t  feel like you came away with something you didn   t know previously.  She was such a wonderful, fine   a lady of the old school. Refined,  mannerly, highly intelligent, caring, compassionate. I don   t think I could  find enough words to completely describe what a fine person she was,  but probably the main thing was her intellect. Because she   d come up  here and honest to goodness, we could have discussions about this and  that that the rest of the people in town probably wouldn   t have known  what we were talking about. And that   s the type of thing   probably her  intellect more than anything else, but aside from that, she was such a  fine person. Civic minded. You know, if it was good for Marshall, it was  good for Angie and vice versa.  So what you   re trying to do is pin me down on one thing, and I think  probably it was her intellect. I don   t think I ever visited with Angie I  didn   t come away feeling like I learned something and Mona, I   m sure,  would tell you the same thing. She was a wonderful, grateful person. I  don   t care what you did for Angie, she was just totally grateful and  would make you think you   re the most wonderful person in the world  for doing this for her. I simply can   t find the superlatives to completely  tell you.  We   ve talked about a lot of different things and I feel like I   ve not even  scratched the surface of your relationship with Angie, but is there  anything that you wish that I had asked you about or that you want to  tell me about that I haven   t asked you today?  No. I could tell you this. Probably it   s in Shirley Leckie   s book, but  when Angie received her doctorate from OU, she applied for a job  teaching and they wouldn   t hire her because she was a woman, this  prejudice. She used to speak of Dr. Dale very highly, but she said,    I  know that when I applied for this job that he spoke against me.    She told  me that herself, but I think probably Shirley Leckie has it in her book. In  other words, she was so grateful to him as a mentor, but still, when it  came down to it, his prejudice against women in the teaching profession  prevailed. But she made that statement strictly as a statement of fact  without the least hint of resentment. I don   t think I could have done that.  35  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  I could   ve said,    Oh, the old son of a buck did so and so,    but with  Angie, that was it. She used to talk about her time out at Panhandle  A M out at Canyon, Texas quite a lot. I remember that Mona and I had  gone to visit some friends in Scottsdale, Arizona one time and we came  back and were telling Angie all about going through Flagstaff. Of  course, we went out to the Grand Canyon. And to Angie   s way, she did  not have any desire whatsoever to see the Grand Canyon because she  had seen Palo Duro Canyon, and that was the end of it. If you   d seen  Palo Duro, there   s no need to go to Arizona. That   s the truth if I ever  told it.  Well, she missed out.  Yes, though she didn   t think so. She didn   t think so.  I know that there were hard times for her at West Texas A M. Did she  ever dwell very much on that?  Dr. Leckie, I think, says in there that Angie never went into any detail  with anyone about the actual circumstances. You know, she was  terminated out there. And Dr. Leckie said that she never went into any  depth of explanation about it and she never did to us either. Whatever  happened, she apparently took it to the grave with her. Of course, we  knew about it, but then she never   we knew about it just about as much  as Dr. Leckie did. Dr. Leckie was up here quite a bit and we were sitting  in there   in those days, I didn   t have my telescopes in the way and we  weren   t recording so she could sit there comfortably on the sofa taking  shorthand notes. But she said Angie never went into any detail with her  or anyone else as far as she could tell.  Well actually, I   ve read Dr. Leckie   s book,  Angie Debo: Pioneering  Historian,  several times and I was looking carefully at her bibliography  and I did notice that she had been here and had interviewed you in  preparation of her manuscript, so     Yes, Mona and I both.     you   re recollection of that interview is that she took notes and that she  wasn   t recording like     Oh no, didn   t ever record it. You know, I remember that I mentioned in  the note that I wrote to you, which you said you finally received  yesterday   the one I sent in the mail Christmas, you know. She took all  of this down and sort of had notes and one thing or another. There was  no recording deal because I mentioned in my note to you that I would  probably be somewhat inhibited not being used to it, and that   s one of  36  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  the reasons. I think I   ve been recorded maybe once or twice and that was  for a deposition in a lawsuit or something like that.  Well I hope this was a little bit less painful than a legal deposition.  Considerably less, Doctor. (Laughter)  Good  Well, actually what I was interested in about those interviews is  that Dr. Leckie very generously deposited her manuscript with us for  this book and then     I didn   t know that.  Yes, and then I saw that she had done these interviews and the  interviews aren   t part of that and I thought, I wonder where those  interviews are? I was thinking that maybe they were recorded on an  audio cassette recording so     No, no, no they were not.  So at least if I write her, I know what I   m asking her for.  Exactly.  That   s helpful.  Two or three years ago (I always send her a Christmas card and  generally get something from her) the card was returned undeliverable. I  thought,    Oh God  Has she died? Has she moved?    You know, she lives  in     Florida.  I forgot the name of the town, but it was Florida, yes. So I thought  maybe I can find out her address through her publisher. So I contacted  them to at least find out if she   s alive or dead, you know. I contacted  University of Oklahoma Press and they told me,    We can   t give you that  information.    I thought, well I understand that   privacy. They suggested  (and I thought this was a good idea) that if I would write Shirley Leckie  in care of the University of Oklahoma Press, they would forward it to  her. I said,    That   s fine.    So I did. About two weeks later, I got a letter  from her and I don   t know where she was, but she   d been gone for the  winter on some project some place and that   s why the letter was sent  back because I think the forwarding order is only good for so long a time  and it was past that time. So anyway, I remember that. That   s been, oh,  three or four years of course, something like that. Maybe five. You  37  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  Paustenbaugh  O   Neill  know, when you get to be my age, you   ve seen so many years, like they  say,    time doesn   t mean anything to a hog.    It   s getting to be about the  same way with me. Time doesn   t mean anything to me. If it   s six years  ago, five years ago, ten years ago, it seems like it   s all a few days ago  anyway. So I couldn   t tell you, this was after Mona died. I lost Mona the  twenty-seventh of November, 2004, and it   s been since then so I know  it   s probably three, four, five years ago.  Well, I thank you so much for doing this today. It has been such a  pleasure and I know we have some other things to talk about, but I   m  going to go ahead and turn off the recording equipment if that   s okay.  Doctor, it has been a pleasure indeed and I appreciate your putting up  with my loquacity.  Not at all. (Laughter)  -------  -------   Content added August 21, 2010   You asked me how the people in Marshall reacted to Angie   s    hanging.     Well, I can   t imagine why, but your query took me by surprise. I can   t  imagine why. The people who were acquainted with her personally liked  her, and some, I am sure, loved her. The rest knew she was a famous  person and respected her as such. I am sure that a majority, a large  majority of these people had never read one of her books and had no  inkling of her scholarship. But, she was a hometown girl who had made  good. Most of them had heard that she was the author of Prairie City  and a few might actually have read it. I know this is cynical, but, then, I  am a natural-born cynic   I can   t remember how many years ago they started celebrating    Prairie  City Days.    This started out as an historical event. Among other things,  they had school buses taking people on tours of the Marshall area and  visiting places of local historical interest such as the locations of former  country schools and other places of historical interest. I recall that Mona  was a tour director on one of the buses.  Well, the historical aspect of the celebration soon was abandoned and  became just a typical small-town celebration, complete with parade with  the high school band, old cars, and so forth. Mona never revealed this to  anyone, but Angie told Mona that the historical significance had been  lost and that she wished they would discontinue the event. The locals  always thought of Angie as the poster girl of the event, and annually  Angie would dress in her mother   s dress of ca. 1900 vintage and appear  in the parade. Usually in an old car. As I told you previously, Mona  38  described Angie as vain. But only a little, like many people are, and I am  sure that Angie did appreciate the attention lavished on her. Still, she  wished the event was discontinued because it had lost its significance.  Now, one time when Angie was visiting us on Sunday for dessert and  companionship, she said facetiously that,    This is the only place that we  can be catty.    And laughed. Well, let me be a little catty. A local citizen  who was a local farmer and former instructor of Vocational Agriculture  in the Marshall high school and was a member of Angie   s church and  who she appointed as the executor of her will told me one time that  someone had given him a book and he was asking me what he should do  with it. (How is that for an extended German-style sentence?) It  apparently never occurred to him that he might read it. This actually  happened. I mention this to show that many of Angie   s acquaintances  were not scholarly and this shows that Angie had many persons whom  she had the highest regard for. There was no snobbery in Angie. None   When Angie took the trip to Africa, she became seriously ill while in  Uganda. A native nurse took her in and nursed her. Angie was  convinced that she would have died had she not been so cared for.  Consequently, she funded the education for this Good Samaritan   s  kinder. I am not sure, but I believe that this was for high school  education. I am not sure if college was included, but I don   t really think  so. I remember that Angie   s attorney, who was also my attorney, went to  Africa on Angie   s behalf to see that the money was being properly used.  It apparently was.  I probably told you this in the interview, but Angie spent almost all of  her Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays with us having Thanksgiving  and Christmas dinner with us. She had a couple of old lady friends with  whom she usually had supper.  Our conversations ranged from King Tut to the ACLU to the weather to  rose culture, and so forth. I am sure that you will recall that with Angie it  was the right way, the wrong way and the Angie way. I will use rose  culture as an example. Mona and I had become pretty accomplished rose  people. I know that you wouldn   t believe it now, but we formerly had  some beautiful rose gardens. Like I have always said, if you can   t find  anything else to do, you can always do something to the roses. Well, we  would suggest to Angie some recommended practice for rose culture,  and, sure enough, she went right on with her usual practices. By the way,  she had a climbing American Beauty rose on the trellis on her front  porch. The Philistine who now owns the house took it out. A climbing  American Beauty is a very rare old fashioned rose, and I am sure the  only one ever in Marshall. Some people could tear up a steel ball with a  rubber mallet   39  Angie was a religious person. Regular churchgoer. Took the pledge of  abstinence (no alcohol) while a Methodist. Left her estate to some  Methodist mission outfit because her mother favored this group.  Mona and I were (I am still) agnostics, and this made no difference at all  in our friendship.  Angie was not a believer in college scholarships. She contended that  students could find a way to work their way through school. (Personal  note: I believe that a scholarship fund would have been preferable to  some Methodist Mission. Would you be surprised if I felt differently?)  When asked what characteristic was most prominently displayed in the  Charles Banks Wilson portrait, Angie said,    Drive.
