Story_ID: 647779
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Chitlins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to have a little house in West Virginia where I would spend weekends and vacation times.  That was my very favorite place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying or quote?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There, there are so many, but I think what sustains me is, "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.  He leadeth me beside the still waters" [Psalms 23:2].  There's a promise in that that helps me through a lot of things.
Story_ID: 647780
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's side [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.], but separately first; and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, first, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Eugenia, E-U-G-E-N-I-A, Inez, I-N-E-Z, Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N, Williams [Eugenia Jackson Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born February 15, 1901 in, somewhere in Virginia, in the Charlottesville area.  I think it's called Stoney Creek [Drive] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Up near Monticello [Charlottesville, Virginia], I guess, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was near the--yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?   How far back can you trace, can they be traced, and what do you know about their activities?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That, that's, that's quite a story.  My mother was the oldest of nine children.  Let's--well, let me get back to what you asked first--how far back can I trace the family?  Back to her grandmother, they spent a lot of time with her grandmother, whose name was Ellen Jackson, in the country, in the rural area of Virginia.  You see, when, when you ask me about my parents, there's a whole lot more than just them because we are all a result of, of influences from our parents, their parents, and their parents, and it goes all the way back.  She spent her childhood and grew up in rural Virginia and, eventually, her family moved to Washington [D.C.] in order to have more job opportunities for my, for her father, and in order to have better educational advantages for the children.
Speaker 1: Now, about how old was she, do you think, when her grand- her parents [Katie Jackson and Eugene Jackson] moved to Washington?
Speaker 2: She was a kid because she remembers roller skating up and down the, the sidewalks, so she wasn't very, very old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, and she did, she did have educational opportunities.  She went to Miner Teachers, Teachers College [Miner Normal School; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] after she finished high school, and became a, a teacher.  Eventually, you know, at, at that point, you didn't get a degree from a teachers college.  So, I remember when she worked on her bachelor's degree at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and eventually got her master's degree, and became--she was an elementary school teacher, and she became a principal.
Story_ID: 647781
Speaker 1: Now, this takes your mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] through her career pretty much, but are there any stories about her family way back in Virginia, about emancipation or Reconstruction, or what they were doing back in the 19th century?
Speaker 2: Well, her father, my grand-, great-grandmother's father was, he was not a slave, they tell me.  He was, he was free.  I don't know anything about her mother [Katie Jackson] and, of course, she came up, my great-grandmother came up in the country--she was an interesting character and, and I will one day write, write about her.
Speaker 1: Well, what's her name, first of all, and what are some of the stories about her?
Speaker 2: Well, they, she, she, of course, took care of the growing brood of, of my mother and her brothers and sisters.  They say, she used to have a gun and was very good at shooting it.  I don't know any, any more details about it than that.  I remember her when she was quite elderly, although do you know I think she might not have even been as old as I am now.  People just didn't live that long in those days, but when eventually, the family, the extended family moved into what was in suburban Washington [D.C.] into, which was, again, like, like country where they could grow things and all that.  But they built a house for her and she lived just right up the road.  So, I remember her as, as a lady with--what do you call those things they would wear--a bandana, they say that she used to know how to carry things on her head.  I never saw that because she was probably at that point, a little bit old for that, but she was quite a strong character.  And do you know, so many, so many decades later--well, she died when I was about ten or something, but so many decades later when I was writing 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier], and I'll tell you a story about that when we get around to that.  When I was writing that story, my great-grandmother sort of--her image appeared before me, and she became a character in the story.  She was so vivid, just I could describe her, I could describe what she looked like.  She was a very dark skinned lady.  She had, she looked like a sort of African mask when, when I knew her.  And when I needed to envision the character, Miss Lottie, there was my great-grandmother, and she was the image that I used for Miss Lottie.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was very, very dear to me even though I was very young at that time.  I was the only girl of her great-grandchildren.  The--my cousins and my brother [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.], you know, they were all boys, and she thought I was somebody special.  And I didn't feel special to anybody much, but she, she was there for me.  She was in her senility then, but I felt that she loved me.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Ellen.
Speaker 1: Ellen, okay.
Speaker 2: Ellen Jackson, I don't remember her, her middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  This is your grandmother, right?
Speaker 2: This was my mother's grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Eugene Jackson], my grandfather's mother.  That's when families really stuck together.  And as I said, the whole extended family eventually migrated into suburban Washington, but they were right down the road, or across the way, or something from each other, deep into each other's business.  And I guess that's all right, too, because they also supported each other.
Story_ID: 647782
Speaker 1: Any other stories from that side of the family?  So, what, what did your mother's father [Eugene Jackson] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He, he--by, by the time they moved to Washington [D.C.], he was working in government.  He was working in the printing office and I remember he worked at night.  And during the day, those of us, the children who were, were there at Grandma's [Katie Jackson] house, we had to keep quiet because if you didn't keep quiet, he would rise from the bed where he was getting his sleep in his long johns, (laughter) and come to the door and fuss with us.  That was the only time he ever fussed with us.  He was a very gentle kind of person, but I just have this picture of my granddaddy opening the door, coming out of the bedroom with his long johns on and telling us to go somewhere else.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he, at one point, he was a teacher.  And I was surprised to discover that he used to play--what was it--a horn, some kind of musical instrument?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a musician, too, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know how far he got with it (laughter), but he was, he was educated to a large extent.
Speaker 1: Do you know where he went to school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember offhand now.  I do have a cousin who did some research on the family, and he would know, but I, I just don't know at this point.  One of the things, though, I hope we'll get around to talking about, is the light skinned black folks.  He was light skinned.  His father was a white man.  I didn't know his name--maybe I'll think of it.  But his father stuck with him, and he was the one who put him through, through college, which put him in a much better position to earn a living for all his family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, so your mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams], she was not the--now, did your grandmother go to college, too?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only remember her as a housewife and mother, a great cook.  Grandma could really cook up some food although I never saw her sit down at the table and eat with everybody but, you know, that, that brings something else to mind, and that is what strikes me is the most unfair treatment of women.  Even those who were married, as she was, and treated well by their, their husbands, and all that, but she had twelve children.  That's a lot of months to be pregnant.  She lost three--that's a lot of babies to lose.  But they had, especially black folks, and especially in the country where they started out, she had, well, they had very little access to medical treatment.  They had their babies at home and, and they lost a lot of them.  They didn't have much access to education.  And so, that was about all you could do was to take care of the house, and that's all that they, they thought they were supposed to do.  But with the next generation, the women, as well as the men, were expected to go to college if they could, difficult though it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said your mother went to Miner Teachers College [sic. Miner Normal School; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and--what did they get--a normal degree or the two year degree (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They got some kind of a certificate.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: I, I don't know how many years it was--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --but anyway, she, she came out of it with, with my father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.].  She met my father there while she was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's another story.
Story_ID: 647783
Speaker 1: All right.  So, we'll go to him now, and then we'll catch up with her [Collier's mother, Eugenia Jackson Williams], her story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Harry, Harry, H-A-R-R-Y, Maceo, M-A-C-E-O, Williams [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And, now there's a story behind his name, I know, with the Maceo.  Somebody told me years ago every time you hear Maceo, it's a reflection of something and--
Speaker 2: There was a Cuban general named Antonio--I'm sure it wasn't pronounced Maceo.  It was probably [pronunciation] Maceo, or something like that but, of course, they anglicized it, and he was named after, after him.  He was quite a hero in Cuban history.  And for, apparently, my, my father's father [Nelson Williams, Sr.] was quite taken with him, and named his firstborn son after him.  Now, Grandma [Minnie Wilson Lewis], my father's mother, wanted to name him Harry after her brother [Harry O. Wilson, Sr.].  And so, that's how he became Harry Maceo, but nobody ever called him Harry.  He really didn't look like a Harry.  He looked, well, like a Maceo--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which he came to be.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, yeah that's Antonio Maceo [Antonio Maceo Grajales], the Bronze Titan of Cuba, they call it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, and what's your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was born in Baltimore [Maryland], probably on Shields Place, which used to be called Shields Alley, but they got rid of the Alley and made it Place.  In September, I think it was the 21st, September 21st of 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now far back can you trace your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's another story.  My father's--let's see--what was she, probably his grandmother or great-grandmother--I lose track of the, the dates.  She was a woman named Ann O'Neill [ph.], that's O'N-E-I-L, maybe two Ls--I don't know how many Ls.  Anyway, Ann O'Neill was a slave.  She really quote belonged to a man in, in Virginia, and she had eight babies by that man, well, whose name I, I just don't remember.  He decided that he did not want his children to grow up to be slaves, so he sent the mother and children to Baltimore, set them up in a house, and sort of disappears from family history at that point.  But he was not through because once Ann and the children were in Baltimore, he took upon himself another slave girl, and eventually had a bunch of children by her, and named those children after the first batch of children.  You ever hear of anything like that (laughter), and eventually sent them on to Baltimore also.  And after that, he truly does disappear from history.  I don't know what happened after that.  My grandma once told me that she had a memory of having been taken as a little, little child back to his house in Virginia.  And I think that's the only time she ever saw, saw him, but that is how that came about.
Story_ID: 647784
Speaker 1: And just by coincidence, one of the second batch of children became one of my good friends in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  We didn't know it 'til we got to comparing cousins and stuff.
Speaker 2: That's something.  So, a descendant of that second batch of children was a neighbor, I guess, and who went to school with you.
Speaker 1: Yes, a friend, yeah.  But, you know, it raises so many questions that would apply, not only to this particular family, but Ann O'Neill [ph.] had all these babies by the master, I don't know whether she was a house servant.  I don't know anything about it, but, but the questions are things like this: did she love this man?  Was she a willing partner?  And there's so much about the sexual history of slavery and, and its aftermath that, wow, you know, I'm going to have to live to be two hundred years old to get done all these things that I want to write about.  But anyway, that's where it was.  And the family, my father's [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] family, settled down in Baltimore [Maryland] and became rather prominent people as time went on.  Some of them, as I understand it, moved to, well, to Pennsylvania somewhere, and became white.
Speaker 2: Now, the photos that I saw, you know, it really appears that it would be easy for them to pass for white.
Speaker 1: Right.  And that, that's another thing I, I'm going to look into one of these days--what must that have been like to leave your family, 'cause everybody couldn't pass for white, to leave town, and just not, no longer be a part of, of history, of family history anyway?  And then (laughter), there was a store in Baltimore called O'Neill's department store [O'Neill and Co.].  And one of my, my grandmother's sisters, Aunt Maggie [ph.], who was a little bit strange anyway, but Aunt Maggie swore that it had been established by, by one of those brothers, who had gone and passed for white, and came back and established a store here.  But I know that when I was growing up in segregated Baltimore, you couldn't go in O'Neill's.  Black folks were not permitted to come in there.  So (laughter), we, we begin to get a rather tangled web in, in all of this.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter), this is stra- this certainly seems to be.
Speaker 1: Oh, here's my cat. Hi, Susie [ph.].
Story_ID: 647785
Speaker 1: So, your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.], so he grew up in Baltimore [Maryland] and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And now was he, was he the first of the children to go to college 'cause I know he went to [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--?
Speaker 2: Yes, let me tell you about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Our father had--there were, there were four children.  My father was the second son.  There were two girls [Minnie Williams and Fannie Williams Butler] and then two boys.  His father was a man named Nelson Williams [Nelson Williams, Sr.], Nelson Murray Williams.  And he was, he worked for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], and it is said that he was the, the first, or among the first letter carriers, black letter carriers, in Baltimore.  He was very light skinned, too, so I don't know whether it was known that he was, was a black man or not.  But he died very early.  The story is that he was delivering mail and, and was caught in a very heavy rain and, thereafter, got pneumonia and died.  My, my uncle [Nelson Williams, Jr.] was something like four months old.  He was a lap baby.  My father was a floor baby 'cause these babies came right, right fast in those days.  And my grandmother was left a young widow with four little babies, four little children.  Somehow or another, the family pulled together, her sisters and her brother, and supported each other, and she made it.  I don't know how in the world she made it, but she did.  The, their brother [Harry O. Wilson, Sr.] was the youngest one, and it's said that he was a business genius.  I, I don't know, and he died when I was very young.  But he established a, an insurance company called the Mutual Benefit Society [Baltimore, Maryland] to give his sisters employment and, indeed, it did.  It gave the whole family employment.  And Grandma became one of the earliest black business women, certainly in Baltimore.  She became, in fact, the vice president of the company.  So, this--
Speaker 1: Now, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Minnie B. Lewis [Minnie Wilson Lewis].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute, let me tell you, Minnie B. Williams Lewis because her name was Williams, then, but after my grandfather's death, sometime after that, grandma married an old flame named Bill Lewis [William Lewis].  That was quite a tale.  They had been friends.  They'd gone together--I don't know what went into that, but they had gone together for a while before she got married.  Family didn't really approve of Bill, and he was kind of a rough character, but anyway, she married him, and he helped her bring up the children.  Then they stayed together, you know, for the rest of their lives.  One time, I have to tell you this story, at least once.  Bill wanted to take his girlfriend, Minnie, out for a ride in the horse and buggy.  However, by this time, it wasn't like before, this time, he had to take the whole family--Minnie, the four children, and probably one or two of the sisters.  Well, they got as far as St. Mary Street downtown where there's a big steep hill.  That poor horse could not pull all those people up that hill.  And so, they all had to get out in their Sunday finery and trudge up the hill, but they made it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 647786
Speaker 1: Now, Bill Lewis [William Lewis], that your, your father's mother [Minnie Wilson Lewis]--
Speaker 2: Married, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --married.  He established an Elks lodge in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Bill worked on the railroad--he was a cook on the railroad.  And I think it was in Ohio that he, he became involved with the Elks.  And what were they called--the Benevolent and some kind of society [Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the United States of America]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, of course, it was strictly segregated.  And in Baltimore, he, he was one of the founders of the Elks lodge here, and they called themselves the Improved Benevolent and whatever society [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World] but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it's all, that's interesting.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I loved it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, he had, just like the Masons, you had the black Masons and the white Masons--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but in the Elks lodge, you had the regular Elks and then, you had the Improved--
Speaker 2: Improved, right.
Speaker 1: --for the blacks.
Speaker 2: And I, as far as I know, they're, they're still going--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but Bill was quite a character.  I, I've written, I've written an essay about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's the title of the essay, yeah?
Speaker 2: I was just trying to think of the title of the essay (laughter).  I think it was called "A Toast to Bill," something like that.  It was, it was published in [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni's book, 'Grand Fathers,' two words, 'Grand Fathers,' about grandfathers.  And I, I mentioned in there such a proud, proud moment when the Elks were celebrating some kind of an anniversary or something--I forgot what it was--and they had a parade.  The parade came down Madison Avenue where, where we lived, and there was Bill riding in the car with his fancy hat on, and he waved at us and, oh, my goodness, I thought that was just so wonderful.  We were waved at by a celebrity.  That was a beautiful moment I'll never forget.
Speaker 1: So, he was a good, he's a good father for your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.], right?
Speaker 2: He was, he was a good man, he was a character, but he, he was a good person.  He was a father figure, and he was the only grandfather I knew, you know, on that side, because I never knew my, my blood grandfather [Nelson Williams, Sr.].  But he's the one that made things complete and he, he used to hang out in the kitchen.  See, we lived in great big house.  Some of it was rented out and some of it was just there for the family.  And there was, in fact, an elk's head in the hallway--first thing you saw when you came in, and I remember we used to hang Christmas tree lights on, on the elk (laughter).  But, anyway, Bill used to hang out in, in the basement with various people who came and went there for various reasons.  And he would sit there with his little can of beer in his rocking chair and, oh, he had many stories, many tales to tell.  And that's how I, I remember him, back when I was a little kid; and we would all be gathered in the kitchen and sitting around.  And Bill would hold forth with a story.
Story_ID: 647787
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, you're talking about the other, other parts of the house were rented out.  Were these like, roomers and people like, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there--it was a three story house and down- downstairs, the usual downstairs things, a living room, and it was a dining room down there and so forth.  Second floor was our apartment.  We lived there--my, my family of origin until I was about eight years old.  And the third floor was rented out, and there were various roomers there.  And there was a room for Aunt Fiddie.  That was the, the remaining daughter, who lived in New York [New York], but came home occasionally to visit.  And now, Aunt Fiddie had five husbands--not all at once--one at a time.  And when she was between husbands, sometimes she would come and stay.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell her name?  Was it--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  F-I-D-D-I-E, her, her name, I think her name was Frances [sic. Fannie Williams Butler], but everybody called her Fiddie, F-I-D-D-I-E (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  And now, she is a character you've written about--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she was quite a character, too.
Speaker 1: So, your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] had two sisters or--
Speaker 2: He had two sisters, one of whom died quite young [Minnie Williams].  I think she died of pneumonia, too.  See, and now, it's so easy to cure pneumonia.  You know, if it doesn't get too far, you can--some medicine will take care of it.  But, anyway, yeah, Aunt Fiddie was a character.  See, now, here's, here's, again, back to the thing that has ever haunted me, and that is the theme of light skinned blacks, who passed for white, or wanted to be white, or thought that white was right, and that black folks were not worth very much.  And there was a lot of that and I think too many black folks still think that.
Speaker 1: So, Aunt Fiddie was what they called color struck, right?
Speaker 2: Color struck, yes.  And, in fact, she adopted a white child.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us that story.  'Cause I think it's real interesting and historical that this would even happen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, I, I thought, I thought that--her name was Katheryn [Katheryn Butler].  I thought that Katheryn was my blood cousin.  I mean, how did I know?  I was a little kid then, too.  She was a little older than I.  But Aunt Fiddie--let me see, she was on either her first or second husband at that time, but, for some reason, she never had any, any biological children.   She went to Washington [D.C.], as I understand the story, to an orphanage and selected the baby she wanted, brought her on home.
Speaker 1: I think you, you kind of indicated that the orphanage may or may not have known--
Speaker 2: They probably--
Speaker 1: --that Aunt Fiddie was like, white or something?
Speaker 2: --yeah, they thought she was white because they would never, ever have approved of one of their children going to anybody that wasn't white.  But she brought her up.  Kattie was a very nice, gentle girl, as I recall.  She was sort of like an older sister when she was, when they were there at the house, and not in New York, but very, very tall, slender girl with long straight hair.
Story_ID: 647788
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your [paternal] aunt--I mean, did Kattie [Katheryn Butler] think, know she was white or did she think she was black, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she didn't, she, she thought she was Aunt Fiddie's [Fannie Williams Butler] blood daughter.  I, I don't know how confused she might have been about all of it.  But she went, for a while, she went to Douglass High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And, of course, she was the whitest thing in the school, and I'm not sure that they were, that people weren't nice to her.  I don't know.  I never heard her complain about that or anything else.  But she, when she was really a young adult, someone in the family told her and, and not in a very nice way, that she was adopted.  The way she was told, it hurt her very much.  She was a very sensitive girl.  And she went weeping to my uncle's, Uncle Nelson's [Nelson Williams, Jr.] wife, who is a very warm kind of person.  But as a matter of fact, she eventually married into the family.  She married the son of my [maternal] grandmother's brother [Harry O. Wilson, Sr.], the one that started the Mutual Benefits Society [Baltimore, Maryland].  That is what, the way I understand it.  The marriage didn't last terribly long.  Kattie had a little girl who, again, is no longer in the family.  She--I wouldn't know her if I saw her 'cause I haven't seen her since she was a little, little kid.  But this, this racial thing, it just breaks people up, it messes people up.  It shouldn't have been that way.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Aunt Fiddie?  Did she, now she never told her daughter herself--I mean, her, the daughter herself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, after that, it was, you know, sort of out--
Speaker 1: Somebody else just let the cat out of the bag?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I think you wrote also, it was interesting that your Aunt Fiddie was, could marginally pass--I mean, if you weren't looking that she tucked her hair in right--
Speaker 2: If she kept her hat on, she could pass.  She, she was very light skinned, she, she was.  And that was the world she wanted to, to be in.  I don't know whether when she was in New York [New York], whether anybody knew she was not white.  I don't know.  She would, now and then, she would bring someone home to visit a child, and they were, invariably, they were white.  So, didn't make any difference to us.  I mean, we were little kids.
Speaker 1: So, I think the implication of what you're writing was that Auntie Fiddie used the little girl as a ticket--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --'cause the little girl is definitely white so--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, she did, she did, indeed.  She was a rather harsh person--my Aunt Fiddie was, and very selfish in terms of getting what she wanted, regardless of anybody else.
Speaker 1: That's, that's quite a story.  That's like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, really, and there's, see, there are so many things behind all of these things that, that I don't know because I was coming along then; and maybe someday, I'll get around to researching some of it.
Story_ID: 647789
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.]; and now, what did your father say about growing up in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, he--not much.  That was, that was home.  He didn't--my father was a very silent person.  He didn't do very much talking and stayed busy all the time.  He became--oh, let me go back a little while, a little, little ways on, on this.  He was a physician.  He went to--Grandma [Collier's paternal grandmother, Minnie Wilson Lewis] managed to send her--both of her boys to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  One, my Uncle Nelson [Nelson Williams, Jr.], went to dental school.  My father went to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And they were so poor up to that time and, and during that time, that Uncle Nelson once told me that they, sometimes they didn't have anything but oatmeal to eat in the house.  That's how bad off they were, but she managed to, you know, get things together and, eventually, sent them both, both to professional schools.  Now, my father practiced medicine, and there were people who named their babies after him.  He practiced during the Depression [Great Depression] when nobody had any money.  And they tell me that sometimes he wouldn't--instead of getting paid, he would leave money for the people to buy their medicine, but that's the kind of person he, he was.  He'd go out with his little black bag and do what he had to do.  But, anyway, the City of Baltimore had no health center for black people, and they decided it was time that, that they did try to, you know, try to have one.  And they selected my father to be the head.  My father needed to go back to school for public health, to get a master's [degree] in public health, in addition to his medical degree.  He wanted to go to Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], but Hopkins would not admit him because he was Negro.  So, he had to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which was all right, except that it would--took him so far from home, and he really needed to be at home.  But he went and he went to school there and he got a master's in public health, and came back to, to head up the Druid Health District.  And I think he was, well, he--everyone said he was good, a good person to work with and, and he was.  He, he--I'll tell you something I didn't know until I was writing a biography of him a couple of years ago, little, just a little essay on him.  But he used to collect clothing, and keep clothing there in the health district for people who, who just didn't have any, didn't have what they needed.  And he said, it, it was terrible to have to send people out of there when they, they didn't have an overcoat in the winter, so he started collecting stuff.  And he had a social worker who, or maybe a couple of social workers, who worked to, you know, to distribute the clothes.  But he did a lot of those things.  He integrated some things, agencies or this, that, and the other.  So, he'd never talked about those things, but that was a part of who he was, that's a part of what he did.  He never turned his back on black folks, or decided to go and be white, or anything like that.  He was a very good person.
Story_ID: 647790
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Eugenia Jackson Williams and H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know too much about it, except that she was, she was a student at Miner Teachers College [sic. Miner Normal School; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], which was right there, almost on the campus of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  My father was a medical student at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], and I, I don't know who introduced them or how.  I guess, maybe they just sort of drifted together as, as kids will do.  When they got married, of course, nobody, again, nobody had any money.  That was, that must have been--let me see--about 1925 or something like that, so he brought her to Baltimore [Maryland] where he lived with his mother [Minnie Wilson Lewis] and, and Bill Lewis [Collier's paternal step-grandfather, William Lewis] in that big, in that big house.  She never liked Baltimore.  She's never liked her in-laws (laughter).  It was not a happy situation, but that's where, that's where they started.
Story_ID: 647791
Speaker 1: So, I know I read that your, of the two parents, your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] was the warmest of the two, right?
Speaker 2: He was.  My, my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] was a kind of a nervous type person.  She had, she had been sort of robbed of her childhood by having to take care of all of these eight brothers and sisters and always felt responsible for them.  Even when they were grown up, they would come to her for some things that they needed.  So, she really, it, it made her quite hyper.  Now, nowadays, again, there would be medical resources that would have helped her to, to get along a lot better, but there was a lot of confusion and fussing and fighting, and carrying on, and not, not fighting, but just verbal fight that went on in, in the house, so that it was--I don't, for me, it was not a happy situation.  My father was, as I said, quiet and gentle and, in fact, one of the things that I think started me off on my whole career, my whole life's work, was my father's love of books.  He would read to us, he would read poetry to us.  He liked poetry.  He would have my brother [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.] on one knee and me on the other.  And they tell me, I was really fascinated by the books.  I, I understood that, that what he was saying was coming from this book that he was holding.  And they say that--well, my father told me that sometimes he would just get tired of reading.  His voice would get tired, and he would stop reading and, and I would get all upset.  I would say, "Read the book, read the book!"  And (laughter), he would have to go back, tired or not, he would have to go back and read the book.  But I came to realize that there were good things on the page.  There were fascinating things on the page, and I learned to read quite early and still, (laughter) still reading.  After a while, I, I, when, when I could write, you know, when I learned how to write, I started writing little poems myself.  So, that, that really started me off.
Speaker 1: So, when you think about your parents' personalities, their disposition, their habits, their talents, how they walked, talked, what they looked like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I look just like my mother.  Every now and then when I pass a mirror without planning to, I, I glance at the mirror.  I, it will look like my mother standing there or walking by, whatever.  So, they tell me I look just, just like her.  But I think my disposition comes from my father.  But in a way, I think I was so very lucky, in spite of the many battles that my mother and I had for all of her life, in spite of all of that, she was a very strong woman.  And I think I inherited her strength, some of it anyway, and I think I inherited my father's gentle nature.  However, as certainly my friends can tell you, every now and then, if you crack that gentleness, my mother's temper will flare out (gesture), but I think I was very fortunate in, in that at least.
Story_ID: 647792
Speaker 1: Now, you have a brother and--?
Speaker 2: Just, just a brother.
Speaker 1: Just a brother, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a story behind that, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] would, as she told us many times, she didn't want to have any children.  She was sick of diapers and, and all that sort of thing.  So, but, and nevertheless, you know, nature will catch up with you.  She was a country girl, as I said, and they, the women had their babies at home.  I don't know that she ever got any (unclear) prenatal care, but she didn't go to the hospital.  She had her babies at home, and my brother was damaged in birth.
Speaker 1: Now, your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] is a physician, right, but--
Speaker 2: I cannot solve that--answer that question.  Well, she was very, she would do what she wanted to do.  And she had a number of fears and anxieties.  And one fear, now I can't solve this riddle either, one fear was she, she feared hospitals and doctors (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And she married a doctor.
Speaker 2: And she married a doctor.  I can't explain that, but anyway, she, she didn't go the hospital.  She had him at home and, as a result, he was born with cerebral palsy.  That sort of plotted the direction of our whole family, our whole life.  I came along just after he did.  I, I was born prematurely when he was eleven months old.  I weighed three and a half pounds, and I definitely was not what you would call a wanted child.  She was certain at this time she would die, but she didn't, and somehow I didn't.  But there she was left with two little children, one of them disabled, the other one premature, and it was a very, very hard time for her and for, really, for everybody, I'm sure in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Maceo (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --he's named after my father, H. Maceo Williams, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They thought he would die at any point for his whole life, but I'm happy to say my brother is here, I mean not, not here, but he's alive.  He weighs, he's a little fellow, which is fortunate because he can't walk.  He has to be carried, or to be in a wheelchair, but he is here.  He got married for the first time at age seventy-eight, which most of us (laughter) can't do; and he has a very wonderful wife who takes good care of him.
Story_ID: 647793
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, truthfully, I was not a happy child, and my earliest memories are not happy.  The very earliest memory is, I remember being--well, you, you wouldn't remember these, these old carriages with the dome top, and the baby is supposed to be underneath that top on pillows.  Well, they had my brother [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.] there.  They would put me on the back of the carriage with pillows.  And I remember, the earliest thing I remember is that it hurt my back and I cried.  And that's, I mean, that's, that's all that the memory is, but, and here was this other baby (laughter), on the, you know, with, underneath the dome where he seemed, well, I don't know whether he seemed comfortable or not.  Usually, when one of us cried, the other one cried, too, so which made it kind of confusing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you're, now, you all are not twins, are you?
Speaker 2: No, he's eleven months--
Speaker 1: Eleven months older--
Speaker 2: --and four days older than I.
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: So, that's the very earliest.  Another early memory, second earliest is I know I was three years old because my father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] was babysitting with us.  And he was giving us Life Savers candies, and he gave my brother four because he was four years old.  He gave me three because I was three years old, and that didn't seem right to me then--how come (laughter), whatever?  But those were early memories.  As I said, those were not happy memories.  The happiest ones were my father reading, reading to us.
Story_ID: 647794
Speaker 1: All right, now you--okay go ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, speaking of my earliest happy memories, I wanted to read you a little bit of my father's [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] favorite poem, and it became my favorite, too.  The poem is 'Columbus' by Joaquin Miller.  Now, picture this--my brother's [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.] on one knee, I'm on the other knee, and Daddy is reading to us.  Now, "Behind him lay the gray Azores/ behind the Gates of Hercules."  Now, you know, I didn't have no idea what Azores or Hercules or any other.  "Before him not the ghost of shores / before him only shoreless seas.  The good mate said: 'Now we must pray, for lo! the very stars are gone.  Brave Admiral, speak, what shall I say?'  'Why, say, "Sail on! sail on! and on!"'."  And believe me, when every, every stanza ends with sail on, sail, and Daddy would--I don't know that he could do justice like that 'cause he was holding us, but his voice would rise, and he would really orate, "Sail on, sail on, and on."  So, that was, that was great.  I, I just loved that.
Story_ID: 647795
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  Now, you, you grew up in what, two different neighborhoods in, in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Actually, I grew up in three different neighborhoods--one in Washington [D.C.], and two in Baltimore.  My mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] never did leave the Washington public school system [District of Columbia Public Schools].  So, that meant that, or in the earliest days, we would go to her mother's [Katie Jackson] house in Washington, and we'd stay there five days.  Then, we'd come back to Baltimore for weekends, which was awfully confusing.  Then, in Baltimore, we lived in Grandma's house, my father's mother's [Minnie Wilson Lewis] house, for until I was about eight years old or so.  And then, we moved in, to the house on Carey Street, the corner of Carey and Lexington [Street].  And that's where I stayed until, until I got married and, eventually, we moved out.  But, basically, the two neighborhoods in Baltimore were--that was home base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my--I really liked better being in Washington because that was suburban, that you could run all on the lawn.  They grew a lot of stuff--great arbors, gooseberries, apples, you know, all those things growing 'cause my, my grandfather, my mother's father [Eugene Jackson], he was really a farmer at heart and he loved to grow things.  So, it was that kind of mixture of Baltimore and Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where- whereabouts in Washington was the home that--
Speaker 2: It was in Northeast Washington on a street called Cloud Place, C-L-O-U-D, Cloud Place, and, again, all the cousins and everybody lived, uncles and aunts, everybody lived in roughly the same area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh!  Let's see--the sounds of the city for one thing, the sounds of people walking, talking to each other.  That's very dear to me.  And, you know, I kind of missed that living, living here, because you don't, you don't hear things like that, but just the sounds of people.  The smell of the--Grandma used to, my mother's mother in Washington, she used to make bread, make rolls.  And I tell you, the smell of the rolls cooking, it was just wonderful, so there's that.  What else--I don't know (laughter) but, basically, I think I am a city girl, so that's what comes back to me most is just the sounds of the city, cars going by, all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When your family moved into the second house in Baltimore, did you live there most of the time, or did you still go back and forth?
Speaker 2: No, we, we went, well, when we were going back and forth, we were in school in Washington, the school where my mother taught [Deanwood Elementary School; George Washington Carver Elementary School], so that when we came here, let me see, I must have been in the third grade, something like that, and started school over here.  I went to school, William, William Alexander No. 112 or, or as we call it, 112th, so I went to School 112th [School Building 112; William M. Alexander School].  That's at Calhoun [Street] and Baker Street [sic. Laurens Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's in Baltimore.
Speaker 2: In Baltimore, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 647796
Speaker 1: Now, I guess you liked school, I guess, I don't know, but?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did, I, I really did.  That was when--see, I, I don't know exactly how to, how to put this, but I sort of grew up with no self esteem.  I had no sense of self esteem at all.  I did not feel important and partly, well, totally, I guess, because all of the attention went to, to my brother [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.].  I was, as they put it, the normal child.  I didn't have needs and so, I didn't get the attention that ordinarily one, one would get.  And, in fact, at one point, they told me that God had sent me to take care of my brother.  That's a heck of a thing to tell a little kid.  And so I, I, that's, I grew up, like a sort of second class citizen.  Nobody knew that.  I was, I was a good little girl.  I tried very hard to be a good girl and to please everybody, and so, I was quiet.  I didn't cause any confusion or any trouble or anything.  So, that's the way that I grew up.  Well, when I got in school, that was where I sort of shone in a, in a sense.  I was really brighter than most children because for one thing, I grew up in a house with books, and that made a big difference, that made a big difference.  But I was usually, I usually knew the answers to the questions, and raised my hand and everything.  And I liked the work, the homework.  I liked the reading that, that we had to do, and that sort of stuck with me all through school.  I was, let's see, I was the valedictorian of some, some place, and I graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], magna cum laude, so I had, I had no problems with, with school.
Speaker 1: Now, so you were at William Alexander School [School Building 112; William M. Alexander School, Baltimore, Maryland] for, until the third grade, you said?
Speaker 2: No, I started there in the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, started in third grade.
Speaker 2: And from there on, I was in the Baltimore public school system [Baltimore City Public Schools].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you started school in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Right, I went to Deanwood Elementary School [George Washington Carver Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I got it mixed it, so Deanwood in D.C.
Speaker 2: That's where my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] taught.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she could keep an eye on us.
Story_ID: 647797
Speaker 1: So William Alexander School [School Building 112; William M. Alexander School, Baltimore, Maryland].  Now, were there any--you went to William Alexander first and then--?
Speaker 2: Then, from there, I went to 130, Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Junior High School; Booker T. Washington Middle School for the Arts, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that a middle school or junior high school or--
Speaker 2: It was a junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now at this level in grade school and junior high school, were there any special teachers that you remember, that you really admired, or who really took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know certainly in, at Douglass [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], in particular, there were teachers that were encouraging, teachers that I liked.  Names escape me at this point (laughter).
Speaker 1: But there were teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but there were teachers that, that were, as I said, encouraging, although I can't, cannot think, I'll think of this lady's name.  She was a wonderful teacher, my Spanish teacher.  Isn't that awful--I will think of it.
Speaker 1: Well, what did she do?  I mean, you can, we can talk about what she did.
Speaker 2: For one thing, she, she knew all of our names, and what we were interested in, what we liked to do.  And, in fact, into her old age, I sort of kept loose touch with her as we all did and she would see me somewhere, call me by name.  I mean, by this time, she's old, and I'm getting old.  Called me by name, wanted to know, was I still writing?  You know, she took an interest in us.  I liked Spanish.  It wasn't my whole, my, my great interest, but I really liked her more than anything.  She was a sort of a role model.  I liked a teacher named, now I do remember her name--Nellie Buchanan, who taught Latin and, again, Latin wasn't, wasn't great but it, it was interesting.  And she was nice and warm.  But there were, there were teachers that I liked, and they gave all of us some--just, just warmth and, and interest.  Llewellyn Wilson [William Llewellyn Wilson], who taught music, was another one 'cause they're all gone by now, but I enjoyed the music classes with him.
Story_ID: 647798
Speaker 1: Now, your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] was reading poetry at home, but what kind of literature was being taught in the, in the public schools in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, totally white literature, even in segregated Baltimore [Maryland].  On Negro History Week [Black History Month] (laughter), yeah, one week, we did learn about Phillis Wheatley.  Nobody ever read Phillis Wheatley's poetry.  I don't guess we could.  And even, even now, it's, well, it's not my thing (laughter), but we learned about Phillis Wheatley and, and we were proud of her.  And we learned about Langston Hughes.  Those were the only poets, black poets that we learned about.
Speaker 1: No Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar] at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, yeah, we did, we did.  Dunbar's dialect poems, we, we didn't, you know, the standard English poems, we, we didn't bother with those, but the dialect poems, people got a kick out of.  And in, in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], I remember when they used to have, they used to have talent shows, and very often someone would read James Weldon Johnson's 'The Creation.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That certainly lent itself to, to reading.  But, but basically, other than Negro History Week, or some specific occasion, we really didn't learn anything about African American literature, even though there were some who had lived in Baltimore years ago, but it was, it was like we just, that was just left out of our education.  Perhaps it wasn't considered important.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: I know I was reading our outline, and you were, I think, in the outline, you suggested that in school, you were given the impression that white literature was real literature.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And ours is really not real or something or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it really, it was not, it was an aberration whatever, ever.  They really--what, what I thought, I guess, all of us thought was that it wasn't that much to it.  And do you know when I was teaching at Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore City Community College, Baltimore, Maryland]--what was that, maybe twenty-five years ago, thirty years, or something like that?  But I proposed that we have a course in black literature.  And one of our more, most scholarly people who, in, in the, on, on the English faculty, was amazed.  He said, "Is there enough of it to fill out a whole course?"  Oh!  So (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, this is after, is this after you wrote the anthology ['Afro-American Writing: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry,' edited by Richard A. Long and Eugenia W. Collier] with [HistoryMaker] Richard Long, I mean the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I may have been in the process of, of--it was, somewhere in the '60s [1960s].  And so, they, everybody, I was pretty well respected on, on the English faculty, so they just said, "Well, okay, we'll approve it.  You go ahead."  Well, we ended up, of course, with two courses, the first half, and the second half, and that didn't begin to scratch the surface because, truly, if you want to know the literature of African Americans, you need to know something about African literature, literature of the diaspora.  You need to be able to compare themes, and you find out that the themes are pretty much the same in terms of protest literature, some of it, it just, there's, there's so much you need to know.  You also need to know something about American literature because this, this, too, fashioned a lot of African American literature.  There's so much you, that you need to know.  I, I don't know it all.  I, I just scratched the surface of it, but if you're talking about teaching people to know the literature, you really have to--you, yourself, really have to know a whole lot of stuff.  And somebody's gonna ask me, is there enough to fill out a whole course?  Yes.
Speaker 1: That speaks volumes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 647799
Speaker 1: So you're saying for the most part, except for Black History Month, you didn't have really any exposure to--
Speaker 2: That's right, Negro History Week, you didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right--
Speaker 2: --you didn't use the term black in those days.
Speaker 1: And it was, that's right, it was Negro History Week then, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Week, yeah, one whole week.  And, of course, in that, you, you also had to learn about George, George Washington Carver, and the peanuts and, you know, stuff, stuff like that.  So, the literature is just a little bitty part of it, but I tell you one thing, at least we did sing the spirituals.  I don't think people do that, I don't think kids nowadays know the spirituals or anything about them.
Speaker 1: Which ones would you sing?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess, the usual ones that people know.  I, I found out later that there were a whole lot more than, than that, but we, we sang things like 'Steal Away,' 'Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.'  Wait, there's one I wrote, I wrote, in fact, I wrote a poem that was published here, at our little newspaper here, about the songs that sustained us and kept us going.  Yeah, but, but people don't even know those things now.  I, I had thought this is sort of, off, a little bit off the subject but, you know, we, we do courses here.  Well, you can teach a course here if you, if you want to, and it could be anything you want, you want it to be.  I, I had sort of thought to teach a course in the heritage of the spirituals, but I need to teach it with somebody who knows music.  I don't know the technicalities of music, but I know a bit about the spirituals.  I would hate to see the spirituals lost to time because nobody just bothered to, to sing them.
Story_ID: 647800
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you write when you were growing up?  I mean, you know, or?
Speaker 2: I, I wrote, I used to, I remember, certainly in junior high school [Booker T. Washington Junior High School; Booker T. Washington Middle School for the Arts, Baltimore, Maryland], I used to, I'd keep a notebook and, with little stories and, and poems and stuff.  And I would show them, show my stuff to my, my friends and they liked them.  They, they gave me encouragement in that, but, yeah, I wrote, I wrote a lot of stuff.  I was always writing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have, by the time you got to high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], did you have an idea of what you wanted to do career wise?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I certainly did not want to be a teacher, which is what I ended up being (laughter).  I, I went through several different phases, but I finally decided I wanted to be a journalist, wasn't quite sure what a journalist was, but I thought that's--it would involve writing, and that's what I could do.  And I, in fact, I did work in, in high school, I worked summers at the Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] newspaper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I worked with the Clean Block campaign [AFRO Clean Block].
Story_ID: 647801
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is during World War II [WWII], right?  You're, you're going to high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from what, '42 [1942] to '46 [1946].  Is this about right?
Speaker 2: When did I come out of high school--in '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is, the war years are your high school years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much, that's pretty much true.  So, and now, what was Baltimore [Maryland] like, in '42 [1942], from '42 [1942] to '45 [1945]?  I know there was a lot of music around here and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And, again, strictly segregated.  You could not go to the stores downtown, or if you--the, the ones you could, that you could go to, you couldn't try things on, which brings me to another Aunt Fiddie story.  Aunt Fiddie [Collier's paternal aunt, Fannie Williams Butler] needed a hat.  So, she went, went to some place, one of these stores, and you definitely could not try on hats.  So, there's Aunt Fiddie trying on the hats, passing for white, and she was so angry when, when she told us this story.  There was a black woman who was a charwoman, or a janitor, or something who told the, the saleswoman, "That woman is a Negro, that woman is colored."  That was the word then, "That woman is colored."  So, the, the sales lady was all upset.  She came and asked Aunt Fiddie, "Are you colored?"  And Aunt Fiddie said, "Yes, I'm colored, and I want this hat," so but, but she was angry.  Aunt Fiddie was not angry with the saleswoman or with the policy.  She was angry with that janitor lady who told on her (laughter), anyway.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a psychological kind of issue, I guess, you know, why would the cleaning lady tell on her?
Speaker 2: You know, one thing--see, you young folks didn't come up in the same, quite the same atmosphere as we did.  But this segregation, it is not just a political thing.  It is not just playing the race card, like they say, it ain't no game, believe me.  It, it goes deep down inside of you.  It fashions you, it shapes you.  It isn't just something to, that you read about.  When you cannot go here, and cannot go there, you certainly couldn't go downtown to the movies.  We had our Pennsylvania Avenue.  That made a big difference, but you couldn't, and you couldn't, if, if you wanted to rent an apartment, you looked in the newspaper under the, the column, 'Houses for Rent' or 'Apartments for Rent--Colored.'  That's where you looked.  You didn't look under just 'Apartments for Rent' because, oh, that was for white people.  You, I cannot tell you what it does to you when everywhere you look, you got that facing you.  Here, where I live now, there are about thirty, thirty-two black folks, and the rest of the two thousand people here are white.  The residents.  And they talk about their childhood and coming up, and how nice it was on Eastern Shore [Eastern Shore of Maryland] where they lived and they had a nice house.  I say, heck--I didn't say to them--I said it to myself, we wouldn't even go to the Eastern Shore 'cause they lynch people there.  And the same thing, "At Southern High School [Baltimore, Maryland] was so nice.  I really enjoyed my high school days," but, but when integration came, oh, there was all kinds of confusion when, when black children started to go to Southern High School.  There were protests and all.  Those things get to you.  It is not a game.  Talk about playing the race card as if it were a game when it's what, what shaped you, what made you who you are.  So, that's part of what Baltimore was like.  There were neighborhoods.  You, only, you could only live in certain neighborhoods.  And some of them were, were nice where people, you know, kept them clean, and swept the sidewalks and this, that, and the other.  Some of them were not so nice because the people were very financially really under the gun because you couldn't find jobs.  That's another thing.  You couldn't get a job for--in a whole lot of fields.  So, what was Baltimore like when I was coming up?  I didn't want to live in Baltimore.  I couldn't wait to grow up and move out somewhere.  Well, I grew up and I'm, I'm still here (laughter).
Story_ID: 647802
Speaker 1: Did church play a major role in growing up?
Speaker 2: It did for some.  It, it played a role for me, but not so much a major role.  My family was not particularly church oriented.  My mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] didn't like the preacher of the church where the rest of the family went.  She said he was too loud.  He was, he was sort of like the, the old time preacher.  She didn't like him, so we didn't go too often.  I ended up, when I grew up, I joined the Union Baptist [Union Baptist Church, Baltimore, Maryland] and the minister there became Vernon Dobson [HistoryMaker Reverend Vernon Dobson], and I think he was one of the great ministers of our time.  He was wonderful.  He, he died just a year or two ago, probably a year ago.  But one thing, another phra- well, another one of my favorite phrases, I got from Vernon, because when he would go on the marches and he would do this thing, some of the ladies in the church disapproved of that.  They thought he was too militant.  He was too, you know.  Vernon, and Vernon said one time in church, he said, "Y'all be patient with me.  God is not through with me yet," and I liked that.  That helps me when I do dumb things.  And I say that to myself: God is not through with me yet.
Story_ID: 647803
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were growing up, church was not a big factor or going to church?
Speaker 2: Not, not really, not really.  I'm not much of a churchgoer now.  That doesn't mean that I'm not religious.  I do have my religious beliefs, but they are not necessarily focused on, on the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  So, we'll probably, I'll ask you about those later on we get to, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's about--
Speaker 1: The more philosophical part.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But now as, okay, so the war [World War II, WWII] is going on.  You're in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you said your Spanish teacher was important and Latin teacher [Nellie Buchanan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh lord what was that, what was her name?
Speaker 1: --and the music teacher [William Llewellyn Wilson], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and your grades were high?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, now, did you have any counseling about going to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or was it the--
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to go to Howard because that was my father's [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] school.  And well, the other, the other thing was there weren't but so many places you could go because, well, when I finished Howard, and I was looking for a graduate school, I remember writing, you know, applying this place and that place.  And he didn't mind telling you in a, in an official letter, "I'm sorry, but we have our quota of Negro students for this year.  You might apply next year."  I mean, they could tell you that, they could tell you that, and others would, would say, "We, we--," oh, well, others, some others you didn't want to apply to anyway.  But I always wanted to go to a black school [HBCU] to begin with because I felt that I could enjoy college life much better.  And, and I did.  I enjoyed Howard, I really liked it; I really did.
Story_ID: 647804
Speaker 1: So, you started Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 1946, '45 [1945], I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-five [1945], yeah.  I came out in February, out of Douglass [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] in February of '45 [1945], and started Howard in the March quarter of '45 [1945] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, tell me this, was--I was thinking about the Double V campaign and the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier].  And I don't know what the Afro [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] was writing about then, but the idea that black folks had reached a situation where they were glad for the end of the war [World War II, WWII], but they wanted things to change here, too, at the same time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They wanted a big change and were actually saying that at--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So, is the end of the war--I mean, was there, do you remember what it was like at the end of the war?
Speaker 2: I, yes, I remember a few things.  One, one thing was that, that the veterans came back, the boys came back, because when I was in high school, the boys were being drafted into the [U.S. military] service.  And as I look at it now, my goodness, they were just kids, and they were being taken and put in the service, and some didn't come back.  Some came back different, and some didn't seem to matter.  But that was one thing.  So at, at Howard, my second semester, second quarter there, all of a sudden, there were all these guys on the campus.  It had seemed like a girls' school before, so that was one impact that the, certainly the end of the war had, had on us.  In terms, in terms of wanting things to be different, yes, we did, all of us did, 'cause by that time, I was deep into civil rights and all, you know, all kinds of things like that.
Speaker 1: Now was--were your parents involved in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or any of the organizations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they weren't involved in any of that.  Well, my father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] was not much on getting involved in a lot of things.  And my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams], I think she was sort of ashamed of being a Negro.  That's another story.  I can go into that, too, but one thing I remember struck me very deeply that, this, and this happened to more than one.  But there was--I read in the newspaper about a veteran who came, came back from the war.  And for some reason, I've forgotten the issue, but he was beaten up, and his eyes were put out and, and I mean they would lynch you in your uniform.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a story, I can't remember his name, but I remember reading that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So, we found that there wasn't that much different, except that our, some of our guys that had gone overseas and had seen a lot more of the world than they would have, perhaps otherwise.  But there wasn't that much difference 'cause it was, it was in '48 [1948] that I was writing around trying, you know, writing to apply to graduate schools and were told, you know, "We have our quota of you people."  So, I, I don't see that there was a lot different, yeah.
Story_ID: 647805
Speaker 1: Now the, well '45 [1945] was--so, so what did, what did you choose as a major when you started at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: English, because I love reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a good major and I'm glad I took it.  I learned a lot.  It certainly deepened my thoughts, thought processes and, and just my sort of philosophy, what was going, going on inside of myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the faculty like at Howard in '45 [1945]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, there was Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown].  It was, it was a very fine faculty.  I, I met and was taught by some people who were really scholars in the field--Arthur P. Davis, wonderful teacher, and critic, and scholar, just num- numerous people.  And I just felt like I was, I was in heaven in terms of, of meeting people.  And it was thanks to Howard and to Sterling Brown that I came to realize that black folks had done a lot of writing, poetry, fiction, you know, you name it, and that there were people working in the field even then, and made me want to reach out and, and do some things myself.  So, that was, that was really the start of it.  And then, when I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and graduate school, that's when I wrote my master's thesis on Sterling Brown, and that was, that, too, was any eye opener 'cause I had to read a lot of other African American literature, too, in order to fit his into a context.
Speaker 1: Now, I was reading that you wrote at some point that when you started, you had no idea who Sterling Brown was, or that he even wrote poetry or anything.
Speaker 2: Didn't know Sterling Brown from any- anybody.  But I was, it was just by chance that I took his course in, what was it humanities, early on.  It was either my first or my second semester, quarter there.  And it happened that my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] knew him.  She had been a classmate of his.  And he was a little, little older than she was, but she was saying what a marvelous young man he had been.  But to see that kind of brilliance when all I had been taught was, "You can't come in here, you can't go there."  You know, just to see that, it was, I guess, maybe, I was kind of late in coming to that realization that, of who we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you happier at Howard than you had been at Douglass [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, definitely so, definitely so, yeah.
Story_ID: 647806
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you involved in campus activities at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I joined a sorority.  I was, I didn't have so much to do with the newspaper, but I did, I was involved with it and, and I had been at Douglass [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], too, with the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were, there were a couple of other things.  I don't, it's been a long time ago now, don't remember everything.
Speaker 1: So, was it still The Hilltop?
Speaker 2: The Hilltop, yes, yes, yes.  In fact, I remember running for editor of The Hilltop, but I wasn't elected.  I really wasn't that outgoing, you know, I was really much more inward.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what sorority did you join?
Speaker 2: AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and now what about other courses, and other teachers, and figures at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, I took the, I took the usual liberal arts courses.  I never was that fond of science, sorry about that, but (laughter), but--
Speaker 1: Apologies to Dr. Chappell [HistoryMaker Emmett Chappelle].
Speaker 2: --(laughter) but I did well, I did well in the sciences, too.  And I don't think I took any math.  I managed not to take that.  I liked history, too, and let me see, oh, philosophy, I had a course in philosophy and, oh, lord, I can't think of the man's name--very, very famous philosopher.  But I took those usual courses and then, in my junior year, I focused more on the, the literature, literature courses, and had some very--that's when I had Arthur P. Davis and, and some others.
Speaker 1: Now was--
Speaker 2: Taylor, what was his name, Dr. Taylor, Ivan Taylor [Ivan E. Taylor]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had Ivan Taylor and--
Speaker 1: In, in philosophy?
Speaker 2: In, in English--
Speaker 1: English, okay.
Speaker 2: --English, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, was some of the other, was Howard Thurman still there in (unclear) or--
Speaker 2: He would have been in the school of religion [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.].  And I really didn't--that was in another part of the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of, well, William Leo Hansberry, did you have any courses from him?
Speaker 2: I didn't have him, but I knew him--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --just a little bit.  But then, I, I was, I was truly astounded and, and delighted with, but to be surrounded by scholars like that, and actually to see things that they had written in books or, or in the magazines or whatever.  So, it was--Howard was really a good experience for me in a lot of ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, what about the president, Mordecai Johnson?  He was president then, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, we had to go to the chapel every--I think it was every Tuesday.  Anyway, it was once a week.  I was impressed by his oratory.  His son was going there, and his son was a, a ladies man, and, and I think we knew more about the son than about Mordecai.  I thought he was kind of pompous at times.  He was kind of, I don't know, seemed to have quite an ego, but I liked to hear him speak, although sometimes he could preach on and on and on.  But it's a pleasant memory now.
Speaker 1: Well, what about E. Franklin Frazier?  That's another name that's really big from those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he, I never had him, but he was there, he was there then.  And later, when I was, when, when I got into sociology, and things like that, I read some of his, some of his works.
Story_ID: 647807
Speaker 1: Were there, what about the women at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  Were they, did they have, was the faculty balanced in terms of men and women and--?
Speaker 2: No, there were more, more men, many more men.  I had Margaret Butcher [Margaret Just Butcher] for English, and she was really, again, a sort of role model for me, and she was a good, nice person to talk to.  I remember I wanted to impress her.  And one time, she was teaching 'Moby Dick' [Herman Melville].  I've always loved 'Moby Dick,' and I wrote an essay on the symbolic, the symbolism of the whiteness of the whale.  And somehow, it meant, when I encountered her years later, she remembered that essay, and mentioned it to me, but I didn't remember.  I really, I really got carried away with the whiteness of the whale.
Speaker 1: What did you say about the whale?
Speaker 2: I don't know what I said about it (laughter).  But it seemed like I saw many levels in the whiteness of, of the whale, but I've, I've often wished that I had that, that essay somewhere 'cause I would like to read it, and see what, what the heck I did say.  Oh, I'll tell you one, one good thing, too, at Howard.  We met Richard Wright.  Richard Wright came to the campus.  He was in town for some other reason, but I was about a junior, or even a senior by that time.  And I remember they called the English majors together, and we all sat around a table in the library, and there was Richard Wright.  I got him to, to sign a card, 'cause that's all I had was some note cards, and he just signed his name.  Everybody was getting his autograph.  And it came across that when I moved from where I lived to here [Charlestown Retirement Community, Catonsville, Maryland], and I'm going through stuff, I came across that card with Richard Wright's name signed to it, and it, it didn't have any monetary value because it just said, Richard Wright.  Anybody can do that, but I gave it to my friend, Floyd Hayes [Floyd W. Hayes III], who, the two of us taught a course some time ago at UMBC, University of Maryland, Baltimore County [Baltimore, Maryland].  And Floyd got so intrigued with Richard Wright that I knew he would appreciate that card, so I gave it, I gave it to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what about some of any of the other noble writers come through to talk at Howard?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see.  I can't remember anybody else much when I was there.
Speaker 1: Did Langston Hughes come through at all?
Speaker 2: No, I did meet Langston Hughes when, when I was teaching at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and that was quite a, quite a pleasure, too, but, you know, when in the presence of greatness, I get very silent.  And I guess my old lack of self esteem is still inside and I, I just don't say anything very much, so I'm not terribly noticeable.  But, yeah, I did meet Langston, I met a whole lots of writers and--
Story_ID: 647808
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If you were trying to read African American literature in those days, what would you read?  I mean, were there, were there journals and, or publications (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that you can read, like good writers and--
Speaker 2: --yes, there, there were, there were.  And certainly we, you know, we did know about Langston Hughes, so I, I read a lot of his stuff then and, and I still, I still love his works.  But there were, there were other--and Richard Wright, of course.   Once you'd met Richard Wright, you certainly had to go back and, and read his stuff.  Even if you had read it, you wanted to read it again.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite work of Richard Wright in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a novella and, again, I can't think of the, the name of that, but it's in, it's not in 'Eight Men,' "The Man Who Lived Underground."  That's what it was because I have taught that and it was in 'Eight Men,' but anyway, I have taught that and it is a pleasure to teach.  There is so much symbolism--I like teaching symbolism.  There's so much symbolism in that, and so much in just the, his technique of writing.  He really is one of my favorite authors, although sometimes he's a little bit difficult to read because of the violence in, in so much of what he had.  I've had students who couldn't read some of his works that I've taught.
Speaker 1: That's something, I've heard that before--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I've even experienced that where a scene is so tense that you don't want to read it.
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: The tension has built up to a point that you don't even want to read it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, that's true.  And, and his realism is so detailed, it's kind of, kind of scary.  But I guess that's what a good writer does is to get inside of you, yeah.
Speaker 1: In those days, would, so Langston Hughes, I suppose Langston Hughes and Richard Wright would be the preeminent black writers in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and then Baldwin [James Baldwin], came, came along a little bit later.  And, oh, he's a remarkable, again, one of my favorite phrases, although it's not a very happy phrase.  I remember in one of his essays--now, I just cannot remember which one, Baldwin says, someone had asked him about his childhood and he say, he didn't have any great, happy memories of childhood.  He said, "What I do know is that I most certainly wouldn't want to go back and live it again," (laughter).  I feel that way, too.  I would not want to live my childhood again.  Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So--
Story_ID: 647809
Speaker 1: As we were saying earlier, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was like a breath of fresh air for you to get away from home (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was.  I was living in the dormitory.  I did not have to deal with my family.  I was very sad about what seemed to be going down with them.  And, of course, my, my brother's [H. Maceo Williams, Jr.] condition has always been, and still is, a source of, of great pain to me.  But I got away from, well, I got away from it all, but the other thing is that my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] was still teaching in Washington [D.C.] then.  And the school where she taught [Deanwood Elementary School; George Washington Carver Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] was not that far from Howard.  It was within walking distance, so I had to report in every now and then, go over there so she could take a look at me.  And then, I, I went home frequently because I was so close.  My mother used to say, "What do you mean, you, you can't come home this weekend?  Your father [H. Maceo Williams, Sr.] doesn't have long to live."  She always thought people were going to die and, of course, my father did live a long time after that, thank heaven.  But nevertheless, it was good to be in what was basically my own place in a dormitory with, with roommates that I liked and, and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the fellow students at Howard? Do you have anybody that we would know, or who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, mostly people in the dormitory--we hung out together.  But there was my friend, Delores Douglas [ph.]--her name was then--from Baltimore [Maryland].  And we, we were roommates the whole time we were at Howard.  And, in fact, I just talked to her a few days ago.  Oh, my, and my good friend, Gwendolyn [Gwendolyn Lamont]--her name was Grigsby then, Lamont.  She died about what--seven, five, seven years ago.  But Gwen, and Delores, and I hung out together, saw each other through various love affairs (laughter), or crushes, or whatever (laughter) you want to call the things.  And we still sort of sustain each other.  Delores became a pharmacist.  She's, of course, retired now.  And Gwen became an English teacher, and she remained very close to me for the whole rest of her life.  Then, there were some other girls in the dorm that, that we liked, too.  There was Geraldine [ph.]--what was her name, her last name--anyway, she became my supervisor.  She went into social work and, yeah, and she was my supervisor when I worked at the Department of Public Welfare [Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare; Baltimore City Department of Social Services] many years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, oh, were you talking about Alain Locke [Alain LeRoy Locke] before, the philosopher, the philosophy teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's Alain Locke.
Speaker 2: Alain Locke?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I would see him on campus.  He was a kind of a little man.  And I was really, you know, how you, you are not always impressed with, with people.  He was in philosophy, so I figure his head was going to be way off somewhere.  The man wasn't like that at all, but when later when I was reading his book, 'The New Negro' ['The New Negro: An Interpretation,' Alain LeRoy Locke], that was, I, that's when I really, truly admired him; and I read some, some others of his things.  Yeah, oh, definitely Alain Locke.
Story_ID: 647810
Speaker 1: Now, had you determined to go on to graduate school right after graduation then?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was no question.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, as you said, you graduated magna cum laude in 1948, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, you went right over, right to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and Columbia was accepting us, so I went on right on there.
Speaker 1: Now, were you able to go for free because of the State of Maryland or--
Speaker 2: Heck, no.  Oh, oh, the State of Maryland, let me tell you about the State of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were the days when black folks were, and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], in particular, were protesting the segregated school systems and so forth, and getting, getting ready for the whole integration of schools.  But the powers that be, of course, hung on to what, what they had to keep us out.  One thing that they did, figuring that this would make it right, if you lived in Maryland, you could not go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  That was out, but to appease us, they said, if you want to major in something that they do not offer at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but do offer someplace else, they would, they would give you a scholarship.  They called it a state, a state scholarship, but it really was just to keep us quiet or to, to, you know, to maintain their segregated system.  So, I had a, I had a state scholarship the whole time I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and I believe I had it at Columbia, too, so (laughter), and I never wanted to go any place, but Howard to begin with.  And, and I was satisfied with Columbia.  I wanted to, to go to New York [New York].  In fact, I wanted to move to New York, but my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] wouldn't let me do it (laughter).

Speaker 1: All right.  So, in 1948, you're at Columbia University in New York City [New York, New York], just steps away from Harlem [New York, New York]; and this is the first time you've been in an all-white institution basically, or a majority white institution.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I enjoyed Columbia, too.  I made friends there.  In, in fact, well, of course, I already knew that the man [Charles S. Collier] that I eventually married 'cause we went to high school together [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], but he was in New York.  He was going to NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  And I guess, that's another reason I wanted to go to Columbia (laughter), so I would be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was going to ask that question.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  And so, I already had one friend up there, but I got to make friends with other students at Columbia.  And one thing I liked about Columbia, even though I didn't take advantage of it, was that you didn't have to go to class, but you did have to pass the exams.  They did two four hour exams at the end of your stay there, so you had to go to class if you were going to pass the exams, but I liked that.  I liked the freedom of at least having the choice, but I went to class anyway.  I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 647812
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're working on a master's degree in English?
Speaker 2: Master of arts in, in English.  It was in American literature from 1870 on, and I, I learned a lot, I read a lot, I learned a lot.  And that's when I, I, I was ready.  I had gotten myself a job, and--summer job in New York [New York], and my mother [Eugenia Jackson Williams] made me come home (laughter), so that was that.
Speaker 1: Now, you worked on a paper about one of your professors, right--
Speaker 2: Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown].
Speaker 1: Sterling Brown--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that was a good experience.  I, I--sometime, decades later, I, I read over that, over that paper.  And I said, gee, I, I was kind of dumb 'cause I didn't, I left out this, or I didn't put in that, or what, and however--I don't know what I thought was dumb about, but it was a good experience writing that paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, and we became friends, Sterling and, and I, we hung out with some of the same people, and especially when I taught at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I would encounter him and, you know, he's a good person to talk to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you, I guess, what was your major theme about Sterling Brown?  What were you saying about him in your thesis?
Speaker 2: Oh, Sterling, Sterling's work certainly is poetry, focused a lot on the folk Negro, the people who worked hard, or didn't work hard, or didn't work or, and were just vulnerable to all kinds of things.  And, and one thing I liked was that he used the language, the vernacular of the people and, and what he wrote was so loving, and so humane although some of it, of course, was very, was, was militant.  As it had to be, wrote protest things, and it just opened my eyes to so, to so much that--well, he was a major figure anyway, as you know, in, in literature, but to actually have seen the man in the flesh, talked to him, interviewed him, and then became, you know, a friend.  It was, it was a marvelous experience.
Speaker 1: Now, were interviews a part of your thesis, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I would talk to him, and he would tell me all kinds of things about his poetry.  And I, I was very shy as, as I still am and, and I, I probably would have been able to go into more depth but, but I, I really got a lot--I don't think the people at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] knew anything about our literature or about Sterling Brown.
Speaker 1: So, did that make it riskier?  I mean a riskier project to report about an author they never heard of before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably, but I mean, I, I was too naive to know.  In fact, what I did, I didn't get any help from anybody there.  I really--what I did, I'd finish my classwork, and I just came, had I finished it--well, I didn't go to any more classes, but I came home.  I got married, I got pregnant.  The, my, my son [Charles M. Collier] was born on one Thursday, and graduation from, from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] was the following Thursday.  I did not go to graduation, needless to say.
Speaker 1: Now, who was your advisor at Columbia?
Speaker 2: I have forgotten her name.  It was a woman--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I can't, can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But all your professors were white at Columbia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there any black faculty members there that you remember?
Speaker 2: Not that I knew--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --nor students.  I don't remember any black students there but me.  So, I, yes, I did make friends with, well, they were, they were white friends.  They were nice people.  They were good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember meeting any black people up there except for, except Charles [Charles S. Collier], the man that I eventually married.  I didn't meet him there but--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --that was my only black friend.
Story_ID: 647813
Speaker 1: Did you take advantage of Harlem [New York, New York] being footsteps away?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, indeed.  Yes, I spent a lot of time in Harlem, um-hm.  I really liked it.  It was, it was nice being surrounded by our culture.  And I had learned by that time to appreciate it and not, not feel like it was anything wrong with it, like there was something inferior about our culture.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any cultural experiences at Harlem you can share with us from those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked just, just walking down the street, and seeing the people and, and the apartment houses, and things like that.  What, what was the name of that restaurant, oh shoot.  Now, Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], and Langston Hughes both lived in Harlem.  I didn't see either one of them then.  There was a famous restaurant then and I can't think of the name of it now, but--
Speaker 1: Was that Sylvia's [Sylvia's Restaurant, New York, New York], is that the one or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Syl- I don't think Sylvia's was there then.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I had been to Sylvia's, but maybe I'll think of the name of that, too.  But when, when people would come to visit, you'd take them, you'd take them to that restaurant.  And it was, it was right there in the heart of Harlem, and good ole southern cooking and it, it was really nice.  I went, we went to a club once where Lead, Lead Belly was singing, and went with a bunch of friends.  And I remember the cold beer, the pitchers of cold beer that, that we drank, sitting there, listening to Lead Belly 'cause I was fascinated by his name for one thing (laughter).  And there were, there were other kinds of experiences.  I would go through the park and from, 'cause I lived in Harlem, and go through the park, to, to school at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  It was a totally different, different world, come back, go through the park again, and I'd be back in Harlem.  So, yes, I, I spent a great deal of time there.  My landlady was a character, and I don't remember what there was about her but she, she seemed much like a--I don't know, there's something about her that, that sort of got on my nerves a little bit, but--
Speaker 1: Would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) she had a brother named Michali [ph.] who was very nice, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you live on the, in the dorm at Columbia or did you live--?
Speaker 2: No, I lived in a, in this lady's apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had rented out a part of the apartment to me.  I had a room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 647814
Speaker 1: When you get, gets toward graduation, you have a whirlwind experience, yeah, getting married [to Charles S. Collier], having a baby, the graduating; all this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  You know, so I, I did not attend that graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated [from Columbia University, New York, New York] in 1950, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it says here that you started as a caseworker in Baltimore [Maryland] shortly thereafter, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I couldn't get a job anywhere else.  You could always get a job at DPW if you had a, a bachelor's degree.  You didn't need a master's [degree], of course.  You wouldn't've needed one in English anyway.  But that, but that, too, was a marvelous experience being at, at, they called it DPW, Department of Public Welfare [Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare; Baltimore City Department of Social Services].  I learned so much by just talking to the clients.  I think I would be a little bit frightened to go into some of the places I went to now because they've turned a little bit different.  But in those days, I would go into people's homes, into their apartments, or their furnished rooms, and talk to them, do the reconsiderations, as we called them, and there's where my writing came in handy.  And, in fact, in my writing in my stories, some of those people came back to me, just like my [maternal] great-grandmother [Ellen Jackson] did.  And I would, I would reach out and, and welcome their images, their spirits, and it was good, it was a good experience.  I learned a lot of humanity, just humanness, that's the word I'm looking for, in seeing what those people had gone through just to be alive.  And some of them didn't know where their families were.  Some of them were living with their families and taking care of them, and it was--some, some of the rules and regulations seemed to me, kind of, kind of weird.  I, I don't know, I don't know how people could live the way the welfare department expected you to live.  You certainly couldn't have a boyfriend because if you had a man coming to your house, he was--the welfare department decided that he was obligated to support you and your whole family.  That seems a little odd, so you, you had to, to not have that kind of companionship of course people did, 'cause next thing you know, somebody came up pregnant.  We used to have a saying that when the spring time came, when the coats came off, the truth came out so (laughter).  I liked my--the people who worked with me there, they were, you had to have a sense of humor because you saw so much of human suffering that if you hadn't have a sense of humor somewhere along the line, you would go into a terrible depression.
Speaker 1: What's the--can you think of the worst thing you, situation you encountered?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Well, well, I'll tell you what, the most gratifying thing first.  I started out in public assistance which was, you know, giving out money, but I moved to children's division, and that's when I decided I was going to go back to school and get my master's in social work.  I did not because they had an opening for me at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but I experienced the--getting to know some of those children, and I really love some of those kids.  I guess the worst thing was the way some of those kids had been treated and abused by their own parents.  That was hard to know about.  The old people in public, when I was in public assistance, the old people moved me greatly because so many of them had nothing, and to, to grow old and be in that kind of condition was, was really awful.  So, I, I got to see a lot of what could happen to people, and it deepened my whole self, deepened my personality.
Story_ID: 647815
Speaker 1: Tell us about your husband, Mr. Collier.
Speaker 2: All right.  His name is Charles Collier [Charles S. Collier], and he painted some of the pictures around here.  My favorite is the one that's, that's facing you right there.  I had just had my second son [Robert N. Collier], so I was about twenty-four at that, at that point.  He's an artist.  I think he did a good job on portraits especially.  The marriage just didn't work out because we were so young.  We had met in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and got married in, right after I finished graduate school [Columbia University, New York, New York].  Meanwhile, he had gone into the [U.S. military] service and all, all of that.  He's still--we're still friends.  He lives about five minutes from, from here.  So, he's, he's still around--I'm still around.  I would help him if he needed help, and if I could do it so, you know, we're, we're okay.  We got three children together, so we've got something in common.
Speaker 1: So, how long were you married?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was not a fly by night thing, but we were just too young.  We were boxed in by segregation here; and there were just too many, too many things.
Story_ID: 647816
Speaker 1: You joined the faculty at Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in '55 [1955] so--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so did you work for the welfare department [Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare; Baltimore City Department of Social Services] until, until then, for five years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, wait a minute.  I, I worked--well, first, for the welfare department.  I was there about several years.  And then, then I went to Morgan, as I said, from there, from children's division.  I was a, I was the lowest of the low on the faculty.  I was a substitute something or other.
Speaker 1: Like an adjunct professor or something or--
Speaker 2: Something like that.  It wasn't adjunct.  It was--oh, what is that term that they had for?  Anyway, you couldn't, you couldn't be there and be any lower on the scale.  And my salary was something like $2,040 a year, something like that.  And I had, wow (laughter), that was a long time ago.  But, anyway, I liked it, I liked the, I liked teaching, and I've been teaching ever since.  And I realized that in my writing, I was, I was still teaching.  It was a good time that--let's see, the following year, Homer Favor came.  He was one of the Goon Squad here.
Speaker 1: And what did he do?  Was he a, the--
Speaker 2: He was--what was he in--sociology or something [sic. economy]?
Speaker 1: A professor?
Speaker 2: He was a professor--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause were all young teachers at that time.
Speaker 1: Homer Favor--now, tell us about, since you, what, had the Goon Squad been formed yet in '65 [1965] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was new, he was new in town and, eventually, he became involved with the Union Baptists [Union Baptist Church, Baltimore, Maryland] with Vernon and, Vernon Dobson [HistoryMaker Reverend Vernon Dobson], and they became, you know, then some others, and they became the Goon Squad.  Harry Jones [Harry L. Jones] was a very brilliant scholar in English, and he was a good friend of mine.  Waters Turpin and Jean Turpin, husband and wife, were in the department.  Waters was a novelist, playwright, and he was involved in theater.  See, I'm, I'm caught on a name again, a little short, cute, cute little man, who was one of the major scholars, critics, a bibliographer.  He did a bibliography of African American literature, early on, when people just weren't doing that--Darwin Turner.
Speaker 1: Darwin Turner--
Speaker 2: Darwin Turner.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Darwin Turner.
Speaker 2: Darwin was there.  [HistoryMaker] Richard Long, Richard was, was at Morgan.
Speaker 1: Richard Long, he's another figure that is well known, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you co-authored a book ['Afro-American Writing: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry,' edited by Richard A. Long and Eugenia W. Collier] with him, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --an anthology with him.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Richard ended up in Atlanta [Georgia] and, yes, I did.  He was a good friend, he was another good friend.
Speaker 1: So, these are, this is a pretty strong department and literature or, or--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --strong group of people.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Any other, well, women involved in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was a girl who came same time, time that I did.  Fannie Chester [Fannie E. Chester], and then, I can't think of her last name right now, another, just really brilliant, really brilliant people were there.  You could, you could hardly go out your, out your office door without running into somebody that was bright, either on the way toward becoming a published author, or already was a published author.
Story_ID: 647817
Speaker 1: So, well now, were you writing at this period of time yourself, were you writing stories and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but let (laughter), let me tell you about the stories.  Before I wrote the story, 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier], which was in--I wrote that in something like 1964.  But I told you about how just the, all the literature that, that I was taught, that I read, most of it was white literature, and that's what I thought, thought it was, it was supposed to be.  Well, the stories that I wrote, they talked, the characters talked like black folks 'cause that's what I was hearing, but they were, the characters were white people, I mean, so they were weird.  They, they were not anything known to man, but when I, when I was at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], I wrote, I wrote 'Marigolds.'  And by that time, I had been through Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown], through, you know, student welfare department, your--I had experienced my own culture much more in, in a much different way.  And that is when I started using the black experience as what I wanted to write about, to understand it better to, to make, make those experiences known in, in a sympathetic manner, and so forth.  So, yes, I was writing, I was writing then.  I didn't publish 'Marigolds' until '69 [1969].  That was a long time to live through from '64 [1964] to '69 [1969].  And I would gather stories.  Harry told me a story, Harry Jones [Harry L. Jones] told me he used to talk about his family who used to be sharecroppers.  And I got a story out of that--'Sweet Potato Pie' [Eugenia Collier], that has been published in a number of things.  So, I was finding stories everywhere, stories much more than, than poetry.  I have written a little bit of poetry, but not, I'm not really that much of a poet, but I, I was writing, yes, not a--
Story_ID: 647818
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, I think Gwendolyn Brooks had, had like reached, you know, some prominence as a poet by then, right, by '55 [1955] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ab- absolutely, absolutely, and I tell you, I was so highly honored when I did publish 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier].  In '69 [1969], Negro Digest published it.  And Gwendolyn Brooks offered a prize every year for the best, best story, the best poem, the best something or other else, and I got the prize that year for the best story for 'Marigolds.'
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was, I was just so honored that Gwendolyn Brooks had even read my story, let alone selected--well, what, between, I don't know whether she selected or (unclear) did, but it was just wonderful to get the Gwendolyn Brooks' prize.  It was something like a $150 which was a fortune to me at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, this is---I know you said.  I think if it was a Gwendolyn Brooks' prize, Gwendolyn Brooks definitely read it.  If you know her--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --or you knew her, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --that Gwendolyn Brooks definitely would read it.  And the other thing is that we--I guess it's supposed we better go back and tell the story of how you wrote 'Marigolds' and--
Speaker 2: Oh, then, heavens (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause this is a seminal work that's all over the place now; it's published in anthologies.  A lot of people have read it.
Story_ID: 647819
Speaker 1: So tell us, now, you started writing this in '64 [1964].  This is nine years after you started teaching at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, but you weren't at Morgan for nine years, were you?
Speaker 2: I was at Morgan, yeah, for ten, ten years or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I thought you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eight, nine, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I thought you were at another--'cause they have you at Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore City Community College, Baltimore, Maryland] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did go to CCB from there.  I, I don't know, I don't know about all of that.
Speaker 1: Maybe it was ten years, yeah, okay, but, okay, 'Marigold' [Eugenia Collier], this is '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: This was '64 [1960] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were still at Morgan.
Speaker 2: And I, I remember it was '64 [1964] because I was pregnant with my third child [Philip Collier].  And the marriage [to Charles S. Collier] was not going well.  In fact, it was going terrible.  And I was, I was just sort of, I felt like I was like, I was like in a room with no exit and no windows.  I just felt boxed in.  I didn't know which way to turn.  I didn't know anything and I was dreadfully unhappy.  And then, just one, one night for some reason, I don't know why, I just sat down and started writing.  I had, had this story in mind for a while, but just didn't get around to it.  So, at this point, I--while I was sitting up in bed--I just started writing.  And I kept writing, and I kept writing, and I couldn't stop.  It was like I was, was just pursued by something.  And to tell the truth, I have not changed but one word in the story since then.  It just came pouring out.  That is not the way you're supposed to write.  You're supposed to make--go back and make revisions, but I didn't make any.
Story_ID: 647820
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you, you worked all night and--?
Speaker 2: I worked all night.  I, I just wrote and wrote.  I did, did give my boys their dinner or whatever, whatever you had to do, but called in sick the next day, and went right back to writing.  And I did feel a sense of release when I had finished the writing.  Since then, I've changed nothing, except for that one, one word.  And there was a sentence at the end that, that Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] took out when it finally got published.  But anyway, life went on as it, as it does, and I didn't do anything with the story ['Marigolds,' Eugenia Collier].  I did read--there was a magazine I was reading, Writers magazine [The Writer], that would tell you, you know, how to write, what to do, and so forth.  There was a, an agency that you could send your work to, along with a fee, and they would tell you how to make it publishable and then, you know, and you could rewrite whatever, and send it back, or else they would tell you it's hopeless, don't even bother, but it, it went like that.  So I, I after a while, I got my little money together and sent them the story and a check.
Speaker 1: How much did it cost to do it?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, but it would, it, if it cost anything, it was more than I could afford in other days.  Well, I waited and waited and, finally, they wrote back, sent the story back, and said, "Thank you for submitting your story, but it is really hopeless.  There is nothing you can do," and they said, "you have no plot.  Where," I remember this one in particular--, "where, where, Mrs. Collier [HistoryMaker Eugenia Collier], is your plot?"  And they said, "There's no conflict because these people are poor, and have always been poor, and always will be poor.  So, there's no conflict."  I wish I had kept that letter.  I would be getting the best laugh in the world, so I just put it in the, back in the drawer where all other neglected and awful things went, and forgot about it.  Well, some years later, I met Hoyt Fuller who was the editor of Negro Digest.  I met him through [HistoryMaker] Richard Long in Atlanta [Georgia].  In fact, I think it was my first trip south ever.  And I told Hoyt that I had sent him a, a manuscript, but I hadn't heard anything from him, and only, to me, that was just the way it was.  I wasn't good at doing anything, so I said to myself, so why would I expect to be able to publish anything?  Hoyt, when he returned to Chicago [Illinois], Hoyt dug up the story out of whatever, whatever pile of manuscripts he had, and read the story.  And he wrote me the most wonderful letter.  "Where have you been all this time?  Why have you not been writing?"  And he loved the story, and he published it in the November '69 [1969] issue of Negro Digest.  After that, as I said, I got the Gwendolyn Brooks' prize.  I also had--what is the man's name--anyway, someone wanted to use it in an anthology and since then, it has really made the rounds.  It has been published in middle school textbooks. It has been published in African American anthologies, and I am just so pleased with it.  I've had students to write to me from all, all over the place, and to call me.  And I've spoken to, to classes here about the story, the latest being right here at Catonsville High School [Catonsville, Maryland], just a few, a few weeks back.
Story_ID: 647821
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, yeah, the story ['Marigolds,' Eugenia Collier] has taken on a life of its own in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: It really has.
Speaker 1: And kind, kind of give us a synopsis of what it, what it's about.
Speaker 2: It's a story of growing up.  It's set in--I just said rural Maryland 'cause I didn't know where specifically to set it.  It's about a family during the Depression [Great Depression], black family, who have really had a hard time of it.  The father is out of work.  The mother [Maybelle] is a domestic.  The older children have been parceled out to relatives so it's, it had been a bigger family than what it is.  And all that's left is this girl named Lizabeth and her brother, younger brother [Joey].  Well, it's a very sensitive time in a child's life.  It's the end of, of summer, and the elder kids are just bored with not being in school, but they still, still don't necessarily want to be in school.  But they don't know what to do with themselves.  And so, one day, the--just to have something to do, they go over to Miss Lottie's house.  That's the lady that is my [maternal] great-grandmother [Ellen Jackson].  Miss Lottie also has, Miss Lottie's house is, is so beat up.  It looks like a house you make out of cards and if you blow on it, it's going to fall over.  That's what her house is like.  She also has a son [John Burke] who is mentally disabled, and he just sits and rocks all day long.  There's one thing Miss Lottie has.  She has created beauty in creating a little garden, a little patch of marigolds.  The children just want somebody to pick on and they, they like to say she was a witch, and they are not terribly nice.  Well, the, the, chil- there's a little, little bunch of children, including Lizabeth, who is the oldest, who go over to Miss Lottie's house, and start taunting her.  She's out there digging in the ground or doing whatever you do with marigolds.  And they start making, start dancing around and, and singing, "Old lady witch, fell in a ditch," and, and all of that.  Well, Miss Lottie has had enough of all of it, and so, she--what'd she do--she picks up a rock, a stone, and throws the stone.  No, wait a minute, no, it doesn't go--see, I don't remember my own story.  They throw a stone at her marigolds, and she stands up and hollers at them.  Well, the kids run.
Story_ID: 647822
Speaker 1: But here's where the growing up part comes.  Lizabeth feels ashamed.  She's too big to be doing stuff like that.  She doesn't know, she doesn't know what to do.  In the dead of the night, kids are in bed, but they can hear their parents talking through the walls.  The father is in total despair because he can't get a job and, in fact, he weeps.  She has never heard her father weep.  She grows up a little bit more from that.  She doesn't know exactly what to do.  She, she knows she's got to do, she can't do anything for him but, but her whole insides are just sort of boiling.  She gets up, goes out the window, she's going out.  Her brother [Joey], little brother is tagging along behind her.  She goes--doesn't know where she's going, but she goes over to Miss Lottie's house, and she has such a hatred for those marigolds.  She gets in Miss Lottie's garden and just pulls them all out, destroys the garden, and looks up finally, and there's Miss Lottie standing over her.  She says, at that moment, 'cause the, the story is told by, by Lizabeth, grown.  At that moment, she felt compassion.  She felt something she had not felt before and that was her growing up point, time.  She looks around.  She can't do anything about the marigolds--she has destroyed them.  And that moment is her moment of turning a corner, of growing up.  And, and that's about it.  There's no great plot to it if they're looking for some kind of a plot, but I just wanted to use the symbol of the marigolds.  The one spot of beauty in that terrible little neighborhood town, whatever.  Miss Lottie never plants marigolds again.  It has destroyed something in her.  And the sentence that Hoyt [Hoyt W. Fuller] took out, the last sentence in the, in the story was supposed to be that as I, Miss, Miss Lizabeth, grown up Elizabeth, "I, I'm, it's strange that I should think of those marigolds now as I wait for you who will not come."  That was my own pessimism there.  Hoyt took the sentence out, and it's much better without that sentence.  So, that's 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier] somehow or another it has appealed to different people.  And, oh, in fact, I was so pleased and so tickled.  A teacher--oh, where, way, way out of town, a teacher wrote to me and said that her students had read 'Marigolds' and how much they liked it, and how much she enjoyed teaching it every, every year, whatever.  And so, what she did, she had, the, the last sentence, the last existing sentence--oh, the last existing sentence was, "And I, too, have planted marigolds."  That's the end of it.  She said she liked it so much that she had that last sentence tattooed on her side (laughter) so.  I said, "Whoa, no greater tribute can anybody make," oh my goodness.

Speaker 1: So, though, though you've written, you started writing when you were in school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  This is the first piece ['Marigolds,' Eugenia Collier] that was published in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First thing I ever had published.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, this is 1969.  Now, you're in your, you're forty-one at this point, right?
Speaker 2: I guess--I mean I don't do arithmetic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have to do the arithmetic.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that sound about right.
Speaker 2: It sounds about right, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I mean I had been teaching and been around for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is, now, were you at this point, participating in, was there any writers' workshops going on in the Baltimore [Maryland] area that you--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --'cause I know you got Lucille Clifton here, and other people here that really, and all that faculty at Morgan, all those great writers, was there any, was there a writers' workshop or a group?
Speaker 2: I, probably, I really didn't learn anything from, you know.  It's just something I, I learned from reading.  I have taught in workshops.  I have taken a couple of workshops since then, but by that time, I had already been writing all I was going to write.  Lucille was a neighbor of mine by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a friend and just a wonderful person.  I wish I'd known her better there.  You know, there are people you, you wish that you had pursued a closer relationship with, but we were friends.  I had most of her books.
Speaker 1: Did she teach at Morgan, too, when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, she taught at, at Coppin [Copping State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] where I also taught but, but this was, I taught there after she had left.  Yeah, she, she was a great person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there was no, so there was no group that was formed to--
Speaker 2: I can't think of any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  I think I was still at Morgan, maybe not, I used to go to a workshop in Washington [D.C.], and that's when I, I did learn a lot of things there.  We, we would read our works to each other, and then comment, criticize, say what we like, what we didn't like, and so forth, and that was a really, a good group.  I so enjoyed that.  There were some good writers in that group, yeah.
Story_ID: 647824
Speaker 1: All right, would you, what would you, how would you describe your writing style and--?
Speaker 2: Well, and we're just talking about fiction and poetry and stuff because I have written critical essays.  That's a little bit different, all of it focusing on black life, black literature, and so forth 'cause that's what I was really, really into.  How would I des- describe my--well, I'm a very careful writer.  I learned to write by teaching composition.  I did not like teaching composition, but I learned a lot, so that you will find my sentence structure--I can't say flawless because you make mistakes and don't know you've made them.  But I'm very careful with sentence structure, with beginnings and endings, and titles and, and just all, all of those, those things, with going back and crossing out superfluous words--all those things that I, I tell students to do, I do them myself.  So, there is that.  In terms of subject matter, and here's where my really cruddy childhood comes in.  So much of it is sad, and I've been told that, I didn't realize it, that I was writing about sad things because really, pain is much more interesting than joy.  So, that's, that's a part of it.  But that, just let me see, is that, what else can I tell you?  It's hard, it's hard to say about your own writing.
Speaker 1: Like, what, do you, are you, I guess, I don't know, is there any, is there another writer that you think you write similar to, that you know of, or one that you admire or try to be like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not, not now.  I think, oh, what, years and years ago when I first discovered Robert Frost, I really liked his, his works.  You know, language is so important.  Well, that goes without saying, but Frost language was so fairly simple, but what he said was, was very complex.  Frost wrote in the vernacular, and you didn't have to look up the words or anything like that, and I liked that.  And so for a while, I was trying, I would write like Robert Frost, but I think that didn't last too long.  I just sort of tried to like, write like myself.
Story_ID: 647825
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Can I read you a poem--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --if we have time.  This is a, as I said, I'm not primarily a poet.  But I was telling you, I was a most unhappy child and this poem was written, oh, not too long ago, maybe about five years or so ago.  And it's based on reality.  It's called 'Nightmare House' [ph.].  "That house / even now / comes back to me in dreams / nightmares / dimly lit / where unseen horrors lurk / where dead things walk again / where my own dead self cringes.  The house of my childhood / the spawning ground for what I was to be / and waking / drenched in sweat / drenched in fear/ I smother under unremembered memories in my own hidden hate.  For she cries out to me / even now / the child who was never a child / the child without mother or father.  The house nigger brought in to serve / invisible / unheard / untouched / even now / in nightmares / that house comes back."  I was a pretty unhappy child--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because this was written, you know, when I was in my sixties or so.  And I haven't had those nightmares lately, not for a long time.
Speaker 1: You have nightmares about, you used to have nightmares about growing up?
Speaker 2: About my, the house where I grew up.  Can I read you just one more?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: Just, just so that you will know that my story has a happy ending.  This is called, this is a love poem.  It's called 'Salmon and Saxophones' [ph.].  "Words glide like schools of salmon / slipping helter skelter up a stream of ideas / as we munch barbeque ribs and speak of cabbages and kings.  Words flow like blue notes from a tenor sax / as we linger on the sofa / my head on your shoulder / your fingers gently, gently stroking my hair.  The dissonance / the offbeat rhythms of all of my life pour forth and you listen / and you find them beautiful.  But when they lie entangled / flesh on flesh / and the deepest recesses of myself open to you / like morning glory.  When we mingle sweat and spirit / and the music of my soul is a hymn of Thanksgiving / no words come."  So, it's not all sad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's some happiness in here somewhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 647826
Speaker 1: Now, you're teaching [at Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] while you're, you're raising three sons, right?  You got three sons.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they, okay, so they, so at this stage, they're, they're like in high school or in your, when the poem, when the 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier] is published?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, one was just, yeah, yeah.  Phil [Philip Collier] was born in '64 [1964], so when that was published in '69 [1969], he was how old--you do the math (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the others, yeah, they were, they were, like in high school and all.  They, of course, right now, they, they are old folks.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: My, my oldest son [Charles M. Collier] is sixty-three, so they're older than I am.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So they're older than you are now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're older than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 647827
Speaker 1: Tell us now, now you wrote in '69 [1969], you co-published with Dr. Ruthe Sheffey [Ruthe T. Sheffey], 'Impressions in' ['Impressions in Asphalt: Images of Urban America in Literature,' Ruthe T. Sheffey and Eugenia Collier] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'in Asphalt'--
Speaker 1: 'Asphalt,' yeah.
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it's not much to say about that.  That was her idea and she, she suggested that we do a little anthology about this, works in the city.  That was not the most satisfying experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I don't even have a copy of that, I don't think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore City Community College, Baltimore, Maryland] until '70 [1970], from '70 [1970] to '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a teaching philosophy or a teaching style?  What would you say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so.  First of all, you have to be, excuse me, you have to be yourself.  So, I was honest with my students about everything.  When people say, "What do you teach?" You don't say, "I teach English."  You say, "I teach students."  The focus is on the students.  I was always friendly with those who needed for me to be friendly.  Students would come in my office and, sometimes, they just sit and chat when I had other things to do, but I, I chat with them to be supportive.  You know, you always have to know your subject.  So, I, I never came to class unprepared.  (Laughter) In fact, I've got note cards around here right now.  I've got to get rid of those things.  I'll never use them.  But you, you had to, you have to know what you're doing.  But never, never make anybody seem stupid or anything like that.  You have to be positive in all that you do.  I, I still have relationships with some of my students.  I'm very proud of some of them.  They've done well.
Speaker 1: Who are some of them that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, you know, one that, you would like to know if you don't already, Joanne Gabbin [HistoryMaker Joanne V. Gabbin].  She also did work on Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown], except she did a book ['Sterling A. Brown:  Building the Black Aesthetic Tradition,' Joanne V. Gabbin].  And there's a real authority on him, and also was a good, good friend of his.  She is the director of the honors program at James Mason University [sic.], J-, wait a minute.
Speaker 1: George Mason [George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia], George Mason--
Speaker 2: George Mason, James Madison--
Speaker 1: There's a James Madison and a George Mason.
Speaker 2: The one in, in Virginia (laughter).  I just wrote a check to send down there, too (laughter).  Anyway, James, James Madison [James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia], anyway, Joanne--
Speaker 1: George Mason, I think, that's probably it [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I, I can find it.  Anyway, Joanne is one of my very favorite students who has done so very, very well, and is also a really good person.  Student here named Tom Saunders [Thomas Saunders] that I taught a long time ago.  And he said, I, I really helped him to gain a direction, but he now runs tours of black Baltimore [Maryland], and also has expanded beyond that to Eastern Shore [Eastern Shore of Maryland] and other places.  But a most knowledgeable man, very, very excellent man.  That's, that's two.  Now, wait a minute, there, there are some more, and even those who didn't get to be scholars or anything like that, I'm still in touch with, and they are among my very favorite people.  So, whatever, whatever I did seems to have worked at least on, on some of them; and really, you get to love your students.  You really do.
Story_ID: 647828
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, now you worked on a number of different projects, but at some point, you decided to go back and earn a Ph.D. [from the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland], right?  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I knew I really couldn't go very far teaching in a university without a Ph.D.  So, I did, I did go back.  That was not easy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you not having a Ph.D. have anything to do with your leaving Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I left Morgan because (laughter) at that point, I was just teaching freshman English.  And that was not--it, it would pluck your very last nerve, but it wasn't all that satisfying.  So, because it was almost like you had the same class over and over every semester 'cause they were making the same errors.  And I'm teaching people where to put their commas and stuff, and it got--well, that wasn't all there was to it, but it got so that I had just had enough and--
Speaker 1: So, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oddly enough, I left a, a full blown college to go to a community college.  And there, I did get to teach American literature, which was what I had been trained to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, yeah, well, that makes sense, that makes sense.  So you were at the Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore City Community College, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a, because of that.
Speaker 2: That was a good experience, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, every place I've been, I've really, really liked.
Speaker 1: But you had to go on and get a Ph.D. to be able to teach on that level at a, at a higher institution?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 647829
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, where did you decide to go; and what was the experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I had decided some years before that, that I wanted to go.  And the best, most convenient place would have been University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] because I had a family by that time.  I couldn't just pick up and go.  But they had, the head of their, of the English department was rumored to have made a very definite statement that no Negro would ever get a Ph.D. while he was chair of the department.  So, I said, well, the heck with that.  And so, that's, I didn't, you know, I didn't pursue it at that point, but I liked what they, what the offering was, you know, this was years later at University of Maryland because my degree, my Ph.D. there would, was in, not in English, but in American civilization, which I felt would give me more leeway to do other things.  So, I got to, to take courses in folklore, for example.  I--you could do all kinds of things with, with the American civ.  And I would focus on African American literature and criticism, so my dissertation was on criticism.
Speaker 1: Who were the leading African American critics when you were going to school in those days?
Speaker 2: When I was at the University of Maryland?  Oh, they were, what, Addison Gayle [Addison Gayle, Jr.], for example.  George Kent [George E. Kent].  [HistoryMaker] Richard Long, of course--oh, all, all kinds of folks.
Speaker 1: Well, even Darwin Turner, right, I think, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Darwin, yes, Darwin Turner.  It was, it was a very rich field at that time.
Story_ID: 647830
Speaker 1: What we were doing was, among other things, was trying to see whether there was a black aesthetic--a kind of writing subject matter, and so forth, that was, that characterized a great deal of African American literature.
Speaker 2: Now this is different from the themes of the, that preceded the mid-'60s [1960s].  I guess prior to the mid-'60s [1960s], it seems as though a lot of our people were trying to prove that they were just the same as white people.
Speaker 1: See, you have now just summarized my dissertation.  That's what it was all about.  We went through several stages.  And one stage was imitation of white writing, even take Paul Laurence Dunbar's dialect poetry.  It was still written in the form of, of traditional English lyrics.  It's just that the words were misspelled to make it seem like a dialect, but if you read, look back over it, it's the same rhythm, meter, and rhyme, and so forth.  Okay, but so, so we went through that stage of imitation.  And then, trying to be just as good as, how you going to be just as good as anybody, ever?  And then, it, when, when I got to writing my dissertation, in the question of well, no, we don't have to be, don't have to write like you.  We can be different.  Now, what accounts for that difference is what we were getting into.  So, that's what I was doing.  I had a, you know, different chapters on imitation and, and then finally, what is the black aesthetic?  I don't know that I ever came to a conclusion.  I don't know that anybody ever did because now we have gone sort of into a whole 'nother thing, but--in terms of theme and form.
Speaker 2: So, a whole 'nother thing, I mean, what do you mean by that?  I mean--
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, just where you, you can't tell who's who nowadays, but nobody is trying that, that I know of--and I'm not, I'm not in the loop anymore.  But as far as I know, nobody is trying to see what is unique or, or what characterizes as African American writing because it's all now sort of the same--well, no, that's misleading.  I don't mean that everybody is writing the same.  I just mean that it's not ethnic in the way that it used to be.
Story_ID: 647831
Speaker 1: What were some of the, I guess, what were some of the essential parts of a black aesthetic?  I mean, what did, what does black writing have that makes it different?
Speaker 2: Well, we never quite got to the end of, of that.  But for one thing, the language was--let me put it this way.  The black folk people--I'm not talking about when you're highly educated.  Black folk do not talk the same as white folk.  At least, they certain- they didn't then.  There's a black vernacular that is written, is spoken to, you know, among ourselves.  One thing about the black aes- that's, that's one thing--it's just the language.  Another thing about it is that it is aimed toward, the writing is aimed toward black people.  You write about black life without having to define certain things that we know.  And maybe those that are not of our culture would not particularly know the significance of certain words and so forth.  Oh, Steve Henderson [Stephen E. Henderson], that's how you make me think of Steve's, Steve's work.  Certain words have a different intensity to black people, things, things like that.  Themes, often the themes are sort of--well, militant, yes, hopeful, sometimes.  Anyway, there's, there's a lot to it, and we, we got some of that written down.  The black aesthetic, oh, lord, what is that man's name?  I can see him standing before me just as plain--we did a lot of writing along, along that line.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know Addison Gayle [Addison Gayle, Jr.] wrote a lot about black aesthetic, you know.  A lot of people in the '60s [1960s], in the mid-'60s [1960s] especially, was like a number one topic of discussion in a lot, a lot of circles so.  So, you think nowadays, it's not so much discussed anymore or not--
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so.  I stopped reading criticism because it stopped interesting me to tell the truth.  So, I don't read too, any, any criticism anymore.  I'm much more into fiction and fiction writing and stuff, but even, even that has, has changed.  We went through the anti-man sort of thing following after women's lib [women's liberation movement].  I don't know.  It just doesn't seem to have the same kind of ginger that the old, the writing of the last generation had--to me.
Story_ID: 647832
Speaker 1: You worked as a critic.  I know you criticized 'Sanford and Son' and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, lord, that old ghost coming back (laughter).  I, I think I was much harsher in the earlier days.  Then I sort of mellowed a little bit, but many of my opinions are still the same.  I just don't go around expressing them that, that much because who's, who, who's interested, who cares.  Black folks have stopped being angry, not entirely, no, that's not a fair statement.
Speaker 1: In those days, I mean there were lots of venues, I guess, to write in to, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, so many of the old periodicals have just gone out of business and died.  So, there just isn't the same kind of venue as you're saying.
Speaker 1: Now can you--I know one was around the time that you started working on your Ph.D., Black World caved in.  Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] ceased the publication of Black World before Negro Digest.
Speaker 2: Oh, child, that was a time.  Johnson was never too supportive of Negro Digests anyway.  And just, and I think Hoyt must have gotten on his nerves, too, Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller], because, I mean, they, they were constantly battling over things.  And, finally, as, as you know, there were only two people putting out Negro Digest/Black World.  That was Hoyt and Carole Parks.  And so, one day, they went to work as usual.  And Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] came--this is the story I heard--Johnson came into the office and said, "Pack your things, go home, and you may, you need never come back."  That is what the story was and I believe it was true.
Speaker 1: What, what did you hear about the contention?  What were they contending about, or why did Johnson cease the publication of Black World (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it seemed to be just a constant battle.  I don't think he liked Hoyt's philosophy.  He was much more into popular--well, not that, not that Hoyt's viewpoint was not popular, but he, he was much more into superficial things that made money.  And I don't think Negro Digest necessarily made a whole lot of money.  But that was, it, it sort of went like that.  And have, have you ever been to their offices in Chicago [Illinois]?  Fabulous! Even the elevator changed panels with the seasons.  Wow!  And I think the two of them just--it was like a bad marriage.  It wasn't going to work.  And so, Hoyt didn't like the name Negro Digest anyway.  He says it's not a digest and he didn't like the term, Negro, at that time, so they changed the name to Black World.  And then, when that just ended, Hoyt moved to Atlanta [Georgia], as you know, and started the magazine, First World, said, "We're not the third world--we're the First World."  So, that was that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, you know, so, yeah, there are a lot of publications, so literary magazines, a lot of poetry being published.  I think there was over forty black publishers at one time, independent publishers at, you know, before, prior to the mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Was it that many?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I know there were a lot of them.
Story_ID: 647833
Speaker 1: I know you did a, they cite in here a review you did on the film, 'Conrack,' too. Do you remember that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, that was another one (laughter).  Before I saw the film, I, I did talk to some people who were from, from there, who were up here for some kind of conference or something or other.  They did not like 'Conrack.'
Speaker 1: Now, these are people from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the Sea Islands, yeah.  And I, I've forgotten which, which island, but when I saw 'Conrack,' it bugged me because in the first place, it was a, it was not so much about the black people, as it was about the man that came there.  I've forgotten his--Conrad was his name, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Well, Conrack [sic. Pat Conroy], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who had come there, and it was about his enlightenment.  He learned that black people are human beings, too, and there were a lot of things, like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'  That's what the people learned--black folks are people, too.  And, and that seemed to be like what, what that was.  Also, people seemed so stupid they were living on an island, and the children didn't know how to swim.  Now, I didn't believe that.  And, and some other things, I've forgotten some of the details, but when, when he had to leave, he had taught them classical music.  And when he had to leave, he left, they had, they had brought classical music there, and he sailed away to Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] or somebody like that.  Now, these people, they could have sung and danced and done things, but they were--progress meant becoming more like white people, white culture, and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's interesting, I've seen films of, was that, Alan Lomax, and other people go in there to record the songs of the Sea Island people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And those songs aren't presented in this movie, are they?  So.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a, oh, lord, there's so much to read and know about, and I don't know.  I, I got a lot more to talk about, come to think of it (laughter).
Story_ID: 647834
Speaker 1: But your Ph.D. was about 'Steps Towards the Black Aesthetic'--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: '--The Study of Black American Literary Criticism' [sic. 'Steps Towards a Black Aesthetic: A Study of Black American Literary Criticism,' Eugenia Collier].  And who was your advisor, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten the man's name, isn't that awful, because he was good, he was good to me, he was very good.  And he was married to a black lady.  See how it, and it's that time of life, I forget names.  I'll probably forget your name after you leave, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: This is a department that was, I guess, graduating black students at one time.
Speaker 2: I was the first black Ph.D. from that department [at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] so and he, he was very good--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and very helpful and but didn't, didn't really interfere with anything that I wanted to say and maybe some of the things I, I could have tampered some of those things, and made them a little bit more palatable.  But that was, I was deep in my militant stage then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which I still am.
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).

Speaker 1: This is 1976, so, all right.  So, now in '76 [1976], a one act play of yours called 'Ricky' [Eugenia Collier]--
Speaker 2: 'Ricky.'
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: 'Ricky' started out as a story in Black World.  Almost a novella, it was a long story, but Hoyt [Hoyt W. Fuller] published it.  It was, it was about a--well, it was based on a real friend of mine who had taken in a child off the street, and tried to help him.  But he, by that time, he was so damaged, there was not a whole lot that she could do for him.  But, anyway, it was about their relationship, and the child's name really was Ricky.  Anyway, she--so 'Ricky' started out as a, as a short story.  [HistoryMaker] Val Gray Ward, who's a friend of mine, and she's--do you know Val?  She's, she's from Chicago [Illinois].  Val hunted me down because I, when she called me, I wasn't even home.  I was in Groton, Connecticut waiting for my granddaughter to be born.  Val found me and called me and said, "Gene [HistoryMaker Eugenia Collier], you've got to write that into a play, so we can do it."  You remember she, she had this little play group.
Speaker 1: The Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Kuumba, and, and she was in tears.  She said she had, had a similar experience with a, a foster child, and that it was, it just moved her so because it was so true to life.  Well, it was true to life because I got it from life.  I said, "Val, I don't know how to write a play."  "Yes, you do, you just sit down and write it!"  So, I did (laughter), I sat down and wrote it.  And she, she gave it, she presented it in Chicago.  I went there twice to see it.  We did it here at the, when I was teaching at UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland].  I was teaching a class in, in drama and theatre, and the class decided to do my play.  We did four plays that semester.  That, that was crazy, that was crazy, but we did four, and they were all good.  And they decided to do, to do 'Ricky.'  And I'll (laughter) never forget the little girl who was directing the play.  And I went to the rehearsals, all that I could, went to one rehearsal and, and this was a very emotional director--this girl was.  At the end of the scene they were rehearsing, she got up.  She said, "Now, wait a minute, y'all got to do that again."  And she, even though she had tears running down her face, she said, "Y'all got to do that again.  You didn't do it right because I didn't cry as much as I usually cry" (laughter).  So, they did the play, and I got a standing ovation at the end of the play, which was a very, very wonderful moment for me.  And my granddaughter was in the play.  She was an infant, and it was a part where they had a courtroom scene of the little baby, so they got my granddaughter (laughter).  She was in the play.
Speaker 1: So, how large a cast does 'Ricky' have?
Speaker 2: I guess about four or five people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it wasn't a big cast.
Speaker 1: Is it, how many acts?
Speaker 2: I think it was three.  I haven't read it for years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to ask because somebody might want to check it out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, another critic, 'cause he, 'cause he saw this.  He went to see it with Sam Hay [Samuel A. Hay], and he liked it, but he gave me some pointers.  I really didn't know anything about writing a play, but--and I've always meant to go back to it and make some changes, but they, they liked it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sam liked it, except for, you know, the pointers that, that he gave me, which were very, very good.
Speaker 1: Now, what, do you have any thoughts about, you know, what would happen to 'Ricky' if it had not been a black theatre to produce it?
Speaker 2: Probably nothing, probably nothing.
Story_ID: 647836
Speaker 1: So, you joined the faculty of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 1977--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?  So, this is, you're pretty much set now, right, or I guess, is it, so does that, I mean, do you get, did you join as an associate professor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're on a track to be tenured?
Speaker 2: Except that I, I came there with tenure--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --but I never got a promotion the whole time I was there.  That's why I left.  I didn't get along with my (laughter), my department chair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the chair there?
Speaker 2: Well, her name was Estelle [Estelle Taylor].  I, I don't know where she is now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But if you, if you read my book, 'Breeder' ['Breeder and Other Stories,' Eugenia Collier], the collection of stories, you'll find that often the female character, who something bad happens to, or who is the villain or something like that, is named Estelle or Stella, or something.  See, you don't mess with a writer 'cause you're going to find yourself in a story.
Speaker 1: That's, that's yes, that's chilling (laughter), and those who dare mess with writers.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: And the chilling, a chilling admonition, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you're at Howard through '87 [1987], I guess, for about ten years then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was there for ten years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ten years from '77 [1977] to '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, also, in '77 [1977], was FESTAC '77 [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] in Nigeria.  Did, I know a lot of your colleagues went.  Did you go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --yes, I do go there.  I've been to Africa a couple of times and, oh, man, I am so glad that I went, when I could.  You know, it would be, it'd be too difficult a, a trip to go now, but I'm so glad I did go.  Oh, it was wonderful to see and it, it was disturbing also because there's so much poverty there.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what, what is FEST- what was FESTAC '77?  What was it supposed to be?
Speaker 2: Well, just, though you, we went to learn.  We were, you know, in those days, we were, people were deep into their roots, and that was what we were doing.  Richard [HistoryMaker Richard Long] got together a--well, in fact, he did it all himself.  He didn't really have an organization.  What was now, what was that known as the first--anyway, what we did was to travel to different parts of the diaspora every summer.  And we started out in Brazil.  That was a journey.  And we went to vari- various parts of the Caribbean, and we took writers, performers, scholars.  And we, we met some of theirs down there so we, we gave these various programs, and some of the people there would attend.  And we attended, so it was a question of sort getting to know each other.  We went to Haiti.  We went to several different, different places.  Guiana, we went there.  And it was, that, too, was a marvelous experience, yeah.  Oh, I'll tell you who else was at Howard.  I don't know what made me think of him, Julian Mayfield.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: He was the writer in residence when I was there; and we got to be very good friends.
Story_ID: 647837
Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Dr. Chappelle [HistoryMaker Emmett Chappelle].  Ma'am, could you give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Eugenia, E-U-G-E-N-I-A, Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, Collier, C-O-L-L-I-E-R [HistoryMaker Eugenia Collier].
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 6, 1928 in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm retired, oh, yes.  But I used to be professor of English at various places, the last one being Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And an author, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was chair of the department, too, at Morgan and at, at Coppin [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and an author, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And critic, I would guess as well.
Speaker 2: Yes, also grandmother and great-grandmother--all of that.
Speaker 1: All right. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date, the 20th, May 20, 2014.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my apartment in Charlestown senior center [Charlestown Retirement Community].  What else, what else--
Speaker 1: In Maryland, right?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore [Maryland], in Catonsville, I'm sorry, Catonsville, Maryland.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, we are finishing an interview that we started last fall of 2013, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Correct.  And we left off in 1977.
Story_ID: 647838
Speaker 1: You had gone to FESTAC '77 [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] with the North American delegation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you had mentioned, just before we stopped, you had mentioned that Julian Mayfield was writer in residence at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And I think you wanted to talk about him, but we didn't, we ran out of time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What, now, you have to, you have to cut me off 'cause I, I tend to--once I get started, I don't want to stop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Julian was a good friend.  He was writer in residence at Howard and, oh, lord, what can I tell you about Julian?  I admired his work tremendously.  In fact, he was one of the sort of set of authors--he and John Killens [John Oliver Killens], and several others who were writing at the same time.  And Julian's writing taught me so much about just the use of language, the use of the vernacular, use of African American speech, and just a whole African American world.  There were so many things I never got to know about Julian.  There was some tale, which I, I cannot remember the details of now, but Julian making his escape, ran down the highway with a weapon in his hand.  I don't know who he was escaping from, but it had to do with his civil rights activities, so he was someone who didn't just write about things, but he did things, too.  There are many Julian stories.  Julian used to buy old cars and get somebody, get the man on the corner to fix the cars.  Well, of course, the cars never stayed fixed.  And he used to give me a ride to the train station because I was commuting to Howard, and sometimes Julian would give me a ride.  Well, when we went around the corner, Julian would have to reach across me and grab the car door 'cause the car door would fly open when he went around the corner.  It was an adventure, believe me, when Julian was giving you a ride.  He, he--eventually, they, they cut out his job.  He did not have a Ph.D., and we were very much into that.  I guess, I guess they still are.  And a writer in residence is not a job that you look at as a permanent kind of thing, but he was going to leave Howard.  In fact, he had left Howard by the time he became ill with heart problems, and eventually died.  But he was, he was such a lovable person.
Story_ID: 647839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember he was involved in a screenplay for 'Uptight,' the movie--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1968?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I think he had a role in it, too, didn't he?
Speaker 2: He did--
Speaker 1: He played the--
Speaker 2: --he did.
Speaker 1: --role of, did he play Tank in that--
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: --the, the lead character?
Speaker 2: I have forgotten.  I don't think he was Tank--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but--
Speaker 1: He was involved, I know he was certainly involved in--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: --'cause--
Speaker 2: He, he was an actor, oh, he had so many talents.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep, so many talents, and he knew everybody.  He was a good friend of [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was in the movie--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --along with Max Julien--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --produced by Jules Dassin.  I always remember, I almost remembered all of them in it, but it was--I think he did play Tank, I think he did.
Speaker 2: Was he Tank?  Do you think Tank?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he played Tank in the movie.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's been, been a while ago and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I have to think about, I have to go back into the recesses and think about this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I think, I'm pretty sure he did and, yeah, he was a great, great talent.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, can I tell you one, one Julian [Julian Mayfield] story?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He had--well, the same cars.  Julian took me to the station, came back, and on the way back, he saw a lady, who was on the corner, looked like she wanted a ride, a nice looking lady.  So, he stopped, lady got in the car.  Well, he had to go to the bathroom, so he stopped in a filling station, ran into the bathroom.  When he came back, the car and the lady were both gone (laughter).  So, he reported it, of course, to the police.  Well, the car was recovered, but he couldn't get it because he owed so many traffic tickets.  They wouldn't let him have the car (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a sad story.  So, he, now he was a preoccupied artist, it sounds like.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: --but, a fantastic friend.
Story_ID: 647840
Speaker 1: I don't know if we, we really got your final thoughts about FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria].  I know you, you'd mentioned that it led to trips to other countries where other artists, you know, you met other artists that were at FESTAC [FESTAC '77] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we used to go--it was, well, FESTAC, I, I suppose, was sort of the, part of the inspiration for going to various places in the diaspora.  Rich- [HistoryMaker] Richard Long was the sort of center of all of that planning and everything.  We would go to various places.  One summer, we went to Brazil.  One summer, we'd go to somewhere else.  And, and 'cause Richard would have everything all planned for us.  We would, took, we took artists, performers, writers, scholars, and off we would go.  And we would meet scholars, writers, and people from there, from wherever we were going.  So, it was a most rich, rich experience, and we went almost every, almost every year for quite a long, quite a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it'd be a summer trip to a different country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Summer trip, right.  It would be maybe ten days or some- something like that, but it was, it was quite a thing to be away from home and, yet, almost at the same time, at home because you knew the people; and you got a taste of the culture of other black nations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was beautiful.
Story_ID: 647841
Speaker 1: This is 1977.  I may have asked you about this in the other session.  I'm not sure, but did, did we, well, let's--the end of Black World is around this same time, either in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-seven [1977], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] was one of the people who went on some of the trips.  It was the end of the '70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s], or somewhere around that time.  I don't remember exactly but yes.
Speaker 1: And Black World ended in '77 [1977]--
Speaker 2: Was it in '77 [1977]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then, we started another magazine, First World in, in Atlanta [Georgia].  It was, it was an emotional time for most of us--I guess for all of us because Hoyt and Black World had done so very much for all of us.  I don't know whether I would ever have published anything, had Hoyt not been the first one to, to publish my story, 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier].  And then he published many other things that, that I wrote, and it sort of started the, the, really got my writing career started.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, now I take that back.  I think the last issue was out in '76 [1976], I think, and then '77 [1977] was the first issue of First World.
Speaker 2: First World, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Came in '77 [1977], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I know it had Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter] on the cover.  Remember that, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Not--tell me some more.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Carter was on the cover of the first edition of the First World (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of the first, I've--well, I probably have that right on the bookshelf somewhere, but I had forgotten that point, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was kind of surprised to see him on the cover, but I mean, not that he was a bad person, but you would think it had been some black cultural--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --iconic figure or something on the cover?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, I'd totally forgotten that.  I know it was a terrible struggle, each issue, and there weren't very many issues really, but it was a terrible financial struggle.  We just, we didn't have the backing, we didn't have very much of anything, except the will.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then, Hoyt Fuller himself passed away in '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Yes, was that, was that '81 [1981]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the dates very well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Larry Neal, Hoyt Fuller died the same year, 1981 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, they did.
Story_ID: 647842
Speaker 1: And that leads to another personality that I don't think we've discussed, and that's [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who spent a lot of time at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Was he writer in residence when you were at Howard?
Speaker 2: I think he was.  He left before I came to Howard.  I think that people like, Haki and, and Julian [Julian Mayfield]--that wasn't the right environment for them.  They and others, they just had ideas that were not consistent with, with Howard's, what, with the--well, with the atmosphere at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you kind of explain what that means in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I (laughter) I don't know whether I can explain it or not.  But Howard was not so much, at least the Howard that I knew, the part of Howard that I was involved with, was not really so much interested, I don't think, in African American writing, culture, et cetera.  It was more a rarefied atmosphere that went for scholarship, of course, but they seemed to be more European oriented.  Now that's been a while ago.  I just remember how I felt there, too, and anyway, Haki didn't, didn't stay.  He, he, as I say, he left before, before I came.
Speaker 1: I think he, now I know I was at the institute and Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois] at the time.  I'm, I'm thinking that he was either at Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], or went to be writer in residence at--I know he was at Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], too, in the late '70s [1970s], Central State or Morgan State.  And so, I don't know, was he still in the area--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, that?  Yeah.  I know, 'cause he spent lots of time away from Chicago [Illinois].  He was, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 647843
Speaker 1: Now I first heard your name in 1976 at a con- at the African Heritage Studies Association conference.  And you were mentioned by a woman named Abena Walker who was from my hometown.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was, she had, she was talking about black English, and she had a poem, where she mentioned you and Geneva Smitherman, and some others as being black linguistic freedom fighters.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).  I like that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, what do, do you consider yourself a black linguistic freedom fighter?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I may have at one time.  I'm, I'm a freedom fighter for all kinds of freedom, but I tell you, I do, I do love the language of black peo- I don't mean this kind of vulgar stuff you hear or, you know, on the street, I don't mean that.  But our language is so full of figures of speech, different kinds of rhythms, and just, just creativity, just, just imagination.  Now, now, I've forgotten who said this.  One, one of our group, one of our gang was talking about that same thing, the richness of the language, and was saying that you find it, ever- that kind of richness, everywhere people not, don't necessarily even set out to, to be anything in particular.  It just sort of flows.  And she'd tell us about a boy, a young boy, a teenager, whose mother would cry all the time.  He kept doing things, and she would keep crying.  And he said, "That woman's got a fountain in her head."  And I, and that, I don't know, that sort of stuck with me.  That, that was a sort of, so creative and imaginative, just came on out, you know.
Story_ID: 647844
Speaker 1: I don't know if we alluded to these before but, you know, in the 1960s and '70s [1970s], you had the--you mentioned John Killens [John Oliver Killens] in the last session as being a--now he was the leader of the Harlem Writers Guild.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in Chicago [Illinois], you had Obassi writers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was there a similar group here in Washington, D.C. area or in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: No, not that I--no, not that I, there were always groups being formed among students, and forming and unforming because students don't stay students.  And later, they graduate or leave or something.  There were various groups that came and went, but nothing, nothing like John, John's, oh, nothing at all like John's group, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wondered that, you know, there'd be something if, you know, Obassi basically--Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] became the, like the generator of what was going on with Obassi.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But there were other people involved, too, and Gwendolyn Brooks--
Speaker 2: Gwen Brooks, yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --was very much involved in that.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs and others.  I just wondered if Lucille [Lucille Clifton], and some of the other poets around here hadn't formed some kind of--
Speaker 2: No, we really didn't.  And, and I guess we missed an opportunity, but it--because we really did have the talent, but people seemed to be not so much given to what you have to do to have an organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think Dudley Randall in Detroit [Michigan] would have been another example of somebody to pull together a group around them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Naomi Long Madgett, and some of the people in Detroit know (unclear), you know.
Speaker 2: Those were some times, weren't they?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so a lot of literature out.
Story_ID: 647845
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for, you know, 'cause you came on in '77 [1977] that year, the FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I was at Howard for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, [HistoryMaker] James Cheek is president, right, of Howard when you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what were some of the highlights of being at Howard?  You, other than what we were already talking about, you know, FESTAC and that?
Speaker 2: One thing, one thing was the Howard tradition of excellence although it, I had sort of grown away from the kind of stilted thinking that, that was still a part of Howard at that time, but used to--well, of course, I was a Howard grad, and I just felt like I was on sacred ground.  So, that was one, one of the things.  It felt good to be around people who had done things and been somebody.  It was good being, say, in Sterling Brown's [Sterling A. Brown] territory.  He, he had taught me, as I think I might have mentioned before, and he was, I had just so totally looked up to that man.  And there were, there were other scholars whose works I had read, and whom I had so admired, Arthur P. Davis, for example, and others.  So, it was to me, I always felt like (laughter), I was sitting at the feet of, of a great mind quite often when I was at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Sterling Brown still at Howard when you were there?
Speaker 2: I think he had, he had probably retired by that time, but he would show up now and then for, to do a lecture or to recite his poems, or something like that but--
Speaker 1: And what about Arthur Davis?
Speaker 2: Well, Arthur P. Davis was (unclear).  By that time, he was working on his collections of poems--I mean, of, well, not just poems, of literary works and, and so forth.  He was a very fine critic although I think he and I probably differed on a number of things.  But he was, he was a great person.  So, you just, you just had a feeling of being around greatness.  Maybe I just tend toward hero worship maybe, but those were the people that started me off wanting, wanting to accomplish something, wanting to, to study and learn and create, and so forth, so that those, those were some of the things.  Of course, close friends like, Julian Mayfield, for example, and a number of others were there, and it just--I felt at home.  I felt good.  For a while, there were--the, the political situation, I sort of didn't, didn't take so much to that.  I always end up on the wrong side (laughter) of the political fence but whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who was the chairman of the department at Howard when you were there?
Speaker 2: Estelle Taylor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think you told me, yeah, Estelle Taylor, all right.  And I don't know if we talked about Eleanor Traylor.  Estelle Taylor's name reminded me of Eleanor Traylor.
Speaker 2: Of Eleanor Traylor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a good friend of mine, too.  I haven't seen her for a long time, yeah but.  There were parties and things at Eleanor's house in which I met all, all kinds of folks.  I met [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou there and just, just good, good things.
Speaker 1: Now, did Toni Morrison stay connected with Howard?
Speaker 2: She had left by the time I came.  I met her at Eleanor's house, too, Toni Morrison, yeah, so.  It was a good, rich kind of culture; and there was a lot of good conversation going on all the time somewhere.
Story_ID: 647846
Speaker 1: What were you working on?  Were you working on any specific work of your own during this ten year period at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I was writing stories then.  I started with 'Marigolds' [Eugenia Collier] when I was at Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but I'll tell you, Larry [Larry Crowe], I'm a pretty slow writer and publisher.  I got so many other things to do.  By the time I get around to having something published, it's been written a long time ago so, but I did, I did turn out some stories there.  And another, another person that's good, good to know and be around, was Paul Coates [W. Paul Coates].  Paul, Paul was a librarian there and, eventually, Paul asked me to submit my stories, and he did publish them in what was that--'94 [1994].  I wasn't at Howard then, but that's where I had, you know, be- begun my acquaintance with, with Paul, and he did publish the stories in a book called 'Breeder and Other Stories' [Eugenia Collier].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Paul Coates, now, he was a founder of Black Classics Press [sic. Black Classic Press].
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And, right, and he worked in, at some point, he was hired by Howard, the Moorland-Spingarn collection [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, he was there, [HistoryMaker] Thomas Battle, I think.  Elinor Des Verney Sinnette, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, they were, right, okay.  So, but there's a, there's also during this period of time--and correct me if I'm wrong--a decline in independent black publishing (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, oh, yes, that, that just seems that, that the number of black publishers just went way down real, real fast.  Well, most of them, if I remember correctly, most of them had financial problems from the very beginning, and that was, it marked a, a decline in, in other ways, too.  People just--if you couldn't publish, if there just wasn't an outlet for the publication, you ended up just not writing, some people.  So, that things really started to going down somewhere, what, in the '80s [1980s], was that around--
Speaker 1: I believe so.  I think, you know, it seems to be a decline in black bookstores, a lot of them closed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --Drum and Spear [Drum and Spear Press, Washington, D.C.] here closed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and quite a few others.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The bookstore in New York, the National Black Bookstore, Memorial Bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, New York, New York] at 125th [125th Street; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard] and Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] closed up.  A lot of them around the country closed down so.
Speaker 2: And that was another beautiful thing.  In certain cities, there were black bookstores.  We had some here, but you go to Atlanta [Georgia], and the one thing you had to do before you left was to go to, and I don't remember the names of all the stores now, but you, you go browsing.  And certainly in Harlem [New York, New York], oh, that was a thrill to go to Harlem, and walk down the street, and you had all kinds of bookstores, businesses, clothing stores, just, that was a time--that was really a good time.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 647847
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there anything else we want to say about Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] before we, we move you to Coppin State [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I, I don't think so.  Things got to be pretty difficult for me at Howard.  As I said, I stayed on the wrong side of the political machine and so, I ended up leaving there, coming on back to Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what kind of things did you do to get on the wrong side of the political machine (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Opened my big mouth probably--I don't know.  It, it's just, it's hard, it's hard to look back at those times and make a whole lot of sense out of it.  I just wasn't in the in crowd for one thing.  I'd just rather not talk about it (laughter), to tell the truth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it was, like lot of academic--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll, I'll say this.  There was a lot of dissatisfaction among faculty members.  People who left there don't want to come back to Howard for, for, not even on a visit for various reasons.  I'm not, I don't mean to imply that everybody is that way, but one very fine scholar that I know said, told me, he, he gets nauseated when he gets on the Howard's campus.  His stomach actually acts up.  I don't know his story, I don't know why, but although I still maintain a sort of--what is it--good feeling about Howard in a lot of ways, the, the political structure got, really got to me, and I didn't want to deal with it.
Speaker 1: Was the Howard administration--you said they were, they tended to be, at that point more, they tended towards the conventional--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, but they tended towards excellence, but towards the conventional--
Speaker 2: Conventional excellence.
Speaker 1: --excellence, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Coughs) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you got down to things, like promotions, and fighting over who was going to get promoted, and why or why not, and this, that, and the other, yeah.
Story_ID: 647848
Speaker 1: Oh, let me tell you something else good.  At Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I got to meet Robert Hayden there.  He, he was there for, for a year.  He was sort of a, a guest professor.
Speaker 2: Now, he's the, he's a great poet but like, tell us who, or tell the reader, I mean, the viewer, who he is and what he--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, Robert Hayden.  Let me describe him first because he sort of pops into my head, and I can just see him--tall man, fairly elderly at that time, with real thick eyeglasses.  He had very, very poor vision.  A very stately person, the kind of person who would open the door for a lady, and all things like that.  Hayden was a very fine poet in the traditional way.  When I think of Haki [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti] and Robert Hayden, they were just totally, totally opposite of each other in, in their work.  Robert Hayden, oh, gee whiz, if I'd, I'd thought of it, there's a poem I'm going to read at one of our functions here about his father [Asa Sheffey].  Apparently, he had, Robert Hayden had a kind of hard, harsh childhood, and has written some of the most moving things about that.  But also, some of the most philosophical kinds of, of works, but in using all of the traditional things that we would feel that this is what makes a poem a great poem, in terms of language, figurative, figurative language, use of sound, and just thoughts, ideas.  There's a poem that comes to mind called 'The Diver' [Robert Hayden] in which he describes diving down into the water and the thoughts, ideas.  It's almost as if the person were, to me--just my interpretation--person were thinking of suicide, but comes back up, comes back into the world again rather, like Robert Frost, 'Stopping by Woods' ['Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'].  You, you--I had the same kind of feeling.  But he, oh, yes, it was so good to meet him.  And I can admire both Hayden's kind of traditional thing and Haki's non-traditional thing; I admire both of them.
Story_ID: 647849
Speaker 1: Well, well, it seems as though--I mean, I was at Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois] at a time when Haki [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti] became an admirer of Robert Hayden and, and ran a couple of Robert Hayden poems in one of his books.  I think the book, 'Black Men, Single, Obsolete Dangerous?' [Haki Madhubuti] had a couple of chapters with lead in poems from Robert Hayden.  One was 'Runagate' ['Runagate Runagate,' Robert Hayden].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, runs, stumbles, falls, rises, you know, on it.  And then, he had another--well, you know, 'Middle Passages' [sic.] is Robert Hayden's real famous poem, the poem about the 'Middle Passages' that most people know him from.
Speaker 2: And Frederick Douglass performed by--I, I was trying to read 'Runagate'--well, I did read it here on, or it must have been during Black History Month, or something like that.  There was a program and, and there are some, so many different voices and so many different accents.  And, of course, I'm not an actress.  I couldn't do all of that, but I wanted people, I wanted people to, to know that poem, and to know--see, folks don't know enough history, and not just white people, but black people, too.  We do not know our history, or we would know who we are.  We would know--oh, see, then now, I'm getting started now.  I'm going, but to take a poem like that, and read it before an audience that is really mainly consisting of white people, many of whom don't know anything about our history.  It was an experience for them, so in spite of my, my non-acting, they, they enjoyed the poem.  And they seemed to get a great deal out of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's a powerful poem that if--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and 'Middle Passage,' yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Yep.  So, Robert Hayden, yeah.  That's right.  He would have been here--(unclear).  I should have thought to mention him, but, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: So, he was here for a year in a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was just in--
Speaker 1: Early '80s [1980s], I guess, right--
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: --like '81 [1981], '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: I don't do well on years and (laughter) numbers.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking that's it 'cause I'm thinking where Haki was at that time.  I think that's exactly where, yeah, so yeah, so these are two poets that you say are like, are vastly different, but I know that one appreciates the other especially, you know, and.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 647850
Speaker 1: Now 1987, so, was there a last straw here that you just, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you just said, "Well, I had, I got to go now.  I can't--."
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), yes, it, it had to do with promotion.  You know, you, you would, you get to, you would work there for a certain number of years.  I've forgotten how many, five or something like that, and then, either you had to qualify for a promotion, or you were let go.  And that seemed kind of, you could be very subjective about who you wanted to keep, and who you didn't want to keep.  So, we had some confusion about that.  We had some confusion about--they had a strange way of appointing a chairperson where department members were to submit to the dean a written statement about who you wanted to be the chairperson.  And that can be kind of dangerous.  So, it was just things, things like that, that I really didn't agree with.  And so, finally, I had an offer to come here to Coppin, and by that time, I'd had it with commuting, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was a last straw, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you came to Coppin State [Coppin State College].  Now, it's Coppin State University [Baltimore, Maryland], in the department of languages, literature, journalism, and philosophy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of that.
Speaker 1: And, and taught various subjects, including African American literature, African American--American literature, creative writing, and literary genres, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite class?
Speaker 2: Oh, I always liked the creative writing class.  I taught that with Julian [Julian Mayfield] at Howard, and really, almost any class in African American literature.  I really, really loved teaching, teaching that.
Story_ID: 647851
Speaker 1: Then I got, I also--well, I had, already had an interest in theatre, but it was while I was at Coppin [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] that I became more active with the community theatre here, the Arena Players [Arena Players, Incorporated, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, is this an African American company?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The Arena Players, oh, my goodness, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us something about the Arena Players.  Who founded it and who--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was founded by a group of African American--I think they were mainly teachers, though perhaps, perhaps not exclusively so.  They wanted to, to be a part of theatre.  They wanted to act.  They wanted to do theatre arts, and so forth.  And white theatres were not having any of that.  They couldn't get anything much in, you know, joining some white theatre company.  And so, they, these, you know, local people got together, started out in somebody's basement, and with no money really, they started a theatre group.  They could, they started with a play called--it was right in my head and now, I can't think of it--'Hello Out There!' [William Saroyan].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It started with the 'Hello Out There!'.  The main, the major founder was a man named Samuel Wilson.  He was not the only founder.  There were several, but Sam seemed to be the, the heart and spirit of the Arena Players.  He's deceased now, but he did some wonderful work with the Arena Players.  And they--it was, it was a time when people would--they'd bring like, they'd make a set by bringing somebody.  "You bring, bring one of your chairs.  I'll bring a table," you know, and things like that--really, really a beautiful group.  They are still in existence.  They are the oldest, continually operating African American theatre--they say in the, in the country, but I say in the world.  Where else will you find African American theatre but here?  But anyway, they now have a little playhouse down on McCulloh Street, and they're still functioning, still having financial difficulties, as they have from the very, very beginning, but they're still dealing.  They would like, when, when a play closed, you'd, you'd break down the set.  And the same wood that was on, that was the floor or the same thing, they would appear for the next play or another play.  So, they've had their struggles, but, but they're still, they're still going, they're still dealing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, they were founded, were they founded in the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s] or--
Speaker 1: Let me see.  We just had something like a sixtieth anniversary.  It goes back quite, quite a ways.
Speaker 2: Goes back to the '60s [1960s], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: They had a sixtieth anniversary.  I'm sixty-four, so it must have been founded around 1964 or so [sic. 1953], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's, okay.  Well, not--
Speaker 1: Well, and let me just say this.  There is so much talent--well, here in Baltimore [Maryland] because that's what I witnessed, but so much talent among people that you see, just ordinary people walking down the street.  Musc- musical talent, dancing, you know, in addition to acting, and creating sets, creating from nothing, creating something from nothing.  So, I, I really am very much into the Arena Players.  I've, I've done--well, officially, I was the dramaturge.  And I've, right now, I've done a few things for Coppin, the Coppin Players, and I just, I just love working with students there.  They call me Mama Eugenia [HistoryMaker Eugenia Collier].  They also call me the word detective because oh, somebody said a word wrong, I would be on their case.
Story_ID: 647852
Speaker 1: Now, you were at Coppin State [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] from '87 [1987] to '92 [1992].  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  Now, what happened now?  You left Coppin State, and went to Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had taught at Morgan before as, as we have said.  I don't remember specifically why, except that Morgan seemed to be a little more affluent.  Yeah, kind of felt the jobs were perhaps a little more secure there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were a chair at Coppin--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you came over to, to Morgan, right.  So, did you come over to Morgan as a chair?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you were a professor and chairperson of the English department (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you taught creative writing, American literature, but basically the same--
Speaker 2: Basically, the same things, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was interested.  I, I was thinking here, how did you approach American literature?  Who, I mean, who were favorite--I mean, would you approach it in a different way than a white American literature professor might or--
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so.  For one thing, when I did the survey, for example--well, when I first started teaching American literature, there were no blacks in the textbook, no black literature, and very little by women.  But our, my main concern was that you got a totally different viewpoint of American culture, if the, this is the, this is the literature and it's all white, mostly male.  So, I started adding things to it, and even I (laughter), I don't think I did this too, too well because I didn't know this, this particular subject, Indian literature, Native American literature.  Well, we had nothing of Native American literature, not in the early days.  Perhaps now, that might be changing, or might have changed.  There is some very beautiful poetry, for example, from Native American poets.  So, I did, I did do it a, a little differently.  I--it's, it's, I don't know, Larry [Larry Crowe], it's hard, it's hard to express how that feels when here you are supposedly an educated person with a Ph.D., and all that kind of thing, and reading, and looking over the textbooks for your class, and you're not in it, you're not in the text at all.  It's like, you had just no kind of being, you're not a part of it.  It's a strange feeling being left out of your own native land.  It's really, it's really not nice at all.
Story_ID: 647853
Speaker 1: I guess in the '80s [1980s], Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] wrote a book called 'Loose Canons' ['Loose Canons: Notes on the Culture Wars,' Henry Louis Gates] where he discussed the process of being canonized in the American literature books or in, in African American literature.  I mean some writers are canonized.  They all, they're in there, and they're never going to be put out of it.  And, but then some people, who are just as good, never get canonized.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They're not in, they're not in.
Speaker 2: They're not in it at all, as, as if they never, never existed.  It's, it's a bit strange, it's a bit strange.
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite writers that need to be canonized that haven't been?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, let me see (laughter).  I do have some favorite writers.  Oh, we have the--let me, let me go a little bit farther, a feel on, on this.  We have an activity here at Charlestown [Charlestown Retirement Community, Catonsville, Maryland] called the Poets' Corner.  And once a month, five or six of us, different people, will read poetry on a particular subject, a particular theme.  I like to, where I can, I like to read African American poetry to them, or I've gotten a little bit into Indian, Native American poetry.  But I don't know that field well enough to, to do more than read a poem here--here and there.  But I like for people to know that, heck, we've been writing all along, and just see some of the beautiful things that we have written.  The (laughter), the problem is that we don't write about some of the themes that, that they, that are going to be, you know, things folks are going to read about, and it's like nature.  We don't have that many nature poems, even love poems.  There, there are some in there, more and more now, but it's kind of hard figuring out what, what you want to read.  And some things are just--I mean, these are--we people here in Charlestown, we're little old people, and we don't like to, to be, have our nerves upset.  And a lot of our stuff is going to upset your nerves as it should.  And, anyway--well, I got off the subject.  You had asked me something else.  What did you ask--oh, writers, they should be canonized?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh, lord, I don't know, I look at them.  I guess most of the people that I really like already are, are in the canon somewhere.  I can't, I just can't think at the moment of anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, but some, but you're saying, I guess that some people that are canonized in African American literature don't appear in American literature at all.
Speaker 2: And that's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's right and then, and it seems that it's the same ones.  You know what it makes me think of--Negro History Week [Black History Month].  Do you remember what that is?  And you, you got this in one week now, but you got the same people every year, as if there weren't any others of us who had done any- anything.  You got Langston Hughes and he was good.  He is one of my very favorites.  They leave him canonized right where he is.  Phillis Wheatley, we need to know about her, of course, but there are so many other people.  George Washington Carver, not for poetry, but for sweet potatoes and peanuts and stuff.  But those were the people that you, you learned about and that was it--same people every year.  So, I, I think that there are some writers that people do, do read that have been canonized--Richard Wright, well, Langston Hughes certainly, and some, some others.  But, well, anyway.
Story_ID: 647854
Speaker 1: I have taught students, and especially in creative writing class years ago, and I've been waiting for them to, to sort of make it, but the things just haven't worked out that way.  There's a student that I had named Juanema Henderson [ph.].  That's probably is not even her name anymore.  She's probably gotten married and stuff.  She wrote some of the most beautiful, sensitive things, and I have come across one of two of her poems somewhere, somewhere along the road, but I have no idea where she is now.  But and there were others who were good writers, good writers.
Speaker 2: So, there's, what you're saying, there's a lot of talent out there that has not really been recognized.
Speaker 1: Really.  Well, and I tell you who has been recognized within our community, but you don't see him in, in anthology and things.  That's Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown] and he's a marvelous writer.  Oh, I mean, he really changed my whole direction.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, you wrote your dissertation about him, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And one of my students, when I was at my first year of teaching at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], Joanne Gabbin [HistoryMaker Joanne V. Gabbin] did her dissertation many years later.  And she, she has produced a book on Sterling Brown ['Sterling A. Brown: Building the Black Aesthetic Tradition," Joanne V. Gabbin] and I'm so proud of her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is Joanne Gabbin?
Speaker 1: Joanne, yeah, her maiden name is Veal, V-E-A-L, Joanne Veal Gabbin, G-A-B-B-I-N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, she has started, sometime ago, a marvelous writers' group called the Wintergreen Women [Wintergreen Women Writers' Collective] because they used to meet at Wintergreen Resort in Virginia [Wintergreen, Virginia].  And probably, I know [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni must have mentioned that group to you.  And I don't know whether Joanne, whether HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] has interviewed Joanne or not.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Oh, she--keep her in mind.  She's a marvelous scholar and gets things done, like getting the women organized.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, are women in a better position today in terms of literature than they were, you know, when you started, yeah?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yes, definitely.  And that's good, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: And, well, how come, you know, is it, did the black cultural arts movement help do that or, or what, or was it something else?
Speaker 1: What, I think it was several, several things, one being that just women in general, not only in America, but in, and in the world, women have come more into their own, and that would be one of the reasons.  Certainly, black women have become much more vocal, much more active in, in a lot of ways.  Wow, when you look at someone, like Lucille Clifton, and Lucille was just as quiet and dignified a lady as you ever want to see, but she could write some really, really heavy poems.  She could write some fab- fabulous, fascinating poems.  And some of them are poems that, that I don't know that anybody, but Lucille would ever write about, like 'Homage to my Hips' [Lucille Clifton].  That's a great poem.  And she wrote an 'Ode to Menstruation' [sic. 'Poem in Praise of Menstruation,' Lucille Clifton].  And she wrote--I don't know, don't remember the name of it, but Lucille suffered from cancer.  And at one point, she had to have a mastectomy, and she wrote a poem in which one breast was saying goodbye to the other breast.  Who would think of anything like that, but they were real, they were very moving.  So, women have just, you know, become much more visible, much more vocal, and I think just so interesting.
Story_ID: 647855
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, in 1992, you published a novel called 'Spread My Wings' [Eugenia Collier]?
Speaker 2: Well, not under that name, there was some complication.  Something else had that name, and so we couldn't keep the name.  But the, the title of the book, the title of the novel is 'Beyond the Crossroads' [sic. 'Beyond the Crossroad,' Eugenia Collier].  And it was published here by a little group called Three Sistahs Press [Baltimore, Maryland], which is, well, three women, three, three women.  And I, I was just so happy and pleased with that.  Oh, what do you want me to say about it?
Speaker 1: Well, what was the plot about it and what was the, what's the story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  That--I, I really, yeah, that's another one, took me years and years to get that thing written.  But, I'm so pleased with that because it is true.  It's fiction because I did a lot of rearranging and adding dialogue and adding characters and all, but here's what it was about.  It's based on a woman.  Her name is Mrs. Cromer, Margaret Cromer.  I knew her when she was in her nineties.  I didn't know her well.  She was a neighbor of one of my students, and the student said that she, Mrs. Cromer, had been held as a slave.  Well, she wasn't born until after the era of slavery and what it was, she had the experience that a lot of black people, or I don't know a lot, but a number of black people had.  That is, they were not told they were free.  They were just, continued to be held in slavery.  And my, my student brought this lady to school to speak to my literature class.  I had told them that, that African American literature is based very firmly in history.  And she was living, walking history--tall, slender lady, even at her age, with a very commanding kind of voice, the kind of voice you listen to.  And she held my students fascinated while she told us about that.  Well, that tipped off my thinking.  And to make a long story short, it ended up being the, the crux of a novel about how this young girl named Caroline escaped from slavery.  Mrs. Cromer had to--the actual person had to escape from slavery with the dogs running after her.
Speaker 1: Now, where was she held in slavery?
Speaker 2: She was--I think she was in, somewhere near the border line between North Carolina and, and Virginia.  She was certainly in my novel.  She--the, the character, Caroline, lived in the mountains where--there were just sort of separated from, from everything.  And she was handed from one person to another, just like slaves were sold and everything.  So, she, she was really the major character, but I did a lot of research on that.  When you do a historical novel, you have to do a lot of research, so I did that, and I, I read some of Du Bois' [W.E.B. Du Bois] works of focusing on that period, and things like that.  But it was, it was a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: Now, did she--well, I guess she told you about how she found out that she, that slavery was over, and, yet, she was still being held as a slave.
Speaker 2: Well, I, well, I figured that out.  She didn't really--I don't remember that she ever really said that because there were other black people involved, too.  And somehow, the word got around, but there wasn't any slave culture at that point for them to rely on to help them.  But there were actually four characters, four black characters, and who she encounters along the way, but oh, she had, she had a terrible time.  She said that she got a beating every day.  Now, this is a kid coming up, that the, they would beat her with a wooden, a shoe with a wooden heel.  They beat her with the heel part.  And she would escape, and they would have to bring her, they'd bring her back.  But things went for her from bad to worse--

Speaker 1: I put in as much as I could of the things that I had read about, well, slave culture because one of the, well, characters [in 'Beyond the Crossroad,' Eugenia Collier], actually, there were five characters that she, that sustained her, black characters.  One was a woman who had actually been a slave before the Civil War, but was re-enslaved after the war.  There were so many ways of re-enslaving black people and she was caught in that, so that she was, she was one who told this child that, you know, slavery was over, and that they, but they, they were stuck.  They couldn't, they couldn't go anywhere.  They couldn't leave there.  So, it's, it was an experience.  It, I got so involved in that novel that somewhere toward, toward the end, it's getting, working its way toward the end, the actual person, Mrs. Cromer [Margaret Cromer], who by that time, was about seventeen or so, they punished her by making her sleep in a slaughterhouse where they would--remember, they would slaughter the pigs and then, then put, put them in this, like an ice house.  That's not the right word for it, but she had to sleep there with all the meat hanging on the, from the ceiling (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like a smokehouse--
Speaker 1: Yeah--a what?
Speaker 2: --smokehouse?
Speaker 1: Smokehouse, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's what it seems like.
Speaker 1: See, I'm a city girl.  I don't know these things.  But she, she described how she, she would, she would try, she would lie down, and snakes would crawl over her legs.  And the rats would gnaw her fingernails.  This is a woman, ninety-two years old, looking back on her childhood experience.  Well, when I got down to writing that part of it, I was having dreams that I was a person, I was that child, I had gotten so involved in it.  But it was, it was quite an experience.  I, I learned a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean, to think that someone had to go through that, you know, after slavery, is really--
Speaker 1: Oh, it, it happened, happened to my grandfather.  And, and I have read just not really, not a whole lot, but now, then, that's a (unclear).  And see, you're letting me talk, Larry [Larry Crowe].  We're going to run out of time.  Go ahead, what else do you want to ask me?
Story_ID: 647857
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, 1993, you published a collection of short stories.  Now, this is the collection published by Paul Coates [W. Paul Coates], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Breeder and Other Stories' [Eugenia Collier]?
Speaker 2: Right.  And the story that appears there as "Breeder" [Eugenia Collier] was a chapter from what was then called 'Spread My Wings.'  That was before the, way before the novel was published.  But, anyway, that's something else that we don't hear much about anything, really, about how they used to breed slaves.  What must that feel like to be a young girl, and to be forced to become pregnant by somebody you don't even know, and then never see again?  And then, when the child is big enough, and the people who quote own you need, need some more money, they're going to take your child and sell it.  It has happened and people don't talk about that.  You don't hear about that, but I was told there was a breed- a breeding farm in, in Maryland not too, too far from here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, historians have, yeah, I mean it was after the end of the transatlantic slave trade around 1830 or so.  I mean, that was the only way you could get more slaves--you'd breed them.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--so, so 'Breeder and Other Stories' so that the total of, how many stories were in this collection?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  I guess, about nine or ten, I, I don't know, but it started with that, my first story, "Marigolds" [Eugenia Collier] and this was, you know, sort of all spread out through, through the years ending with a story, that story about a young, a trial where I was a juror.  That's another (laughter), oh, wow, how did I end up there?  And this kid was accused of murdering a drug dealer.  He was a drug--I don't know the vocabulary--drug runner or something, himself.  And I was so impressed with this child, seventeen, who should have been sitting up in one of my classes, and here he was in chains on trial.  So, and that was just before the book was going to be published.  I got it in just in time, just under the wire.
Story_ID: 647858
Speaker 1: In another story, Rachel's--well, in two stories, 'Rachel's Children' [Eugenia Collier] and 'Present for Sarah,' there's a professor involved, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, is this a (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, all of these things come from either my life or something that someone has, has told me.  Let's see, what did you say, 'A Present for Sarah' [Eugenia Collier]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'A Present for Sarah' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and 'Rachel's Children'.
Speaker 2: --and 'Rachel's Children'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, both feature a professor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Rachel's Children' came from a friend of mine who wanted to, upon retirement, wanted to take a job, just like the professor there, take a job in a small southern black college [HBCU] for very little money because he would have his retirement to live on.  And that sort of grew out of that.  Oh, and plus in 'Rachel's Children', there was a house that just fascinated me, it was an old broken down beat up house on, in West Virginia, that I used to pass sometimes going to my other house and back.  But it looked like it must have had such dignity.  And I, and I was, I sort of imagined what that must, must have been like, and, and put my professor friend in, in there, plus I like ghost stories anyway.
Speaker 1: So, it's a ghost story about a haunted house?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Well, you can call it a ghost story.  I did--I mean, I felt that it was a ghost story, or you can, can say, well, no, these things were sort of in, in her imagination or, or something, but I prefer to think of Rachel's ghost anyway, whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you wrote it like, like the Henry James' novel, 'The Turn of the Screw' where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, where it could be the imagination of the--I think he wrote--the story is written from first person perspective--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, the narrator is telling you things he's seeing, but you're not sure if she's really seeing them or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or what, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  It's little subtle things--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, subtle.
Speaker 2: --in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.  Were you inspired by 'The Turn of the Screw'?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I was just inspired by this old house and by the idea of retiring, and then moving to, you know, another, sort of, you're donating your services in, in a sense.  I like that idea.
Speaker 1: Now, in 'Present for Sarah,' a professor slips into a state of depression and paranoia, fueled by alcoholism so--
Speaker 2: I don't know where 'Present for, for Sarah' came from.  It's (unclear)--I, I think it was a time when I was kind of depressed.  Well, I stayed depressed to one degree or another because you can't write unless you're kind of depressed exactly.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's really true--writers got to be a little bit depressed?
Speaker 2: Well, not, not really, not really.  They're, but, but happy things don't make as good a story (laughter), so whatever.  I don't know (laughter).
Story_ID: 647859
Speaker 1: In 1996, you, you retired from teaching [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were sixty-eight--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at the time.  So, did you think it was just time to retire or, or did you?
Speaker 2: Well, sort of.  It--I, I was getting kind of disillusioned with the whole education system.  Students were, were less well prepared, even then they had been.  And I, I think I, I really didn't love being the chair.  I--the teaching part is what I, I like.  So, after a while, I got to counting up my nickels, and I said well, shucks, I can go home and just sit, so just basically I guess what I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you did do some other things.  You, now you wrote a piece called 'Sterling's Way' in Callaloo, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Published by Callaloo in '98 [1998]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was about Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown], yes.
Speaker 1: And then, the novel we talked about before, 'Spread My Wings' or 'Beyond the Crossroad' [Eugenia Collier] was published in 2010--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --by Black Classics Press [sic. Black Classic Press, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 647860
Speaker 1: And I'm working on another one, now finishing up another novel, which I hope to finish by, maybe by the end of the summer.  And then, I have to figure out what to do with it (laughter).  Now that I've got it, what do I do with it?
Speaker 2: Now, what is this novel?  Can you tell us what it's about?
Speaker 1: Yes.  The title is 'The Day the Gods Wept' [Eugenia Collier].  And it's, it's different from anything else that I've written in some sense, senses, but not in others.  It's, it's about the Italian city of Pompeii, which I think most people know what happened to Pompeii.  There was an eruption, and the town was destroyed.  Well, I went to Pompeii, and I was so impressed by so many things there--one thing, by the antiquity of the, the city.  But there was a--well, don't want to go into too much detail 'cause we don't have the time.  But I was impressed by what I saw of images of the people.  It had a great culture, a flourishing culture, and all of a sudden, it was gone.  So, what the--it, it started out just to be a story, but somehow it has grown into a novella, and I think it's going to end up being a novel.  And I got to stop somewhere along the line.  But anyway, what impressed me was that people had no idea that their, their lives were going to be stuffed out, just, just destroyed like that.  And I was impressed by the, so many ironies.  Here was this beautiful town on, built on rich soil that came from another eruption before, you know, centuries before.  And they flourished, but there were other things, too.  There was slavery, and I have used our slave experience to, to sort of be sensitive to, to that part of it.  There were some things that were not very nice about Pompeii, but you don't hear about that.  You just hear about the, the great splendor of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you insert or inject into this story an African presence in the Roman empire?
Speaker 1: Yes, but not, yes, in terms of the slave experience.  The--one of the major characters is descended from Egypt.  And so, that's, that's a part of it, but I don't, I don't think, I don't think that, that I could do too much with African culture.  I don't think there was a black community that I, that I know about now, might find out there was, in which case I have to start and writing again.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to mess you up, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: But there was--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the work of our late, greatest story on William Leo Hansberry.
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, he talked about the--
Speaker 1: At Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], yeah.
Speaker 2: --and Frank Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.], you know, Frank Snowden talked about the African presence in Greece and Rome.  So, they, they both kind of, you know.
Speaker 1: They did, but I don't know that they were in Pompeii at this particular time.  I don't know--that I just can't stop reading up on, on this thing.  It's, it's not only about the eruption.  I tried to create real people, real characters.  And, in fact, there's a little sex in it, it's a little, there's a murder in it.  And there's a bit of insanity in it, so I'm trying to make the people, like real people that, that we may have seen or heard of, and so forth.  So, it really, it's really about more than just the eruption.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: What, how, how do you think that must feel?  Well, I guess if you did, you don't feel anything.  But all the people, everybody has plans for what they're going to do tomorrow.  Everybody has some idea of a future.  And then all of a sudden--wham, it's all gone.  There's a quotation that I used--what, what do you, what can you do when the very earth that you're walking on reels and twists?  You know, what, where is your security anywhere?
Story_ID: 647861
Speaker 1: Now, you, you still, still write, and right, even though, I mean, you're still writing, not only that, but I've got, so do you--I mean, are you basically taking it easy now, or actually--how, how often do you contribute something, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Well, I'm--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me just say this.  You contributed everything from TV Guide to the College Language Association Journal to The New York Times so--
Speaker 2: Yep.  I, I don't do as nearly as much writing as I did.  Somehow, the imagination kind of, kind of dries up after a while and plus, I've just been very happy and satisfied with life the past few years.  And I do, I do much better when I'm angry or sad (laughter).  I, well, I stay angry.  I don't understand black people who are not angry.  I truly do not, although I do, I know some, but it's more of just--I begin to say, what's, what's the use, me being angry all by myself, but, whatever.  Yeah, I do some writing.  I published a couple of poems in our little newspaper here [at Charlestown Retirement Community, Catonsville, Maryland].  And I'm pretty satisfied with those for as I might try to publish them somewhere else where they'll get a wider readership.  But, and I do have the impulse often to write about things that I see in the newspaper, sometimes to write a response for the editorial page, something like that.  But it's hard to get around to doing things, I stay busy, I stay busy here all the time, so I don't know.  Now, now that I'm back, kind of back into writing to finish up this, this novel, I might find the time 'cause I still have a lot of things to say.
Speaker 1: Now, are you using a computer now in your writing?
Speaker 2: I'm using the computer.  I'm not good at it, I'm not good at it at all.  I get mad with it and if, sometimes I feel like if I could lift the thing, I'd throw out the window, but that has not yet happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There's so much to do around here.  You would not think that little old people would be as busy as we are.  You can't find anybody home certain times of the day.  Everybody is out doing something, so I really do like it here; and it's, it's good.
Story_ID: 647862
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Charlestown village, right, where (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Charlestown ret- well, what do we call it--Charlestown Retirement Community [Catonsville, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --or something like that.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it is Charlestown here.
Speaker 1: How long have you been here?
Speaker 2: Eight and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I heard when we were setting up that you had a big house before, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, I did, and I loved that house, I really did, but it gets to the point where you don't feel like gardening anymore, or keeping up your flowers.  And you certainly don't want to have to shovel the driveway and all that sort of thing.  So, I'm, I'm glad--it was a good move.  It was very difficult, and you feel like you, you, when you're downsizing, you feel like you're getting rid of part of yourself.  But me and my three cats, we moved, moved over here.  I'm down to one cat now.  You have seen her walking through here messing with things; but it's--I, I feel good, I feel good being here.
Story_ID: 647863
Speaker 1: Now, do you have advice for young writers today, young African American writers?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, I'm full of advice.  I would say, write, that is the main thing, just keep writing.  That's, that's, one thing.  The other thing is you got to have something to write about.  You have to, you know, examine your convictions about various things.  Certainly in the black community, we have great need of people, young people in particular, who are making a point to, to read and understand or reading, that's another piece of advice--read as much as you can, but we need people who can look into our culture.  It's a beautiful culture and, but a tragic culture.  People don't, don't feel like they want to, to deal with sad things, but it's, it is tragic, but look at the strength that has come out of it.  We need to understand these things, and writing certainly a novel, a poem, an essay can help you to understand so.  Is, is that enough advice?
Speaker 1: So, you're suggesting that writing about something is, can be as powerful as reading about, or maybe more powerful than just reading about it, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, I learned so much in, in writing the, my fiction, which is what I really, really love to write.  I've learned so much about that, about a whole lot of things because you have to read, and you have to put yourself, you know, you have to play all the roles.  You're an actor, as well as a director in everything.  You have to put yourself in other people's skin in order to be a good writer.  John, not, yeah, John Killens [John Oliver Killens] taught me--I learned as much--see, I taught creative writing with John Killens, too.  He taught me as, more than I think most of the students learned, but he taught me a great deal.  And one of the things was that if you're writing fiction and you have, and you're going to introduce a character, write down everything you know about that character.  And everything is not going to appear in, in your work, but you have to know that person.  He said, know, know what he had for breakfast, know how old he is.  Was he one of several siblings, or was he an only child--I mean, everything.  Just let it flow, and by the time you finish, you know that character pretty well.  And so, what, what you need for him to do in the novel makes a lot of sense because you can pull that right out of what, what you thought about as you were writing.  So, that's, that's another piece of advice if you're writing fiction, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you think of some of the younger writers today?
Story_ID: 647864
Speaker 1: So what do you think about the writing of younger people today?  Are you, I mean, for instance, here's, here's a good example.  I don't know if you read him, but Paul Coates' [W. Paul Coates] son, Ta-Nehisi Coates (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: --is a writer and--
Speaker 2: --yes, I saw, saw him on, what was it, 'Meet the Press' or something the other day.  Well, I, I have a couple of just, just kind of general statements to do.  First, I want to say that I, I did enjoy his, his book.  How do you pronounce his name?
Speaker 1: Ta-Nehisi.
Speaker 2: Ta-Nehisi?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I believe that's it.  I haven't heard him say it so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, partly because I live through, you know, the same time, obviously, my children [Charles M. Collier, Robert N. Collier, and Philip Collier] and he.  So I could look back and see so, so many things he was talking about.  And I think that is a good, good thing to do, to bring to life the past, the place, and all of that.  I, I would make a sort of a general statement.  I admire the courage of some of these writers.  I'm thinking particularly, particularly about the Wintergreen women [Wintergreen Women Writers' Collective], [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, and, oh, just the whole bunch of them.  They are into reality.  They are exploring their world, our world, and that needs to be done.  That takes courage.  I suspect that in a lot of other younger writers, people seem to be pretty superficial, young people, and you really got to go down deep.  You really got to feel things in, in order to--well, change the world.  That's what we used to say.  You remember back when you were working for, with, with Haki [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti].  The task of the black writer is to change the world and to do that, you can't just have a bunch of junk.  You really--I, I read--let me see, what was I doing--I was in the hospital for something years and years ago.  And this hospital worker and I got to talking about books.  She said, "Oh, I got the best book, and it's about black people and Baltimore [Maryland].  It's so good."  She brought me this book, she lent me this book to read, and it was terrible.  The English was terrible.  I don't know whoever edited it.  You have to perfect your craft, and that's something that a lot of younger people don't want to do.  They don't want to hear about commas and semicolons, and stuff like that, but that's, that's a part of it.  So, I would hope that younger writers would, would be very diligent in perfecting their work.  It's not ever going to be absolutely perfect 'cause when you see it in print, and you read it, you say, why did I say that, or why did I put it this way instead of that way?  So, it's never going to be completely perfect, but you have to reach toward it, and I'm not sure that some of the younger writers are.  But they've--I'd like to see young people experiment, too, and, and not be just tied down, in spite of what I just said about perfecting your craft, and learning your commas and semicolons; and so, you got to know that in order to manipulate it.  You got to know what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 647865
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, one hope is that more of us will get to know about our past, not just our individual pasts, although that is, you know, necessary, too, but just to know where, how we came about, and to appreciate the strength of our ancestors and of our immediate family.  We got to--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, when you were in the middle of something, we got interrupted, but in the interim, you thought of James McBride, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, he had looked into the past, and brought out some really significant things and really, some accurate history from what I know about the history.  So, again, we were talking about younger writers, and he is someone that I have a great deal of interest in and now, we, we were, we were talking about my hopes for the black community, for the African (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, hopes and concerns, yeah.
Speaker 1: Hopes and concerns for the African American community.  And I was saying that we really need to know our culture ourselves.  We need to know our past.  We need to like, we, we need to, to have some direction, where we want to go.  It's great having a black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], but I think we need to understand the stress that, that man is under, part- partly because, maybe mostly, because he is African American.  We got a long ways to go and we need--that is one of my concerns that we continue moving, that, that we have.  We do things, like getting out and voting.  Sometimes you just have to do simple things and, and we seem to be kind of integrating ourselves into invisibility, but we need to hold onto what, what we have and what we have done, and where we can go.
Story_ID: 647866
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, I mean, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go, if you could go back and change something at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or anywhere else?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  It, it's, I wish I had taken more history courses.  I have done what I could with what I knew, but I kind of think that if I had--see, I minored in psychology.  I think maybe I should have minored in history.  I don't know, I don't know.  That's one thing.  Another thing I would have done differently is to, to write more.  Some things have gotten, I've gotten an idea, I've gotten a feeling because you can't do an idea if you don't have the feeling for it.  And then, I put that aside and do something else.  I'll say, well, I'll do that later, but I don't get back to it.  And that's--I wish I had written more, I really do.  I--and then, that, that's about it, that's about it.  I have enjoyed the teaching, I've enjoyed it tremendously.
Story_ID: 647867
Speaker 1: Once again, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, then in your career, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's what I'm working on right now, trying to get everything together and looking at it, and say, well, now what have I done, and get it in some kind of order, so that someone else can pick it up and go from there.  I think that perhaps my legacy is in the teaching.  I, I write in order to teach.  I try to teach in my writing.  I think maybe I'm a born teacher rather than a, maybe I'm a born writer, too, I don't know.  But that is my legacy, what I've handed on to other people through the writing in terms of just those concerns I was just talking about.  I guess, one thing, it won't be money.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), okay.  But you've done fairly--I mean, you know, for those who want to become writers, I mean you didn't starve.  You did, you did okay.  It's a profession where you can make some money and you're not, you're not rich, but you're, you did--?
Speaker 2: I did okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm happy, I'm satisfied.
Speaker 1: There you go.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 647868
Speaker 1: Oh, tell us something about your family.  You've got children, right, that, and--?
Speaker 2: I have three, three sons, three sons.  And whole bunch of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and stuff like that.  One, the one that lives closest to me is my second son, Bob [Robert N. Collier], and he is, he and his family, they are a real joy to me.  And we, I think, I think we're kind of close.  I have another son [Charles M. Collier] in California, and I haven't, I haven't met his wife.  He's working on a second marriage now but, and I haven't met her, but I talk to her sometimes on the telephone, and they are a joy, too.  The third son, my youngest son [Philip Collier], I don't get to talk to very often because, now he's an airline pilot, and he lives in China.  So, we don't get to have very much, very much contact, but when we do, it's very good, it's very good.  Yeah, they're, I always have to smile a little bit when I'm talking about them, about my children, my grandchildren and all, yep.
Speaker 1: Now, present here is one of your extended family members, Dr. Chappelle [HistoryMaker Emmett Chappelle], the synthesizer of bioluminescence, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, he is my--
Speaker 1: --the secrets of that so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is my very dear friend.  He encourages me, and he hassles me when I'm not doing right and so, I have to turn around and do right.  And, in fact, he, the Pompeii novel ['The Day the Gods Wept,' Eugenia Collier], it's going to be dedicated to him unless he makes me mad between now and then.  You hear that, Em (laughter)?  But I admire him tremendously, and he is really a light of my life really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and his family, they're my family, too; so it's nice to have an extended family.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think I've talked you half to death, yeah.  Well, what is, what is this last question?
Speaker 1: Well, it's very similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.  It's more, more personal.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) As a good grandmother (laughter), even though I don't bake cookies, and things like that.  As my, one of my granddaughters said, "Yes," but I said, "I don't do these things that other grandmothers do."  She said "Yes, but other grandmothers don't write stories and books and things."  So, I said, oh, okay, it made me feel good.  But I would like to be remembered as a good writer, and as somebody who had some good ideas, and maybe opened up some doorways for various people.  I think that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well, thank you so much for sharing with us.
