Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Today is November 27, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  OSU Library and we   re doing an oral history project called Women of  the Oklahoma Legislature. Today I   m with Susan Paddack who was  elected to the Senate in 2004 from Ada, Oklahoma. Thank you for  allowing me to come today.  Thank you, I   m glad you are here.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little about your childhood and then  we   ll work forward.  Okay, great. I grew up in Texas. In fact, I just have to throw this out  here. When I was campaigning I told everybody I was a Texan by birth  but an Oklahoman by choice. And so I made a very conscious decision  to come to the state of Oklahoma and it was a great decision. But,  growing up, what can I tell you? I have one sister and she is ten years  older so I was the baby of the family. My dad was a telephone lineman  for General Telephone Company and he and my mom, when they were  first married and they married young, because that   s what they did back  in those days, they traveled all around in a little trailer and my dad was a  telephone linemen. In fact, on my office wall you will see some climbers  that were his. When he retired they gave him his climbers back from  when they climbed the poles. And it   s kind of interesting because young  people now don   t know. They just always see bucket trucks. But before  there were bucket trucks, there were people that climbed up those  telephone poles.  My mom was a stay-at-home mom because that   s what my dad wanted  her to do. And my sister, as she was ten years old, she tells me stories of  when I was little. She would ride her bicycle around and she would put  me in her basket and she said the neighbors would just come out   I was  a baby and she rode with me in her basket of her bicycle. And the  5  Finchum  Paddack  neighbors were all pretty horrified about that but I guess my mom was  okay with it and my sister never dropped me so that   s a good thing.  But what do I remember about growing up? I just remember you know,  being outdoors. I liked to do a lot of outdoors things. My dad would take  me fishing. I was born in Baytown, Texas but spent most of my growing  up years in a town called Robstown, which is close to Corpus Christi.  And I can remember a lot of fun times. My dad really liked to boat and  we   d go to the lake and I learned how to water ski. He took me fishing  one time on the Gulf of Mexico in one of those big boats that you rent     or you pay to go out and go fishing. And I had like a bamboo pole and I  caught the biggest fish. And so I liked to fish a lot. I thought that was  fun. So I grew up with the water, I really enjoyed those activities. I was  a Girl Scout   a Brownie first and then a Girl Scout. My mom was the  leader and I just remember doing a lot of things. We were very family-oriented,  which was good.  What about college?  College   well, before college my sophomore year of high school we  moved from Robstown to a town called Brownfield. And Brownfield is  out in west Texas. Our grandmother lived in Levelland and I can  remember going there while growing up. From south Texas it   s very  lush and tropical and you know, nice trees and plants and everything. If  you go to west Texas it   s very dry, very flat. And when we would go to  see my grandmother, I   d say,    Oh, this west Texas. Boy I   m sure glad  we don   t live here.    Well low and behold, my sophomore year in high  school my dad got transferred and we moved to Brownfield out in west  Texas.  I definitely believe that we have destiny, a fate, a life plan that our  Maker has for us. I met a young boy named Gary Paddack when I  moved to Brownfield, Texas. He asked me out to the movies and to go  get a Coca-Cola and so I asked my friend Hazel. I hadn   t been in town  very many days, is this somebody I want to go out with because when  you   re new in town you want to make sure you go with the right person.  You want to go with a reputable person. So she said,    Yeah, he   s okay.     So Gary Paddack and I of course dated and married in 1975, after  college. So it was one of those things that I think I was supposed to be in  west Texas.  College, I went my first years in Lubbock   Texas Tech University.  Gary Paddack and I were still dating and he was at the University of  Colorado and he wanted me to go there. So I asked my parents and  learned very early on you better have a very good case for whatever it is  you want to do because he  her father  wasn   t easily sold on anything.  6  Finchum  Paddack  You had to say why this was beneficial and I made him a deal. If he  would let me go to the University of Colorado, I would work and I  would raise all my spending money and all he   d have to pay for was the  schooling part. Well, he let me go. So I went to the University of  Colorado my junior year. Gary Paddack and I broke up which is kind of  funny when I think back on it now but that   s okay because it was the  first time I   d been away from home and it was really good for me to  grow up.  I might also add that I was the first person to get to go to college in my  family. My sister went to business school, but there was such a gap in  age that as my dad kind of worked his way up in the company, by the  time I came around ten years later they were more able to afford my  going to college and my sister was just able to go to business school. So  I went to the University of Colorado, never been away from home. But I  can remember my mother just going,    Oh, and now you   ve broken up  and you are so far away from home.    But it   s probably the best thing  that ever happened to me because I learned to be independent. I learned  to take care of myself. It was also actually a little more difficult school  and I had to study really hard and I learned that I could succeed and  made lots of new friends, people from all parts of the country.  I was in a sorority. I was the only girl from the southern part of the  United States and it was so funny. Back at that time there was a  commercial on,    It was Shake    n    Bake and I helped    and my nickname  became    Shake    for Shake    n    Bake because I had that southern accent.  So I   d be walking across campus and I   d hear someone say,    Hey  Shake.    So that was kind of fun. Isn   t it funny the things you remember?  But I did well in school. I got my degree. My senior year, Gary and I  started getting back together. But I really had the opportunity to grow up  and be self-sufficient and to learn to be independent so that was a very  good thing. So it was good to go away.  Then I actually went back to Texas and taught school in Brownfield  where I had gone to high school. It was now the junior high school. So I  went back and taught and then became engaged and got married after I   d  been out of college a year.  And then worked in Texas for how long?  And then I moved to Houston, Texas and Gary was in medical school  and I worked there in Houston for two years. And he was out of medical  school and we went to Denver, Colorado where I also taught school at  Littleton. He was in his internship and residency and we did a lot of fun  things. We were very poor because you can   t go through medical school  and two of you live on a teacher   s salary. I think the first year that we  7  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  were married I made  9,000 dollars which is not very much money to  live on. Needless to say, we had to take out some loans and he got a  public health scholarship which helped us get through that time. But  when we went to Denver he was able to moonlight some. And he would  work in the emergency rooms and gave us a little extra money and that  way we could go snow skiing. And we snow skied and we cross country  skied and we back-packed and we did all of those wonderful outdoor  things that you can do in Colorado   and fished some too because I like  to fish. So we did all of those fun outdoor activities and just really had a  good time.  Because he   d gone into Public Health Service, which is a federal  program, he decided to go into the Indian Health Service. And so we had  a two-year payback and we looked at the various openings and there was  a brand new hospital being built, the Carl Albert Indian Hospital in Ada,  Oklahoma, brand new in July of 1980. And so we decided, well, you  know, Oklahoma is pretty close to Texas. We   ll go there, only intending  to be there for two years and then we would either go back to Texas or  back to Colorado. Well, we just fell in love with Ada. You know, rolling  hills, all the outdoor activities that we did in Colorado we could do them  around the Ada area but there weren   t all these people there. You could  actually go camping and somebody not trample across your campsite  and so we made a lot of friends and just loved the area and started our  family. Our son was born in 1981 and we just fell in love with the area  and the people and just the quality of life. So after he did his two years  there we decided we   d make that home, which is what we did. So we   ve  been there twenty-seven years, in Ada.  And you   ll be there a few more, I   d say.  I   ll be there forever. We built a home in 1994 and I said,    This is it.  We   re not going anywhere else.    This is home forever.  So how early on were you interested in politics or political issues?  That   s interesting. I will tell you it   s just a beautiful gift to be an elected  official. It   s a great   I tell everybody it   s a great season in my life. My  kids are grown. Honestly I would not have done this when my children  were little. It   s pretty much a seven day a week job and I have this  wonderful marriage of thirty-two years and my husband is a great  helper. And to really give what I think you need to be giving to the  people of your district, it takes total commitment and it takes just about  every minute of your time.  So when did I get interested in politics? Oh, I guess I was always  interested in politics but while my husband was in medical school, I  8  joined the Medical Alliance Group, which is a physician spouse group.  And you know, we learned about all the things that were affecting health  care and once you start knowing about the issues, it really compels you  to get involved. So through the years, I was very involved. Gary and I  were always what they called key contacts for the Medical Association,  which meant if there was an issue they would contact us by fax. That  was back in the old days it was always by fax, not by e-mail like it is  now. And they would do a blast fax and say,    Contact your legislator  about this bill or that bill.    So we were always very active.  Actually, I got even involved through the political action committees.  The Medical Association had a PAC and they allowed physician spouses  to be part of the PAC board. I also got involved in the National Medical  Alliance Group and was President of that organization in the year 2000-  2001 which took me to thirty-two states and Canada. And much of what  I did was talking about health care issues. And the passion, when you   re  volunteering and you do something, I mean obviously you do it out of  your own money and your own time and energy and you get very  dedicated to that. So a lot of that energy and that knowledge and that  training actually came from my volunteer work because as I was a part  of this organization before I was President they would do speaker  training with us and they would do leadership training with us and just  all sorts of things that really helped me, unbeknownst to me, at the time,  I just enjoyed that. I enjoyed the challenge, I enjoyed thinking about new  issues, but I was getting a lot of leadership training.  I was getting a lot of really good skill sets that once I decided to run for  office helped me tremendously because I would go into a room with 200  people not knowing anybody and have to do a presentation. Well that   s a  skill set that   s very useful to me now as I travel throughout my district.  And to know how to put a speech together and that sort of thing   of  course, in those days you had a lot of time to prepare. At this point in  time, I do so much speaking I don   t have time to prepare. You just kind  of have to go for it. But of course I read all the time. Even when I   m  exercising, I catch up on newspapers. I get on the elliptical and I   ll read  five or six newspapers that are in my district and that   s how I keep up on  issues and also what   s going on right now during interim. All the house  studies, the senate studies, I read the newspapers and it keeps me  knowledgeable about what   s going on.  So I   ve always kind of had that interest and we   d come and visit the  Capitol. There would always be Medicine Day at the Capitol and  nobody else would want to go talk to the legislators. It   s kind of like that  commercial, you know,    Let Mikey eat the cereal.    It was always,    Let  Susan go talk to the legislators.    Nobody else wanted to. I guess it     people have, for some reason, almost a fear of elected officials like they  9  don   t want to come talk to you or they think you   re different. I mean,  you are just the same person you always were. You just have a little bit  more responsibility at this point, obviously. And a true gift to be able to  help people to make a difference by passing good legislation, by doing  constituent work, that sort of thing. But a lot of people are not as  comfortable going and talking to legislators. But it never bothered me. I  always went and talked with my legislators because I cared about the  issues. And I guess that   s really the bottom line of why I ran for office is  I cared about the issues.  2004 was a very unique time in our state. In 2004, of course, that was  the first year that term limits were going to be in place. And so a third of  the legislature was going to be gone. And because I   ve always been  involved, not just in health care issues, but also during that time, I  worked. It was always in the educational field. I was a teacher, I worked  Adjunct Faculty at East Central University there in Ada, I worked for  many years for the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence, started by  David Boren, with the whole prime objective of promoting academic  excellence. I have this real passion for education in our state, too.  And so in 2003 I started looking at the candidates that were going to be  running and I just kind of had that feeling that nobody would work as  hard or care as much as I would. I mean, I just know when I do  something I give 110 . And that   s what I wanted for our area.  Somebody that would wake up every day going,    How can I serve the  people of this district? How can I help make good things happen?     Because it   s always a collective   you personally can   t do it all. You  have to have people that can help you and you have to work. Especially  in this day and time, you have to work in collaboration and be a  consensus builder and I thought I brought those skill sets to the table.  So I ran for office, and what an amazing, amazing, process that is. We  live in this democracy and we take it so for granted. I mean, everyday  you wake up and you get to do exactly what you want to do. You know,  if you want to start your day in prayer, if you want to go and have lunch  with your friends, or if you just go to work, take time with your family,  go to a ballgame, whatever it is you do. And yet our country is at war  right now and we have people who are putting their lives on the line so  that we have those pleasures every day to do   the freedom to do  whatever it is we choose to do.  When I ran for office, I had just a very profound sense of what it means  to be in a democracy because when you go out and you talk to people  and you knock on their doors, you really find out what   s important to  them. And it   s so amazing. People were so nice and appreciative of  someone that would come and knock on their door. I knocked doors for  10  Finchum  seven months till the point I was just limping. It kind of wore me out but  six days a week for seven months, I knocked doors because I was really  the underdog, because there was really nobody that thought I had a  chance. But I believed that I could get it done and I was just so amazed  at the people who came forward to help us. My husband was wonderful.  He had blood blisters on his hand from putting up the big 4x8 signs that  you have to put up, driving those T-posts that you have to hang those  4x8 signs on.  We had people that would go knock doors with us, we had people in  another group would go be in parades with us and other groups that  would just help us do different activities that we needed to do. And it  was just amazing. Our kids helped. What a remarkable process  democracy is. And I wish for everyone that they would have that  experience, to be a part of really trying to get the best government that  we can have. I think that   don   t you think that is kind of remarkable? I  do. So that   s all we did. We worked hard. We got elected. And I say     we    because I could not have done it without the tremendous  supporters and I have, to this day, friends that just bless my life   that I  would never have known had I not have run for office and they are just  like part of my family. I mean there are some that are just, they are like  my sisters and brothers because they are just always there, even now. Is  it time to go do parades? What do we need to do to help you? Just some  great people that I wouldn   t have had the pleasure of getting to know  had I not have run for office.  And I think the other thing about running for office is that you really put  yourself completely out there. I   m really interested in a lot of books on  leadership and one called On Becoming a Leader was one that I  remember I particularly liked. It talks about leadership is fully deploying  all your skill sets. And I think for me running for office was that full  deployment of all my skill sets. It   s like there   s nothing to be afraid of.  (Laughs) Once you   ve gone through a campaign, and mine was pretty  tough and at times very nasty because you know, campaigns can be very  negative. I think when you start edging ahead of the competition that   s  when they get particularly negative, is people trying to suppress the  voters, if you will, or make them not believe in you anymore. So when it  gets really tough like that you really are in touch with who you are and  there   s just a real sense of there   s just no fear. I   ve put it all out there and  I prayed that whatever the outcome would be, that I would just be, I  would be gracious, that whatever it was it wouldn   t make me sad or, you  know, bitter that I lost. That whatever the outcome would be, I really  and truly believed that it would be okay. And it was tough but it was  okay.  Did you have a slogan?  11  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  I think my slogan was,    She   ll fight for us.    And you know what? I do  fight for the people of my district and I fight hard. The truth is     government is not as responsive to its citizens as it should be sometimes.  As a state senator I   ve had many opportunities to be an advocate and  advocate for my people to help them get through the bureaucracy, to  help them get through the maze, to help them sometimes get the services  that they don   t even know how to access. So I do fight, I do fight. I   m a  nice fighter and not a physical fighter. I   m not anything but above board  when I do fight but I do advocate and I don   t give up. I   m very  tenacious. I   m very persistent.  Can you talk about election night a little?  Election night   well, there were several election nights because I had a  primary, I had a run-off and then I had a general. So I had three   three  elections. And every one was equally, I guess, exciting. At the primary  there were three other opponents and myself. I came in with 38  of the  vote. My opponent came in with 42  of the vote and then of course, the  other two, I don   t remember what their percentages were. So I had one  month from the time of the primary to the run-off and we worked so  hard   we also ran out of money. And I think that   s another true test of  your character. When you   re spending about  20,000 dollars a week on  a campaign, and you have no money left in the bank and you have to call  your banker up and say,    I need you to cover me for a while knowing  that I   ll make good because we always made our payments and our bills  and everything on time.    And it was scary that   it was very scary. But  you   ve invested too much   other people have invested too much. You  do not quit. You cannot quit. You wouldn   t want to elect somebody who  was a quitter anyway so you just dig in and you just keep going.  And so probably the biggest relief   the biggest celebration and it was  just a total euphoria was the run-off because in the run-off I beat my  opponent. I had 55  of the vote and he had 45 . So I had gone from  38  to 55 . He   d gone from 42 to 45. I had worked so hard and so had  all the people who had helped me and it was just absolute excitement     absolute excitement. I remember hugging my husband and we were all  just kind of jumping up and down. My consultant, I think, who was  helping me, was almost just in disbelief because it was just pretty  remarkable that we did this. And so that was really the hardest part. The  general was not as difficult because that campaign really didn   t have the  people or the resources as much as I had generated.  So the big one was the run-off and that was the really tough month when  the campaign got really negative and it was pretty much like a bomb  falling every day. You just didn   t know where it was going to come  from. And then, like I say, you run out of money. But then very close to  12  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  the time of the run-off, I got this surge of support again and it was just  kind of like, just carried me over. So it helped me to get the win in the  run-offs. So it was pretty exciting.  And swearing in day?  Oh, that was so special. I had probably thirty people who were my  supporters who came up for swearing in. My husband and our son were  here and we took a picture and it was just a very humbling experience  because here are all these people who had done just what you   d done.  They fought hard, they worked hard to win. And we were all up here and  anxious and excited and just all of the things that come   all the full  range of emotions that come with just this new opportunity.  Do you stay here in the Oklahoma City area or do you commute back  and forth?  During session I stay up here. It   s just too hard, the days. You know,  when we   re in committee meetings, gosh I   m probably up at five in the  morning, reading bills and that sort of thing. And there are so many  functions and so many things to do after hours. I mean, and if there   s  not, I stay up here at my desk and work till 7 or 8 because there   s just so  much to do. The volume I was not   aware of the volume of things.  There are days during session where I may get as many as 200 e-mails  and so the volume is just huge. And so it   s just, you   re always behind.  For someone who is a very type-A personality who likes to get things  done and everything neat and tidy, all organized and finished, that   s the  hard part. You see my desk is a little messy because you can   t get it all  done. And it   s always a matter of prioritization. I mean, you have to be  able to prioritize, you have to multi-task.  And that   s the funny thing, the first year I was up here, people would  come in and talk and you would always be going to the next committee  meeting or some other thing you had to do. I learned very early to just  say,    Come walk with me.    That would be the only amount of time you  had is just to march from your door to whatever committee meeting you  were going to. And I think about that now.    Come walk with me.    But  that   s all the time you had. You have to be able to process. You have to  be able to multi-task. You couldn   t survive if you didn   t. And I think  that first year I passed eleven bills.  That   s a big number.  Which is quite a few. There again, I   m pretty ambitious and fairly  intense. But eleven pieces of legislation and it takes a lot of work to do a  bill and a lot of education. And that   s what I love, though. You learn  13  Finchum  Paddack  something new every day. Every day you have a new challenge, a new  something that you learn and that   s fun.  Do you remember the first bill or your first experience debating a bill on  the floor?  Well, I remember I had a very ambitious bill and it   s called Rx for  Oklahoma and when I was campaigning and I visited all of the nutrition  centers, I saw our senior citizens and they either would bring little  plastic bags or little Tupperware-type dishes and they   d put half their  lunch in there. They   re just so economical and they all talked about how  they couldn   t afford their prescriptions. I found out about this pilot  program in Norman, whereby they tapped into   the pharmaceuticals  have programs and they   re available but they   re very labor intensive.  And so when you go to a physician, they don   t have the time to fill out  all these papers and for every drug company, the paperwork   s different.  Well this program in Norman, this pilot program, helped people fill out  all the paperwork and they helped them tap into these programs that the  pharmaceuticals have to give people that are uninsured or under-insured  the ability to access their prescriptions.  What we did is we took that program, put funding into it and it went into  all the Community Action Agencies and then they go out and help the  citizens to get access to these medications. So it was a one million dollar  piece of legislation   I mean, that   s a huge, a huge deal for a freshman.  And what I remember is I had this radio interview and the interviewer  said,    So Senator Paddack, how does this bill become law?    And I had  the   it   s a good thing I didn   t laugh but it makes me laugh now because  you know, at that point I really couldn   t tell you how it became law. I  only knew that the first step is it went to committee. If you got it out of  committee you get it heard on the floor. If you got it off the floor, then it  went over to the House side. And you kind of lose control of it a little  bit. But it turns out there was a House bill very similar and so there   s a  House bill and there   s a Senate bill and we ended up, the representative  and I discussed whether it would be a Senate bill or a House bill and we  each had things we wanted. It turns out I felt very strongly about who  should manage the actual bill, the implementation and he had very  strong views on other things. So we ended up making it a House bill but  it went through the implementation process that I felt very strongly  about. So it was a very nice compromise and that program is still in  place.  And what is so exciting is I was at a dinner recently in my district, they  have a free medical clinic. So this Community Action Agency that  serves that area comes down and helps those people and the director told  me,    We   re just saving thousands of dollars for people who come to our  14  Finchum  Paddack  free medical clinic for their prescriptions.    And it   s just like,    Yea      Three years later, it   s still making a difference and that   s the fun of  being a legislator is getting to put good programs in place that help  people. But that whole idea is, how does it become law? And I   m like,     Ohhh.    But I think my response was,    Well I   m working on that as  we   I   m learning that as I go.    Yes, that   s what I said,    I   m learning as I  go.    Which was very true and I learned and got it done.  What are some of the other eleven?  I actually had a bill that was very near and dear to my heart, which was  in the second session. This was an area that was totally   I wrote a lot of  education bills, a lot of health care bills because those were my passion  areas when I came to the Senate. But I   ve written some other bills that  really were just leaps of faith. One of which was the Caitlin Wooten Act.  I don   t know if you   ve heard of it but there was this 16-year-old young  woman at Ada High who was abducted and she was murdered by her  mother   s former boyfriend. He had been let out on bail after he  kidnapped the mother. He   d been let out on bail even though he had  some violent tendencies. I just thought something is not right with our  laws when we   re not protecting people from those who are violent. Why  are we letting them back out when they are violent? And so I stuck my  neck out there and said,    You know we need to change our laws.    And  there again, you learn as you go.  I didn   t realize at the time that our bail laws are in the state constitution.  So it turned out to be a little bit more of a challenge than I thought.  There were some precedents in case law and we were able to change and  strengthen what I think are the bail laws in our state. And I heard an  instance recently in Durant where someone was in a similar situation and  they evoked Caitlin   s law and the gentleman did not get out on bail. So  you know, there again, it   s pretty exciting to do things that keep people  safe, that help people get the help they need whether it   s medical or  education.  Some really, I think, some good laws have been passed that I   ve been  privileged to be a part of. Another one that I   m very pleased   it   s in that  health, education arena   is we have huge shortages of healthcare  workers in our state. In six years or less, we are going to be 3,000 nurses  short. Allied health professionals we are short on. And I was able to pass  a bill that provides   it   s called a Healthcare Workforce Resources  Center, so studying all the gaps and now we   re going about methodically  trying to fill those gaps by increasing the pipeline and providing the  educational training so that we can get more nurses. We found that like  57  of all students that apply are getting into nursing school, which  means there are a lot of qualified applicants out there that because we  15  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  don   t have enough nursing faculty and that sort of thing, they aren   t  getting into the pipeline. So that   s what I mean when I say we need to  expand the pipeline. So really some exciting things.  Are you a chair or co-chair of any committees?  I am, and that   s another really significant change because of term limits.  I came in as vice-chairman of Education Standing Committee, moved to  chair of the Education Committee in year two and then in year three,  because now the Senate is equally divided which is historic. We have an  equally divided Senate, half democrats, half republicans. I   ve got to help  be a part of the negotiating team to define what shared leadership was  for that and it really worked well last session. So hopefully it will again  this year. Of course, it   s a campaign year so that could be interesting to  see if it holds as well. But I am co-chair of the Senate Education  Appropriations Committee, which is a huge responsibility. But what   s  happened because of term limits, you move much more quickly into  committee chairmanships and leadership positions and that sort of thing.  Any women on some of those?  Actually, women are involved in everything. Now that we are split,  everybody is co-chair of a committee so that   s kind of the new thinking.  And very much a result, again, of term limits, I think because in the  years passed, you had to be here for years and years and years. You  know, the joke was, they always told you to sit in the back row and keep  your mouth closed. You can   t do that anymore. You better be able to hit  the floor running.  Has your office always been here  Room 428B ?  No my office actually was in the south hall and I liked that because I  overlooked the south parking lot and it   s very scenic. I don   t have any  windows in this office, but when we moved to the shared agreement,  part of the restructuring was the democrats got the north hall and the  republicans got the south hall. So I had to move from south to north. So  that   s how I ended up   but this is a great office, too. All the offices are  quite nice.  So a typical day     A typical day? Oh my goodness, what is a typical day? A typical day  really varies. In session, like I say a lot of times I   ll get up at five  o   clock and I   ll read bills before I come into committee meetings here.  Essentially the minute you hit the floor, there   s going to be people lined  up in your office. So what I   ve learned is that if I need to read and have  16  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  a quiet reflection time, I   d better do it before I get to the Capitol because  once I hit the floor, there will be people here. And first year, the  lobbyists and the agency heads and everybody learned typically a lot of  people will leave after lunch on Thursday if there is no session Thursday  afternoon. Well I would always use that time to catch up on phone calls  and paperwork. I would always stay here on Thursday afternoon and not  go home until late in the afternoon like five o   clock, I   d head home.  Well pretty soon people started coming in because nobody else was left  in the building much so they   d all come to my office. I still do that  because I can   t get out of here. There   s too much work to do.  But a typical day is being in committee meetings, it   s putting bills on the  floor, it   s having meetings with constituents. I have a lot of people come  up from my district. I had an urban legislator in here, my co-chair who is  from Edmond and one day we were in here having an education meeting  and he was in here an hour and a half. We had the fiscal staff in here and  we were just talking about budgets and that sort of thing. I think I  probably had about four or five interruptions of people from the district  and he goes,    Susan, I live in Edmond. You have more visitors in an  hour and a half than I do in a whole session.    So it   s really great though.  I mean, I love the fact that people back in the district come up here. So  you might have a classroom of kids. You may have CareerTech students.  You may have the home educators group up here. I mean, you never  know. A retired educators group   there   s just a ton of groups that come  up on a regular basis.  Without calling first?  This is everyone   s Capitol. I   m glad that they just come up   usually a  lot of them schedule days, you know they   re coming. But I always  encourage them to come up to the office. You always have time for your  constituents   that   s who you work for. You better always have time for  them otherwise you aren   t doing your job right. So it   s always a treat to  have people come up and it   s nice to visit. Because I travelled statewide  in a lot of my work in education, I have people from all over. They   re  not always necessarily from my district but people will come by and say  hi. So it   s always nice. But it makes for a very chaotic day. And then  about five o   clock, it gets quiet around here and a lot of people head to  receptions or other events that they   ve got to go to. I will stay, usually,  try and catch up on a few more e-mails, a few more phone calls,  organize papers, load up my briefcase for all the reading I   ve got to do  that night and the next morning and then you start all over again. So I  don   t know if there is a typical day but it   s always busy.  No time for cooking?  17  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  No time for cooking, that   s for sure. Except on holidays.  Well do you drive down Lincoln Boulevard to get here?  I do. I do. 23rd is a little harder to get off of the freeway.  And your thoughts when you see the dome?  You know, I still get excited. I still get excited. It   s like,    Oh, goody.  Look what I get to go do today. I get to go to work and wow. I   m a  legislator.    And it   s powerful   it   s exciting. It   s just a huge honor and  truly a blessing. As I said, it   s a truly grand season in my life. A time  when my kids are grown. I have this wonderful husband who supports  me. I can really devote all my energies and time to doing my job for the  people.  You   re up for re-election?  You know, I will gear up but I   m out every weekend. I   m out all the  time in my district. I talk to people, I have meetings. During interim, I   m  meeting with one group after another. I   m out at the pie suppers, I   m just  everywhere. I put on a lot of miles. I put in, what, 2,500 to 3,000 miles a  month on my car. I think one Saturday night I hit about four different  events. So you just go from one thing to another. It   s tough not to put on  weight with so many good pie suppers and catfish fry   s and all of that  sort of good thing. But lots of nice places in the district and you know, at  this point it   s kind of like going to a family reunion when you go out to a  lot of these events. You like visiting with people and you like giving  them a hug and you like seeing how the kids have grown. And you  know, talking about who is feeling poorly because sometimes there are  health issues. I mean, you just talk about   they are, they   re like family  and just good friends. They become a really vital and integral part of  your life. They are your family. That   s who you serve.  Well a little bit related to that, do you have a role model?  I do and it   s interesting you would ask that and I   m surprised I didn   t  mention her sooner. For me, when I was a young mother and you know,  I stayed home with my children for a few years when they were little  and we had a Senator named Billie Floyd who you interviewed. And  Billie was one of the first people I went to talk to when I decided I was  going to run. And it   s so funny, I can remember sitting at this restaurant  and I didn   t know her very well at the time but I   d always read about her  and for me, she was indeed the model of what a legislator was supposed  to be. Somebody who was out there all the time, cared about the people,  accessible. She   s like the Energizer Bunny. She still is the Energizer  18  Finchum  Paddack  Bunny and she   s everywhere and she does everything. And I just love  her to death and I call her every week because she still loves to hear all  the stories. She   s such a good friend and such a good mentor. But she  probably never knows how many lives she affected through her   just  through the way she served the people of District 13. She was a  tremendous role model for me then as she is now because she continues  to give so much to the people of the district and contributes so much and  is so active in everything. I mean, that   s definitely who I want to be  when I grow up. I want to be just like her. So she   s awesome.  I hope that in some small way that some people see me that way. And I  think maybe they do. But it   s also a little bit of a heavy burden because  it   s like, oh my gosh, people watch and you want to do everything right  because you want to be a positive role model. But Billie Floyd really  continues to be just a vital citizen and a good friend and the truth is my  family probably gets a little tired of all the politics and all that stuff, but  Billie always loves to listen. And that   s really special to have a friend  like that.  Once you are here in this building, did you have someone that would  take you under their wing and show you a few of the ropes, or     You know it   s interesting. I   m not sure that we do as good a job as we  should in nurturing our new people. I had a group   there were four  other Democrats besides me who were elected at the same time and they  called us the Five Amigos. And so   and they   re all guys and I was the  only female. But they called us the Five Amigos because we went  everywhere together. You know, we went to all the receptions. We did  all the things together. We went out to dinner together. We learned  together but it was so great to have other people who came in because  we could talk to each other and we could talk about issues and we  learned from each other. And for us, it was a great thing. It was a great  thing to have that. Very necessary the first year and I   m not sure that we  shouldn   t somehow just structure that every time we bring in new  legislators. And actually, because we   re bringing in so many new ones  because of term limits, that kind of naturally occurs. Even the    06 group,  the four of them really bonded when they came in.  I can   t speak as much on the republican side, but for me, that freshman  year was the Five Amigos and that was a great thing. But I   m not so sure  we don   t need to really do a better proactive job, if you will, of nurturing  our new people. And there   s a lot of talk about that. I was reading in US  News   World Report on they just selected eighteen top leaders and  there   s a discussion about the new thinking on leadership and that sort of  thing. I think you have to grow your leaders and I think you have to  grow people into the positions of responsibility that we   re in. And I  19  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  think there are some skill sets that I think we could all help each other  with because people learn from each other.  Have you noticed any gender differences?  Gender differences   well that is interesting even in the year 2007 that  we would even talk about gender issues. The truth is, there are gender  issues   always. I think we   ll fight that for a while. Look at our numbers.  We have seven senators that are women out of forty-eight. Even lower  percentage in the House. But when I ran, somebody asked me,    Is this  like a woman thing with you?    And I said,    No this is like a credibility  thing. It   s never about the gender, it   s always about the credibility.    And  frankly, I still take that approach.  I don   t address the gender issue, I just work through the gender issue. If  I   m dependable, if I   m reliable, if I do my work   and I always do my  work. I always stay informed, then I   ll be credible and so then I don   t  have to worry about the gender issue. But you have to be credible. You  have to be hard working. I mean, you just   but don   t you want that for  every elected official? To be working hard and to be credible and to be  doing the work that they need to do. So that   s the approach I take. It   s  not about the gender, it   s about what you   re willing to work and work  ethic was one of the big things my dad taught me.  What about the after hours, the social aspect of it? I know men go out to  dinner a lot to dinner to discuss issues and women don   t necessarily feel  comfortable joining them, or some do, some don   t.  I think that   s changed. I think that   s changed somewhat. I do know, that  first year   because, the Five Amigo group we always hung out together.  And there was one evening, one of the Amigo   s said,    Well we   re going  out to dinner at such-and-such.    And I said,    Well I don   t have that on  my calendar.    He said,    Well it   s for all the freshmen. Go ask Senator  over there.    So I went and asked the Senator over there and I said,    Well  I understand there   s a dinner tonight.    And he looked at me and goes,     Well it   s not for all the freshmen.    At that point I realized, I think this  is just the guys. And I said,    Oh, that   s okay. I   m not trying to intrude.     And he said,    Oh, it won   t hurt. You can go.    So I think that night I  went out to dinner with, I don   t know, seven or eight guys. I guess I  didn   t embarrass myself or didn   t embarrass them because I got invited  back another time. But it was funny because I remember going home  that night and calling my husband and going,    Well I had dinner with  the guys tonight so I guess I   m okay.    You know, because you want to  be treated and accepted as an equal   always.  Hannah Atkins had breakfast with the guys, so we have come a long way  20  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  since     There you go. There you go.  So that   s a good thing.  Yeah.  It   s been interesting to see how the different ages from the 60s, 70s and  on up have answered that question.  Well Billie Floyd even tells stories of when she got here there weren   t  any female bathrooms close to the Senate floor so things are making  progress.  When you were coming in and you have certain goals and certain issues  you want to address, have you done most of that?  Well goals should always be on-going. If you ever get to the point where  you   ve achieved all your goals, you   re just not pushing yourself hard  enough. So have I achieved goals? I   ve achieved a lot of goals.  With eleven bills I would think     Actually I   ve, in three sessions, I   ve passed over thirty bills. So I   m  learning every year. I   m always pushing legislation. It   s that time again  this year so I   m looking at all the things that I want to do and I typically  will take on   I ran a water bill last year. And water is one of those  issues nobody wants to talk about. It   s one of our most critical issues  that we need to deal with as a state. And then those tough issues, people  just want to bury. They don   t want to deal with them. I see myself as  somebody who wants to push it. And I want to push it. As a people we  can   t be complacent, we can   t be happy with what we have.  We need to always be pushing to get to the economic prosperity that we  need in the state. You know, our per capita income is not where it needs  to be. It   s lower than a lot of other states. We don   t have near the  number of college graduates that we need. Right now, I   ve been to two  meetings in the past two days and the big issues were workforce. We  need more educated workforce. We need to be tackling the tough issues  in this state. That   s how we achieve prosperity in the second 100 years.  We have got to be tackling the tough issues. So I   m comfortable with  my role.  Some of those things will get shot down and I   m okay but this year I   m  going to bring back two water bills and see how those fare. And I   ll  21  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  bring back some bills   I had a bill last year I couldn   t believe it didn   t  even get heard in the House. It was to increase the penalty for not  wearing a seat belt. And this bill came to me from an Ada High  leadership group. They had done some research and they had this big  project that   s gotten national recognition. It   s called Project Ignition. It  is to get kids to buckle up their seat belts and to drive more safely. They  brought this issue to me and they thought that our penalties needed to be  increased. Well our penalties in this state are  20 dollars and nationally  they   re at about  38 dollars. So I ran a bill to increase the penalty. Well  during the course of that, as I told you, you always learn, I learned that  we were missing out on  2 million dollars from the federal government  on public safety issues that we could be capturing if we raised our  penalty to at least  25 dollars. It didn   t get heard in the House. So that   s  one of those that I will bring back this year.  It   s amazing sometimes that some things just get killed. I had another  one, you know how we   re always hearing about people leaving their  children in the car and they have serious   sometimes they die, a serious  illness or sometimes they die   and we heard about one recently.  Somebody was out at a casino and left their grandchild in the car and I  had a bill that would set penalties for that and that one didn   t get heard  in the House last year. So it was interesting. I had eighteen bills pass out  of the Senate last year but probably only four of those survived in the  House. Now, probably another four ended up passing because I put them  in other bills of similar title but they don   t have my name on them. But  primary author, I have about thirty-one bills in three sessions so I   m  always working very hard to meet goals, and more importantly, to meet  the needs of constituents because a lot of my bills come from  constituents and their needs.  Do you do your own research?  We have staff that helps us on the research. There   s just   there   s not  enough hours in the day to do all the research you need to do.  You have to be a speed reader.  Pretty much. You learn.  What has been your biggest obstacle or have you had an obstacle?  My biggest obstacle   I would just have to say too much work and never  enough time is an obstacle that, just not getting to do everything you  want to be able to do in a day. But I do fit as much as I can into  everyday.  22  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Do you have a favorite campaign story?  A favorite campaign story? Well I told this actually the other day. I  talked at East Central to a group about public service as a career. And I  told this story and I   ve told this several times because it kind of goes  back to that gender thing. There was an elderly gentleman who lived  close to the college. We had knocked his door once, my husband had  knocked it and the second time around I knocked it. And he told me that  he couldn   t vote for me because I was a woman. And at that point, we   d  knocked a lot of doors and you kind of learn to put your toe kind of in  the door there so they can   t completely shut it. So I kind of engaged him.  And I said,    Well I think you might want to give me a second chance.     He said,    Well why is that?    And I said,    Well my daddy raised me to  think and to work hard.    I said,    My husband knocked your door last  time, I knocked your door this time. Has anybody else come around and  asked you if they could work for you?    And he said,    No.    I said,    Well  that   s why I think you might want to consider voting for me because I  will work hard for you.    We ended up having a really nice conversation  and he was talking about his health and he was headed to church that  night and that sort of thing.  But you know, the bottom line is, it was a little bit of a surprise that he  actually came out and said,    I can   t vote for you because you   re a  woman.    But yet, at that point in the campaign, it really didn   t faze me  because I believed in myself and I believed in what I was doing and  that   s why I said,    Well you know, I think in this case you might want to  give it a second thought or make an exception.    Or whatever the exact  words that I said to him but I wasn   t shy on telling him,    You know  what, who else has come and knocked on your door?    So I do think it  made an impression.  You   ll go knock on his door again next time.  There you go.  Since we were talking about favorite stories, do you have a favorite one  dealing with actually serving?  A favorite story? Gosh, there   s just so many wonderful experiences. I  mean, one day you may be going out and looking at bridges and another  day you may be speaking to a group. I don   t know if I could really single  out   I love the diversity and if you talk core values, I mean one of the  things that I value is just the ability to challenge yourself on a daily  basis   the ability to learn something new. And in this job you always  do, you always learn something new. So I really like the diversity of  things from going out   I can remember going out one time and going  23  Finchum  Paddack  on   there   s a Sportsman   s Caucus and I went out with the Sportsman   s  Caucus and we went out on a coon hunt which is something very big in  my area. It was very interesting because I didn   t know what all that  entailed. And then another day you might be going out and looking at  sink holes on somebody   s property. Or you might be talking to  somebody that needs help with their DHS  Department of Human  Services  and their grandchildren. I love the diversity.  Well after your twelve years are up, what do you think your next step  will be?  Well that   s interesting. I think what I   ve always tried to do, just like with  this opportunity of running for office, is   and I think it   s very typical  with today   s thinking is I keep my skill sets up and I think I   ve been so  blessed throughout my life. Doors just seem to open   there just seems  to be endless opportunities. If you like to learn, if you like to work hard,  if you   re blessed with wonderful friends   there   s just so many  opportunities to   I guess that   s my biggest challenge, I want to be a part  of everything.  One of the things that I continue to do, even now, is I do some non-profit  consulting on the side. Most lawmakers do something, whether it   s  insurance or law or whatever. And because of all my non-profit work, I  continue to do non-profit consulting and I love that. I love that because  it   s just limitless possibility and it   s such a quality of life issue. When  you think about what our non-profits do for us in our communities and  in our state and in our nation, it   s just a real quality of life whether  they   re helping to rebuild homes for the elderly or they   re helping  children to learn to read. Whatever it is, there   s just tremendous energy  in that non-profit sector. So I continue to do some consulting there and I  enjoy that. I could see myself doing that more fulltime at the end of my  twelve years and I hope the people will give me twelve years. But I  don   t know.  There   s all sorts of other things that may come along and somebody  asked me,    So do you have aspirations to move on to the federal level?     And I really don   t think that I do but I   ve learned never to say never.  Who would have ever thought that I would be a state senator now? I  mean, ten years ago I didn   t say,    Gee, I want to grow up and be a state  senator in ten years.    But that opportunity came and I think it   s just fun  to have the courage to walk through those new doors. I think that   s what  makes life interesting and fun is new challenges, new opportunities and  just continuing to grow your skill sets and to continually push yourself.  Isn   t that what keeps you young? It   s just that whole learning and  growing and taking on new tasks.  24  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Perhaps you   ll do a leadership class     That would be fun. That would be really fun. I really am very intrigued  with leadership. I just think we need to help people to be leaders. I was  doing some reading, like I said, the other night and I just find that very  intriguing.  If some young woman came up to you and asked what your advice would  be to her if she was considering running, what would you have to say to  her?  You know, I have had a young woman who was in a very good job who  thought about running for public office and she asked me an opinion.  And if you ask me an opinion, I   ll give you an honest opinion. She is  very talented, very intelligent, obviously going to move up in her career.  She had lots of opportunity to move up where she was. Had only been  married probably seven, maybe seven years   no children   and she  wanted to know what I thought about her running for office. And I said,     Well, you would be great.    But I said,    You   re young enough that  you   re going to have lots of opportunities in life and you don   t have to  fit them all in, in the next decade.    I said,    If you want to have children,  if you want to have a little bit more time right now with your spouse, I  would advise that you wait and think about running for office later on  because you   re going to continue to move up in your career. But you  need to have time for your husband because seven years is not married  for very long. And if you want to have children, I couldn   t do this job if  I had babies, I couldn   t do it if I had toddlers.    Now there are some  women who have done it out here and I just applaud them. But that   s not  what I wanted to do.  She asked my opinion, so I gave her my opinion knowing that she would  do whatever that she wanted to do. But I think young women sometimes  think that you have to do it all right now. I think the wisdom of being a  little bit older, like I am, is that you know what? Life is always full of  opportunities and you don   t have to cram them all in the next five to  seven years. Pace yourself. Do what you want to do now and then  know   set these other goals for yourself later on. But it doesn   t all have  to be done now. I do think there is a tendency with all saying we   re  young, we   ve got to do it now.  I just think there   s a season to life in lots of things. But there   s   that   s a  whole career philosophy for some women. They   d rather have their  career and postpone having children till later in life. And some do it  younger and then have their careers later in life. I also said that, you  have to find what works for you   with you and your spouse. You have  to talk about these issues and put it out there. But I think it would be  25  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  very difficult to do this job   to do the energy level that I have now it  would be very difficult to do with younger children.  Even harder if you   re having to commute or you live further away.  Exactly. There are young women out here that do that, I really applaud  them. I think it would be tough.  Did the forget-me-not   that was the forget-me-not vehicle act was the  one not leaving them in the car.  Right, right. I talked about that.  The other one was you were on the Fifty Making a Difference.  The Journal Record is the Oklahoma City newspaper and every year  they select fifty women making a difference. It   s all women. And I guess  it   s been about three years now. Someone nominated me and I was  chosen as one of those fifty and I was very honored by that. Certainly no  one does volunteer work or works in their career   you don   t do it for the  awards or the recognition but, you know, it   s always nice to be  appreciated   that somebody has noticed that you are trying to work hard  and make a difference in your state. So I was very honored and very  pleased to receive that.  If you don   t have anything else, my last question is when history is  written about you, what would you like it to say?  You know, if you really adhere to the whole good to great philosophy of  leadership, it   s not important that I   m remembered for this bill or that  bill and I don   t need roads or bridges or anything named for me. What I  would hope that people would remember about me is that she worked  hard, she cared about the people. And that would be enough because you  know, the true legacy I would leave would be that things are better and it  doesn   t matter if my name is attached. That   s not the important part. The  important part is that I did my contribution and that whole good to great  philosophy is that it   s not about me because the credit goes to all those  around you because in this environment you do nothing by yourself.  You have to be a team player. You get no legislation passed if you don   t  have the votes for it. So I just think it   s important   especially in this  environment, there are some who it is about their personal credit or  whatever. I really don   t care about that. I really would just hope that  people remember that she cared and that she worked hard and that she  gave her best. Because really what else is there? And that is what I hope  to leave.  26  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  And I think you   re doing just that. I   ve got the other question.  Oh, that   s okay. That one kind of makes me tear up.  You were the Majority Whip?  Yes.  And the first freshman to do that? First freshman     Oh, I presided. I presided. Because I had   and this is really the truth     because I had such a difficult campaign   very difficult campaign which  we   ve talked about   and because I had to raise a lot of money   I had  one of only six senate races that year that went over  200,000 dollars in  expenditures. There is a tribute, really, that comes with that and that is  that you have the opportunity to be part of the leadership. And so my  freshman year I was the Majority Whip which means I was part of the  leadership team. I guess that year I was probably the only female, wasn   t  I? Yeah, I was the only female on the leadership team. I think probably  when that happens there are some who have been here longer who  wonder why. But I really think it was a tribute to the fact that I had such  a hard campaign and that I had proven myself worthy of being  considered for leadership. So I was Majority Whip the first year.  This year I am called the Democratic Whip because now that we   re in  this 24-24 tie, there are Democratic Whips and there are Republican  Whips. And actually this year we have three. A lot of people don   t know  what a Whip does. The Whip is actually the person who goes around and  asks the caucus members how they   ll be voting on the issues. And issues  that are very tight that we need to know where our caucus members are,  typically the Whip is the one that goes around   now a true Whip  probably goes so far as to say,    If you aren   t where you need to be on  that vote, they   ll probably try to twist your arm.    I was not that way, not  that way now. We don   t typically do that.  Our caucus is very respectful of the fact that you need to vote your  constituency and your core values and I really value that as part of our  caucus that everybody values. They value each other and they value that  you have different constituencies and different stands on issues. But a  true Whip would probably help you decide that you need to be here or  there on the vote. At the federal level a Whip is a little more persuasive  in that regard. But at the state level, it   s more just to really ascertain  from other caucus members where they stand on issues so that we know,  there aren   t any surprises, you know where everyone stands on issues.  If there are three this year, are there any other women?  27  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Finchum  Paddack  Yes there are.  That   s good.  Yeah.  That   s a balance the other way.  So yes, we   ve got a couple of women in leadership now.  Well that   s all my questions. I appreciate your time.  Okay, good. Well thank you, Tanya. It   s been a pleasure.  ---  ---
