Marcia Greenlee:
Inabel Burns Lindsay:
This is part one of an interview with Dr. Inabel Burns Lindsay. The interview is taking place in Dr. Lindsay's home in the Harbor Square apartments, 510 N Street^ S.W., Apartment N 317, Washington, D.C., 20024. The date is May 20, 1977. The interviewer is Marcia Greenlee.
Dr. Lindsay, would you please give me a synopsis of your career up until your retirement from Howard in 1967?
Yes, I'll be glad to. My career began immediately, well, not immediately after graduation, because I had a scholarship to the New York School of Social Work, now the Columbia University School of Social Work. However, I went home, after one year of graduate study at Columbia, because my mother was not well and had been very disappointed in my choice of social work as a career. Her other children had become teachers. And in the little midwestern town where I was born and reared, there was very little else for a black girl to look forward to. So it was just assumed that I, too, would follow in the path established by an older sister and brother and teach school. Plus the fact that I was assigned to Columbia in New York, which meant, in my mother's mind, that I would be exposed to a life of vice and crime and danger, the first time I'd ever been in a big city alone.
As a matter of fact, the choice of Howard for my college was influenced largely by the fact that I -was very young and not particularly physically sturdy, so my mother wanted me to be where I'd be "protected." So she searched for a school that would offer dormitory facilities. Many of my classmates and friends, on graduation from high school, attended nearby midwestern state universities: Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas. That was an area where the schools were easily available to those of us in northwest Missouri. However, they did not offer dormitory accommodations for black girls and so, being close to sixteen years old, my mother didn't want me in that kind of an environment.
After Columbia, one year, I went home to teach because of my mother's anxiety. I taught in my home town, Saint Joseph, Missouri, for one year, following in the footsteps of an older brother and sister. I had a very sheltered situation.﻿2
IBL: (cont) The principal of the school to which I was assigned had taught members of my family, practically all six of them, and was unduly protective of me, handpicked a class of fifth grade children from "the better families." And went in the classroom to introduce me to the class, telling them that he remembered my older brother bringing me to school and my sitting on the desk as a little girl in my brother's classroom. I told the principal afterward , that he was damaging my capacity for a relationship with those children, all of whose families I knew, of course. But anyway, I had a happy, and I hope, productive year there. I didn't know very much.
In the summer between the two academic years, I went to Cleveland to work as a summer substitute for the Cleveland Urban League, since social work was my objective as a career, and I enjoyed that experience. But when I received an appointment in the Kansas City school system, the nearest large city to us, I eagerly accepted it, because the salary was better, the social life was more enjoyable, and it was only fifty miles from home. I thought I would commute over weekends, but when I came back from Cleveland, after the summer experience there, my mother and older sister had gone to Kansas City, selected an apartment and moved my mother in so that she'd be there to take care of me. There was a note on the door at home to come to Kansas City. This was Labor Day, that I got that. And so I did.
The apartment which they had selected was not a very desirable one, and we were sort of unaccustomed to big city life. We immediately began a search for one more suitable and found a little cottage next door to distant relatives who were also teachers in the Kansas City system. That made life a little more bearable for my mother, and comfortable and protective for me.
I had an exactly opposite kind of situation in Kansas City to the one I'd had in my home town. The principal, to whom I was assigned in Kansas City, wanted no part of any college graduate. He himself was a normal school graduate, and that's what he wanted in this grade school. Plus the fact that I had been requested to be assigned to a school whose principal had been one of my high school teachers, and another principal, who was a graduate of Howard, wanted me because I was a graduate of Howard. He hadn't known me before. I suppose to avoid any conflict or show of favoritism to either one of them, the board of education assigned me to a completely neutral one whom I hadn't known, and whose principal didn't know me. The usual general faculty meeting was held in the morning of Labor Day, and in the afternoon you had your own school faculty meeting in the building to which you were assigned. This principal in Kansas City greeted the two college graduates who had been assigned to him with a good deal of criticism and not a very pleasant reception. He announced at the meeting, "We've got two college graduates assigned to us this year. I don't know what they're coming here for. They ought to go down to the high school."
And then my physical setting, instead of being a room in the main building, was in an annex two blocks away. Plus the fact I found on the arrival of my class, that it was a bunch of leftovers from an old teacher who'd retired, who, having heard of some new pedagogical methods, tried them all out without familiarity with them. Others of my students were rated﻿3
IBL: (cont) low average. This was a combination of a 5-A and a 4-B or
the other way around. I don't remember how they classified the classes, but there were these levels. And they were very difficult.
I found discipline the main problem, and appreciated a great deal the help given me from a man who was next door to me in the manual training division located in the same little annex. He was an older man who could control the big boys. I had some very overgrown boys, twelve, fifteen years old, in the fourth or fifth grade. So you can imagine what life was like, trying to teach them something and control them.
About six weeks into the school year, one of my former teachers in my little high school at home, who had also moved on to Kansas City and become a music supervisor, in her rounds of visiting the various schools to see the progress of the teachers and to give them some help, visited my room and was quite amazed at the order which I had achieved within that six weeks. She said, "How did you do it, Inabel? Because when I used to corae here last year and see half of these people, in Miss Hunt's class, they'd just as soon run out windows as doors. And she always pounded on the desk with her ruler or the pointer and yelled loudly, which was reciprocated by the students, of course." And I said, "Well, I found out that I had to cast aside pedagogical theory which I had learned, and get down to plain old good manners." I tried to use some of my social work training, too, by instilling a sense of pride and self and identity in these kids who were from awfully deprived neighborhoods. And I knew the kinds of homes they came from, and I knew they had been subject to very harsh discipline, not reasoning. Well, it was quite a struggle, but I did get some response from them.
And toward the end of that semester, the first half of that year, the principal of Lincoln High School in Kansas City, who was a very humane and socially conscious man, had been seeking funds for a grant to put a visiting teacher in the high school. Somebody had told him that I'd had some social work training. So he came to visit my class at Attucks School, the elementary school. It so happened that he came without an appointment, and I had had to go to the main building with a report or some special assignment so I was away from my classroom when he arrived. I had helped these children develop a sense of pride in themselves to the point where I could leave one student in charge and say, "Now you may talk quietly among yourselves if you wish." I don't know the little girl's name, but let's say, Mary. "Now if we have any company, you have them take a seat and make them comfortable and tell them I'll be back." So he went in, and he found this class happily working, fairly quietly. The little girl rose and greeted him as a hostess would, and he said, "Where's your teacher?" She said, "Well, she had to go to the main building on an errand but she'll be back shortly. Would you have a seat?" Well, he was simply bowled over, because he knew these children and their backgrounds and the neighborhoods from which they came.
So when I finally returned, and he had set up an appointment with me, so when I went to his office for it, later, he said, "I don't know what your academic capacities are or even the discipline which you're prepared to teach, but if you come down here and do the kind of thing with these teenagers that I have from the same areas, I'll give you any class you﻿4
IBL: (cont) want and any schedule you want."
So he got a local philanthropist to give him the requested grant. I think it was all of $1500. That was my salary, to come to the high school. And I changed schools, much to my good fortune because I don't think I would have lasted at the Attucks School. I don't think the principal thought very highly of my work, and I really was not a good teacher at the elementary level. I didn't want to do that, the first thing. I wanted to be a social worker. And it turned out that the project went along very well and showed some modest degree of success. There were gaps, of course, because there was no other professional social worker. I was young; I was inexperienced; I had no supervision; and I wouldn't dare take a job like that again. I think it was very silly. But I did it because I was interested and excited by the opportunity to be near home and also to do what I wanted to do. And I stayed there for three years, till I got married. I believe it was three, it was either three or four. I didn't teach very long because in those days, you had to give up your job when you got married, if you were female. That's how my oldest sister happened not to be teaching. She'd gotten married.
The first year of my marriage, I didn't work because my husband had some old-fashioned ideas about women working. This was in the middle 1920s so you can appreciate that those ideas might have been the ones that governed behavior of both males and females. But I got bored to death. We had agreed that I wouldn't work for a year. And if 1 had a child, we'd decide then which way our marriage was to go, whether I was to be a housewife and a mother, or whether I was going to go in for a career.
It had always been my intention to have a career, because I was brought up in a hard-working family where you were supposed to earn your keep. Even when I was in college, every summer that I went home, I found a little job of one kind or another, babysitting or a stock girl in a dress shop or anything that was available to do for the summer. It was understood in the family that I was to earn my railroad fare back to school. Whatever I earned over that, I could spend on myself. But that was my obligation, to help support myself through school, as much as I could without jeopardizing my career, my studies. And again, I was lucky enough to get employment without any effort, and totally unexpectedly.
I'd been married and living in Saint Louis then for eleven months when the national Urban League, which had sent me to Columbia University on a fellowship, found out I was there. They were doing a survey of Springfield, Illinois, which was very close, just across the river from Saint Louis. And they had hounded me for the four years I'd been teaching by telling me I was not repaying my obligation to the Urban League, that they had invested in me, and I was not being a social worker. And I did feel very guilty over that. But after I'd been married eleven months, I was quite bored, and guilty about not doing anything, because I said my mother worked too hard and spent too much money on my education for me not to be doing something with the education that was made possible.
After one of the famous riots of that period, the early twenties, during that decade, I the Urban League] had been invited into Springfield to do a survey of the community and recommend facilities to ease the racial tension. The outstanding sociologist, whom you're too young to know much﻿5
IBL: (cont) about but you've read about him, I'm sure, Charles S. Johnson, at Fisk University—had been at Fisk—was director of the research division of the National Urban League. So once more the Urban League wrote me and said, "Here's your chance to begin to repay your obligation. This survey is going to take only six weeks. Can't you go over to Springfield and be the assistant on this research project?"
My year's agreement not to work was about up, and my husband agreed that it was all right since this was temporary, just a matter of weeks, to go over to Springfield, and we could visit each other over weekends. He came to Springfield once and I went back home a couple of times.
So I went and it was a very exciting and meaningful experience to work with Charles S. Johnson, a marvelous researcher, and excellent insight into motivation and behavior, and I just enjoyed it tremendously. I served as his assistant for the duration of the research project. And in writing thumbnail sketches of the people whom I interviewed, he felt that I had some capacity for writing and so he started me on a career of trying to write. I wrote a series of little sketches which were printed in Opportunity magazine, called "Some Unimportant People," as a result of his reaction to the sketches that I did of the people with whom I had interviews.
And when I came back to Saint Louis, I had letters from practically every private social agency in town. The idea of a black girl trained in social work, when trained social workers of any race were very rare indeed, interested them and they wanted me to come in and talk about job possibilities. And so I did a few, three agencies I believe, selectively, beginning with the biggest private agency in town, which offered the kind of service that I'd be interested in working in. They offered me a job and my year was about up and I accepted it.
And you know, my husband and I have never discussed a career for me since that time. Because I was so obviously better satisfied and more adjusted doing what I wanted to do, instead of feeling guilty about bridge parties, or they were "500" parties in those days, and teas and club meetings and people who were very limited in their concerns about social problems and what was going on in the community. I just thought that was a waste of my time.
So I eagerly accepted a job as a caseworker with what was then called the Provident Association. The other major agencies that I would have considered working for, had I explored their invitations to come in, were the Children's Aid Society and the Red Cross. However, the Provident Association was a very satisfactory experience, a very fine experience which I've never regretted taking. It was later merged with the Children's Aid Society and became the Family and Child Welfare Agency of Saint Louis. And that's where I really think I got my start in professional social work.
Of course, I was not a social worker with a degree because the academic program even then was a two-year program, although it led only to a certificate at Columbia- which was, at that time before it became Columbia University School of Social Work, the New York School of Social Work under﻿6
IBL: (cont) independent auspices. It later was merged into Columbia.
The Association of Schools of Social Work, when it was formed, set up a requirement that any school at the graduate level with a two-year program had to be a part of an accredited university. But it was the same school moved into a more structured academic setting.
Because I was satisfied and happy in my work, I rose quite rapidly and in less than a year became a senior worker and remained at that level for some time, I guess two or three years. The old Family Welfare Association of America, which was a federation of major family welfare agencies in the country, in those days had an annual institute in New York which was one month long to which each of the twenty-five largest family welfare agencies in the country was invited to send one or two workers. And in 1929, I was the one selected to go from Saint Louis.
I was petrified when I was there because the majority of people attending were much more experienced. They were at higher levels of practice than I; they were supervisors and administrators. Some of the biggest names in the country, w hich probably would mean nothing to you, but they were Betsy Libby of Philadelphia and Francis B. MacClaine and people of that caliber who were the instructors. This was also a very wonderful and productive experience, to work with people like that for a whole month. I think I grew in maturity and skills while I was there because assignments were made of you, and we were required to produce them. One I chose was to analyze a current novel or fictional work and identify the social components and assess some of the meaning.
I chose Mamba's Daughter which was the popular novel of the day, about this old black woman on the river front who was a hard-working, sincere and earnest person, but had a derelict daughter or so. I don't remember how many children she had. But the daughter was very loose in her morals and didn't want to work, exhibited none of the approved social behavior, as her mother did.
Five members of this seminar group chose that same book. In cases where the same book had been chosen, the group choosing that book was asked to get together, pool their reports, and make one report to the group. I had an interesting experience in race prejudice at that point because I was the only Negro in the group, and the geographic representation was from throughout the country. There was one young person besides myself in the group, who was at the same placement level that I was, namely a senior worker in a family agency. She and I drifted together out of our anxiety and concern over being so young and inexperienced in the midst of all these very erudite, experienced supervisory staff. On the other hand, one of the women who also had a very high reputation, was a supervisor from the Boston family agency. She, too, had chosen Mamba's Daughter as her book. She could never find it convenient to meet with the group to pool our thinking. Of course, we usually met at lunch or in the evening at somebody's apartment, a semisocial situation. She never found it convenient to meet with us. All the others did. This little girl from New Orleans, who was my peer age-wise, had not chosen that book so she didn't get in on this group.﻿7
IBL: (cont) When the time came to make the report, the group, I suppose naturally, chose me, the only black, to make the report. And as I tried to interpret the cultural aspects of this book and the motivation, or say, lack of it, for Mamba's daughter in the behavior she was exhibiting, I did it sympathetically because I thought it deserved that kind of treatment. And this was a pooled report; the others had agreed that my interpretation was more or less in common with theirs, except this lady from Boston. When we made the report, to which she had not contributed, she objected to all of this and pulled out a good many of the stereotypes about blacks which, of course, I had to refute.
But as I say, I'd always had the impression, or the feeling that white southerners were very hostile and prejudiced and I wanted no part of them. And yet, the most enjoyable relationship out of this seminar, for me, was with a little southern girl, white girl, from New Orleans, and the most disappointing experience was this episode of not being accepted at all, really of being rejected, by this very fine, well-trained supervisory woman from Boston, from Neivf England, the cradle of liberty and the seat of the abolitionists and all of that. So that kind of opened my eyes to looking at people as people and giving them a chance to reveal themselves as to their feelings. It also helped me to understand that you've got to dig a little bit deeper than the textbooks on psychology and psychiatry to understand behavior. Am I talking too long about this particular...
MG: No, no. I want to hear everything you have to say.
IBL: Continuing in my career, I rose pretty rapidly through the ranks in Saint
Louis and became the senior worker next to the supervisor or the superintendent, so that I took over when the superintendent was absent or on vacation. Since my major in college, because I was supposed to teach, had been mathematics, I did the statistical reports and they never had to be returned. One of the workers in the main office, charged with statistics, made the mistake of saying to my supervisor, our district supervisor, "Why don't you let Miss Lindsay do the reports all the time? Hers are always so well done."
Well, this supervisor of the district office was a rather insecure person. She was well trained, although she did not have a professional degree in social work, and sort of resented the fact that her courses had been the ad hoc type of seminars and group discussions offered on a noncredit basis by the Saint Louis Community Council, whatever it was called. It was the welfare council for the city. At that time the universities in Saint Louis, as were the public schools, were segregated, and there was no resource for furthering one's training there. She had done the best she could by taking these extension courses or ad hoc courses or seminars on a noncredit basis and had done an acceptable job, except that we in the staff felt that she was overly acquiescent and responsive to the main office's demands, that she didn't have very much regard for our ability, nor our rights.
And I was always an outspoken, rather aggressive little woman, I think, taught to speak politely but to express how I felt and to justify it, and I felt no fear of doing so. She felt this was not being, well, the﻿8
IBL: (cont) only word I can think of, is acquiescent enough. I'd like
to say subservient but that is going too far, I guess. So comes time for my evaluation and assessment. Well, that went off all right. I don't know when that was in this period that I was in that agency, except that there was great delay in her evaluating my records. You were supposed to keep very detailed case records, which I did. I liked to write and, I think, could interpret feelings and behavior pretty well in doing so.
And I had selected the records on which I wanted to be evaluated, put a stack of, say, six records on her desk and they lay there for months while my promotion was hanging, waiting for her evaluation. So I picked up the records, three or four of them, and sent them over to the main office to the case consultant on my own, with a note that Mrs. E., my supervisor, had not been able to get around to these, and I was sending them on because I knew it was time for my promotional evaluation. Well, my supervisor didn't appreciate that at all. She was highly annoyed. Nevertheless, we let that go by.
I should say that I was also something of a crusader. I saw poor housing; I saw broken hydrants; I saw rickety stairways without light; I saw damp, muddy courtyards with tenements built around them and little children out there playing in the mud. I should have said that we had parallel districts. We were a segregated agency but there was a black and a white district covering the same territory, a white worker covering the white clients and the black worker covering the Negro clients.
It so happened that the girl who shared the same district to which I was assigned was equally concerned about the kinds of social conditions that disturbed me. So we made reports of conditions that we saw. And I went so far as to call the housing authority, whatever it was, a government bureau that had responsibility for correcting violations of the housing code. I guess I didn't do it very tactfully because I was quite direct; I just did it. I suppose a better and a more professional way to report violations would have been to send them through my agency, and to get the executive of the agency to direct the attention of the executive of the regulatory agency to these to see if something couldn't be done. But as I say, I was aggressive; I was concerned about the problem and I wanted action and I wanted it fast. So I just reported it.
Another episode, which didn't redound to the comfort of my agency at all, and probably not to my credit, although I got promoted, was attendance at a state conference in one of the more southern communities in Missouri. It was either Columbia or Jefferson City, I don't remember which. Both were not noted for liberality. And so far as that's concerned, no part of Missouri was, so far as I know. But anyway, these were a little worse than most. It goes without saying that the Negro delegates to the state conference were housed in private homes, whereas the whites could stay at the one and only hotel. Well, that irritated me. Anyway, I knew that was the condition that we would have to accept if we got to attend the conference and I hadn't objected.
But about the second day of the conference, a white judge was invited as the luncheon speaker, and he started his speech with a "darky" story. So﻿9
IBL: (cont) I got up and walked out and several of my colleagues followed my example. They weren't courageous enough to do it on their own, but I was angry and I didn't care. So I went out. After the luncheon, I went to the executive of our overall agency—this was a districted agency so I'm not referring to my supervisor, but to the executive of the total agency—and said, If this is what we were to be subjected to, I wanted my return fare home. I would not stay. Well, he apologized for the speaker but he was visibly disturbed and didn't know how to handle it.
When we got back from the conference, he called ray district supervisor to ask about my behavior. Was I always this arrogant and hostile? I don't know what she said, but this didn't increase our friendship for each other.
So when comes 1929 and '30, when if we'd had good sense and viewed what was happening in the agency in perspective, we could have predicted the depression, but we were overconcerned with increased expenditures for people in need. The concern of the agency was, What were we doing wrong that the clients weren't improving and getting jobs and moving on to independence? What were we doing wrong to precipitate such behavior? And so it was determined by the central office staff that they would review one case load from every district to see if they could arrive at some of the reasons why our expenditures were going so far out of bounds.
The day before our district was scheduled to go up for this review of one case load, the girl who had been chosen to report for our district, by review of her case load, was grilled to the "nth degree" by our supervisor so that, at least according to our interpretation, she could say, when we got to central office, "Oh yes, that should have been done; I told Miss Williamson that should have been done." But she hadn't, because she gave very poor supervision; she was very lax in her supervision. We didn't get any supervision except as we gave each other support, and we did meet and talk over cases and get ideas from each other. The girl came out of her day long conference with the district supervisor, and said, "If I have to go through this again, whatever day that the review at central office is to be held, I'm going to stay home tomorrow and rest up." Our review was scheduled for two days later. Well, we all encouraged her to do that. Comes the next day and the girl did stay home, called in sick. But comes the next day, the central office called our district and says, "Mr. Steger," that was the executive of the overall agency, "has to go out of town and we'd rather shift your district's appointment to today." This meant that nobody except the girl who was home sick had been briefed and grilled and prepared and all of the defenses established.
So our supervisor came into my office, which was a corner office overlooking the street, and many of us gathered there to eat lunch. We brought our lunches, and about three or four of us were sitting in there eating our lunch. Mrs. E., my supervisor, the district supervisor, said, "Central office wants us to come today instead of tomorrow, so Mrs. Lindsay, we'll take your case load." And I was just so furious I saw red. Because it meant to me that she recognized the quality of work that I did, and she thought she could risk taking mine without this previous preparation. And﻿10
IBL: (cont) yet there had been this lag, this neglect of giving me a
good evaluation so I'd get my raise. I was so furious, I was fit to be tied and couldn't finish my lunch. All of the girls in there with me were shocked and angry too.
So together with the office manager, we began pulling cases out of files to take over, just trembling with anger, but not saying a word because I didn't dare. If I had, I would have been very rude. She and I together walked over to the central office. We were within four blocks of the central office and we walked over carrying my case load in hand. As I went over these cases, as I pulled them, I realized, Here's an insurance evaluation that hasn't been done; here's an intercity inquiry that I should have done a long time ago; here is a budget not up to date. Things that I knew were wrong and that I was getting to as much as I could. It wasn't neglect. It was just lack of time. And I kept thinking to myself, "Oh Lord, am I going to get a blasting when I get over there."
We get to the central office and walked in to the big second-floor office of the executive. The consultant for home economics was just coming out as we stood outside waiting. She was a pale, blue-eyed blonde from Minnesota, as sweet as she could be, and very helpful in making economic plans and budgets, and I liked her very much and we became very good friends. But as she came out of the executive's office, she looked at me with those pale blue eyes and said, "Oh, Mrs. Lindsay, what have we done about Flora Somebody's insurance?"
We were one of the agencies involved in the Metropolitan Insurance Company's study to assess the habits of insurance buying by poor and ignorant people. They used to have reams of policies that had been dropped because they couldn't keep them up when they got out of work, or sick policies that had no values, you know, all those kind of stupid things. We found people with twenty, thirty, forty and fifty policies. Sometimes we were able to retrieve some of the money that had been invested in them.
So this was one of my cases that I'd been working on with Miss Slocum, that was her name. This was the last straw. I burst into tears. And I shocked her so she just scooted away. And at this moment the executive opened the door and invited us in. And I went to the window to look out while I was trembling; I was so angry and so upset. So I pulled myself together and sat down at the long, executive table, and I just visualized me and my clients being on one side of the table and all this battery of executive top-ranking personnel on the other.
The end result of this review of my case load was not a decrease or finding of any one of them wrongly awarded assistance, but rather, suggesting that I increase the relief to one family, where the man had a very irregular work record (we suspected that he was a gambler, but we didn't know), to see what adequate service and assistance could mean to that family. I've forgotten what the other one was in which they raised the welfare, which was, of course, according to a required standard budget the workers had to observe. We couldn't just raise it without its being approved on a formula.﻿11
IBL: (cont) So as we got up to go out from this meeting, which took all afternoon, Miss Thomas, the case supervisor for the overall agency, who was also a very warm, sympathetic person, came and put her arms around me and said, "Mrs. Lindsay, you seemed a little upset when you went in. Would you like to talk to me?" Well, by this time, I was in a state of complete reaction to that experience and I wasn't angry. Well, I was. I guess I was more angry than ever because it seemed to me such a waste of time. So I said, "Yes, I would like to talk to you. I want to say things to you that I wouldn't say if Mrs. E. were not here to listen because they concern her." I said, "I think this is extremely unfair and shortsighted. We don't have the kind of supervision which would help us see the future and the outlook for these people. And I don't have any supervision at all." I said, "I wouldn't say these things except that Mrs. E. is right here to listen." By this time, Mrs. E. was crying. Miss Thomas was so shocked, she didn't know how to handle this outburst, and she said, "Well, would you like to make an appointment to come and see me next week?" I said, "Yes, I will."
So I did. I went back the next week. Of course by this time, my relationship with Mrs. E. was shattered. She wasn't projecting anger on me, just grief that I was such a nasty little girl. And when I went to see the case supervisor at the main office, I, in a very calm and restrained fashion and I hope, objectively, laid out what I thought were the defects for any young worker beginning there to grow and learn.
And so she said, "Well, we're having a vacancy come up in Manchester district," that was an outlying district, all-white. See, the services were separate. I was in an all-Negro district. "And I'm going to suggest that you be offered the job to go out there and fill that vacancy. Would you go?" And I said, "Well, let me think about it." Because with my attitude of hostility and belligerence, I didn't know whether I'd last fifteen minutes. I wasn't overtly hostile, but I was very direct and I did not feel that I was inferior to anybody, and I didn't let anybody infer that I was. So I thought this over and talked it over with my husband and he said, "Well, why not? You don't have to make your friends out there. Your social life is entirely separate. All you have to do is perform your job." So after about two weeks, I told them I would take the transfer to Manchester district. And I'm sure Mrs. E. was greatly relieved.
Well, Manchester district was in an outlying, almost suburban, area of industrial plants. If you're familiar at all with Saint Louis, you know this is a highly industrialized area, just south of the city. Many factories. I was the only black worker there at the time I went out there. I went as a senior worker. I didn't lose my status.
The woman who had retired was a very gentle, kindly old lady, a black worker. I wasn't the first black worker they'd had, but I was very different to her. Because she was a missionary type, a member of one of the leading Baptist churches in Saint Louis, sister of the minister, carried peppermints for the children and her Bible in her purse all the time, allowed the clients to descend upon her at home and any time of day or night. Any﻿12
(cont) time they'd come to the office, they could see her without an appointment. She thought that was terrible,to punish them by making them stick by an appointment. Well, they had a very different character to cope with when I went. Maybe I was a little egotistic, being one of the very few who had any training. But I felt extremely secure in my self. And also, I knew I didn't have to work if I didn't want to, which was another security-inducing state.
At the same time I came in, a young white woman who'd been working in Louisville, Kentucky, came in to this district, just south, South Saint Louis district, we'll call it. I don't know what it was, it was Manchester district, that was the name of it. And she resented the fact that I had senior status in that office, because that meant you were the assistant superintendent. She had about the same background I did of training and of experience. The only plus for me that I had was seniority in the agency, and she had come in from another agency, so I got the senior status which made her very unhappy. As I say, our backgrounds were very similar,same amount of training, the same amount of experience and I guess similar records of performance. I don't know what hers was. I know I wouldn't have given her a good record of performance, but I'm sure that she must have had with the Louisville agency. And she showed her resentment of me pretty openly.
For example, about the first or second day I was there... You know how workers will stand around in an office as they come in in the morning, sipping coffee or something and just chit-chat? She said something about children in her case load and something about little pickaninnies. Well, I stiffened and didn't smile at all but I said, "Now, keep cool, Inabel. Keep your shirt on. She's not accustomed to having people like you around." So I didn't respond that time.
A few days later, within a week, she made the same remark. Well, by this time, I knew it wasn't such naivete. So I said, right in the office, in the presence of all the others, "Miss H., this is the second time you have used that term in my presence and for your information, I want you to know that this is not an acceptable term with Negro people." And she was so taken aback, because I was very direct and very firm and not loud and belligerent. "Oh, I thought that was what you people called them?" I said, "Did you really? Well, I think you know we don't call our Italian clients 'wops.' We don't call our Jewish clients 'sheenies.'" And went on down the list of stereotypes, because this was a very heterogeneous area, with a number of ethnic groups. I think I included Polish because we did have a lot of Polish people in that section. I said, "We don't call our Polish children 'polacks.'" I said, "You know, I think, as a trained social worker, it would become you to refer to the children as children." And I flounced out. Well, she didn't last in the agency very long because she was so annoyed with competing with me.
On the other hand, there was another girl in that office, a young white woman, whose father was from one of the deep South states and her mother was from Illinois, and she told me, because she appealed to me for help... She wanted me to help her understand, and I loaned her many books. I gave﻿13
IBL: (cont) her sociological texts to read and some of the novels that
depicted social conditions and all, and she said, "You know, my mother thinks it's wonderful that I'm having this chance to work with you, but we aren't even telling my father because he'd make me quit my job." My helping her was legitimate, as I was considered as an assistant supervisor, so I did have some supervisory responsibilities. She said, "We fight the battle of the Civil War all over again in our house every day." But she was a delightful girl to work with.
MG:	Can I interrupt you just a minute? You mentioned novels and we talked
about Mamba's Daughter before. Were there others that you used for training purposes? That you can remember titles of?
IBL: Not until I began to teach.
Oh. Well, I'll come back to that because I'm interested myself to know what you used.
TBT,: x have used numbers of novels for teaching...
MG:	Well, I'll give you a chance to...
IBL: ... with a slightly different emphasis, because when I began teaching, I emphasized the behavioral influence on people of their environment, and I had to pick novels with that point of view. But I will try to think of some. If I think of any more of this period that... Oh, I know another one, Native Son.
MG:	We used that, oh yes.
IBL: You know, that came around a little bit later, but I got up and gave a hostile speech at the National Conference of Social Work when somebody was reviewing that, talking about what are "they"—meaning blacks—going to do about the problem. Informed them that it wasn't their [blacks'] problem, it was America's problem. That was the time when if you offered any defense of democracy, you were a Communist. And I've been labeled that too.
But anyway, back to Saint Louis and the Saint Louis Provident Association. The district superintendent at this agency was a recovered alcoholic and , unfortunately, I hadn't been there a year before he had another episode and fell apart. So I was immediately put in charge. And when I took over, it meant that I was not supposed to assign myself any more cases. I was to distribute intake as it came in. I was to carry what I had, but I was to distribute intake which would logically go to me on a regular basis to other workers in the office.
I assigned this Miss H. to one of my cases one day. Well, she came storming in to my office about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, saying, "I don't know what to do with this," and so, knowing what was coming, I just took the case, held myself tight and looked over what had come from intake, the central intake downtown, to find out what the situation was. After I'd done that and recovered my own equilibr ium a little bit, I said,﻿14
IBL: (cont) "Miss H., this looks like a very ordinary situation to me. It's a deserted woman with small children needing resources to hold the family together. Now what is unique about it?" Response from her—"Well, I don't know what to do about this." I said, "All right, just leave it here. I'll take it. I'll take it myself. I'll also report it to central office." Oh, she snatched the case away from me in a hurry and rushed out of the office, but she didn't stay at the agency very much longer.
So, those are kinds of situations which I remember. There are many more pleasant ones that I also remember. The appreciation that I got for my work, the friendships I formed, and I certainly got a lot of education out of it. I unfortunately became ill myself. I think this collapse of the superintendent must have come in the spring and... I was acting superintendent until the next fall or late summer, when I became ill.
MG:	What year was this, do you remember?
IBL: Oh, it was, let's see—
MG:	We're still in the thirties, aren't we?
IBL: Yes, it was in the early thirties because I stayed with this agency through the period when it became part of the federal relief program that was developed in the early thirties, you know, when Roosevelt became president. This must have been between '32 and '33 when the federal relief program began. We began to get federal subsidies from the government around '34, '35. The Social Security program came in '35.
MG: Yes, right.
IBL: But this was pre-Social Security. The more significant aspect of my acting superintendency was my unfortunate illness, which lasted about three months and involved surgery. Because all the workers, particularly the Negro workers, were laying bets as to whether the agency was going to make me a permanent executive. Some of them felt they would, and some thought they'd be afraid. They'd never had a black superintendent over a mixed district. See, there were two entirely black districts, manned by black superintendents and black workers, but this was the placement of a black worker in a district with a sparse Negro population, split wide open by a boulevard going down the middle of it, with the blacks livipg across toward downtown.
But I never found out whether I would have been made superintendent or not. If I hadn't been, it would have been purely on the basis of race, as I had already demonstrated competence. They would have been afraid and that might well be understood because the agency would have jeopardized its allocation from the Community Chest. I'm sure. I think there were some in the executive structure who would have wanted to, but they might not have had the courage. This case supervisor, this home economist supervisor, perhaps the legal advisor. I'm not sure about her. She had a very legalistic mind, but seemed fair. I'm not so sure that she would have gone along. Anyway, I never found out because I was ill for, oh, four﻿15
IBL: (cont) or five months, and when I went back I was sent to the central office.
We were into the depression by this time, and we'd set up a structure which I had helped to devise or propose. It consisted of dividing the influx of cases into people who were purely in need of money or support— they were very normal people who could handle their own affairs—and those who had family problems, conflict between husband and wife, trouble with their children, disillusionment and unhappiness because of unemployment. We soon found that there was an overlap. And it wasn't long before the straight unemployment division was sending more cases from its division over to the service division than we could handle without adequate staff, so I became the supervisor in that division.
I had to have surgery at that time. I'd been married seven years. That was '32, late '32. So I probably went back to work early '33.
The problem of unemployment and need for federal assistance to people became so acute, the Federal Emergency Relief Program was organized. And our agency, Missouri, Saint Louis [did not] have, nor [did] any place in Missouri have any tradition of structured public welfare programs. We did have a widows' pension plan operated locally, in Kansas City and Saint Louis, but it was so politically dominated that it really was not a service program. We weren't doing any casework with people. It was politically ridden and highly moralistic.
I remember spending almost a year with one family that was a common law marriage. The man was feeble-minded and the woman was low, low average, having a raft of children. They had subsisted in one room. Man and woman and about four or five children. One child, one of the older children, was so obviously feeble-minded that we tried to get him into an institution. The others were probably low, low average. The man in this marriage, this common law marriage, dropped dead on a summer job, like cutting grass. So my objective in that case became to prepare this woman and help her become a good enough mother to qualify for the widows' pension. She wasn't ever going to be able to hold a job. She was going to have to be supported at public expense and therefore should be a charge of the government. And I devoted very elementary efforts to getting her to that place and finally did. It took about a year. And this family, living in one room, in the most dreadful conditions... I went with her to help her find a little three-room apartment, a kitchen, two bedrooms. They could use the kitchen—it was a big one, in a big old-fashioned house—as a living room too. I shopped with her at the Salvation Army stores, the Goodwill stores, for furniture, doing all of these elementary things that social workers think are beneath them now. And of course it was stupid, because I could have probably gotten a good volunteer to do this, but I was just so determined to help this woman get to the level where I could refer her to the widows' pension program with some hope that she could get it. And I did all these things myself. This wasn't very good judgment, it wasn't very good...and it wasn't very good social work either.
Anyway, when I went to this little apartment that we had found together, the﻿16
IBL: (cont) woman's refrigerator had been delivered, and she had never
before had her own refrigerator. When next I went to see her and she opened the door for me to come in, she threw her arms around me and hugged and kissed me and I almost dropped dead. She still hadn't cleaned herself up very well. But I was glad that she enjoyed her refrigerator so much. The children were kept in school on a fairly regular basis. This feebleminded boy was kept in fair control, not running loose in the community, and we kept that up for about a year. It was a very satisfying thing to me, to achieve this very elementary, low-level objective. But that was all I could hope for.
I'm wandering a great deal. I don't know where we go from here.
Well, let's talk about how you got to Howard University. And then maybe just a little about your experiences, and then we could talk about what you've done since retirement.
IBL: Let's see, I was at the beginning of the depression and the impact it had 011 social services in Saint Louis. Well, we went into a different pattern of operation when emergency relief became available. As I said, we had no tradition of public welfare, under governmental auspices in the state of Missouri, except this widows' pension plan in Saint Louis. And I think Kansas City also had one. There is a controversy between Kansas City and Chicago, as to which city had the first juvenile court. But Kansas City had some semblance of a program in that area. It was probably local. Chicago is generally given credit for having established the first juvenile court.
Therefore, without any public welfare well established and structured, which in some ways was a benefit in structuring our later program under Social Security, the federal government and the emergency relief program agreed to supplement the budgets of the private agencies—Children's Aid Society, Salvation Army, Red Cross, Provident Association—all of those agencies which were being overwhelmed with the load of unemployed people. The Federal Emergency Relief Program established the level at which our operation had been in normal times and what we spent in excess of that, they supplied. We became unite A,B,C,D, in the Federal Emergency Relief Program. Our agency was expanded. We went from a small number of districts to maybe five or six additional ones.
I was put in charge of one of those, and set up a new office in another congested black area with my own staff and a very substantial organization. I had two assistant supervisors,and I guess a casework staff of about fifty, and clerical staff; we got the swankiest physical facility of any relief agency in town. They used to bring visitors over to see ours, because we got a converted dance hall. It was in the building that my husband managed, so again it was a happy situation. One of my assistant superintendents was married to a lawyer whose office was in that building. And it had good eating facilities in a little restaurant on the first floor on our left.
This was a period when social workers and welfare workers were harrassed,﻿17
IBL: (cont) and threatened with physical assault by the unemployed, councils of the unemployed, which were considered "Communist fronts." They marched on welfare offices; they beat up welfare workers; they did everything except tear up or burn the buildings down. We had sixteen districts in Saint Louis. I think we'd gone from ten to sixteen in the broadened structure. Two of these district superintendents, and I was one of them, were in very, very tinderbox neighborhoods with the poor living in slum areas, poorly educated, not capable of jobs. We would authorize work relief, like CCC*, WTA**,' and the like, and they would regularly descend upon my offices threatening the staff and oh, it was just bedlam.
MG: What was the source of the hostility?
IBL: What?
MG: What was the source of their hostility?
IBL: "Well, they thought we weren't giving them enough money and, you know, we were not, because of the restrictive and rigid eligibility requirements. We had such little money, as the load mounted, that sometimes we had to eliminate whole categories. Able-bodied young married people with no children, for example, was the first group we cut off. Then the next group was able-bodied couples with grown or healthy adolescents. Oh, we'd long cut off able-bodied single people. Couldn't give them anything. An adult family in good health with children in their early twenties, or late teens, we ultimately had to eliminate. It was a very painful thing to undergo. Very.
We chose the philosophy in our agency of giving adequately for those who were going to get anything. Now, some agencies chose the policy of cutting the grant and making it stretch farther. We didn't like that philosophy. So we chose to give as adequately as the low (emergency) Department of Agriculture budget authorized for certain categories, rather than to cut that and give everybody, say, 50<: instead of 75<?. We should have had $1.50. That was the pattern of our thinking. I think it was because we had not had this public welfare structure, which is a punitive, niggardly, oppressive kind of program everywhere that it had been in operation for a long time, because it was politically dominated and the welfare grant was a reward for political going along or adhering to irregular political practices sometimes. But fortunately, since we had not had this, we had a better trained staff, more socially aware and more clear in a social philosophy to try to help restore independence to people.
I was one of sixteen district superintendents who were harrassed by these councils of the unemployed. But I'm very proud of the fact that I was one of two that they treated with respect, and invited me to their meetings simply because I tried to treat them with respect. They would descend on our offices. Our office was the top floor of this five- or six-story building, with one elevator. So I don't know what we would have done if they had come up there and torn up our office. When the building management would see them descending upon our office, they would put guards on the stairways or lock the gates to the upper floors. It had been a dance hall,
** ci-vilian Conservation Corps Works Progress Administration﻿18
(cont) as I said, so there was a folding metal door at the foot of that top flight. I remember telling my workers, all of them, to try to protect them... We had one side of this dance hall, one end of the length of it, partitioned into little cubicles for interviewing. The checkroom had become a big waiting room, and never a morning that I reported for work that I didn't go out there, opening up the office, to protect my little receptionist who was there to catch them first as they got off the elevator. And if the crowd seemed unruly or if it was overcrowded, I'd stay out there. It was funny. I was so fearless; I mean, I wasn't seeking danger nor encounter, but I just knew nobody would bother me.
And I got myself locked up in one of those interviewing rooms one day with a hostile girl who for some reason or another was blaming us for not getting enough relief and she blocked the doorway to the interviewing room. I'd always told the worker, don't let the client get between you and the door, you put the client in first and you sit in the seat nearest the door. But I hadn't done that myself. I'd just gone on in and sat down And this girl Mocked the door for me. She wasn't going to let me out. And nobody on my staff thought I was in any danger, because I didn't think so. So I was in that situation. I never lost my calm. And I tried to continue to talk to the girl and show her why I couldn't do what she was demanding. I don't know what it was she wanted, now. But anyhow, after about fifteen or twenty minutes, somebody... There was constant motion up and down the corridor, nobody had ever looked in my direction. I had a pencil in my hand, I usually work with a pencil in my hand, and my office manager passed by and I just reached over and tapped on the window. Well, she was a short stockily built woman, and she just yanked this girl out of there just like that. And then we had to call the police. And when they came, I explained to them in just a very low, normal voice that we couldn't agree to this lady's request and that she wouldn't leave. So they oh, you should have seen them yank that young girl out of there. Oh, I just, I could have cried.
But you have to maintain order and you had to maintain a kind of discipline You could put understanding into it and an attempt to reason, but you had to do it. As I say, I earned part of my reputation as a Communist because of the way I worked with those people. They would descend on your office any time and break up your routine. Our rest room facilities were back of the stage that had been on this dance floor, and you couldn't even go to the toilet. I remember one day I was back in the rest room and one of the workers came around just singing, just as though she were singing a song, "Mrs. Lindsay, the Communists are here! Mrs. Lindsay, the Communists are here!"
I usually let them talk because that was the best thing to do, to let them ventilate. But I, they were coming so often and staying so long, I couldn't continue that loose pattern. So I said to them one day...as they were telling me how many children didn't have milk. And I said, "I'm not surprised. I could supply twice that many that I know of, right in our case loads." "Well, give us their names." I said, "For what? Are you going to give them the milk?" "No, we ain't got no money. You've got to give us some money." I said, "Well, if we had it, you wouldn't have﻿19
IBL: (cont) to make us give it. We're spending what is allocated to us." And I said, "Now, listen. I listen to you and I sympathize with your needs and wish very much that the system would let us do more, but we can't. Now, I will be available to you one afternoon a week. You set the afternoon and the hour, but I don't want you coming in here disrupting my office all times of day. We won't be able to do even what we're allowed to do if you keep us away from our work." And so they set up an afternoon and they regularly came.
I went to one of their big central meetings. They had meetings just like a lodge or club. And it was at night, down in a slum area in the weirdest kind of a barn. And I asked my assistant superintendent, the wife of the lawyer, to go with me because I thought he could get us out of trouble, if we had any trouble, and she went, but she was terrified. She had a rose in her hand and by the time we got out of there, that rose was squeezed into a pulp in her hand. And of course what they wanted us there for was to let off steam, to vent their hostility and their anger, which they did. Against me, against my agency, against our district; oh, they just had a ball. We just sat there calmly and listened and didn't say a word and they got rid of their anger, as much as they could.
MG: Good psychology.
IBL: Yes. But you see, you had to treat them like people. Another episode during that period that sticks very firmly in my mind, I guess because the man thought I was beautiful, which I never have been accused of being. This morning when I went out to the waiting room to check, as I usually did, I saw this very disturbed man, not sitting down, just restlessly moving, pacing the hall. Pacing up and down. So I went up to him and I said, "You seem a little disturbed, what's the matter? Can I help you?" And he said, "Oh, yes, ma'aip*" He was on WPA, and we had to authorize tickets for him to get gas for an old rickety truck that was his only asset. If he could get the gas, he had two days' work. We could authorize pay, hours on OTA to the extent of the budgeted needs at this low level budget. He said, "I'm parked in a 'No Parking' place and if I get a ticket, that will be the end of me." And of course, I could sympathize with that. So I said, "Well, let me get your case worker." I got this worker and asked her to give him carfare, the gas money, or the tickets for it, and get him out of there so he could go get on his job. I think he only had two days authorized, two or three days authorized. And she did and while she was taking the information necessary to issue the tickets, he just raved about me, "Oh, she's just an angel." And I hadn't done a thing except get his worker to get him the coupons for his gas.
But it just shows the suffering people were undergoing, that they put such an inordinately high premium on a simple gesture like that. It was really very pathetic. And it just made me feel like I wanted to cry because such a simple act as issuing some coupons for his gas, and to keep him from getting his truck ticketed.
Well, now how did you... Go ahead, you were going to say.﻿20
IBL: Well, these were the early days at the emergency relief administration. Then as you may recall from the development of the federal relief program, Social Security came into being with the allowance for assistance to dependent people. That was the public assistance part of it. Then, also, this was accompanied by the federal regulation that public funds must be administered by public bodies. And so the public welfare system was set up. And we, the workers, in the old units of the private agencies, which were administering the emergency assistance, we were offered the choice of going into the public welfare structure being organized, or staying with our private agencies.
And I chose to go with the public welfare agency. They were very happy to have all of us with some training and good backgrounds to come in because it meant that we had a rather unique opportunity to establish social service in public welfare. Most of the old traditional systems were politically ridden and scandal ridden and administered by...ward politicians is all I can think of. People without concern for the social welfare, for changing the system, for guaranteeing help to people to establish independence and to try to look forward to some improvement in their lives.
So I think we in the Saint Louis public welfare agency, as it emerged during that time, had a pretty sound one, one of the best in the country. And it was here that—again, I was the district superintendent— that these episodes that I've been talking about, some of them happened, as I became superintendent of a district under the public welfare system. I don't remember exactly when the transition was consummated, but it was between '30 and '35. '32 and '35, I guess.
And then in '36, I decided I was going back to school to get my degree. I just had the one year at the New York School, and all this experience I'd had, which was wonderful education, but I wanted the degree. And in Saint Louis...in fact, no Missouri school was open to Negroes. Chicago, University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration was an excellent school, emphasizing public welfare. I'd been there one summer. A group of us went up from Saint Louis to Chicago for a summer term, four or five of us. Chicago was very pleased with all of us and wrote to the agency and said, "If you've got any more workers like that, refer them to us. We'd like to have them in our student body." And they gave me a fellowship. So I went back to get my degree that year, finished, got my degree in '37. Then I came back to Howard because the program in Saint Louis was deteriorating. Political influence was creeping in, and regulations were increasingly repressive and not showing what I wanted shown as concern for the welfare people.
And my husband's business was going on the rocks on account of the depression too. So I said, "You get some kind of a job." He did. He came out East and worked with Carter Woodson and the History Association as a salesman, trying to get the history books in the black institutions in the South. And I was in school in Chicago where I have relatives, living at my brother's home, tuition and all being paid for by the university on the﻿21
IBL: (cont) scholarship. My sisters were sending me spending money to
supplement my little, meager income. Oh, I should say my mother died in the summer of '36. Because I had planned to do this anyway, but I didn't go for the summer term because she died in June and I just was too torn up. She dropped dead on the street on her way to church on Sunday morning. But in spite of my personal problems, it was a very productive year.
I had known Frazier at the New York School of Social Work. This is E. Franklin, who had come to the New York School of Social Work thinking he wanted social work. He already had a master's degree in sociology and was an older person. The New York School of Social Work, at that time, was suspected of having a quota system for Negro es. There were just three of us. Frances Williams from Saint Louis, Dr. Frazier, and I. And there was a fourth one who came in with me. Frances and Frazier were in the second year class. This girl, I can't remember her name, and I came in as first year students, but she dropped out early during the year so that left just three of us. Frazier had known me at the New York School and had been very kfrrd and friendly toward me.
So when Howard established a program of studies in social work at the graduate level, he looked for a social worker to come and help. This was started in '35, while I was still in Saint Louis. The University of Chicago was his alma mater, you know, for his doctorate. He received his master's at Clark, in Massachusetts. But his Ph.D. was Chicago. And Miss Edith Abbott, dean of the School of Social Service Administration, had sent out another graduate of Chicago to help build the program here. But when he knew I was finishing, he asked would I be interested, and since I had thought that Howard should have a school of social work... As a matter of fact, when Mordecai Johnson had visited Saint Louis, I had asked him point blank when Howard was going to pay some attention to introducing a graduate program of social work. It hadn't been done until the welfare programs got organized under federal supervision, and in recruiting staff, the agency here in Washington had naturally turned to Howard University as a source, and gotten many of their workers as graduates of Howard, because there weren't any other jobs available. People were glad to get into any kind of a program. These workers recruited from the liberal arts college at Howard saw the white workers going on, getting degrees at Catholic University.
^G: This is part two of an interview with Dr. Inabel Lindsay. The date is
the 7th of June, 1977, interviewer Marcia Greenlee. Dr. Lindsay, when last we were talking you told us about the development of your career and we were just about to discuss your coming to Howard, in fact I think we did discuss it briefly. Could you continue now discussing your activities at Howard University until your retirement?
IBL: Well, that covers a long time. That covers thirty years. And I don't
recall whether we discussed the way I got there. But I'm sure you're aware that during the depression the federal government began to pick up and develop welfare services because of the prevailing economic distress among all people. Here in Washington, as in other communities, there was﻿22
IBL: (cont) a Federal Emergency Relief Program established, and the administrators of it staffed it with as many college trained people as they could find; they were primarily women. Few of them had social welfare training, though the programs were set up to be a social service program, the administration of relief, work programs, and other ways of trying to help people maintain or achieve a degree of independence.
Here there were two resources for the white workers to get advanced training in social service. One was the old National Catholic School of Social Service, which was for girls, up on 19th Street, I believe. And then there was the Catholic University program in social service training which was limited primarily to members of the religious. Neither accepted Negroes as students.
Therefore, a number of the young Negro women educated mostly at Howard University, and recruited for the new welfare programs in D.C., who saw that they needed further training, and wanted to become trained and effective workers, came to Dr. Johnson with the request that Howard add some courses in social work. That was about 1935. He sent the group to Dr. Frazier, who was the director of sociology, or the head of the sociology department. Dr. Frazier, few people knew, was also a trained social worker, having studied at the New York School of Social Work after his master's degree at Clark College in Massachusetts. Dr. Frazier was therefore interested in helping these workers get adequate preparation for the jobs they were undertaking, and with the reluctant agreement of other members of the social science division, he did begin a program of courses in social work. The program consisted of just a group of courses at the graduate level without too much coordination and certainly without too much social work content, as we see it professionally. He did, however, employ Miss Ruth Jackson, a recent graduate of the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, to come in and help develop the field placement, or the practicum as we call it now.
By 1937 the program had increased its enrollment and needed more time than Dr. Frazier could give to it, so he asked me, knowing that I was getting my degree at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration that year, if I would be interested in coming on to help. And that's how I got here. I had known Dr. Frazier at the New York School of Social Work, to which I had a fellowship immediately upon graduation from Howard.
The Saint Louis program in which I was employed and on leave was getting very much more political than I liked to see, and it didn't seem to me that we were making the headway that we ought to be making. Also this was the middle of the depression and my husband's business was very rocky. Further, we always had wanted to be in a situation where we could enjoy cultural activities without discrimination, and if we so desired, go on for advanced training, none of which was available to Negroes in Saint Louis, although there was a school of social work there, as well as at the University of Missouri, which had given some loosely organized and constructed courses through the Council of Social Agencies. Many of﻿23
IBL: (cont) the Saint; Louis Negro workers had taken advantage of them, so they at least had an orientation to professional social work.
So I decided I would take the job at Howard and my husband decided that he would eventually come to Washington too. I came in the fall of '37. Dr. Frazier assigned me a title of his own origin, namely director of the Program of Social Service. And I immediately began attempting to put more social work content into the program and also to develop a stronger field work program.
Fortunately Miss Jackson did not object to my taking over, although Dr. Frazier had not prepared her properly for my doing so. It could have been a very difficult conflict situation, but we got along very well. I did take over the overall management and direction. We Immediately set out to have a sounder, better coordinated program of social work education, she continuing to direct some of the practice component and also teaching in child welfare, while I taught social legislation and history of social ^welfare and some of the practice courses. Our enrollment increased rapidly. We gave a certificate in social work on the completion of the two-year program.
But I was not content to have a certificate program. There were two types of programs approved by the then Association of Schools of Social Work, which is now the Council on Social Work Education and the major accrediting body for our field. With their help and consultation with the executive, we set out to develop an independent school of social work. Because our resources were limited, however, we had to proceed a little bit slowly. So from 1935 to '40, we gave a certificate in social work for the completion of the two years of training. I was working all the time toward the establishment of an autonomous school of social work.
In 1940 the Association of Schools of Social Work decided that we should have more recognition and more status as an autonomous unit within the university than we had as part of the department of sociology. And so I think about 1940 we became a division in the graduate school. Then we battled with them for three or four years to get to be a full fledged two-year autonomous school within the university. As long as we were a division within the graduate school, we still gave the certificate, and Dr. Frazier was nominal head until, oh, I guess the very early forties, when I became the director of the Division of Social Work in the graduate school under the dean of the graduate school.
I worked with Dr. Charles H. Wesley as a dean of the graduate school. Dr. Logan, Rayford Logan was the dean one year while the permanent dean was on leave. I've forgotten whether that was Thompson or Wesley. Then Dr. Thompson became the dean under whom I served the longest time as the director of the Division of Social Work within the graduate school. Dr. Thompson said I worried him to death, because I was always pushing recommendations under his nose and urging passage of recommendations that would strengthen the school of social work and provide it with more resources and expand its faculty, and all of the things that were necessary to have a sound school of social work. So he joined me in the recommendation to make it an autonomous school of social work in 1944.﻿24
IBL: (cont) And the Council, or the Association of Schools of Social Work
(I don't believe it had yet become the Council on Social Work Education), it, with some reservations, approved us, gave us provisional status as an autonomous school, and I became the dean of the School of Social Work at that point. I worked very, very hard to get increases in faculty, increases in physical and financial resources. We were still in a dilapidated old building on the edge of the campus, Johnson Hall which was an old frame house, former residence of one of the university officials, which we had been given a few years before. Dr. Mordecai Johnson promised that when funds were available to start building again, we would inherit the first building constructed for classroom purposes, as during the war there was no building program going on.
We gave our first master's degree in social work, I believe in '46, '45 or '46, because the trustees had approved the establishment of the school in '44. That meant that the students who had finished their one year that year could stay on for another year and get the degree. I believe that was '45. Anyway, there were seven students who stayed after completion of their first year and came out with master's degrees in '45. Well, the school grew very rapidly because, as I said, there was no other educational resource for blacks in the city of Washington for advanced training, which, I suppose, was one of the reasons we did move ahead fairly rapidly. However, I like to think that it was a strong and sound social philosophy that helped us along too.
I tried to help the university find a qualified man for the deanship because chauvinistically they wanted a man dean, and I was not particularly interested in administration. I liked working directly with the students. However, they couldn't find a man at the salary available, in spite of my canvassing the field very carefully. So I took it as acting dean, still hoping to find a well-prepared man whom they would accept. As I say, the salary was low. There wasn't anybody who was interested in sacrificing to that extent. The men I wanted them to consider were men in very prominent positions, in national organizations such as the Urban League and the like. And nobody was coming here at the tremendous financial sacrifice which would have been necessary. However, when we came up for accreditation, the Association of Schools of Social Work told the university officials they would not accredit a school with an acting dean, so the university administration very promptly changed my title to dean. I became the dean by happenstance, I guess.
That, of course, put a great responsibility on me to see that we had a school that was fully accredited and the equal of any other school in the association. I had good administrative experience and background from my days in Saint Louis as the director of one of the districts of the existing public welfare program, but I just didn't care too much for administration. I liked the more intimate contact with the students which was largely precluded when you had to take on administrative duties.
I studied the catalogues of all of the accredited schools, seeing where we needed to fill in gaps, bridge gaps, strengthen certain programs and I made two resolutions in my own mind. One, we were going to have a good﻿25
IBL: (cont) school of social work, not just a good black school of social work. It was going to be equal to any other school. And secondly, it would be available to anybody who could qualify for admission. Therefore, from the very first we accepted students of all ethnic backgrounds. It wasn't very long, maybe a couple of years, before our first white students began to come. There was a period there, in the middle and late forties, when everybody on the campus would identify any white student walking across the campus as a student in the School of Social Work. I don't know whether their behavior added to it, because they were a little freer and more relaxed, probably, than some other students.
I remember one of the white girls telling me one day, laughing about it, how she had shocked some professoi; whom she had encountered on the campus, because she was smoking. I didn't want to restrict her, but I did ask her to conform to the decorum of the university when she was on campus, because I didn't want the school to get the name of being too far out of line with university decorum.
Also I saw a needT which I think was not reflected in any of the major schools of social work except perhaps for the New York School, for introduction of cultural a®d racial content in the curriculum. It is my belief that one's cultural orientation influences behavior very greatly. So I introduced very early a course called racial and cultural factors in social work practice. It went through many metamorphoses, becoming social and cultural factors very soon, so that we could consider other ethnic backgrounds than black. I had some experience in New York which indicated a need for recognition of the Latin culture, especially the Puerto Ricans there. Then a little bit later on we moved on to incorporate this kind of content, rather than in a separate course, into a sequence called growth and behavior, where we could give proper attention to the component of ethnicity in behavior, and also in response to the various problem situations with which people had to cope. As I say, we were one of the first schools in the country to add that kind of component in a professional sequence.
The New York School, which I had attended, had a very good course which incorporated some of the content of ethnic backgrounds, because New York was so influenced by the amount of immigration coming in there. That, I suppose, was similar to our motivation, where we saw our role as working to help all people, particularly a Tacially disadvantaged group, like the number of blacks that we had to deal with, adjust to and have an impact on their communities.
It wasn't that we wanted people to adjust to adverse circumstances. But we wanted all administrators and operators of programs to recognize the disadvantages inherent in growing up in a deprived or economically depressed area, and do the things necessary to strengthen people so they could cope with that, while we were at the same time trying to change the system. We never were setting out to help people adjust to a static situation which was unequal, but rather to :help the social system recognize the inequities and change.﻿26
IBL: (cont) And then we also saw our mission as being trainers or
educators of workers in a primarily urban environment, so we never put the emphasis that some schools did on coping with the rural environment. When they left the rural area and came here, then they had multiplied their problems. So we focused on preparing urban workers, and so far as I know, the school continues that kind of emphasis, though I'm sure that adaptations can be made to operate in any environment.
Then, I didn't have a great deal to do with the expansion into working with foreign students. But as programs became stabilized, as the United Nations came along, and they had UNESCO, and gave some scholarships for foreign students coming here for training, we got a substantial number of them sent to Howard because they were from underdeveloped countries, and we were here in the nation's capital where they could have exposure to some of the federal programs. We had students from Egypt, from Nigeria and other African countries, India and the Dutch Netherlands.
I had a great deal of difficulty with one student from the Netherlands who wanted a degree in a year's time, and we just couldn't do it, because she wanted to go back and compete with students who had their degrees from American schools; her scholarship didn't last the full two years. She had some training before she came here, which we did not assess as equivalent to our basic year. But it was a very interesting experience. We also encountered some of the conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis because we had students from both groups, and we had students from India and Pakistan where there was some conflict too. So we got a liberal education in adapting our behavior to accommodate to the nuances and variations in the international situations from which they came.
MG: Were there any important changes or modifications in the school's program during the upheavals of the sixties?
IBL: I retired in '67, and while there were some upheavals on campus during that time, we were fortunate in the School of Social Work because we did not have that kind of upheaval. I think it was because we tried to listen to the students' complaints. I had an open-door policy, not that they could come in without plan or an appointment, but I always made it clear that we wanted them to know that they were adults and would be respected as such in any conflict situation they got into. They should take responsibility for discussing any problem with the faculty member involved, on their own. If it were not resolved at that level, then they had a faculty adviser with whom they could discuss their problems, and if that didn't bring about resolution, they could see me. Not that I could always resolve it, but at least I'd listen.
But there were procedures to be observed for them to get in for a conference with me. Number one, they had to let the faculty member, from whose contact the difficulty arose, know that they wanted to see the dean. They had to notify me in advance, so I could also talk with the faculty member involved, so that I would come into a conference with them knowing what each side's position was. And then we would take it from there and try﻿27
IBL: (cont) to resolve it. We absolutely tried to treat them as adults, with minds of their own and with prerogatives of differing with us.
Also, we had a student-faculty committee which was privileged to take up anything in the administration that they felt needed attention, and many of their ideas were good ones. We also had frequent forums to discuss social issues, and for that reason I think they ventilated their problems before they got to an outright conflict situation. Now after I left, there were some conflict situations which weren't too pleasant, and I don't think that the procedure which I carefully developed was observed to the same extent that we observed it. But primarily it was because we tried to respect individual rights, whether we agreed with them or not.
I can remember one instance which I think is very illustrative of the way we tried to handle students' grievances. We had a new faculty member come in who was assigned to the research program. The students in one section of his class, these were beginners, objected and said they weren't learning anything. So they demanded that a committee of their classmates meet with me to air their grievances, and after the observance of the procedures which I insisted upon, we did have a meeting of the committee from the class, with me and with the teacher. They had prepared a questionnaire and circulated it to their own class. It was full of complaints about procedures and assignments and this, that, and the other. On exploration, when I found that they were first semester, first year students, I suggested that if they knew all of the research methodology that they were being taught, they should have asked for advanced standing. Then I questioned some of their procedures, for example, circulating a questionnaire to one section of one class. I said, "Do you think this is a fair sample of opinion of the students?" Well, everybody had a right to answer the questionnaire who wanted to. They made it known to the others that they could participate, but nobody did. I said, "Have you ever thought of talking to the second year students about where they were at this time in their program?" Well, they had a right to fill out the questionnaire, too, if they wanted to. And I said, "Well, really, it seems to me that your methodology could stand great improvement, and I believe this is what we're trying to teach you. Now if you know all of the procedures, and you think that this class is being handled incorrectly, let's write it up, documenting every complaint you have, and then we'll give you advanced work if you're capable of handling it." But it seems that one student, who was the wife of a nearby metropolitan area psychiatrist, a white girl, was very impatient and very aggressive and wanted to lead the group on a strike. After I'd got through conferring with them, they decided they'd better go back and have a meeting with the instructor on their own, and they did. But when they called this girl to come, she said she couldn't come because she had small children and she couldn't get a baby sitter. So they said, "Well, you bring the children with you. We'll take care of them." One of the members of the group, who was a very bright girl, one of the best students we ever produced, said in this meeting as we concluded, "Well, I do think we've been a little hasty and we've probably been a bit presumptuous. Let's go back and begin﻿28
IBL: (cont) over again." Well, that was their taking responsibility for
themselves, and I never had any more problem with them. That was just what I was aiming for, in my questions to them; I was trying to probe and establish the fact that there was a lot of maturity in what they had done. They took this little girl in hand and they handled her very well. I never had any more problem of her conforming to the program and going along, not challenging faculty opinion the way she and they had been doing.
But we had our ups and downs, of course, like all schools do, with students because we had a significant interracial mix, many black students feeling that we, the faculty, particularly the black faculty, were giving preferential treatment to the whites.
I remember another episode, where at the end of my class I asked for a comment on what they had gotten out of the course, how they were able to use it. I also said, "If you have a question which you would like to discuss, if you will write it up on a separate 3x5 card and sign your name, I will be glad to set up an appointment." And this girl, who was a very bright girl and is now one of the outstanding supervisors over in the Baltimore program, wrote on this 3x5 card, "Why is it that all of the A's always go to the white students?" So I called her in and asked her whether she could prove this. Well, they go around boasting about getting A's. I said, "Well, I could refute that in terms of my own grading for my class. However, I'm not so interested in how A's are passed out. I want to know why you raised the question." Well, it just seemed like all of the students in her class who were white got A's. I said, "Well, let's look at some of the sessions we've had, and who has responded with good preparation and effective input. Do you remember when I was talking about incidence of juvenile delinquency and the distribution by ethnic backgrounds? I asked how many of you had had an undergraduate college exposure to a study by Helen Witmer and a coauthor, a very comprehensive study of the incidence of juvenile delinquency. Do you remember how many students said they'd reviewed this sociological survey in undergraduate school?" And she said, "Well, no, I know I didn't have it." I said, "No, you and a good many others hadn't been exposed to it, and unfortunately most of you were Negro students who hadn't been, although it's a very standard survey." I said I knew that she had come from one of the better colleges that are predominantly black. Now what could I do when the white students, who had been to Bryn Mawr or somewhere else, recognize the study and could apply it immediately. "Do you blame me for giving them credit for having had that background?" No, she didn't. But, I said, "If there are lacks that need to be made up and we identify them, we certainly take pains to try to make them up. But I don't think that you have any right to blame us for what we presume is adequate background for a professional program." Well, she accepted that. We had to be so conscious of this.
Of course, segregation and racial prejudice were so much in the backgrounds of all of us who were black that I guess maybe it was natural for her to react that way. Seems to me that we as a racial group tend to project all of our problems on the fact of our race. It's much more﻿29
IBL: (cont) comfortable to say they're doing something to me, something
wrong to me, because I'm black, rather than look at myself and say how much do I know and how hard have I worked to achieve the grade and the level that I want to achieve. It's much easier to have some scapegoat. Much easier.
Fortunately, most of the students with whom I've had to discuss things like that have been very receptive and have been able to look objectively at their own backgrounds, their own deficiencies, and see where they had to make up, fill in, rather than project. And it was a very challenging and exciting thing to do. I guess maybe we've all had to do that sometime or other if we want to really be honest and to work toward our own greatest fulfillment that's possible.
MG: What activities have you engaged in since your retirement from Howard?
IBL: ^I have continued a good many of the same ones, membership on boards and committees. For two and a half years after I retired, I worked as a special consultant in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, as a consultant for the assistant secretary in charge of community and family service. And I participated while there in trying to establish a valid definition of social services. I was one of the staff people working for a task force, a nationally appointed task force, headed by some topflight social workers throughout the country. I wrote some of the papers for that, saw to it that it was available to schools of social work and national welfare organizations for their comment and recommendation. Unfortunately, this came at the end of my two and a half years which was, I guess, eight or ten months after the change in administration, so the study didn't get very well advertised and didn't come to fruition the way we had hoped it would.
Dr. Charles Schottland, who was dean of the Graduate School of Social Welfare at Brandeis was the chairman. Several members of faculties from the New York School, from Bryn Mawr, from California and other outstanding schools composed the task force. It was a very exciting experience to work with them, share their ideas, listen to their philosophies. I think I enjoyed that more than anything while I was working in that capacity, though I had to answer inquiries about various social welfare programs and philosophies which made me go back and look up a lot that I either hadn't known or had forgotten. For example, we had one inquiry as to what states provided subsidized adoptions. This was very interesting to look up because it was a new development, just beginning to take place in a very few states. Then another was what preparation was needed for workers who served in various overseas programs, which was again a knowledge-expanding project for me.
But after the change in administration I felt that I really wasn't being productive, wasn't being called upon to be productive. We knew the newly appointed assistant secretary didn't know anything about social welfare professionally, saw it as a job of coordinating volunteers. That just was not a very satisfying kind of assignment, so I resigned. At that﻿30
IBL: (cont) time the Senate Committee on Aging was doing some special studies on aging of various ethnic and racial groups, and I was asked if I would come over and do the one on Negroes, which I did. I worked there about eight months, producing a pamphlet on "Multiple Hazards of Age and Race." It was focused on the needs and programs for older people and many of them were handicapped by race. That was published, and I got a lot of satisfaction out of that.
Then I've been a consultant on a couple of research projects and I've worked, in an effort to develop a program of curriculum in gerontology at Howard, as a consultant, which fell apart because of conflict of various divisions. Not very many of them, only one was anxious to undertake this program and didn't want the students elsewhere to have it. I did help them get a planning grant, which was not followed through. However, I've enjoyed a good deal of activity with some of the boards that I was on before I retired, and some I've gone on after I retired. The National Council on Aging, I'm still on that board, and have served as a vice-president and as a secretary, chairmam of various committees; the center and the caucus on the problems of the black aging, I was on that committee for a while. I served on the Edwin Gould Foundation for Children Board, the American Foundation for the Blind, Committee on Aging Blind. I've done enough to keep me busy. I also work very actively in my church on various committees. I'm an Episcopalian, and I've served on the social relations board of the diocese here. I've served on the National Committee on Institutions for Children and Youth, and on general welfare programs. I chaired the committee for the National Council when we were attempting to get the Council of Bishops of the Episcopal Church nationally to speak out in protest to the existence of poverty, and for the church to take a leadership role in proposing programs to eliminate it. It's only in the past, well, I would say the past year, when I've been less active because of my health, but I still enjoy participating and having an active involvement in social welfare undertakings. Inactivity is difficult for me to get accustomed to and I haven't gotten accustomed to it very well.
MG: Dr. Lindsay, I'd like to discuss with you now some of the early influences on your life and your career interests, beginning with your family background. You were born on the 13th of February, 1900, in Saint Joseph, Missouri.
IBL: That's right.
MG: Your father was Joseph Burns and your mother -was Margaret Hartshorn Burns.
IBL: Joseph Smith Burns.
MG: Oh, all right, let's put that in. Could you tell me something about your parents?
IBL: Well, I know most about my mother, because my parents were separated when I was about three. So I don't know too much about my father, except that he was born in Kentucky, son of a white father and a black mother, which wasn't unusual in those days, a tall, handsome, light-skinned man, brown﻿31
IBL: (cont) hair, striking in appearance, not much education.
My mother was the first of her family born in Missouri, and used to be spoken to by her grandmother with a good deal of disapprobation because of that. She would chide my mother, "In old Missouri nothing but hog and hominy," to express disgust at the family's migration. They were Virginians and my mother's grandparents, who reared her, had been slaves who purchased their own freedom. Hartshorn, that was their name. I can't remember my great-grandfather's name. That was Hartshorn and my great-grandmother, my mother's grandmother, lived with us because my mother's parents died when she was very young. She was reared by her grandparents who were farmers, having migrated to Missouri, I presume, as nearly as I can fit these dates in, during the Reconstruction period. It was always a source of pride that my great-grandfather had bought his freedom, and he then bought his wife's freedom, and they migrated west, as many of the Negroes in those days nearing the close of slavery did. They were farmers. My parents had settled in the country in northwest Missouri early in their lives. I think they were furnished land by my mother's grandfather. Then I guess around the late nineties or 1900 they came in from the country, when the first Negro high school was established in Saint Joseph.
My mother had three boys at that time, my three oldest brothers. And they came in for this first high school graduation in June, and my mother was so thrilled that she decided that her children were going to have the advantage of that education. She herself had education, possibly at the eighth grade level. I don't know. I know it was very skimpy and probably very inadequate. She would often relate the fact that her grandparents paid a dollar a month for her to go to this school, whatever it was in the country, and how she disliked wearing shoes, so that when she'd get out of sight of home, she'd take off her shoes and go barefoot. In her later life, after she was an older woman and keeping house for me, she went to night school and got her high school diploma.
She was a very ambitious woman with ambitions beyond the ordinary for her children. When she saw this high school graduating class, this first Negro high school, she went back and badgered my father, I presume, into moving into town, so by August, by the time the school was open for the fall, she had moved the family in town. Well, my father was a farmer, I presume with very little education, and not as much ambition and push as she had, so this was a very difficult thing for him. He did get a job in a shipping department of a large department store because he had an excellent mind. I've heard my mother tell about how when the boys would come home from school with mathematical problems, he'd take a box of buttons and figure out what they were trying to solve, and show them how to work a problem by manually utilizing whatever was available. But I think the fact that he was so handsome and attractive to the ladies might have had some effect on the marriage. I understand that when they joined the little Baptist church there, he became a great leader in the church. That was probably a great satisfaction to him since he didn't have education. The ladies made a big fuss over him, and I presume that didn't add to my parents' happiness as a married couple. The only thing I can remember about my father﻿32
IBL: (cont) as a child was standing behind his chair at night, playing with his light brown, straight hair, braiding it in little braids while he read his paper. I guess I was about three when they separated, and my mother, who was a very hardworking, ambitious woman,never stopped pushing her children to achieve.
Also we had a very strong family feeling, one for all and all for one. When my oldest brother, next to the oldest, who had come here to Howard to try to get into medical school, learned that they were separated, he turned around and came back home to become the head of the family. I have visual difficulty, so that from the time I was two or three, until I was six or seven, I couldn't see. He and the next brother just took over as head of the family, and they would take the most tender care of me. My sister-in-law, who is still living at age ninety-one, says that when they would come to choir practice or any church social, they would bring me, and they would always be carrying me in their arms. She said the girls who went with them must have loved them deeply to put up with their carrying around this little blind child, and they wouldn't let me walk, not teaching me any independence.
However, that brother, the oldest one, and my older sister were teachers and they set up a regular schedule, and when they came home from their schools in the afternoon, they had a regular schedule of teaching me. They would read to me, teach me spelling, the meaning of words. They'd read stories and we'd discuss them, so when I entered school I was well prepared for a grade beyond the first. They tried me out in various grades until I ended up in the fourth grade at age eight, which is when I started school. Unfortunately, that brother, whose name was Weyman, contracted tuberculosis, and died. My next brother whose name is Ocie had gone on his own to Tuskegee and gotten his training as an engineer.
MG: Excuse me, was Ocie the second eldest child?
IBL: No, the third. I'll tell you about my oldest brother Arthur after I finish telling you about the leadership role in the family of these two. Ocie had finished Tuskegee and had been one of a small group, ten or eleven, who were chosen to be sent to Africa, to Egypt, to explore the potential of irrigation plants in the valley of the Nile. Well, when my brother Weyman became too ill to continue, they sent him to Colorado, which was the popular treatment for tuberculosis in those days. Ocie came back from Africa, and then went out to Denver to see about Weyman and found him in very deplorable surroundings. People in Colorado were deathly afraid of tubercular patients. Naturally they would be, because this was the mecca. The high, dry climate was supposed to be good treatment for tuberculosis, but the native population naturally was afraid of contracting it. So there was always difficulty in getting decent housing and care for them, and Ocie brought Weyman back home. He was too far advanced in his illness, so he died shortly thereafter, and Ocie then took over as the head of the family. But we've had a marvelous family life because of this closeness and the sharing and the sense of responsibility each for the other. I, being the youngest, benefited the most, I presume, because all of them took care of me.﻿33
IBL: (cont) Now you asked me about my oldest brother, Arthur, who was perhaps as near a genius as anybody who's normal could be. The school principal said he had one of the two minds that to his way of thinking were in the genius category. But he got enticed away from his family at, I guess, seventeen or eighteen by being a good-looking young man and being brilliant. He fell for the seductiveness of an older woman, and when I was born he wasn't even in the family. I never knew him particularly well.
I knew these other two brothers very well, because they'd been father figures, particularly the younger of the two, the third boy, Ocie. He died in 1969. He was grown and he had a great deal to do with dictating our education, where I was to go to school, what I was to take. He really was a father substitute. My older sister, who was next and who was a teacher, she was my mother's right-hand support in taking care of me. They all pooled their resources as we did all the time.
MG: What was her name?
IBL: My sister? Ola. Her name was really Leola, but we all called her Ola.
She was a teacher, at home. I know her training was at Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri, and I think my brothers went there too. But see, there's eight years between me and the one next to me, so I really didn't know the details of training and upbringing of these older ones sufficiently to be really too knowledgeable about them. All I know is that they took care of me. These two older sisters, Ola, and Tena, the one next to me, were caretakers for me when my mother went out to work, and I was a horrible brat. I knew my mother didn't want them to touch me, so anything I didn't want to do I wouldn't do.
My mother used to tell a very funny story about me when I was very young. I guess it was even before I became blind. She was helping a neighbor who lived two or three blocks from us, and I had a little rocking chair, and I wouldn't let Tena and Ola bathe me and dress me up for the evening the way I was accustomed to being... Something had gotten into me. I just didn't want to be bothered. So I sat in my little chair and rocked until about time for her to come home, then I struck out to meet her so I'd get my story in first and prevent them saying how bad I had been.
My brother Dolph, Weyman, his name was Weyman Randolph but his nickname in the family was "Dolph." He was ill at the time. Ocie had just brought him home from Denver.
I struck out to meet my mother. The woman whom she was helping knew that my brother was home ill and had given her a bag of oranges. I don't know the number, let's say a half a dozen. So I got all the way to the woman's house, she only lived two or three blocks from us at the foot of a hill, and we were up on the hill. She said, "Your mother's gone to the bakery before she comes home, but you can take these oranges home for her. I was sending some oranges to your brother." My mother was so fiercely independent that she wouldn't let us ask for a drink of water if we were playing in somebody's yard. We had to come home and get our drink of water.﻿34
IBL: (cont) So I got frightened as I started back home, thinking my mother would think I had asked for these oranges, and that would have meant a spanking, sure as life. So I threw them away.
When my mother got back to pick up her oranges, the woman said, "Oh, your little girl was here, and I gave her the oranges to take home." And my mother went on. As I said, the woman lived at the bottom of the hill and we were at the top of the hill. So my mother saw these oranges, the same number, the same size and everything, which had rolled down the hill and stopped in front of the woman's house. She wondered what had happened. This was the same number of oranges, the same size. No damage seemed to be done to them. So she said, "I'll pick these oranges up. Maybe somebody frightened Inabel. If I get home and the oranges are there, I'll know something's wrong with these, and I'll throw them away."
And she got home and said, "Inabel, what did you do with the oranges Mrs. Enderbroc?" <jave you?" I always drawled and never talked baby talk, because I'd been brought up in an adult atmosphere and had no reason to talk baby talk. I said, "Well, you know, I saw a poor little boy and he looked like he needed them so I gave them to him." And my mother said she was so astounded that such a little child could make up such a lie, she didn't know what to do. So she said, "Now I know that isn't the truth. Tell me the truth."
In the meantime a neighbor had come over to visit, and as we had a big old family kitchen which was sort of the living room, you know, especially when it was time to get dinner, my mother spanked me and I still wouldn't tell her. I wouldn't say a word. I've always been stubborn as a mule. Anyway, it began getting dark, and she put me upstairs in a bedroom by myself, and I finally told her the truth. And she said, "Well, what was wrong with you telling me that downstairs?" I said, "You shouldn't hit me in front of anybody." But I was not going to say anything in front of Mrs. Butcher or whatever the woman's name was. So the family has always had a joke that I was born to be a social worker, poor as I was, giving away the oranges to someone who looked like he needed them. It was a great joke in the family.
MG: Now you were the youngest of seven children, is that right?
IBL: Yes, but one died in infancy.
MG: I see.
IBL: That was the one between Ocie and Ola; that was a girl. I don't think she lived more than a few months, according to what I've heard.
MG: Who were some of the other relatives who were important in your life, and in what ways did they influence you?
IBL: Well, of course, I think my mother was the most important factor in my life, but this brother that I speak of, Ocie, who became the last father figure, had tremendous importance to me because he dictated my college program;﻿35
IBL: (cont) he dictated my major in college. I sound pretty weak and I'm
not really. I have a mind of my own and I always have had, but of course I listened and accepted his guidance. I think my great-grandmother had a great influence on my life, too, my mother's grandmother. She lived with us, and after my parents were separated and my mother went to work, she became my baby sitter.
MG: This is Mrs. Hartshorn?
IBL: Yes. And I think that her tender loving care and her smothering affection gave me a great deal of security. I can remember that she'd hold me in her arms tightly, and I was quite big enough to walk and do things independently, but they all were overprotective because of my visual problems. And she would say to my mother, when my mother attempted to discipline me, "Must be a mighty mean, hard-hearted person to strike a little afflicted child like that." So I was spoiled rotten. The other thing that she gave me was deep religious values. She was deeply religious. She and I were - at home alone together a great deal while my mother was out to work, and our entertainment was singing hymns and having prayer meeting. We'd start off the morning with that.
MG: Just the two of you.
IBL: Yes. And I took up all of her ailments. I'd go out in the yard to play
a little while, and a neighbor would say, "Well, Inabel how are you today?" I would respond, "Oh, I'm pretty good, but I've got that rheumatiz." Just hearing her say it, you know, I didn't know what rheumatism was, didn't know what I had, but "I'm pretty good, but I got that rheumatiz."
She was a very wonderful old woman. She, I'm sure, was not educated. I don't know whether she could read or write. She died when I was, oh, seven or eight. But she would tell us the most fabulous stories in the evenings. This was our entertainment, sitting around listening to her tell about slavery, the days of slavery. She had been a house servant and had the privileges that were accorded some house servants, I'm sure, because she told one story about getting angry with her mistress for interfering when my great-grandmother was attempting to correct her own child. She got angry because the mistress was preempting her right to direct her own child. So she picked the mistress up and set her in the fireplace. I guess she leaped out and didn't get burned because I never heard of any stories about any tragic results. And the mistress said, "Now, Margaret, I'm going to tell your master on you when he comes in." And so she did, but all the master said was, "Now, Margaret, you mustn't do that anymore." So she must have had a lot of privilege, I don't know. I'm only surmising.
Then she told us many stories about the attractiveness of Washington, so her locale in Virginia must have been nearby Washington. She told stories about the Smithsonian Institution, for example, and she called it Smithsonian Institution. She was quite correct in what she labeled it. And she told us about seeing the White House. I don't know whether she talked about the Library of Congress or not. But I remember distinctly her talking about the Smithsonian Institution and the White House. So these were the kinds of stories we were entertained with at her feet in the evening after dinner.﻿36
IBL: (cont) And she couldn't help but have had a good deal of influence
on me and my older sisters. Ola wanted to come to Washington to study nursing and I came to Howard, not particularly because it was Washington, although that lent attractiveness to it. I came because... Well, there were two factors. One, our old family doctor had just died, and we had a new young doctor came to Saint Joe who was a graduate of Howard. He encouraged me to go to Howard, because I was considered rather bright. I was school valedictorian. My family thought I had a bright future, and then graduating from high school shortly after I was fifteen... The schools nearby were segregated to the extent that I couldn't live in a dormitory, if I went to the University of Kansas, where most of my colleagues went, or the University of Illinois or the University of Nebraska. Those were the schools, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas were near enough to be the schools which attracted young high school graduates from my area. Most of my classmates who didn't go to Lincoln Institute, which was a separate institution for blacks in this area, went to one of those schools.
But because I had poor health, sort of had physical defects to overcome— I had suspicious respiratory ailments when I was in my early teens and I had this visual problem all my life, other weaknesses—my mother wanted me to be where I could be in a dormitory and very well supervised. So Dr. Strong, this physician, came to town right after our family doctor had died, and we became his patients. He encouraged me to come to Howard, and my mother felt this was a good place for me, because I could be in a dormitory and supervised, protected. That's how I landed at Howard. Otherwise I probably would have gone to one of the nearby state universities like the others did.
MG: How would you characterize your early education-^this was before you were in college?
IBL: You mean whether it was adequate or not? No, it wasn't adequate, but I
had dedicated teachers who were all friends of the family, so that was one reason they took an interest in me. Then I was bright, so they thought, so that was another reason. I think the tendency of teachers in those days and perhaps to some extent still, I know it's my own tendency, to relate very warmly to a bright student. This gives you a lot of enthusiasm. See how much I can do to help this kid. I would never be able to be an effective teacher with retarded children, I don't believe. I've never had it to do, but I don't believe I could cope as well with those students. I respond very enthusiastically to a student who shows promise. So I think that because this was a stable community, and many of the teachers had either taught with my older sister and brother, or they had been very good, very close friends of one of my older sisters or brothers, they knew me.
For example, one of my teachers, when I first started school, had a little sister my age and we were playmates. She'd pick me out as the person to begin with, for example, after Thanksgiving recess, when we came back, to get us in the mood to work. "Well, I know you've had a nice Thanksgiving dinner with a big brown turkey on the table. Now Inabel, I know you all had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner, didn't you?" And I said (and this is another family joke), my speech slow and drawling and very precise, making﻿37
IBL: (cont) it more ludicrous, "Yes, ma'am, we had a turkey, but his name was ribs."
My mother was a marvelous cook, and the thing that was so remarkable about her was that although we were poor and struggling, we were always proud, and she'd never let us feel sorry for ourselves. Our table was always set and covered with another cloth, because we came in at different times from school. Any one of us was privileged to bring home friends if we wanted to. There was always cheese and crackers or potato chips. Ginger snaps my mother bought in large quantities in the fall. We had one of those cold cellars where she'd roll in barrels of potatoes and cabbage and things that she could buy in quantities and keep. We were always well fed and always welcome to bring in anybody to share a meal with us, but nevertheless we were poor.
So, at Thanksgiving time, she had gotten a beautiful rib roast, a pork roast, rolled and made dressing to stuff it with, baked it to perfection, and when she put it on the table, she says very gaily, "Well, we've got a turkey too, but his name is ribs." I don't know whether I'd ever had turkey or not, but I just went back to school and said with the greatest naivete, "Yes, ma'am, we had turkey, but his name was ribs." I mean it was a very happy way to be brought up; as I say, we were never allowed to feel sorry for ourselves, never allowed to ask anybody for anything.
MG: You received your A.B. degree from Howard in 1920. What field was that degree?
IBL: Education.
MG: In education. What stands out in your mind about those early years in Washington, D.C., and at Howard?
IBL: Well, I had never been away from home, and it was very exciting, a delightful experience to come to Howard. I think my teachers varied a great deal. Some were very competent. Others I think, one I remember in particular, he taught educational psychology, just read from a little black book. So that's where I got the expression. He passed on his notes from his little black book to my little black book. I don't think I got anything out of that course except what I read and learned myself. My major was math. I had been encouraged to take math as a major by this brother, Ocie; I wanted English and history as majors, because I always wrote very well and got excellent grades and was encouraged by my high school English teacher to go on. In fact, she wanted my family to send me to the University of Chicago at that time. But that was a little beyond us in terms of cost, as well as the fact that my mother would never have confidence in my being where I'd have to live out in the city, you know. But this teacher was excellent. I had excellent science teachers too.
Although I wasn't particularly interested or had any aptitude for domestic science, I was good in it and learned a lot of social graces, and how to set a table and how to do things like that. We had just gotten a new home economics teacher my senior year in high school who called us "Miss ,"﻿38
IBL: (cont) and this was so exciting, such a new experience for us little kids, you know. We had known the older teachers and they knew us, and had seen us grow up and there was no such thing as anybody calling you "Miss" at age fifteen in high school, even if you were finishing. That would have just been considered most ridiculous, but this woman was from an eastern school and she encouraged us to be adults.
We had to make our high school graduation dresses, and I was very inept. We were allowed to select our material and our pattern. I don't think she gave us very good guidance there because the material was a very soft mull, awful to work with and the pattern had horizontal tucks going around from the hem up. And if I took out one tuck, I must have taken out all of them before I was finished. There were four or five or six tucks all the way up. I must have taken out those tucks one hundred times, 'cause when I finally got the dress finished to wear to graduation, it was dirty as it could be, just filthy. But anyway, we felt very grown up, and I think the woman really gave us some things and broadened our vision of our role to a great extent. If you can imagine it, I got the first grade in domestic science, not because I deserved it, there were a lot of girls who did much better than I in the manual arts. But I think because I was bright and I was scheduled to be class valedictorian, anyway at least first or second honor pupil... There were three of us competing. It so happened that I got the top place. It was just one of those things. Well, this is the brightest girl in the class and she's done all right in home economics. Even though this girl over here is much better at sewing, I think I'll give her the prize. It wasn't deserved, I assure you. It was terrible, and I still feel badly about the girls who deserved it not getting it. There were two girls in there who were excellent seamstresses, just had a knack for it. I never had any knack for anything with my hands. I like to cook, but I don't like to sew.
MG: After you graduated from Howard, you spent a year studying at the New York School of Social Work as an Urban League fellow, and in 1937 you received an M.A. degree from the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration. What were some of your most important experiences while you were a student in New York and in Chicago, and were there any teachers whose instruction was especially beneficial to you?
IBL: Yes, I think I've been extremely fortunate in having some of the leaders in my field at both schools. The New York School... See, I went there right out of college on an Urban League fellowship. I was extremely naive, had never been on my own in a big city. In fact, my mother became ill because she didn't want me to go to New York. I had written my letter declining my fellowship when my oldest sister, Ola, and my sister-in-law, the one who's still living, prevented my sending it. I was working as a volunteer camp counselor that summer. My sister and my sister-in-law said, "No, hold your letter. Let us talk to mother. If this is what you want, we'll see what we can do." So the next week when I came back from camp, they had persuaded her to let me have a chance at it. So I changed my letter to one of acceptance. But Mother was worried to the point of being ill all that year and that's why I went back home after I﻿39
IBL: (cont) finished that year. You had to get this fellowship in those days, this was 1920, by passing a competitive examination.
I should have mentioned, when I was talking about my influences at Howard, this man, Dr. E.C. Williams. I don't know whether you've ever heard of him. He was one of the early librarians at Howard, a tremendous person. There were about ten or eleven of us who had finished all requirements by the end of the second quarter in March. Howard was then on the quarter system. So we were offered a separate graduation if we'd wanted it, but none of us wanted it, because we'd been four years with the class and we wanted to finish with them in June, so we stayed on. Our deans let us sort of roam around and do what we pleased. We were assigned to Dr. Williams to guide us in a seminar and it was a fascinating experience. He was such a cultured, well-educated man, unusually well educated for a man at that day and time, and he acted as a real mentor, a tutor. We'd pursue individual interests. We had conferences with him, and just talked about anything and everything, world problems, race problems, cultural identity and so on, and he could lead us in all of that.
So in one of my conferences with him, I happened to say, "The closer I get to graduation, the more fearful I am of teaching. I don't like to take on big groups, people in groups, I like to work with people individually." He said, "Well, did you ever consider social work?" I said, "No, what's that?" And that man back there in 1919 or 1920 gave me one of the clearest and best explanations of social work I've ever had given to me yet. Now he wasn't a social worker. I don't know what his field was. He was so able and so cultured that he could have participated in a number of fields, but he was the chief librarian at Howard. I imagine that his doctorate must have been in literature, because of his breadth of understanding and knowledge, I don't know. Anyway, he said, Did I ever hear of social work, and I said no, what's that? And he gave me an excellent explanation. He said that you had to have graduate training. I said, "Well, my family is poor and they struggled hard enough to give me a college education. I can't ask them to sacrifice any more to put me into graduate school." He said, "Well, the Urban League has a scholarship program. Would you care to have me find out about that?" I told some of the others in the seminar group, and three or four of us decided we'd like to find out about this. Ruth Howard Beckham, who's from the old Howard family here, was one of my classmates, and May Miller. So Dr. Williams sent and got the literature on the Urban League fellowship program, and we perused it, and Ruth and I wanted to take the examination. As I said, we had to qualify on a competitive examination then. Now you don't. Dr. Williams proctored the examination for us. I came out with top rating in the examination and was offered the scholarship, and was very excited.
But as I said, my mother just couldn't understand why a daughter of hers
would want anything like that. She conceived of social work as being in
the slums, working with the derelicts. Why would a child of hers, never
exposed to anything like that, want to take up that kind of work? So that
was the basis of her resistance, plus the fact that in the little town
that I came from, there wasn't any such thing as social work. There
wasn't anything for a Negro girl to do except teach or go in somebody's kitchen
