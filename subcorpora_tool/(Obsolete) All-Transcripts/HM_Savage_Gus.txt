Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I like a lot of different foods.
Speaker 1: What? Anything come to mind?
Speaker 2: I like more than--I like several different kinds of foods.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I have a rather eclectic preference.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. We'll say eclectic. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Nah, I kind of go along with whatever the trend is or the fashionable thing is at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Whenever it's warm. That depends upon where you are.
Speaker 1: Okay. You like summer best?
Speaker 2: I like warm weather.  It don't have to be summer. If it's in Brazil or it doesn't matter.  It could be winter.  It was fine. Depends on where you are.  I love warm weather.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay. Do you have a favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: No. I don't do too much vacationing, never have in my life.  I kind of mixed my pleasure and recreation with the other purposes.
Speaker 1: Did--A lot of people have said that recently. Okay. And a favorite--Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, you'd have to ask someone who's heard me. I wouldn't think--I wouldn't notice it, if I did.
Story_ID: 12964
Speaker 1: I want to ask you first about your mother. What you know about your mother and her side of the family. I know her name was Mollie; I don't what her maiden name was.
Speaker 2: Yes. My first name, Augustus, comes from her side of the family. Her brother was named Gus. Both of my parents, to save some time, came out of Macon, Georgia. Neither one finished eighth grade in school. My family came off of the Baulcom plantation during slavery times. The Sherman March freed my great-grandfather, whose name is my middle name Alexander. And he migrated down there to Macon, Georgia after they kicked him off the plantation, of course. He had been a metalsmith as a slave. And for my--both my father [Thomas Savage] and mother's side were reared in that area. They came to Chicago [Illinois] during the First World War [1914-1918].
Speaker 1: Do they--Do you remember them telling you any stories about growing up, either one of them?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And they went from Macon, Georgia to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: To Chicago.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I was born in Detroit [unclear]--but they were residents of Chicago, when I was born. My other--My siblings, I have three brothers [John, Robert, and Randolph Savage] and a sister [Emma Savage], were all born here. I'm in the middle. And my father happened to have been on a temporary job assignment for his employer in Detroit. And I happened to be born there.  But they were residents of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And your siblings? Where do you fit in the order? I know that--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I just said I'm the middle one out of five.
Speaker 1: [Unclear] So you're after Robert?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And before Randolph.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 12965
Speaker 1: Because something I read said that you came back to Chicago [Illinois] when you were five. Was that--?
Speaker 2: From Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: From Detroit. Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well, maybe four, about Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. About five, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Do you have any early memories of growing up? You know. I like people usually to share maybe, you know, two or three memories of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I came up poor in a very tough ghetto. And had a rather ill spent youth.
Speaker 1: Okay. But can you just share some memories with us?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] I mean most black people grow up poor.
Speaker 2: Well, even though I was a street gang leader, I was considered very bright. And if--I never--I never attended eighth grade. I was graduated out of seventh grade, because of my high scores.  And went into Wendell Phillips High School as perhaps the brightest in the class, at only 12 years old.  And out of a class of 243, I came out 243.  And Wendell Phillips was the worst--poorest school in the city.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] academically speaking.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Now you--Where were you raise--You came out of what housing projects? You were--
Speaker 2: No. I lived in public housing, low-income public housing after I was an adult. After I came out of World--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Oh, after. Okay.
Speaker 2: War II.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up at 42nd and Cottage Grove, most of the time.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] 42nd, okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived in tenement buildings.  So you didn't live in one place a long time.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 2: But the place where I spent most of my time and my more conscious years would have been 42nd and Cottage Grove.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And so what junior high did you go to? I know you went to Wendell Phillips [High School].  But you went to--
Speaker 2: In elementary, Fuller [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Fuller. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 42nd and St. Lawrence.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were there--What was the--I mean around the time that you were in elementary school were there? You know, 'cause we're always, when we're young, we have dreams. Or, you know, we have thoughts.  Or there may be people that are influencing us then. Or, you know, we look up to in the community. Was there any of that with you?
Speaker 2: Not in the neighborhood I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had nothing to dream about--But just be a little gambler. Steal a little money, hustle a little money and stuff like that. You had no dreams.
Speaker 1: Now when you got involved in the gang, how old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh a young teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And what--Was there a name to the gang at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah. El Rays [Chuckling]. I never will forget that.  Spanish for The Kings.
Speaker 1: Oh it is! 'Cause, you know--that sounds like a singing group.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't then [chuckling].
Speaker 1: So you were the leader?
Speaker 2: A bunch of juvenile delinquents [laughing].
Speaker 1: So you were the leader?
Speaker 2: At one time.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so what did you do as the leader? You gave orders?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well that's not important.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Well okay! I just trying--
Speaker 2: I was just a street gang leader.  I did whatever street gang leaders do. You know?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Okay [chuckling].  Well  we won't go--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Was anti-social..
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Well I won't go--That's that. So what happened--?  So when you were--That lasted how many years 'til you graduated from Wendell Phillips?
Speaker 2: Well, I was going downhill all the time, from the time I went to Wendell Phillips on. But I went into World War II [1939-1945] and that saved me.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I was on my way down.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: My--Most of my teenage buddies and those in the gang ended up dying from overdose or in jail--or being killed doing something wrong out in the street.
Story_ID: 12966
Speaker 1: Well what made you decide to go into the service?
Speaker 2: World War II [1939-1945].  They were drafting people.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, just talk about that. So you got drafted and you got stationed where?
Speaker 2: Well--That changed me.  Because again, even though I had the terrible deportment problems and terrible grades in high school, again my IQ was very, very high. So high that I got out of--I guess I didn't have any other qualifications.  But so high that they put me in an elite group called the Aviation Cadet Corps, that ended up in Tuskegee [Alabama] at the Tuskegee Airmen.  And what made a difference there is, for the first time I was in association with blacks who were not antisocial, who did have dreams and had already made some achievements, academically particularly. That was all new to me. Blacks that weren't poor or didn't come from families that were as poor as my family.
Speaker 1: So were you shipped off to Tuskegee? Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah. First you go to basic training at (unclear) Field and then from there to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: '43, okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] '43, '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: So who were some--Were any of these people Chicagoans that you met there? Are they any--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some of the names or things of people, who may have influenced you? That, you know, sort of got--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No. No individual that influenced me. It's just that I was exposed to people, who had different values. Things that I'd learned to do to get credits like something for all antisocial activities, violent activities. They were people, who had different values. They thought you should get credit for things that were very constructive socially and so forth. Like I said, they were middle class kind of group, as blacks go as there--to an extent, there was a black middle class back in those days.
Story_ID: 12967
Speaker 1: But a lot of people talk about the fact that in the service while it may have been good for, you know, teaching and--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Let me save some time. When I came out of service I had had some very bad experience at the hands of racism and the United States military, at the time.  And they took blacks and put them in the South to acclimate them. Just as they would take the blacks out of the South and have them trained in the North. And I was always kind of rebellious, because of my background and so forth. So it caused a lot of problems. And I began to realize that, there was more to this than just my individual antisocial behavior. There was more of a group problem that touched other people too. And that the forces were too great to battle single-handedly; they'd beat you down in a minute, and just put you in jail and forget about you.
Story_ID: 12968
Speaker 1: And so during the course there I began--I became concerned about what's causing all these problems. Now why am I in this fix? And I began to read more. My father [Thomas Savage] would send me different books as I would ask him for them. I'd hear of books. And the guys I was with knew about books. You see. To find out what was going on, why people treat people like this.  And finally it impressed me so that in the end when I came out, I committed myself to--trying to dedicate my life trying to do something about it. I thought first--I'd read Gunnar Myrdal's book, 'The American Dilemma'. And got fooled by that for a little while, and got sidetracked. We talked about the problem being the heart and all that nonsense. So I figured I'd major in psychology then see what was psychologically wrong with these white folks. But after--for a while after that, when I changed my mind about that, I realized that I just needed to know more period. So I shifted to philosophy as my undergrad major.  Find out about ideas and thoughts over the world history. What had people thought? what--And then I got more and more interested in politics as I began to see its political implications, of this problem and so forth. Or to some extent its political source. And it went from there.
Speaker 2: I wanna ask you. What--You decided on Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] because of what? Was it because where--You know, it was the place where a lot of black people went as a first [unclear]?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Nah.  I've forgotten now what it was. I've forgotten.
Speaker 2: Okay. Were there any people, you know--
Speaker 1: It had a very high reputation academically at that time. It didn't last long. But during that period, it was highly rated. It'd gotten in some top notch European professors, who were progressives and radicals and so forth. So it was a place of intellectual activity and agitation at the time. So that interest--no particular reason other than that.
Speaker 2: Did you--Were there things that your eyes were opened to during that time? I mean I know that between--you know. You said, "I started out as a psychology major. And then I, you know, became a philosophy major."
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] And then finally start doing greater work in political science.  I went for.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But what things were you sort of learning in that whole process of--
Speaker 1: Oh I don't--I don't recall. But I've been--tried to be a student every since then.  So it wasn't just learning at any particular time. I can't cut off where I learned this and where I learned that. I'm trying to be a student for the rest of my life.  I still like to think of myself as a student.
Speaker 2: And you did very--
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't see college like a lot of people now see it as a vocational training school. I didn't go there for the purpose of learning how to earn a living. I went there to try to find out a little more about this world, and about society, and so forth. And so that I could better understand what was going on.
Speaker 2: So in many ways that's what I would call a true academic, in many ways. You know, you wanted to learn for learning's sake only.
Speaker 1: Well yeah. I think it took a 120 credit hours of good grades to graduate. And I think I had about 140 when I finished.  Because again I wasn't that anxious to graduate. I was interested in finding out things I wanted to know about.
Story_ID: 12969
Speaker 1: Were you getting--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well my grades were so--My academic background was so poor that I didn't have much choice. I was lucky to get into Wilson [Junior College, Chicago, Illinois]. But by the time--When I started, I had to take remedial courses.  At least the professors wanted me to take remedial courses. I begged myself out of some of them. But when I finished I was on the honor roll.  So then I could go to any university I wanted to.  I did that from Wilson.
Story_ID: 12970
Speaker 1: Is that at the point that you decide that you want to get involved with politics? And you start getting politically active?
Speaker 2: Nah. Nah. I was never--I was never particularly interested in getting involved in politics.  I spent most of my life as a writer, as a journalist.
Speaker 1: Correct. I know. But--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] And I've never been a member of a political party.
Speaker 1: But you've worked on many political campaigns?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I would work on anything that I--that gave me an opportunity to contribute in the radical directions that I thought would be helpful to society.
Speaker 1: So that's what I'm trying to get at--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But as a volunteer.  And against the political establishment always.
Speaker 1: Okay. But in 19--
Speaker 2: In fact my first job out of school was as a--the Southside director of the old Henry Wallace Progressive Party.
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me--I mean I'm not a Chicagoan. And there was nothing in the writing to tell me about Henry Wallace but--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Henry Wallace was a candidate for President.
Speaker 1: Right. I know. I know. I know.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh. In '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Right. I know but--And I know he was--Truman--he was running against [Harry] Truman. But I was wondering--what appealed to you about Henry Wallace? And--
Speaker 2: It wasn't so much Henry Wallace.  It was just a movement that was against the establishment. It wouldn't have mattered whether it would have been a political party or a social movement, or civic movement, or Civil Rights Movement. I was antiestablishment. So whatever gave me an opportunity to participate the most effectively, then that's what I would participate in.
Speaker 1: So you didn't care about the ideals and things of what he espoused or anything at that time? Besides just being antiestablishment?
Speaker 2: Well that was one of the main ideas, that it was anti-status quo.
Speaker 1: So did--were there things--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] And, of course, it was for peace in the world. And I was always for peace. It was--had a better program with regard to race relations, I thought. So a little more understanding of the plight of black folks in this country and so forth and working people.
Story_ID: 12971
Speaker 1: What was happening [in the 1950s]? What were the issues in Chicago [Illinois]? Were they labor issues--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Same as what they are now.  Things haven't changed. We're no better off. The situation hasn't changed any.
Speaker 1: [pause] Well I would--Okay.
Speaker 2: I led my first demonstration in 1947, in Chicago for decent housing for veterans. And I've tried to be active consistently ever since. And I don't see any change. Not basically. I mean we may dress a little nicer.  May let you stay in this hotel room where they wouldn't let you stay before or something like that. But that's no basic change.
Speaker 1: Did you--Okay. So in 1947, you said, you [unclear].  But I, you know, I was looking at 1953.  You know, when you graduated. What were you doing? What did you go from that point to do? What were you doing then? After you worked on the campaign [for Henry Wallace]?
Speaker 2: Then I got into journalism. I was always gonna write. And I'd had--I was interested in English. I had a minor in English, in fact. And I ended up working with a magazine. Always in journalism.
Speaker 1: And which one was that? Was that the Westside Booster?
Speaker 2: No. A magazine called, The American Negro Magazine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  American Negro.
Story_ID: 12972
Speaker 1: You were very active in the, you know, leading the fight for housing for veterans. And that was in 1948. You also worked on the behalf of department stores downtown to, you know, what to--so people would be hired. And I had been told even, black people didn't even, you know.  They weren't even allowed to shop downtown.  A lot of people's--
Speaker 2: No. You could shop, but you couldn't work even as a clerk. You could shop.  Some of the anchor stores were in the Loop [downtown Chicago, Illinois].  But at the time where the Sears Roebuck chain, Goldblatts. So those stores all chains--got--had a lot of black patronage. It was just that it was a one-way street. They didn't hire any blacks. So I was part of those, who picketed to force those stores to hire black clerks.
Speaker 1: And so what stores are we talking about in Chicago?
Speaker 2: It was true of all of them in the Loop. You could shop in them, but you couldn't work for them.
Speaker 1: I know. But what stores did you target at the time?
Speaker 2: Goldblatts and then Sears.  Because they had the--a higher proportion of black patronage than the others.
Speaker 1: Did you--were you doing--mainly your demonstrations--Were they done and, you know, by pickets or--? You know.
Speaker 2: In that case we were picketing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Were you following the sort of the non-violent approach to things? Or were you, you know.  With your pickets were you just, you know, gathering people? Who were the people who you would gather and go? And--You know. Who were the other people in the community that you were working with at the time?
Speaker 2: Well in the case of the picketing of Goldblatts and Sears, the breakdown on employment discrimination in the Loop, it was based on students at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], which was located in the Loop.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so you did that as a student when--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right, right.
Speaker 1: You were still a student. Okay.
Story_ID: 12973
Speaker 1: Let me ask what did you learn about that whole process after you--Because this is one of the first things that you had sort of done. And sort of the demonstration and sort of, you know, being successful there with demonstrations.
Speaker 2: No. We were successful in the housing--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Oh.
Speaker 2: in '47 [1947]. We ended up with housing for veterans.  Black veterans. They had us in a--They called them, you know, like motor homes?  Took the wheels off or something. Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you came back out of the service, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's where they put you. They didn't have housing for you.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was that housing located at?
Speaker 2: One particular place where I stayed, there were several locations.  But the Lutheran Hospital was right across the street from Artgeld Gardens--about 130th Street.
Speaker 1: And so when you did this--When you led this fight here where did they end up putting--What did they--What was the end result?
Speaker 2: They put up prefabs in different locations.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did that start something in terms of--Because I didn't even know they used to put up veterans afterwards--after the war. They did?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That was part of the housing story. I mean all these people came back. You know, a lot of people were in World War II [1939-1945] [chuckle].  Not like the other war.
Story_ID: 12974
Speaker 1: I know that it was a big deal in the black community.  I don't know the whole story behind Lake Meadows [apartment complex].  And, obviously there was more of a story.  You know, because you--You know, here it says that you organized and demonstrated the right of blacks to even live in--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Helped organize.
Speaker 1: Lake Meadows.
Speaker 2: Helped, helped.
Speaker 1: So I would like to know the whole story behind Lake Meadows.
Speaker 2: See, again, I'm not gonna give a lot of time talking about Lake Meadows.  I will tell you, in brief--just why I was involved down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay tell me.
Speaker 2: Because you can get the history of Lake Meadows from a lot of people who know more about  it than I.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well tell--just talk about the role that you played there.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well Lake--
Speaker 1: And why you thought it was important.
Speaker 2: Well Lake Meadows was being developed by an insurance company, I forgot. I think it was New York Life or something. And it appeared that it was gonna be an effort to bring whites into the community and exclude blacks. So to make sure that blacks were permitted to live there also, we demonstrated. There were indications, as I said, that blacks were not gonna be permitted to live there.
Speaker 1: And why was there an indication there? 'Cause wasn't at that time--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh pardon me. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay go on.
Speaker 2: Not--See I don't recall--there were indications.  But I've forgotten what the indications were.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was pretty standard procedure. People didn't build houses for blacks then, unless it was low-income public housing.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But without what we did, without the demonstrations and so forth, I don't think that blacks would've been permitted to live there in the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But we won the--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] At all?
Speaker 2: Not in the beginning, I don't think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we won concessions that they would have to have a fair housing policy.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] See, fair housing was not a policy of this country at that time. In fact, restrictive covenants were a part of the law in the state of Illinois.
Story_ID: 12975
Speaker 1: You were--Were you working very closely at that time with people like Dempsey Travis and things like that. But--
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis was never involved in protest activity. He and I were close friends. We had been locker mates in college [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois]. But he was never involved in protest activity. Dempsey was always interested in what he's interested in, making money. And being a successful businessman.
Speaker 1: But he--wasn't he head of the NAACP  [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Local Chapter--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh that's long after. That's after he'd become a successful businessperson.  That's years, years later.
Speaker 1: Okay. That was in the '60s [1960s]? I thought it was in the '50s [1950s]. I thought he--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Not in the '50's [1950s].  Nah. That would be the late '60's [1960s]--or early '70s [1970s] or something.
Story_ID: 12976
Speaker 1: But this whole issue of restrictive covenants, it was a big deal. You know, in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean it was a big deal all around the country. But it was a big deal in Chicago. And that was really where the fight was at. Right?
Speaker 2: No, not especially so.  To be honest--Let me make you understand something. I didn't get involved in these protests because the individual protest had some special significance to me. As I said in the beginning, I was dedicated--I had dedicated myself to encouraging and helping any protest that struck at the power structure in this country.  And so if it was Lake Meadows, fine. If it were hiring blacks to drive buses, fine. Whatever it was.
Speaker 1: What are there? What are some--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] If it was getting blacks to vote against the Democratic machine. Anything that had to put pressure on this racist power structure in this country. And in this case, Chicago, since that's where I was.
Story_ID: 12977
Speaker 1: And what are some of things that you did? Let's say, in the '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s] that you're sort of most proud of? In terms of, you know, I mean I understand--
Speaker 2: I would say the most important thing that I did was to bust up the [Democratic] Machine, hyphen, criminal syndicate on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the Machine that existed on the West Side in the [unclear]?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah. Yeah. It was part of the Democratic Machine.  Headed then by the father [Richard J. Daley] of the current mayor [Richard M. Daley], his successor is our slave--political slave master in Chicago.  And it had no respect for black folks. No accountability to black folks. Took every advantage of the black folks weakness, political weakness.  And robbed the community. The majority of the population in the immediate West Side at that time was black, 80, 90 percent.  But all the elected officials were white. All the precinct captains, even, were white. They didn't even live in the area. But that gave them the authority then and the power to be able to operate with some impunity, gambling and other vices in the ward. And also, of course, to avail themselves and their friends of the patronage that was available as the result of the corruption of the political machine in Chicago. So there were some efforts--by people who lived there, residents, black residents, to try to get some changes of that kind--Something done about it. But they were very weak and unsuccessful. So I was asked by some people if I'd go over there and see if I could help. So I moved over to the West Side.
Speaker 1: And what was the process that you--I mean what did you end up doing? Did you--
Speaker 2: Well I--first thing I did was organize a newspaper so I'd have a communication vehicle. And could also ingratiate myself with the middle class residents that were there then by doing them favors, like putting their pictures in the paper and rubbing down the egos.  You know, gratifying the ego needs and what have you. And also to raise questions about the injustice of--the political injustice that this represented. And also to try to organize some independent black political activity in rebellion against it. And eventually we won.
Speaker 1: So who was helpful to your--[unclear]?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] well the leader--I would say the leading force there for black political representation was a guy named Al Janning.  A big guy. We used to call him Big Al.  A very courageous guy. A real unsung hero who risked his life along with me to break that machine up.
Speaker 1: And how long did that whole process take?
Speaker 2: A couple of years. We started in, I guess, late '58 [1958] and we busted it by '59 [1959] or '60 [1960], a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you're saying before that time that all the--your politicians were white?  And all the--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] On the West Side. On the West Side.
Speaker 1: I know. I know you're talking about the West Side.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure. All--even the precinct captains.  Not just the politicians.  All the good patronage jobholders. They--You know, they were raping the community.  That's what they do.
Speaker 1: And did you--so what was the end result of that when you won the fight? what--did you get black people into positions? Because the West Side still after that period of time, was a lot of times controlled by--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well yeah. The blacks are often controlled by whites. But we broke the back of the machine and--by beating it in elections. We won with Ben Lewis, who was--became the first black alderman over there in the 24th Ward. We had put pressure on them in other ways. We called it "making it more difficult for them to deliver the vote."  By constantly harassing them, and speaking, and writing about their ways that were not in the interest of the community and so forth.  And mobilizing the people. And finally they could no longer control the vote.
Speaker 1: And so they saw you--people saw you at this point, they're seeing you as a force to be reckoned with. And that was so you--I mean you're now around Chicago as a force to be reckoned with in many ways. With your--I would call them, guerilla techniques.
Speaker 2: Well techniques vary, you know, depends upon the circumstances.
Speaker 1: But you were using the press very successfully [unclear]--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I used the press in that instance. You use whatever is necessary. Whatever is best.  In that case we had a big educational problem. That was--You had to educate people in addition to agitate people for that gave--Plus that gave me an entree to the community.
Speaker 1: Were you working with the churches at all over there at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  Most of the things you do in the black community you need to have some church base.
Speaker 1: Okay. So who on--I know you talk about Big Al.  But who of the churches were helping you out at that point? Or, you know, who may have been significant?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't wanna say.  Maybe they don't wanna be known.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's okay.
Speaker 2: Because at the time it was not--You could get in a lot of trouble helping what we were doing.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously]  In fact, they eventually ran me out of business, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: They ran me out of there.
Speaker 1: So let's talk--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But by that time we had broken their back.
Story_ID: 12978
Speaker 1: I attended the founding convention of SNCC at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] back in, what I guess '64 [1964], or '5 [1965], or something. But I was there as an advisor to the Alabama Nine.  Because I was no longer student age.  But because of my experience in organizing and years of involvement, I was asked to attend.
Story_ID: 12979
Speaker 1: What other things would you be, you know, that you're sort of proud of that occurred? You know. Let's say in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: In the early '60s [1960s], I would think maybe helping organize the--and strategize for the movement called, 'Protest at the Polls', that won the involvement of the local Civil Rights leaders in an electoral activity. Prior to 1963, there was some doubt.  Civil Rights leaders felt that, there may have been the--separate--should maintain a separation between electoral activity and what they called, civil rights activity.  And I think that the 'Protest at the Polls' was probably one of the main vehicles that persuaded them that they were one and the same. That you're not going to get much civil rights if you can't also build from political power.
Speaker 1: So who were the people that were involved in this whole project with you? Or that you--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Phil Smith was the leader, I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay. And who was Phil Smith?
Speaker 2: He was an active guy, that's all. He's no longer in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And--
Speaker 2: And, of course, you know, the independent--by that time we had some independent political thinking going on and so forth. So--
Speaker 1: And who was leading those independents' sort of political thinking? Who were players in that?
Speaker 2: I would have been accused by some [laughing].
Story_ID: 12980
Speaker 1: Like I said, the political machine and syndicate on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] had run me out of town. And so, I went up in Michigan and hid out for a year with my parents [Thomas and Mollie Savage] and--who were retired there. And then I came back in. And some--I'm trying to remember now--
Speaker 2: Sir, can I ask a question about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was that when your house was broke--You know. I read that you left--went to Michigan. Was this a separate time?
Speaker 1: No, that's the time, Right.
Speaker 2: It is the time that you--someone broke in and they--
Speaker 1: They didn't break in, they just [chuckling]--
Speaker 2: They came in--Well whatever [chuckling]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They came in at night. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. But exp--Can you go into that whole story? 'Cause I mean I didn't know it until you said, you hid out in Michigan. And it made my realize--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] I may be exaggerating when I said, "I hid out." But I had to get out of town. But they busted the business. They had the political leaders--the white absentee leaders to phone the advertisers, since their relationship between business and politics. You know. Businesses need licenses and all other kinds of governmental assistance. And they controlled the process.  Because they were--controlled the vote in that area. So they would call the advertisers and tell them that they should not be advertising in this paper. And they would have me sometime even fit in before they could have me to hear. They'd call the advisers. And then they would, you know, say, "You wanna talk to him?" You know.  That or, "Do you wanna change your attitude?" Like I said, they ran the businesses away. But that didn't stop us. And they tried to frighten us, you know.  As the incident that you were referring.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Can you just talk about that incident? Because you [unclear]--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Well they just came up to the--they would--they had come into the house and--threatening my family. And my wife [Eunice Savage] called me and asked me to hurry home.  And I came home. And they were--they had been threatening to throw my son [Thomas Savage] out a window, the third floor window. And so--In the guise of going to the closet to take off my coat, I reached up on the top shelf and got my gun. And that changed the whole picture. When the guy was convinced I was gonna make him jump out the window instead, he left.
Speaker 2: So--But at that point, you decide you better get out of town and go to Michigan.
Speaker 1: Well no.  That was just part of it. No. Later they took me for--they come themselves taking me for a ride.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So go on and talk about it!  Come on!
Speaker 1: It ain't nothing.  I just happen to have my gun, too. And so it was gun to gun. You know. I don't--that's all.
Speaker 2: You said you had good training already. So okay [chuckle]. From--I mean you were accustomed to the streets.  That's all I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You know. When you come up like I did, you know, you get afraid like any person would. But you learn not to permit your fears to determine what you do. So I knew where I was and what was going on. So I carried my gun all the time, too. And I would test them, see if they were more willing to die than me. And most of them would back off.  Most of them weren't ready to go. Not that I was ready to go, about as willing as they were. I could give more details.  But I won't.
Speaker 2: Why won't you give more details?
Speaker 1: Because I'd involve some names of people, that may not wanna be known.
Speaker 2: Oh jeez! Can't you just! Okay. Go on.
Speaker 1: Of course some of this stuff was not legal. You know what I'm talking--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Okay, okay. I understand. Okay. So you--So what I'm saying--You went to Michigan for a year and then you--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They had beaten me up pretty badly. I don't mean physically but psychologically and business-wise.  That I wasn't in the best of shape. [Chuckling].  They 'd really wrecked me. But we won.
Story_ID: 12981
Speaker 1: There was a magazine in New York.  A quarterly called Negro Liberation, that was edited by Shirley Graham, who was W. E. B. DuBois' wife. And DuBois had moved to Africa. And she had decided that she wanted to join him. So she was resigning as editor. It was a radical black publication. So I was asked to come in and interview for--as her replacement. And while I was in New York, a friend of mine named Richard Dorm--he's dead so I can mention his name, called me, because the Nation of Islam under the Honorable Elijah Muhammad wanted to start a newspaper that was to become 'Muhammad Speaks'. And I probably knew as much about starting a newspaper as anybody in town.  So he had called me in New York and asked me, would I come back to Chicago [Illinois]-- I hadn't been hired. I was just up there being interviewed--come back to Chicago and undertake that project of getting this paper started for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. And so that interested me even more than the project for which I was being interviewed. Because the project for which I was being interviewed was a--what might be called a left wing black publication, whereas Elijah Muhammad represent a nationalist black position, which was more my position. And so I came back and--to set up that paper for him. But in the process the word came out that he had met with a guy, named [George] Lincoln Rockwell who was head of a white racist organization [American Nazi Party] much like, say, the Ku Klux Klan or something. And they had met or something.  And that bothered me. And so when I demanded that I have an explanation in person from him, as to why he would meet with this guy.  They didn't show any respect for my demands.  So that ended up in my being terminated from that, after the paper got its first issue up. And so then I was left high and dry again.
Story_ID: 12982
Speaker 1: A guy named Bruce Sagin that owned a small chain of community weeklies in Chicago [Illinois], including the Hyde Park Herald had gotten interested in trying to duplicate the success of the Hyde Park Herald in some black middle class communities. And he contacted me and asked me would I go to work with them. And I did. So I went to work for the Hyde Park Herald. And as he started black operations started. And the Woodlawn Booster was a black paper in Woodlawn. I had to be responsible to build it. And then next came the Bulletin Newspaper in Chatham. I had to be responsible for building it. And then I scouted other papers for him when communities where they had a strong community newspaper, but the residents had--turning from white to black.  And so we could buy them cheap and where they'd be worthwhile and so forth. So I worked for them until '65 [1965].  And--Well I had to start the Citizen, because what happened is that we finally won--You see all this time from the early '50s [1950s] when I got involved, politically that is, we fought the Democratic machine at every election. We'd run some--We'd run people. We could never make much of a dent.  Because they're just too strong and we didn't have any resources. And they had a strong cadre of black straw bosses. Claude Holman, Ralph Metcalfe, William Dawson, all those guys. But every time we kept battling them.  We didn't give up. We'd battle them every election. I think I first managed a campaign against William L. Dawson in 1950. I think we ran a guy named Sam Parks for [U.S] Congress, as an independent challenger in the Democratic Primary.
Story_ID: 12983
Speaker 1: I was an early proponent of black power. I wrote pamphlets back in the '50s [1950s] on the subject. And I was an advocate of economic power, cultural identity and political representation for black people. And, at that time, of those arenas of struggle, the one most accessible to blacks, it seemed to me, was the political arena. Will it mean, that you do one instead of the other? You're involved in all, but it's a question of emphasis. I had been involved in the early '50s in picketing Jewish-owned stores in--along 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois]. 47th Street was the main commercial street in the black community. All of the retail stores, the shoppers were a 100 percent black. All the owners were white.  99percent of all the employees were white. So we started organizing picket lines around them. Pushing for--they wouldn't even rent--a black could not rent a store in the main--on the main commercial strip in the black community of Chicago. Just like it was in Harlem [New York] for a long time on 125th Street.  Same thing. So we pressed for the employment of blacks.  Demanded that they would rent a store to black would-be merchants and so forth. But what we lacked was a power base. And we didn't have the money for it to be--to have  an economic power base. We tried to discourage black patronage to pressure them. And then they could send in, as they did, the black-led local union of store clerks that threatened to hurt us physically. Because their--the  dues for the store clerks were being paid by the white merchants.  So they owned the union, in a sense. So we concluded that we needed to build a political base.  Because the main currency in politics was the vote.  Numbers, not money. Money is a big, big factor.  But at least votes are a factor. And in the case--in the terms of economic power the only factor with which we could deal was patronage.  Black patronage. But that was a difficult strategy to follow, because blacks had no alternative.  You couldn't even work downtown, as I said earlier. You were treated more disrespectfully in those stores and other areas where whites shopped, than you were in these stores in the black community, even though disrespectfully there, also. So that when you asked blacks to--"Don't shop here." That's asking quite a bit if there is no other comparable place to shop. They wouldn't rent stores to blacks. But in terms of politics, if you could convince blacks to withhold their vote or to use their vote in a different way, not beholden to this machine, it would take away that element of power. And put blacks in a position where they could have some influence. They had blacks in office.  But they didn't have any influence, because they had been picked by whites. And were sustained by whites financially and so forth. That's why you had--You had--At one time, you had six blacks in the [Chicago] city council in the late '50s [1950s].  And they were referred to as the 'Silent Six'. I was one of those who coined the phrase. Because on issues dearest to black people they were silent.  Because their bosses were white. That's the thing you were asking about the archives and so forth. And I thought you need the museum thing we were talking about. It's not just enough to have blacks. It's better to have a white controlled by blacks than a black controlled by whites. In my business I hired whites. But whites can [Uncle] Tom just like blacks. They taught us how. And they'll Tom to you if you got the stick. So in '58 [1958], we organized what was called The Negro League--I mean The Chicago League of Negro Voters. And for the first time--before that we challenged for city council, [Illinois] state legislature, even [U.S.] Congress. We had one black Congressman [William L.] Dawson. But there we decided to run a black for the first time for citywide office in the Democratic Primary, and the reason the Democratic primary--not that we had any preference for Democratic Party--it was just that at that time, whoever won the Democratic primary for all practical purposes had won the election.  Because there was no political strength or influence in the black communities.
Story_ID: 12984
Speaker 1: Yeah. The attorney named Emil Bentley, we ran for [Chicago, Illinois] city clerk. And this really threw a fright into the political establishment. Because here we were challenging from the outside for citywide office. And even though we had little or no chance of winning, it was building more and more concern. And it was serving as a vehicle to organize more and more black voters, against them.  Over the course of a campaign--a campaign is one of the best ways to educate people. In the course of a campaign, you  can raise all these pertinent issues. So when we got into the '60s [1960s] and then we went into this 'Protest at the Polls', that I mentioned, to get the local Civil Rights leaders involved in the electoral politics. See at that time, you know, you go in somebody's room and you start--or apartment or something and start talking with them. And if you go talk about religion, they say, "We don't talk about religion." You know. Because naturally that's a divisive subject. Well if you talked about politics they'd have the same response. Because blacks were punished if they tried to get into politics, outside of being selected by the white folks or obedient to white folks. So after that, a guy named Charlie Chew, a black guy, ran for alderman against the white incumbent in an Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] Ward that was overwhelmingly black. And the incumbent was not only was white, but unresponsive to the black constituency. And the paper that serviced that area or the ones that I was editing for and managing for the Southtown Economist chain, which is this chain of white papers I was talking about.  Community papers that had employed me. The paper involved there, was owned by the Southtown Economist chain was a paper called 'The Bulletin', that I was also managing for them. And in that race in the 17th Ward, we had a difference of opinion. The advertising manager, white of course, of the whole chain, not that particular paper came over to try to persuade me to support the white incumbent in the Englewood Ward. The 17th Ward.  It was a guy named Arthur Slight. And I refused.  And told him, "Not only I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna support the black candidate." Because one of the understandings that I had with the publisher, as a condition of accepting the work with him to start with was that any paper that he gave me--put me in charge of, I had to have control of its editorial policy. And I did. I supported the black candidate. And he won. The first time the machine had ever been beat in Chicago by a black, 1963. All the other fights until then, we finally won one.
Speaker 2: And this was Charlie Chew?
Speaker 1: Charlie Chew. Until then every black elected to office was elected with the support of the white political bosses.  In the whole history of Chicago.
Speaker 2: And Charlie Chew was legendary. Even his--they say he was legendary. His personality and everything.
Speaker 1: Well, anyway.  But then the publisher called me in, of course. And I ended up with no job.
Story_ID: 12985
Speaker 1: So I had no choice but try to organize the Citizen Newspaper and I finally did. Then we organized what was called the South End Voters Conference. And the reasons why I organized The Citizen out in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois neighborhood], which was the first of The Citizen newspapers, The Chatham Citizen, because my experience on the West Side had taught me something.  That it's easy to build a base against the power, if that base was not as subject to that power. By that meaning, it's--in some ways it's easy to get a person--See, you're a lawyer. You can survive and plus you came out of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so you have high credentials. Credentials that white folks praise. You could survive shunning the power structure more than say the black--if you had a black--what do you call them? They work in a hotel. A black in charge of the bellhops here or a black in charge of food or whatever. Because he could get fired because of his rebelliousness. And that would follow him.  So he would have difficulty getting equal job from other places since all hotels are owned by whites. Even in Washington [D.C], where Washington is some 70 percent black. No black hotels [nota bene: Howard University has a 110 bed hotel]. But you could find a way to earn a living even if you became rebellious. And the firm that--for which you worked or with whom or with which you associated could disassociate themselves from you. You still could probably make a living, as a lawyer and so forth. You could make it independently as a lawyer, without it being with some white firm. So--
Speaker 2: You were saying you were--
Speaker 1: You get in Chatham, you were a middle class community. The West Side black community was poor.  Though they had some scattering of middle class people, mainly poor socio--the socio-economic profile of the Chatham was such that it was higher than that of most white communities in terms of income, years of school attainment, what had, whatever.  So that's one reason it was a good place to start if you're gonna agitate for political independence. They could more afford--they were less dependent. Say like a real poor person, precinct captain, he may need a captain. Because a captain may give a turkey on Thanksgiving for his family.  He actually couldn't afford a turkey. Or his kid got in trouble with the juvenile authorities and the precinct captain put a good word in. He couldn't afford a lawyer. So the precinct captain could put a word in.  And that'd get his child out of the juvenile detention center or something. So that made him more dependent. He needed more help. A person like you don't--You would not need as much help. You can get your own child out of--You know how to get him out of--get him out of juvenile detention or whatever. So you know how to do things.  You know more about how the system works. So that made Chatham a better, a more fertile area to agitate for political independence. That tends to oversimplify it a bit, of course.  Because the downside of that is, that people in your position often have had their heads put on by white folks.  Like you were saying you went to Brandeis University [Boston, Massachusetts], then Harvard and so forth.  Well you can't go to those kind of institutions where all the power is white.  You get accustomed to whites grading you, determining whether you're good or bad or otherwise and so forth, without being affected by it negatively in terms of black interest. The reason I asked you, what schools you attended, so I'll just tell you. When you were on the phone, I didn't know whether you were black or white.  The way your voice sounded.  That's commonly said.
Speaker 2: So that would indicate to me that you had attended white schools. And I was just verifying it by asking.  That's why I came and asked you. Not just asking. But that's the way you get along with white folks. And that's how you get with a Jenner and Block, a big firm like that is by becoming acculturated. Because things that are strange to those whites, like black culture, they would find threatening. So you learned that and so that's of the negative downside on it.  But so you got to deal with that too. That's a limitation. But the upside is that you could afford not to do that.  If you just knew enough or understood enough rather. So we moved to Chatham and start a paper there. Also, of course, people in your position can afford to buy. You have buying power.  You have what's called disposable income. And advertisers want people, who have some disposable income. Why advertise in a newspaper for an automobile dealership if the people can't get their credit cleared. So that fitted in after--from my lessons on the West Side.  So we started out in Chatham.
Story_ID: 12986
Speaker 1: And then we formed with the newspaper again as a catalyst, we formed the South End Voters Conference behind the Charlie Chew victory.  And ran Charlie for [Illinois] state senator in '66 [1966], and beat the [Democratic political] Machine again. Running against a white incumbent a black district [of Chicago, Illinois]. It was the first time then that a black had won in a district larger than a ward. Of course, the next day after he won, Charlie Chew sold out. But we at least had mobilized the people with enough strength to show that they could defeat the machine. We just passed--let Charlie go on his way. In 1967, we encouraged races of--more independent races in more wards and we won two this time. We won with Bill Cousins, now judge in the 8th Ward. And Sammy Rayner, who was a funeral director at the time, who, now deceased, in the 6th Ward. Both--they are adjacent wards.  Park Manor was one, Chatham was the other the base of the newspaper.  And they were quite similar demographically.  So then Anna Langford, a black woman beat the Machine and a white incumbent in another portion of Englewood called, the 16th Ward. That gave me three black independents in the City Council. And they were able to speak out.  Which was further embarrassing to their so called, 'Silent Six'--put more pressure on them.  They were less able to turn out the vote then. That 'Silent Six' was so bad that when [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came to Chicago--took up residence in Chicago--temporary residence in Chicago in '66 or '65 [1965]. Those six black aldermen under the leadership of Alderman Ralph Metcalfe openly, blatantly organized against Dr. King. They'd rally.  Just as King would whole a rally urging people to support him, or his cause or their cause. These aldermen would sponsor a rally at a church denouncing him and asking him to leave Chicago. Blacks! And, of course, that wasn't hard to do.  Most blacks--you know, everybody celebrates Dr. King's birthday now and talk about what a great guy he was. But when he would come to Chicago, I'd often organize his satellite meeting. By that I mean if you sponsor him to come to Chicago and speak, while he was here, he would take advantage of the fact that you were paying his hotel bill and his train fare or airfare for him and whatever staff members he brought with him. But he took advantage of that to reach more people. So they often asked me to contact churches to see if I could get him some other speaking engagements. Most black churches wouldn't allow King to speak in their church. But all the black pastors rave about him now.  But they wouldn't let him speak. And these black aldermen were encouraging that. But when we won finally with Sammy Rayner and Bill Cousin.  Then Anna Langford. The Machine could see that, their black straw bosses were losing control. And then, of course, in--then we started winning some other victories too. But then in 1980, when we really broke their control. When Harold [Washington] won in the first district running against a black incumbent. And I won in the second district. Both in anti-Machine campaigns.
Speaker 2: So in that--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] So there were only had three black districts. And we beat them in two of the three. I mean three black [U.S.] congressional districts. We beat them in two of the three.  Then they could see that really, that we had broke their control. And then, of course, a few years later [journalist] Lu Palmer led the strategizing and organizing of Harold Washington's campaign for mayor. And we beat them for mayor.
Story_ID: 12987
Speaker 1: So you're saying that in this period of between '60 [1960] and up to '80 [1980], the independence movement was really sort of gaining control in many ways. And you were having some important victories.
Speaker 2: No, no. We didn't have a victory.  But more specific we didn't win until '63 [1963], in one aldermanic race. We had never won any races before.
Speaker 1: No. But I'm talking about from '63 [1963] on. From '63 to '80 [1963 -1980].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Then we won, one other election in '66 [1966] and then one--two elections in '67 [1967]. So it's still small.  And then we began to add on to that. And finally got strong enough where we could challenge and make a whole [U.S.] congressional district. See a congressional district includes several wards, six, seven wards. But not only could--we got enough strength to win in one congressional district, we were able to win in two out of the three. Only Cardiss Collins on the West Side was a [Democratic political] Machine candidate.
Speaker 1: Now who were the people and the entities that were important in this whole project? From this period from like 1963 to 1980?
Speaker 2: I mentioned some of the people that won these elections. [A.A.] Sammy Rayner and Bill Cousins. I mentioned Phil Smith, who never held an elective office, but a dedicated and able independent political organizer. Al Janning, I mentioned on the West Side. Bennett Johnson, whose now head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Chapter in Evanston [Illinois]. Herman Gilbert, who passed, was the author of, 'The Uncertain Sound' and other--a couple--one other novel. Bernetta Barrett, on the West Side. I mentioned Sam Parks who ran against [William Levi] Dawson, I think 1950. Oscar Brown Jr, who ran.  But he ran on a Republican ticket once for Congress. But we learned from that, that your wast--you're spinning your wheels there.  Because blacks were weighted to the Democratic Party. So if you wanted to win anything significant in the blacks, we had to go with the Democrats. But we learned the hard way. But Oscar Brown, Vernon Jarrett--
Speaker 1: Timuel Black was--Wasn't he--?
Speaker 2: Well Timuel Black was a staunch Independent. But you see, you had two sides in the Independents. You had the white Independent movement, which was white liberals.  Like the IVI [ IVI-IPO, Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization], you know. In that which is the Chicago, Illinois affiliate of The Americans for Democratic Action.  So basically a white liberal group. And if you read the history of Chicago politics and independents, you get the impression that the independent force was mainly this white liberal force.  But that's not the case at all. People talk about Independent politics as though it was a North Shore ground-based operation. But that's not the case at all.  But that's because white folks wrote the books. The victories came from the black side. And they weren't a part of--they came from black nationalists, not black integrationist. Tim[uel Black] wasn't--lived in Hyde Park and he was a black integrationist. But I don't take anything from him. He was a staunch Independent. And really paid his dues and made great contributions. But he wasn't a part of the black operation.
Speaker 1: You know. I--The question that I have and don't shoot me down--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] You know, in '77 [1977], for instance we ran Harold Washington for mayor [of Chicago, Illinois]. That came out of the black community, not the white liberal community.
Speaker 1: Right. But don't shoot me down for this.  But what-- Where the Muslims in this whole thing? Were they--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well at that time the Muslims were not involving themselves in electoral politics. That was one of [Louis] Farrakhan's contributions in the '80s [1980s]. Prior to that the Muslims were not involved in electoral politics.
Story_ID: 12988
Speaker 1: Harold [Washington] himself had started off as a [Democratic political] machine candidate in the first place.
Speaker 2: Oh he'd been a--was a career machine politician. His father before him. And was the top Democratic machine precinct captain at the time we got him to run for mayor [ of Chicago, Illinois]. But he was born and bred as much. But Harold was also a brilliant person and extremely knowledgeable and had a deep strain of black pride in him. That would cause him always to be at loggerheads with this straightjacket, in which he found himself. In fact he was most embarrassed I think when in 19--early '70s [1970s], I guess it was, when we had gained some influence in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter in Chicago. And he elected a black junior leader named Willoughby Abner over the black establishment's choice, 'cause we are set apart from the black establishment.  'Cause by definition it meant blacks who were benefiting from the status quo. And that was the black straw bosses of the Democratic machine was ordered to break up that. Because the NAACP would be a great expansion of our influence since it had reached blacks that we couldn't reach.  The more radical because it was considered the moderate and acceptable black organization. And I was out there at the Dusable High School [Chicago, Illinois] where they had the election. The election got big buildup and everything. And--forgotten the name of the challenger but the establishment was trying to take the chapter over again and defeat Abner. So the thing had gotten a lot of attention. And they had a big packed--they had to hold it in Dusable High School Auditorium in order to permit all the people to come in  and to listen to the debate and all that. And then they were gonna vote afterwards. And I was there because I had mobilized the radical blacks to support the Willoughby. In fact I think I ended up taking out a membership in NAACP myself in order to be able to vote. And the debates going on.  But we had our minds made up who we were gonna vote for.  And so I didn't need to stand and sit in there in the auditorium. So I was standing out in the lobby waiting for them to get ready for the vote.  So I could go ahead and vote for Willoughby. And then started coming in an influx of these Democratic precinct captains many of whom I knew from my activities that I had fought in precincts and so forth--[Uncle] Toms to the bone. And among them was Harold Washington.  And I grabbed Harold. And Harold and I, of course, were long time close friends from school days. Family were friends, like he knew my wife [Eunice Savage] and I knew his wife. Most people don't--I don't know if anybody in Chicago know his wife. But anyway. And I chastised Harold for coming in at the last minute to vote against Willoughby Abner on orders from the Democratic machine. As it turned out, of course, the machine had paid for all their memberships. What they simply did was they bought memberships for all their precinct captains. And at the last minute had them come into the high school auditorium and vote for the other candidate, and defeat Willoughby. And Harold was among them. And that embarrassed him a lot. 'Cause Harold had a lot of racial pride. And he was knowledgeable enough to know that position there was just intolerable. The position he was in. Well things like that over the years had begin to gnaw at him. And he became more and more rebellious. Then he organized the Black Caucus of State Legislators in Springfield [Illinois]. That put him more at odds with the machine.  But he could see the necessity of it.  Because the blacks didn't have any respect down there. So he had that in him all the time. So by '77 [1977], he was in trouble with the machine. In fact, in '76 [1976], I think it was, they put him in jail for tax evasion. He did 45 days out at County Jail.  The machine didn't protect him. So by that time he was ready for a change.  He was really up in arms. And we convinced him to run for mayor. We had no illusions about him winning. But we figured he could do better than did Lemuel Bentley, who ran for city clerk. This time we'd challenged for the top office in the Democratic primary. And that we felt that we could make a sufficiently good showing, that it would encourage people to go further. And so that encouraged some of these automatic victories that came, until for later. And that's how he ran. I managed the campaign and raised the money for him what little we had.  But we surprised them.
Speaker 1: And how many--What was--What percentage did he run by? I mean he didn't win at that time. He didn't win at '77? He came--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No, no. But he--But what he did is to win several of the black wards in the South End where I had my paper, newspapers based and where we had been doing this educational work and political organizing. So he won some of those wards. So for the first time a black won more than a ward.
Speaker 1: And you were involved in his second campaign too. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. But not as much--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Not as much.
Speaker 2: Because I was in office myself at the time. And Lu Palmer had done such--was doing such a great job of leading and strategizing and so forth for that campaign. I was spending much of my time out of the city. I was supportive, but not the key player as I was in '77 [1977].
Story_ID: 12989
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your campaigning, and, you know, your decision to campaign at that time. 'Cause--
Speaker 2: Well in 19--Well after Harold [Washington] ran in '77 [1977], and he beat them. They realized that he had rebelled against them completely, that they would have trouble with him.  They had to get rid of him. So when he came up for reelection in '78 [1978]--See he was a [Illinois] state senator at the time. They went after him. The [Democratic political] machine ran a County to get at him.  A guy named Jim Taylor--Not Jim Taylor himself.  But they had the committeeman.  They had commissioned the committeemen of one of the wards in the district, Englewood ward to run a candidate against Harold. And they did. And they were punishing him.  Because one of the things that they would do whenever a black got out of line, they'd do something to him so he won't become an example that would encourage other blacks to get out of line. They still do that not in so much--Not just in politics. So Harold was losing the election. And something happened that jumped down. Oh boy! He was saved miraculously! I left his office about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and he had given up, thought he had lost. We all thought he had lost.  Because almost all the count was in. And he was several hundred behind. He'd have to get almost every single vote out there left in order to win. So we left and I went on home. And Bennett Johnson was there. Bennett Johnson and myself were with Harold in his office. Harold had his legislative office at the time. And I left. And by the time I got home I had a phone call already from Bennett Johnson telling me to rush back over there. I said, "What? About what?" He said, "We're gonna win it!" I said, "Aw man get out of here." Say, "Come on over I tell you. We're going to win it!" So I got back up.  And went back over to the headquarters.  And sure enough!  He had won.  300 or 400 votes had suddenly fallen down on him from a friend who was a committeeman in the 20th Ward named Cecil Partee, who had held out a few precincts.  To see how much votes [chuckle] Harold needed to save himself.  Since he owed Harold.  Because when Harold organized the black caucus in the state legislature, he supported Cecil Partee to be his first president.  Harold would have been a logical choice.  But when you fight people like he was doing, upstream, you're often better off to have somebody else do the front part of it.  Because you've created so many enemies in doing that.  Including enemies among blacks.  And so Partee got his act cleaned up.  'Cause he was a regular [Uncle] Tom.  Everybody knew him as such.  But by him accepting the Chairmanship of the first black caucus, helped clean up his image.  So he owed Harold.  And he saved Harold.  So then in '90--in '78--later in '78--No wait a minute.  This was--Yeah.  The primary in '78, Ralph Metcalfe had also gotten in trouble with the machine.  And Metcalfe--Harold was Metcalfe's--I mean was Harold's sponsor.  'Cause you gotta be sponsored by a committeeman, in order to be in elected office.  Until I start telling you about the victories we started winning.  And the reason you had to be sponsored by a committeeman, because he had an army of precinct captains who could go work for you.  And he had to select you in accordance with the wishes of the white bosses.  Because he was dependent upon the white bosses for his committeemanship.  See that's a party office, not a public office.  You see.  But Metcalfe had gotten in trouble.  They had dumped [William Levi] Dawson and put Metcalfe in his place.  And a guy named Herbert Odem who was a dentist, Dr. Herbert Odem in the mid '70s [1970s] had suffered police brutality.  The same thing that Reverend Paul Jakes is still fighting today.  That's why I say we're fighting the same battles.  Was mistreated by the police.  He's a prominent citizen. And was one of Metcalfe's staunch supporters financially and otherwise.  He helped organize financial support for him.  Odem though was a dentist and had investments and other things.  So he's fairly well off.  But they abused Odem.  And Metcalfe complained.  He wanted the police to do something about the district where the police had beat him.  And they wouldn't do it.  The political powers that he had served so well, the white powers, would not reprimand the police.  Put Metcalfe in an awful position where he couldn't even defend his staunch supporters.  One who was highly regarded in the black community, was known as his staunchest supporter, outside of professional politics, professional politicians.
Story_ID: 12990
Speaker 1: Oh Harold [Washington]--They tried to get Harold in '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: [Cecil] Partee saved him.  And [Ralph] Metcalfe had gotten in trouble.  Because the police were not responsive to his complaints about the black supporter [Dr. Herbert Odem] that they had abused.  And because he wouldn't shut up, he continued his complaint.  He was persistent.  Too persistent for them, they [the Democratic political machine] decided to dump him.  So the mayor [Richard J. Daley] ran a guy named Ervin France who was a functionary of the city, against him.  And so Metcalfe made a great speech out at Operation PUSH [People United to Serve Humanity] I'll never forget.  It was written by [journalist] Vernon Jarrett.  Where he said, "It's never too late for a Negro to turn black,"  'cause he never could have done anything without him.  'Cause everybody knew that he had led the fight against--'Cause he had been the arch [Uncle] Tom in politics.  But people were so glad that he had--blacks  are always happy if a black who is on the other side gets converted.  And particularly one who is powerful as Metcalfe was.  The most prominent of the black committeemen.  Black political powers.  He had replaced [William Levi] Dawson.  Not fully though.  Because he had not gotten the perks that Dawson had.  And that was also one of his gripes.  When Dawson was Committeeman--I mean Congressman--He was Committeeman also of a ward, the second ward [Chicago, Illinois].  All the other black committeemen who came after him, since the first black committeeman to crack the second ward.  That's down in the inner city of Chicago.  All those committeemen had to go through Dawson to get their patronage.  If you worked for one of them and you wanted a job, he had to go to Dawson to get a job and Dawson would go to the white boss.  In this case Daley, to get an okay for the job.  And then come back to you.  And you would go--you would say go down like that.  Well that went on for a while.  Dawson's had trained a lot of them.  So he was the boss of the straw bosses.  And Daley didn't like that arrangement after Daley got his strength.  Because Dawson elected Daley.  I mean old man [Richard J.] Daley. And they trained him.
Speaker 2: Okay, go on.
Speaker 1: Now I may  be the only one that could you tell this.  'Cause I was the only one involved in all that.  The others can tell you what they heard.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] That's fine.
Speaker 1: But so they challenged Metcalfe.  So Metcalfe had to go out and appeal to Indepedents to support him in order to get reelected.  Because when they ran a challenger to him, they took away his committeemanship in effect.  Even though he was in name the committeeman.  They named a guy named I think it was Clarence Kenner to serve as alderman, and set up a rump third ward Democratic organization.  And made the captains switch to that one so they could beat Metcalfe.  So Metcalfe had no support.  I mean none of the support that had elected him in the past.  So he had to find new support.  And the only other place would be to take advantage of the Indepedent movement that we had built.  So he came to Operation PUSH to appeal for the Indepedents to support him by this phrase that Vernon Jarrett gave him.  And it worked.  The indepedents were more concerned with beating the machine, than who they won it with.  That's why it didn't slow anything down when Charlie Chew sold out.  And Metcalfe won reelection.  In that primary where Harold got saved, '78 [1978].  But then Metcalfe died before the November election.  And if you die before--within 90 days of the election, you don't hold another primary.  The party committeemen in that district have the authority to name who will take your place on the ballot.  And the head of the committeemen was Cecil Partee.  He was the Committeeman of the 20th Ward.  But he was head of all the committeemen.  Now Metcalfe also was estranged from the party at the time, because the arrangement that Dawson had with Daley was not passed on to him, when they used him to stop Dawson.  They never gave him authority over the other committeemen.  In fact, they encouraged a committeeman named Claude W. B. Holman, who was a very outspoken and one of the few of them who was a lawyer.  He challenged Dawson's right to name--to have the power of patronage over the other committeemen.  His argument was that they all were committeemen and they should have equal rights.  They should be able to go to the source the same as Dawson to get what they needed, rather than to go through Dawson.  So when Metcalfe was named to run for Congress and challenged Dawson, Dawson just gave up.  'Cause  he realized that he couldn't win without the machine behind him.  Because what they do with blacks--See what they do with blacks, they would take a black and make that black be so loyal to them, that he'd have to become disloyal to his own people.  And when they do that then, if that black got elected by black support,  it would make that black more dependent upon the white man, the white power for his survival.  And the price of survival would be to be less loyal to your people than you are even, and more loyal to us.  And that becomes a cycle--a spiral downward.  So Metcalfe had no choice then.  He was also angry, as I said, about not having the privilege.  He couldn't do the favors.  For instance, one of Dawson's financial bases was the policy racketeers.  Black policy racketeers.  That's a numbers game we had in Chicago.  And they had the most disposable income.  Because of much of their income they had to hide.  Because if they spent it, the IRS would be on them, 'cause they couldn't explain where they got it.  'Cause it was in such  large amounts, so they could easily give you some money. They couldn't spend it.  But--and--but Dawson in turn protected them from the police.  So the policy business ran openly.  Metcalfe, however, was not given the privilege of protecting these guys.  He was not given the privilege of having veto power of who got named the police commander in the district.  You see.  Dawson had all of that.  So he couldn't protect the people who had financed--partly financed Dawson.  And here he couldn't even keep--to protect the finances he did have--one of the financiers he did have from police abuse even.  And when he protested too long,  and too hard, they run a guy against him.  And he beat the guy.  In the primary.  And so he didn't have to worry about the election in November.  He had won the Democratic Primary except that he died within nine days of the election.
Story_ID: 12991
Speaker 1: So now they have to--the committeemen--black committeemen have to decide who will take his [Ralph Metcalfe's] seat behind all of this stir you see going on.  And the chairman of the committeemen, Cecil Partee again.  Cecil  was trying to maintain the image he had gained, while at the same time not--remaining loyal  to the white power.  So that meant that Cecil was vulnerable to pressure from the Indepedents.  As long as they didn't ask him to break his arm or something.  So we pressured Cecil Partee. We know  we couldn't get him to go  with who we wanted.  But we pressured him to at least hold this election publicly.  The only people who could vote would be the committeemen.  But they would generally interview the candidates.  And we wanted it to be done in public.  So Cecil agreed to hold it in public for the first time.  Ordinarily they would hold--have the committeemen meet in the back office somewhere, and they decide who the candidates are gonna be.  Now we pressed him and got him to agree to hold it at Limited Baptist Church on 48th or 49th and [Martin Luther] King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].  At the time, it was one of the biggest churches on the South Side.  And it was a beautiful new edifice.  We couldn't get him to go with our candidate.  Now you can guess who our candidate would have been.  'Cause it was in the first district.  Harold Washington.  Since he had run for Mayor for us, we owed him.  And even though it survived in '78 [1978] by a razor's edge margin, we're gonna be challenged again.  So he couldn't go back to the [Chicago Democratic] Machine.  He was out there floating.  So we were gonna protect him.  So we pushed for Harold.  But we knew Partee couldn't take Harold.  He had to take who the white folks wanted.  But he agreed with us to at least have the meeting in public.  The person he chose was an alderman from the Chatham area called Bennett Stewart.  Now why Bennett Stewart?  Well when [Richard J.] Daley had died in 1977--'77 or '76 [1976][Daley died December 20, 1976].  Well anyway when Daley died unexpectedly, the same as Harold did with a big heart attack in city hall.  A black guy was the president pro-tem of the [Chicago] city council.  His name was Wilson Frost, lived even further south.  And the rule was that the president pro-tem is the acting mayor until you hold a city council vote and so forth for an interim mayor.  Who would serve then until the regular election date, next election date.  But Wilson Frost was a weak [Uncle] Tom; strong as a committeeman.  Had one of the strongest pro-Democratic wards in the city.  But weak in terms of political convictions let's say, I mean weak, let's say in terms of race loyalty.  So when he went up to take over the mayor's office, they had set the police up there and wouldn't let him in the office  Even though he was the president pro-tem of the council.  So we seized upon the opportunity and mobilized the more Indepedent black leaders and the respected--the most respected of the Indepedent black leaders in the black community to go to  Frost to plead with him to stand up for his right to be Mayor.  Even ju--though temporarily.  You know, temporary mayor.  And that we would mobilize the Indepedent movement behind him.  He was very reluctant.  First of all he was known as such a [Uncle] Tom he figured we could do it.  Well we mobilized him.  And the test became--We organized a meeting for a black mayor that was held in Robert's Motel.  Robert's Motel had a ballroom at the time down on 63rd Street.  We didn't have the money.  So Herman gave us the room.  I shouldn't've told that 'cause he's still alive.  But anyway, that was a test that we were gonna show Frost that we could pack that ballroom, with people who would support him fervently, if he would stand up for mayor.  But now they wouldn't let him in the mayor's office.  But he could stand up at the city council meeting to become interim mayor.  At least stand to make the council vote.  And he had agreed, if we could do what we said.  And we succeeded.  We packed the place.  And it came the time of his appearance and things started and  he hadn't shown.  Nine o'clock and he wasn't there.  The place is packed.  We getting the musicians to play a little music to keep the crowd quiet. And then we'd find somebody to make a speech or something to keep 'em quiet.  Ten o'clock he still hadn't shown.  The press is all downstairs.  We  wouldn't let them up in the ballroom.  But all downstairs in the lobby or the part of the hotel--the registration part where the ballroom is located was the next floor up.  We had guards and they wouldn't let the press come in.  But they were waiting.  So all the press down there waiting.  Eleven o'clock.  Frost still hadn't shown.  The people--a lot of the people we had convinced to come there, didn't believe he was gonna show to start with.  So we really had our reputation on the line.  I was chairing the meeting.  And I was finding all kinds of ways to duck and dodge.  'Cause people were saying, "Is he coming?"  You know, all that kind of stuff.  I finally found him--reached him.  I put out calls and calls and finally reached him.  Got him on the phone.  And he was saying well he was gonna come.  "But they tell me you got the press--" He said, "--all downstairs.  It's packed with the press and so forth."  He was nervous.  But then we--I  persuaded him saying, "Look--But you know, we did our part.  This place is packed."  He said, "Who's there?"  and I started naming some of the prominent people there.  It was very impressive.  So after that, he finally said, "Okay, I'll come.  But I don't wanna come down there with all that press down there."  I said, "I know.  We'll bring you in through the kitchen.  I'll arrange to get you in here.  Just have your guys bring you and tell me what street you're coming in on and  I'll have some people out there to meet you.  And we'll escort you up through the back. You won't see the press."  And he agreed to come.  It wasn't until about midnight before he finally showed.  And the crowd was really getting a little disturbed.  'Cause they didn't believe he was gonna come.  The press was beginning to think he wasn't coming.  And about midnight or so, come in through the kitchen door,.  You know, where they serve the food from in the banquet hall with Wilson Frost.  And the crowd just went up.  You could see it.  They just--they really, you could see it. Wilson showed up.  And I was his archenemy, of course, and I introduced him.  So that just made everybody happy.  'Cause  blacks always wanna see some sign of unity, even if it's not helpful to the cause.  They just like the idea--the concept of unity.  So Wilson came up and spoke.  And said if they--If it was their wish that he would stand, he would stand.  And then left back out that cook--that kitchen door again.  Ah, people were so elated.  We asked a black candidate to stand for mayor.  And a guy from inside the [Democratic political] machine.  Which should give him extra strength perhaps.  Okay so the pressure got to Frost from the machine.  They really, really put the pressure on him and caused him to change his mind.  So he started hiding out from us.  And we got the word that he had changed back.  And  we did everything we could to persuade him.  But he would not stick with his commitment.  So when the city council meeting came where they were gonna vote on an interim mayor, something like what they did with Eugene Sawyer when Harold died.  Their candidate was gonna be a guy named Michael Bilandic.  A nondescript, unknown white guy, not a particular political power.  And that was gonna cause a rebellion.  'Cause the black community by that point was up in arms. Just like they were with Ron--Tim Evans when they put in Sawyer.  To help abate the protest, they sought a black city councilman  to make the nomination of Bilandic.  The attitude in the black community was so strong, it was not easy to find a black alderman at that time.  'Cause we had won some aldermanic seats.  They realized they could be defeated by the indepedents.  It wasn't easy to find one to nominate a white when there's a black councilman who was a senior member of the council at the time incidentally, sitting right there who was the president pro-tem.  Had been embarrassed by not letting him into the mayor's office where he should have been.  That would have really put them in an awkward position.  It was hard  for them to find a black alderman who would nominate Bilandic.  And they didn't want to have a white nominate the white.  That would make it even worse--that would aggravate the protest.  So they finally found one who would stand up in the public glare and turn his back on his own people.  Because the galleries were packed with the black people and every kind of--Just like again with the Sawyer thing.  And the black they found was Bennett Stewart.  So to pay him off, they were gonna give him Metcalfe's seat.  And Partee was obligated to carry out their wishes.  So when I got there,  and I knew Cecil, and because Cecil was--at least you could talk with Cecil sometime.  And he had agreed to hold this public gathering, even though we couldn't vote.  I had found out that Bennett Stewart was the name.  And Harold Washington was gonna be our choice.  So he wanted there not to be maybe even violence at the church.  And, of course, there's nothing about me nonviolent or in my beliefs.  So we got him to agree with the format.  That he would let Harold speak after we would indicate our choice, and then he'd let Bennett Stewart speak.  Or any other candidate for that matter.  It wasn't gonna be no other candidates.  And before they vote--And then they'd vote in public.  He would let one person speak for Harold and one speak for Bennett Stewart.  The people selected me to be the one to speak for Harold.  And we tore that place up.  Everybody was hollering for Harold when we finished.  But they were obligated to vote for Bennett Stewart no matter how the people felt.  They had to do it and they did.  That really, really agitated people.  So Bennett Stewart went into office to succeed  Metcalfe in '78 [1978] as a hostile candidate, being obviously forced upon the black community.
Story_ID: 12992
Speaker 1: That would add to 1980.  you see?  So in 1980,  it was easy to persuade Harold [Washington] to run for [U.S.]Congress.  Because [Bennett] Stewart was so unpopular.  And there was such a new mood developed in the black community as a consequence of that insult.  That's how he won in 1980.  He ran against Bennett Stewart and beat him.  I ran against a white incumbent named Morgan Murphy, who was the son of the president of Commonwealth Edison, who had ten years in Congress.  Well, when the day came to file--your petition for nomination out of Springfield [Illinois], he was there with his petitions.  But he decided at the last minute not to file 'cause the word had come to him that we were gonna beat him up so bad in that district, 'cause the district was over 65, 70 percent black.  And it was gonna be a  bare knuckles campaign, and he wasn't the kind of guy that liked  to get in that kind of bare knuckles fight.  So he decided not to run.  Then they had to find another candidate 'cause that left me.  And they found the superintendent of the principals of the Chicago Vocational High School was a very--at that time a very prestigious high school, and the largest on the South Side, named Reginald Brown, who had come from a family that was well known because his brothers had been athletes in high school and all that kind of  thing.  And he was a loyal member of a white political organization.  Headed then by a committeeman named Ed [Edward] Vrdolyak, who later on became Harold's nemesis.  We beat him.  He was shocked that we beat him.  So they were in trouble.  We had won two districts, the second and the first.  And then that leads up to Harold being elected mayor.
Story_ID: 12993
Speaker 1: Did you use the same strategy that you had used for the others?
Speaker 2: Well no.  Because I was known as an indepedent.  I was never a member of the regular organization.  I was never a professional politician.  I was a professional journalist.  All this stuff I did as a volunteer.  And I had led a lot of other fights in the black community.  School integration on the South end [Chicago, Illinois], and I had to risk my life to save some hostages on a--And it was all on live TV like this.  'Dog Day Afternoon', the movie.  Just like that.  People saw me standing out there and risk my life.  I had gone to jail for blocking police from evicting a black family in subzero weather.  I was threatened with contempt of court for helping the blacks rebel in the bus driver's union that was 80 percent black, but all the leadership was white.  So I had been known for a lot of activities.  So I was the best-known guy in the second district.  Not far.  Far better known than the incumbent congressman.  And I was--had been successful enough in the newspaper business.  So I could campaign full time.  I didn't have to go to work.  And also because in the process of all of this work, and also in my efforts and having talked about economic empowerment, where I helped support a lot of black businesses.  A lot of these black businesses felt obligated to me.  And they helped finance the campaign.  So I was a guy that could raise money outside.  And you could very rarely find a guy who could raise money outside the [Democratic political] machine.  Who had not been a professional politician.  I could raise money.  I could afford to campaign full time, and I was the best-known guy in the district, so.  Plus I had all this experience in electoral politics.  So I had a good idea how you could win.  And so Wesley South, the guy that--If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here.  'Cause I don't do interviews.  But he called and asked me to.  Came to me and asked me, would I run?  And I said, "No, no, no.  I'll just run somebody.  I'll help you with somebody else."  And he pointed out these factors that I just mentioned to you.  And said if we didn't run that time--This is 1980--they would redistrict.  Every ten years you redistrict. And you redistrict the year after the election.  It would be in '81 [1981] they would've redistricted.  And if they-- Here we now have a chance to get a third black congressman for Chicago.  Whereas if we waited and didn't run that time, '81 [1981] they would redistrict.  And when you redistrict,  you redistrict only to favor the incumbent.  So they would probably redrawn the district in such a way to have enough whites included in it, so that this incumbent could remain in office.  So he put it that way.  That here's a chance to get a third black congressman. "And you may be the only guy who can actually beat him."  Then I didn't have much choice.
Speaker 1: Right.  But did that--So you didn't fight the decision at all?  You--That was--? That appealed to you.  I mean 'cause you could've continued just doing what you had been doing all these years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But no.  This appealed to me.  Wesley South who was a--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Appealed to you.
Speaker 2: --who was a--was one with whom I had a close--a very close friend.  Plus in whom I had a lot of respect.  Who'd helped me on the West Side to survive even.  A man of great integrity and courage, had explained why he thought I was the only one who can win.  And if I didn't run, we couldn't get another third black congressman for another 10 years.  That persuaded me, eventually.  You know, he got others to come, Winnetta Barrett and others.  But that convinced me.
Speaker 1: So when you won, were you surprised that you won?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--I thought that I could win.  I just wasn't interested in--I wasn't that interested.  I wanted to keep like I was doing.  As you said.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So let's talk about your congressional career.  Let's talk about that.  'Cause it was a long career.
Speaker 2: Yep.  You know, plus at the time--
Speaker 1: and--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Go on, go on.
Speaker 2: Now I was 54 years old.  I figured they should get a younger person.  But his argument was that a younger person wouldn't be as well known and wouldn't have the credit cards I had at the time to help raise money.  And he was right.  So no.  I wasn't surprised.  I  thought I'd win.  I thought I might win.
Story_ID: 12994
Speaker 1: I just wasn't  that interested in winning.  I wasn't interested in holding no office.  Never was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So let's talk about it--
Speaker 1: That's the reason  why I didn't try to keep it.  Yeah.  I didn't care about the office.  That was never my purpose.  I didn't care about the newspaper business, about my profession as a journalist.  None of that was what I was interested in.  Those were only vehicles for me to do what I wanted to do and make a ma--what I wanted to contribute to that to which I wanted to contribute my life.  What I considered would make my life worthwhile.
Speaker 2: But see let's--You're a person that has been very passionate.  And all I'm saying  is that once you've won, and then the issue is being able to do the--you know, bring home the bacon or do things for your community.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Oh!  That wouldn't've been difficult.  'Cause I'm smarter than most people.  And I have more energy than most people.  I'm in excellent health and in a habit of working 70, 80, 90 hours a week.  So if you--If you were very bright, you're very experienced.  I was a value to most congressmen.  A good student.  I was more studious than most congressmen.  A good organizer, I was a better organizer than most congressmen.  And on and on and on.  You don't have to be a regular organization person or a member of a political party to get things done.  In [U.S.] Congress, people are looking out for their districts. And a racist white out of Mississippi say for instance.  When I was chairman say of the Public Buildings and Grounds, you couldn't name a federal building without going through me.  That little subcommittee had control of all construction and major renovation of buildings for federal use, except for military.  And I was given the subcommittee chairmanship--or pushed for it by the person who won the chairmanship of the full committee when  somebody had died.  Because I had helped him, he owed me.  Once I got that stick in my hand, white folks won't treat you sadly if you have the stick.  White folks treat us as they treat us because they got the power.  You know, generally speaking.  I don't mean all white folks are powerful and no blacks are powerful.  I don't mean that.  But  generally speaking.  And white folks respond to power more than they do their emotions just like anybody else.  So if you were a Mississippi white congressman and you wanted a building named after  the governor when he passed,  because you want to  ingratiate yourself with the project to stay in office, you had to come to me.  And my reputation was such that if you came to me, you knew you had to give up something if you were white.  So I might well say, "Yeah.  I don't see any reason why we can't do that.  But look how you voted--"  I'm  just making this up now--"On that affirmative action amendment that I lost last year.  You voted against me."  And he'd say, "No. Well Gus, I admit that was a mistake.  And I'll tell you this much.  I won't be against you next time."  And I'd say, "Well you've already done me some harm.  You know.  You gotta do more than that.  How many people out there in the Mississippi delegation can you get to vote for so-and-so-and-so in which I'm interested?  How can I verify that you got that commitment and so forth and so on?"  Then I'd name the building--the reason I had the power to name the building, is because the house committee at the time on public works--
Story_ID: 12995
Speaker 1: This is a peculiar authority of a [U.S.] Congressional Committee.  Because it's actually questionable executive authority. That's questionable for the exercise by Congress. The General Services Administration, which is like the government's in-house real estate operation--all these federal courthouses and big office buildings, they handle. They selected the developers. They do all that, alright. Now but they can't build a single building or renovate one, or to rent one of any size unless they get line-by-line approval from the House of Representatives. Not the Congress. Not the [U.S.] Senate, just the House. And you can't get it from the House unless it has passed committees. And the committee of jurisdiction is the Public Works Committee. You can't get it passed by the committee, unless it's a proposal submitted by vote of the subcommittee of jurisdiction. The subcommittee of jurisdiction on the Public Works Committee having to do all these buildings and so forth is the subcommittee called the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. It's not a well-known committee or its authority is not well known.  Because it's not the kind of high profile committee that people often get into. But I could see its potential. And so I told the committee chairman after he'd won, that that's what I wanted. And I had to see Archer to get it.  I just needed more help. But he owed me.  So he did. I got it.  So if you wanted anything. If you wanted a courthouse--When you're a member of Congress, you always wanna show your constituents that you brought something into the district.  So if you brought a big courthouse in there, 25, 30 stories, everybody could see that! That's a monument to you. But the reason you couldn't get that without me is because as I said, it had to come before--It couldn't come before the House before the committee. And it couldn't get before the committee, unless it was passed by the subcommittee. And it couldn't be passed in the subcommittee unless it was on the agenda. And the Chairman had exclusive authority over the agenda. I made the agenda. So you gotta get on the agenda.  If you didn't understand me. And in order to have complete control so they couldn't take one or two Democratic defections--This time it was majority Democrats in the House.  All the committees were majority Democrats. So that it wouldn't get beat by defection of two or three Democrats, I also make a deal with the Republicans on the committee, who were all white on the subcommittee. And they would have what they call the--You have what they call the ranking minority member. Not all the ranking members were Democrats. But then they would be Republicans. See. And so I just get this guy.  When you get a name, the rank and member and take him aside and, "Let's have a discussion.  Now here's how it gonna work. Whatever you want, I'll move forward on it. Whatever you want within reason, you'll have no problem from me. But more importantly since the other Republicans have to come through you to get things done in the subcommittee, when you come with a recommendation you'll have me with you within reason. In return whatever I put on the agenda, you and all the Republicans on the subcommittee must vote for it without question. If you need to cover yourself publicly, you can denounce it and get into a debate and so forth.  But never cast a vote, if it were a deciding vote against me.  Or otherwise you get nothing." It's that simple. It didn't take them long to understand that. After two or three tests they'd say, "Well let's work this thing out." So that's what you do. So that's how I would--That's how I was able to beat Dan Rostenkowski, who was the most vote--Oh, probably the most powerful Democrat in Congress, in Illinois, head of the Illinois Congressional Delegation. Except I was from Illinois and I wasn't beholden to no congressional delegation. Because I didn't owe the Democratic Party for my election. So I got a-- I brought in a third federal office courthouse downtown.  Passed it in '86 [1986],  '87 [1987], two hundred and some million dollars. Made it an economic development project for the blacks by making them take on the highest percentage of black participants they'd ever done, in terms of contracting and employees. And named it after Ralph Metcalfe the first--The only one named after a black. Rostenkowski wanted it named after him. And so the papers said if I'd known anything about politics I'd try to get along better with a Rostenkowski, there'd been no problem. As it is, Rostenkowski has put a stop on it. Well you know what the name of the building is. It's not Rostenkowski. Its name is Metcalfe. I kicked his behind for the same reason. I had enough credit cards out from people who wanted something done out of Public Works that I could get enough votes outside of the Congressional Black Caucus and liberals, who might--would support me anyway. To beat him and I beat him. That's to get things done.
Story_ID: 12996
Speaker 1: For instance in 1991 or '92 [1992], I guess it was, the General Services Administration had under construction--They were at the excavating phase, what was gonna be a twin towered skyscraper in the Battery section of New York City for a federal courthouse. When they start excavating they discovered bones. First they had found a few bones and they figured they'd just throw them aside. Now the government itself doesn't do the construction.  They hire people. They hire a company to let the contractor come and do it. But they found bones and the company just threw them away. But they kept finding bones. Until they--And the more they would dig the more bones they would find, until the word got out, that they were finding bones and throwing them out. And then some black radicals in New York went to check.  And they found that this was actually an African burial ground, African slave burial ground. When you read the average book you wouldn't think that they had slaves in New York.  But they had--White folks had slaves wherever white folks were. So they started protesting. And the protest gained such momentum in Harlem that finally a conservative or moderate like David Dinkins who was mayor, even spoke out and tried to get them to stop what they were doing. It didn't work. They cared nothing about anybody. So without giving a lot of details, it was simple.  What I did, when they appealed to me, is to call the General Service Administration Director.  A guy named Richard Austin, at the time. A Southerner if I'm not mistaken. Old army man, incidentally. And explain to him. I had run up--First I had a hearing. I went up in New York and hold--and held a hearing all day on the subject. And I had community participants and the Regional Director of GSL testified. And the cameras covered it well. And I had made the director wait until everybody else had testified and that peeved him a bit. Because ordinarily, a person in that position they let him testify first so he can go on about his business. Well I made him listen to all the other.  And at the end of the hearing I asked him, would he recommend to the Washington [D.C] office, Austin, that they stop excavation 'til they could work this out to the community's satisfaction.  And he just told me, "No." The television cameras were all running and everything. And I said, "Let me tell you something then. You are an employee of the government no matter how high your rank. I am the government! I'm gonna teach you a lesson." And rapped the gavel and called the hearing to a close. I got back to Washington, called the director and told him, "You need to stop by my office." He was not anxious to stop by.  And tried to get me to tell him on the phone what it was all about and everything.  And I made it clear to him.  I said, " Let me tell you something."  Every year, see they come in with a big book like this filled with what they call prospectuses.  Everything they wanna construct or rent--or renovate has to have a prospectus.  That means a congressional approval to do it.  Line by line.  And they bring a big book like this in the beginning of each term.  And the Director of GSA will come in and sit with you and rub you down and everything.  See if there are any special things that you would like.  And then try to get you to accept his priorities of what he wanted passed and all that kind of business approved.  So they could go ahead with the construction or renovations or leasing.  So I said, "Well let me explain to you.  Until you find time to come and talk to me, you know that--" I've forgotten the particular one.  But I'll give you an example of the type of thing I was saying.  I said, "You know that federal--that building you wanna lease out there in Los Angeles [California] for so-and-so-and-so-and-so, that you've been asking me, 'When is it gonna go on the agenda?'  And you know about--" and I'd name another prospectus.  And I'd call them by the number like "10469 where you wanna do so-and-so down in Virginia or so on--"  And I'd go down the list.  "And you've been bugging me about why--when I'm gonna get it on the agenda?  Because you'd like to get started?  Well let me tell you.  It will never be on the agenda as long as Gus Savage is chairman of that subcommittee.  You understand.  So forget bugging me about that.  That's all over."  Then he changed his attitude.  That's what I mean about white folks are [Uncle] Toms just like blacks if you got a stick.  First he called the chairman of the full committee, a guy named Robert Roe out of New Jersey.  To ask him, "Was that nigger crazy?  He can't hold up all these prospectuses!  Can you talk to him?"  Robert Roe called me that day and said, "Gus!  What's your problem with Dick Austin?"  I said, "What's it to you?"  He said, "Well I'm giving it straight Gus.  He called me to ask could I talk with you.  And I told him, that I could talk with you.  But I could not--I had no control over changing your mind or anything.  So I'm not calling you for that purpose.  I'm just trying to find out if what he is telling me is so."  All that kind of stuff.  I said, "You can find out."  I said,  "I'll tell you what.  As soon as he ever calls me back to try to get--resolve this situation, I'm gonna have him come up to this office, sit down and I'll call you.  And have you come out and sit down and you can hear it then."  And sure enough, he must have called Austin back and said, "You're gonna have to talk to Gus yourself [Laughing].  I can't talk to him."  [unclear] Austin then calls back, and asked me if we could get back--when we could get together.  And I told him, "You better make it soon.  How soon can you get here?"  He said, "Well I'll be--What about tomorrow?"  "Okay."  And we set a time and had Roe down--sit there.  And I read the riot act to him again.  And I told him there will be no--none of these projects will get done as long as I'm chairman of the subcommittee.
Speaker 2: So you found this--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] So he finally agrees-- Well he had to agree.  See in the end he had to agree.  And I said, "That's not all.  Here's what I want you to do.  I want you to stop exca--"  He said, "I agree.  The first thing in the morning--"  I said, "No, no, no.  What time do they finish work today?"  He said, I think it was 4:00 or something.  I said, "It's only 2:30.  Go over on my phone right there and call the general contractor, a guy named Walsh right now.  And tell him to stop excavation.  Call the job site and tell them to lay down the shovels right now, quick!  Today.  Not at 4:00, but right now!"  He was embarrassed.  'Cause he didn't like to be ordered around like that and so forth.  'Cause white folks hate like mad when a black tell 'em what to do, particularly when they had no choice.  So he did. Then I said, "Now there are two other things I need to do."  I said, "Number one:  The remains, most of the bones are still in the ground.  But they stopped--They're gonna stop that."  I said, "But those that have been excavated are being curated by this white university in New York.  I want you to turn the curation of my ancestors' bones over to a black.  There is a well-known anthropologist Dr. Blakely at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], a black institution.  Name him as the curator and Howard University as the depository." He agreed to that.  He said, "What else?"  I said, "Now the other thing is your regional director was a little sassy up in New York the other day.  He needs to understand what I told him.  So what I want you to do is Friday, we both fly up to New York together and hold a press conference.  And you tell them that you have stopped excavation and will not proceed until you have a satisfactory consultation with the community's representatives that I name."  He got to do it.  He agreed.  I called Dave up in New York at the place where the mayor stayed called Gracie Mansion up in New York.  Told him to set up a conference out there at Gracie Mansion, get the press out there. I said, "Mayor [David Dinkins] get the press.  'Cause I'm [unclear]-- They're gonna stop all that digging."  I mean they stopped the digging.  But explain to the commission.  They're gonna determine what happened."  And he did.  But that's how I did it.  Because I had control.  There are blacks in there with far more control than that over even far more important subcommittees.  And some that are chairman of full committees.  But they don't use the power that they have.  And that's true of most blacks.  They don't wanna offend.  Because to get a reputation of not giving a damn about white folks, you--everybody start coming after you and so forth.  And they're more worried about keeping that damn job than serving like they should.
Speaker 2: You know, I want--The other thing I don't think people know of the story  that you just told.
Speaker 1: Oh a lot of people know that.
Speaker 2: But--Ha?
Speaker 1: A lot of people know that.
Speaker 2: The story you just told?
Speaker 1: Oh the one about the African burial ground?  Yeah.  It was all over television in New York.  The American, The American--What was it--It's a commission called the American Heritage Commission or something.  A federal government commission of very prominent people in the--historians over in the field who have a trade journal.  They told the story in the trade journal.  So went all over to people who were interested.
Speaker 2: What about--
Speaker 1: People in New York, the blacks, the leaders up there had me in on more than one occasion to award me for saving the burial ground, all that kind of stuff.  It was well known.
Story_ID: 12997
Speaker 1: What about the [Ralph] Metcalfe--Do people know about you worked on the--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well they had a--I don't think--they couldn't've avoided that.  Because we had--we used press and radio and everything else as a weapon to help beat [Dan] Rostenkowski down. And then when they dedicated the building, they had a great assemblage of every black civic leader they could find and business leader they could find and had them there at the dedication.  And I was the one being honored at the dedication.  I was the main speaker.  And I'm the one on--And I unveiled the plaque for the building for Mrs. Metcalfe, the widow.  She's dead now.  But the widow of Ralph.  So enough--Couldn't hardly miss that.  [former U.S. Congressman Dan] Rostenkowski didn't show.  But the senator then was Alan Dixon.  He showed because he didn't wanna get smeared with this brush.  And it was packed.  All the civic leaders in Chica-- black civic leaders and civil rights leaders and business leaders in Chicago [Illinois] were there.
Story_ID: 12998
Speaker 1: Now the press won't carry [unclear].  Now the white press.  Naturally  now--
Speaker 2: Well you don't expect the white press to carry anything about me.  Since one of my lifelong projects has been castigating of the white press for being racist.  Next to the church, it's the most segregated institution in America.  So I jumped on the white press all the time. And so they would fight me.  And so naturally they wouldn't, you know, cover me fairly or something like that.  They know press lies and stuff.  But if you're gonna take that kind of posture in life, and if your purpose is what I said, claim to be mine, you expect that.  And you don't let it bother you.
Story_ID: 12999
Speaker 1: What other things were you proud of that you accomplished while you were in Congress?
Speaker 2: Oh I passed the largest affirmative action program in the history of this country.  In 1986, I think it was, I successfully amended the Defense Department's budget, to set a 5 percent goal on all its procurement.  And it's procurement was almost $200 million a year that--I mean--Not that $200 million, no.  Almost $200 billion that year.  I think it was $160 something to be exact.  I amended it on the floor in a big floor fight.  And won its adoption through my activities and lobbying in the joint committee with the key help of Ron Dellums who was the ranking black on the committee. I wasn't on the committee.  I did it on the floor.  And [Augustus] Gus Hawkins who was chairman of a powerful committee called Education-Labor at the time, in the joint committee and we buffaloed them.  And made 'em come through with that in order to save the rest of the bill.  So that was the largest in terms of money. The largest affirmative action program for black contractors in the history of this country.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how that came about?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah there's a reported.  Definitely reported.  But not in the white press, the white press--Don't forget now.  See the white--See you probably rely on the white press a lot.  Or the Chicago Defender, which is a mouthpiece almost for them.  They're not gonna publish this.  Because why should they?  If I--
Speaker 1: But I was saying--
Speaker 2: If somebody fought me like I fight them, I sure wouldn't publicize him.
Story_ID: 13000
Speaker 1: I was one of the leaders of the largest peace demonstration in the history of the world, in Lisbon, Portugal in the early '80s [1980s].  An international demonstration of some 400,000 people.  I mobilized almost 200 of the most experienced and able independent black precinct workers in '82  [1982] I guess it was.  Or '81 [1981] or '82.  Took 'em to Mississippi to help break the back of Mississippi's racist politics in the second district there.  Where they never had elected a black congressman.  Even though we lost that--we didn't win that election, we busted up so much, they had to let a black win the next time.
Story_ID: 13001
Speaker 1: There were only maybe five or six or so members of Congress who opposed our attack on Iraq in '91 [1991].  And of those, I think I was the only one who spoke against it on the floor of Congress.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about that a little bit.  'Cause you took a lot of heat on that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's talk about that a little bit. I mean--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't agree with this country's foreign policy in the Middle East.  That's why Jews say that--well not Jews as such 'cause a lot of Jews are not even interested in any of this.  'Cause most Jews are like most blacks, trying to make a living and send their kids to college.  But most of the more prominent leaders of Jewish organizations with their influence in the press, branded me anti-Semitic, because of my position on the Middle East and also my position for affirmative action. Since these Jewish leaders like ADL [Anti-Defamation League] oppose affirmative action.  You know, like the Bakke case and the [unclear] case.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But let's just talk about that whole thing.  Because you were basically saying, "Why should all this money go over--?" You know, "--to Israel?"  That's basically what you were saying.  You know--
Speaker 1: Nah, nah.  Let me be more specific.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were appropriating $3 billion a year, $102 billion in economic development funds and $101--$48 billion in military assistance.  I figured--I considered that that was contrary to the welfare of Israel as I see it.  And certainly contrary to the interest of the Arab people in the Middle East.  And I did that for several reasons.  One is as a black nationalist, I'm pro third world.  And the Palestinians are third world people.  Number two, you can't get, in my estimation and the record began to show it's true, you can't get a peaceful coexistence in an area like that if you tell one party, "I will arm you to the teeth.  I'll prevent your opposition from getting arms.  And if you attack and start losing, I'll guarantee you victory." You do that, that party then has no reason to compromise.  If you and I had a dispute over something here as to--I think it belongs to me.  And you think it belongs to you.  And somebody give me a gun and tell me, they'll assure me that I will not be arrested if I shoot you.  You can forget about talking to me about whatever that is we had the dispute over.  That's mine.  See you can't resolve a dispute that way, that encourages the lack of.  So for that reason, I oppose the military portion of the aid.  That $1.8 billion.  'Cause I said that encourages not only violence in the Middle East, but it insures that the Arabs will not get a fair break.  And I went further with the comment you're probably thinking of.  When I said on the floor in the debate, which was unlucky.  If you got $1.8 billion to give to people--at that time, the citizenry of Israel was maybe like 3.5 million at that time.  It's a lot more now.  And that amounted to something like so many thousands of dollars a year for every man, woman and child and baby over there.  I said, "If you're gonna give that kind of money of our tax dollars to arm a nation in the Middle East, and I represent a district where I have housing foreclosures going on, I wouldn't vote to send one dollar to this foreign nation, until I solve my mortgage foreclosure problem in Roseland in Chicago [Illinois]."  It's simple.
Speaker 2: So when people--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] And then, of course, also when I went over there, I was over there on a congressional mission.  And we had met with the leaders of Israel at the time.  I forgot which one it was.  Maybe Menachem Begin [former Prime Minister of Isreal].  I forgot which one it was.  We met with all of them.  Ariel Sharon too at the time.  But he wasn't leader of the government.  But he was there.  And then we met with leaders of the Arab nation, Syria and Egypt and Jordan, met with King Hussein and King--I mean President Mubarak and Assad [unclear].  And then we went back up and go over back to the [United] States after stopping over in London [England] for a few days of rest. And I told them I wasn't ready to go yet.  I said, "'Cause I wanted--You met with all of these people.  But I'm a former journalist,  I have to hear both sides.  See that's why we met with these others.  The other side from Israel is [Yasser] Arafat.  You haven't met with him."  They said, "Yeah.  But he doesn't have a country."  I said, "I guess not.  They ran him out of what was his country.  But he's housed up in Tunisia, just right outside of Tunis.  You know that.  So I don't know about the rest of these guys.  But I'm going to see him too.  I wanna hear what he has to say.  I've listened to the Zionist leaders speak."  And the chairman was a guy named Lee Hunt out of Indiana at the time.  A pretty liberal guy.  He said--came to me later and said, "You know, the problem with that Gus is that, you know, we don't have authorization to finance that trip."  And I said, "Lee, I got an ass-bucket full of money.  I didn't ask you to finance any damn thing.  What you do is just go over there and make the arrangements with the State Department, and so forth and the Foreign Service to get me there."  He said, "Okay."  'Cause he ain't got no choice.  And then the three Jewish members of the delegation came up and pleaded with me not to go.  I said, "I didn't ask you not to meet with [chuckle]--You gotta be crazy."  So I went and met with Arafat.  That was the time when you're not supposed to--when he was persona non-grata.  They had fired [Andrew] Andy Young from the United Nations for meeting with him.  They had jumped on Jesse [Jackson Sr.] because he had talked to him or something.  Anyway.  I went openly and met with him while he was--just days fortunately before they bombed his barracks in--He was barracked in a former university campus. They  bombed that a few days after I was there.  They bombed it.  So they didn't like that.
Speaker 2: So what was your impression when you met with him?
Speaker 1: Oh America had been lying.  I mean impressive lying.  'Cause at the time--Because I raised some of the questions that the Jewish leaders had raised.  And one of the main questions they were saying, he wouldn't recognize Israel.  He was--They were saying that he would not agree to the right of Israel to exist.  He said, "Absolutely not."  He said he was willing to recognize Israel.  He said all he wanted was if Israel would also recognize their right to nationhood.  He said, "So you can go tell your government that, but your government knows that I'm not against recognizing Israel."  I came back with so much information--it didn't mean nothing.

Speaker 1: Have no illusions.  You're not gonna liberate black people through electoral politics.
Speaker 2: How are you gonna liberate black people then?  What are your--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Well that's a larger question.  We have to deal with that later.  But you're sure not gonna liberate black people through electoral politics.  This system and the Constitution and its laws are not set up to liberate us.  Just the opposite.  Congress is not an institution to liberate blacks.  It's opportune--an institution to maintain white supremacy.  But you can help.  What you can do is--Let me put it this way.  If you had a toothache, you go to a dentist.  And he examines you.  And if he saw that he needed to pull the tooth or fill a cavity, and he'd extract a tooth, or have a root canal done.  All that kind of stuff.  That's a painful procedure.  So painful that they need to deaden your nerves.  Or either you would not let them do it.  Or you couldn't tolerate it for very long.  So they anesthetize you.  You know, they give you--What it's called?  What do they give you?
Speaker 2: Anesthesia.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Novocaine.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Novocaine.
Speaker 1: Novocaine.  Novocaine.  Now the novocaine is important.  Because unless they give you novocaine, they wouldn't be able to treat the tooth.  But novocaine doesn't solve the problem.  If you just took the novocaine.  Say you went in there and they gave you novocaine.  And you were nervous already in the dentist, and you didn't feel any pain.  You said, "I tell you what doctor, let me come back next week to have you do the rest."  He says, "Why is that?  "'Cause I don't feel any pain.  My--I  ain't got nor more toothache."  That's 'cause of that novocaine.  If he said, "Okay."  Well then you really haven't been served.  In fact, you have been fooled.  Because your  tooth would get worse then.  Because  whatever--the bacteria or something would cause the cavity to over--continue to cause it.  If you had some kind of gum ailment or something.  So--But that doesn't mean that novocaine is not helpful.  But only to the extent that it would facilitate the dentist  then being able to solve your problem.  Black leaders in the main are anesthetists.  They're not dentists.  That includes the Congressional Black Caucus.  Jesse Jackson, all of 'em.  They're not  dentists.
Speaker 2: So tell me then--
Speaker 1: They're not--So they're not trying to extricate you  from the situation.  They're trying to make racism more tolerable.  Leading you to better adjust to racism.  But then there are some of us, which is why I was never a politician by profession, that are not satisfied with adjustment to racism.  We want to end racism.  So that means that these offices or being a writer or journalist or whatever you are, is not as satisfying to us as it would be to some others.  Because those are just means to us.
Story_ID: 13003
Speaker 1: So what do you think is necessary to end racism?  Where are you--Here you are.  You've spent--
Speaker 2: Well we don't have time at this late hour now to start talking about that.  That's a two or three hour subject in itself.  Let me just say one thing.  I can tell you.  It should be obvious to anybody what won't do it.  Integration obviously doesn't do it.  That should be obvious.
Speaker 1: Do you think that that is--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I mean I get some things like that.  Even in the best of times, in terms of economics, [President Bill] Clinton would brag about, "Black unemployment is lower than ever."  But what he won't admit is more significantly, that black unemployment is still more than twice white unemployment.  And our oppression is not how well we're doing.  It's how well we're doing compared to others.  We're in the wealthiest country in the world.  So naturally we're the wealthiest slaves.  We're the most educated, the most employed slaves the world has ever known.  Because we live in a wealthy nation that's now the most powerful in the world.  It's the empire--It's the Roman Empire today.  So we have better houses.  We move to the suburbs where we once could not live.  Send your daughter to Brandeis [University, Boston, Massachusetts].  Encourage her to get good enough grades so she can go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Then she can afford to buy a home in the suburbs, out there with white folk.  And better than the  second--I mean the hand-me-down house that your parents got in the city.  And then the white folks take that money that you paid for that house that's their hand-me-down, and they build a house twice as large further out.  And with your payment for that house, they pay for their new one.  So you end up buying them a bigger house.  You can't catch up that way.  And, you know, you cannot expect people who are in power to divide up their power with the powerless and redivide the whole equally.  Nobody that got any sense would do that.  White folks got--I think the last time the figure was 3.5 unemployment, black folks had 8.3 or something.  Who in--got good sense gonna take their 3.5 unemployment and mix it up with your 8 something and then redivide the whole equally.  That's gonna raise their unemployment rate.  The same if you applied it to say business ownership.  You flew here on a plane.  White owned.  You stay in a hotel.  White owned.  Everything you do.  The clothes you got on.  White educated, white dressed.  Where do you live?  What section?  I don't mean your address.  What section of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I live in Logan Square.  See I knew you [Laughing].
Speaker 2: I didn't know that did I?  How I'd know?
Speaker 1: No.  But you knew because you were gonna say my father [Laughing] said--
Speaker 2: No see.  No--
Speaker 1: Go on [Laughing].
Speaker 2: See not only does that corrupt whites, that even--I won't say corrupt.  But moderates the more successful blacks.
Speaker 1: So what is the answer?  And you say you don't have--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] you need dentistry.  You don't need--You don't need more fi--You don't need--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.  Now what--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] more of that Novocaine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Don't [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] You don't need an anesthesist. You need dental surgery.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] But from really from a practical standpoint.  Let's look at [unclear]--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] That's the only standpoint that practical.  What's impractical is the concept of saying, "I got a dream that one day we're going to be integrated.  And where we're gonna be judged by the content of our character rather than the color"--That's what impractical.  Nowhere in the world has that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then what is the answer now?  Because we are--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] What is the answer white Europeans have?  I mean European-Americans have?  They run this country.  Right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is a white country.  Do you know that?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Just--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] But answer.  What--Come on!
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Come on!
Speaker 2: Turn the television set--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No, no, no!
Speaker 2: All the television programs are white.  I mean all the stations.
Speaker 1: I--But wait, wait, wait!  No.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Pick up a news--daily newspaper.  All the daily newspapers are white.  Right here in Washington [D.C.] a majority black population.
Speaker 1: I know.  But can I ask--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] The hotel is white.  The airlines are white.
Speaker 1: I know.  But okay.  That's the--What I'm asking is--Okay.  What I'm asking you is from a practical standpoint okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] The--
Speaker 1: What is your answer as we sit here [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Nah.  What I'm saying--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] I'm not asking--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] What I'm saying--
Speaker 1: you for a diagnosis of--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No, no, no.  What I'm saying here [Laughing] is the hope for integration, which, meaning you go to the white schools and all that kind of business, is the most impractical of all.  'Cause nowhere in the world can you point to that happening.  But the European-Americans who teach you that--That's not the way they did it themselves.  They come into a country, they were minority.  Indians were a majority.  And in most of the South, blacks were a majority over the whites.  They took all kinds--They didn't integrate with the Indians or the blacks.  They didn't go to black schools and say,  "Educate me."

Speaker 1: Before the Civil Rights Movement, the odds of you graduating from Harvard [University] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] was far less than what they were when you attended Harvard.  The chances of you coming out of Harvard were very unlikely.  So without the Civil Rights Movement you wouldn't have a Harvard Law degree.  That's one thing.  Number two, without those credentials, your foundation may not have been able--You may have not knew enough even to get your foundation to be able to attract large contributors who I won't men-- I won't characterize--'cause they're not gonna--See you know what I'm talking about.  Now so one thing is for sure.  That hasn't liberated black people.  And it--And that's not how other people got liberated and liberated themselves.
Story_ID: 13005
Speaker 1: Never did any substantial portion of black income go back to blacks.  Never.  Not even today.  Even less today than 10 years ago.  Because then was it Operation PUSH [People United to Serve Humanity] and other groups were pushing.  I was along with it incidentally.  Promoting and helping black bank--independent banks to succeed.  We were proud of blacks wearing Afro Sheen and Ultra Sheen, and I attended some black baseball games.  'Cause they didn't show any respect for us in white ballgames.  You know, when I was a kid my father [Thomas Savage] would take me.  Out of--Called Old American's Giants Park.  That was the name of the black baseball team, professional baseball team in Chicago [Illinois]. The Chicago American Giants.  And Jesse [Jackson] would contribute by saying that--urging blacks to support black businesses.  You know.  Spend your mo--Let the old double duty dollar concept and so forth.  But now, independent banks are owned by whites.  Johnson Products are owned by whites.  BET [Black Entertainment Television] are now owned by whites.  The American--The professional--You're talking about the people in the stands are more important.  The ownership of black baseball was black in the main.  Blacks don't own any professional teams in any sport.  Though they're bringing all the money by their athletic prowess.  Jesse urged blacks to invest their money in the stock market.  But that's supporting not only white businesses, but the most--the largest of white businesses to be on the stock exchange.  That's all consequence of the--That's the logical extension of the whole concept of integration.  Integration doesn't empower blacks.  Just the opposite.  It makes whites even more powerful.  It does, however, when the country is on the upswing, permit the blacks to do better than say blacks were doing before.  But not better than whites.  But not as good as whites.  And when the downswing comes, just like we saw in the last months' unemployment figures, a slight down turn, white employment remained the same.  Three point whatever it was.  black unemployment went up like 12 or 13%.  And they'll get worse than that.  And blacks have no more power now than they--blacks rioted when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in '69 [1969].  Now they're rioting in Cincinnati [Ohio].  The same thing happened too.  White folks beat them up.  Nothing happened.  Nothing is gonna happen now.  So--Now again, some blacks have benefited in a narrow sense.  As materially.  But, of course, the King Movement was based on middle class blacks.  So its demand--And listen now, I marched with Dr. King.  I was supportive of Dr. King.  Still am.  Okay.  Still am.  Co-sponsored the Dr. King Holiday bill.  But it was based on this black that wanted to adjust to racism, not ending racism.  So it wasn't saying, "Give me Woolworths."  It was saying, "Let me eat at your counter."  It didn't say, "Give me a license to construct a hotel and the money to do it with.  And form a reparation or something."  It said, "Give me the right to stay in your hotel."  That made whites even bigger.  So--And then it said, "Let's go to your school."  That just about destroyed black--historical black colleges.  They praised Jackie Robinson, and that almost destroyed  black major league baseball.  Didn't pay them.  They take a guy from Japan, this boy in from Seattle, the other day.  This great hitter, the outfielder. They paid the Japanese team for taking him.  They didn't pay the blacks when they took Jackie Robinson or anybody else.  They just took him.
Story_ID: 13006
Speaker 1: How do you believe the who reparations issue should be handled?
Speaker 2: Well I don't believe in reparations as it's framed right now.  Because for instance, it's framed now as though what we mean is to give every black family or at least every black family who can prove its lineage.  And I would fall in that category.  I have pictures of my great grandfather.  And then on down.  'Cause I happen to have a long stable family line.  So you--The day they said, "Give all such families and not all families, at least those who can establish their lineage, so much money."  Who was it?  Renault Robinson wrote the book about the debt.  Trying to compute how much we were owed and then he divided by the number of families.  All kind of stuff.  Well don't you know that if you gave $40,000--Say give $40,000 to every black.  Husband and wife make 80.  In a year's time, white folks would have that money right back.  They would be richer and we would not.  Well how would we know?  Ask the average black, "What would you do if you had $80,000?"  And see what they said.  These are some of the things like they'd say:  "Buy me a car that don't break down all the damn time like this one.  Buy my mama a nicer house or buy myself a bigger house.  So I don't have these kids sleeping in one bedroom.  Take myself and my wife on a vacation that we long did not have.  Go on one of these cruises, and buy myself some better looking clothes.  And maybe upgrade my stereo set."  Every one of those would be taking some money and giving it back to white folks.  'Cause that's the source of all of those.  You can't buy that without the white folks.  No blacks wanna make television sets.  Not enough to make clothes.  Most of the bank--Most of the mortgage money come from white sources.  So all that money would go right back.  We would not be any closer to liberation.  We'd be no more powerful.  And we would have received reparations and the whites would've benefited more than us.  That's what's wrong with that.  Our problem is not just the lack of wealth, the lack of education.  All that the white folks try to teach us.  'Cause they want us to spend our time being selfish and trying to figure out a way to make--our children to make more money than we made and have more education than we have.  All that kind of nonsense.  We're already the wealthiest slaves in the world.  The wealthiest slaves the world has ever known.  Our problem is our powerlessness comparatively speaking as compared to whites.  You ever heard that game, when you were a kid--Well I don't know.  I was a child so long ago.  We used to play a game called musical chairs.  You ever heard--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah!  They still do that?  Well I'll be darn.
Speaker 2: In musical chairs, you would have fewer chairs than you would have people.  Now let's say--And this is my last example.  Let's say you got [Laughing]--Let's say you got 10 people, and you have eight chairs.  Two people are gonna be left standing.  If you had seven chairs, three'd be left standing.  And you walk around when the piano hits the certain thing, beat or something.  Or loud sound, you fight for those chairs.  Let's say the white folks have a musical chairs game separate from ours.  Let's say for every 10 whites, you got nine chairs.  And for every 10 blacks, you got six chairs.  And you expect those whites to take the nine and the six to make 15.  And combine the two 10s to make 20.  And have a 20 to 16 chance, when right now they got 10 to 9.  That don't mean they don't like us, or whatever.  It ain't got a thing to do with that.  It's just plain common sense.  Why I know?  It's a zero sum game.  If this young fellow here is running the cameras, then a black not running it.  If a black running it, he wouldn't be running it.  It's a zero--Ain't but so many cameramen jobs.  It's a zero sum game.  So--Which is why it doesn't happen in history.  So reparations would have to deal with the question of equalizing power.  So for instance, one of the first things, you would want in reparations would be land.  Not individually owned land.  Individualism and so forth is another trick of the Euro-Americans to maintain control.  That's why you have--Like when you hear for the United States fighting for a free trade agreement--. Who are they doing it with right now?  Just came out of Canada pushing for a free trade agreement opening markets in the whole Americas.  Well when you got the greatest industrial capacity, the greatest capitalization, the most skilled workers, obviously you can out-compete me if I don't have that.  So Brazil can't compete with the United States.  They don't have that.  So if you say, "Give me open trade.  I'll open my markets and you open yours."  You know who's gonna win out of that, don't you?  You are, not the Brazilians.  'Cause it's zero sum game.  So in reparations, we're not talking about individual land.  'Cause that doesn't serve us.  If you were talking about collective land.  In other words, give us a share of what we built.  Capital formation began with the profits from slavery.  That's the foundation of America's wealth.  The industrial wealth in the North that finally overpowered the South in the Civil War [1861-1865] was based originally on agricultural wealth.  And then they converted it into industrial wealth.  The mercantilism and so forth in history, to protect us with tariffs and so forth, against competition from overseas.  But we--So reparations would have to first of all include our share of what that riches to be had.  Not our share in terms of money.  Like [Richard M.] Nixon once said, "Money is the cheapest thing we got."  If we are 13 percent of the population, then we get 13 percent  of the land.  Do we get 13 percent  of the wealth?  Do we get 13 percent  of the net worth?  They ain't talking about that.  They're talking about giving something they can take right back.  And will take right back.  'Cause you have no choice.

Speaker 1: But what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Liberation of African-Americans, economic independence for Africa and the third world nations, and peace in the world that's enforceable by the present disadvantaged.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: [Laughing] I can't answer.  How do you mean?  In what way?
Speaker 1: What do you wanna be remembered for?  I mean you don't want--you can be remembered for your press clippings?  You could be remember for those things.  You know, where people really knew what you did.  No.  I'm just saying, what do you--Gus Savage wanna be remembered for?
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter about what people know.  Whatever was the value to the world, of this one life.  And when I talk about value of the world, I indicated to you what I thought was the key values.  Liberation for the oppressed, prosperity for the poor, and peace for the world weary.
Speaker 1: And what are your hopes for the black community?  And I want--
Speaker 2: Liberation, liberation, liberation.  That means equality with other nationalities.  Cultural identity, economic sovereignty and political independence.  Self-determination.
