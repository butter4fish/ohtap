Story_ID: 465705
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, Celestine Bevrotte, B-E-V-R-O-T-T-E [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald].
Speaker 1: R-O-T-T--okay.
Speaker 2: I have the, the dates, I have to get them for you but both she and my father were born on September the 23rd, but they were two years apart, but I can get those dates for you.
Speaker 1: So you think she was born what, about 1920 or so?
Speaker 2: Twenty [1920]-something, yeah.  I have it right outside--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I can get it for you.
Speaker 1: All right, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unless you need it now.
Speaker 1: No, where was she born?
Speaker 2: New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family, about the ancestors?  Are there any stories that go way back to 19th century or--?
Speaker 2: Well we have stories that goes back to her father, who's a shoemaker, and the story was that he was from Cuba. We have not traced any of that back for documentation yet.
Speaker 1: Do you have his name?  Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: Charles Bevrotte.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bevrotte sounds French, you know.  I don't know, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I have a little family tree I brought that we did some years ago so I can get that to you before you leave.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the story's that he's from Cuba? (Unclear) Cuba?
Speaker 2: Well, Cuba, Caribbean area, I don't know quite where.
Speaker 1: You know, with a name, it sounds French.
Speaker 2: Bevrotte can be French from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know.  It can be from Haiti or--
Speaker 2: --one of the French settlements, Haiti or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or, okay, so it's not, it's not certain where in the Caribbean?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Martinique, Haiti, it could--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, French.
Speaker 2: It could be any of those, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Now was he considered a Creole--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as such? Okay, yes, I think likely it's Haiti but, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we'll see, okay.
Speaker 2: Probably it is Haiti.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Any stories about--so he came directly over himself from the Caribbean?
Speaker 2: I don't know the story behind it, how he got here, et cetera.  We were in the process of trying to get that information before some of the family members passed but wasn't quite there yet as far as how he got to the U.S.
Story_ID: 465706
Speaker 1: Any stories passed down in the family about Creole culture and what it's about and--
Speaker 2: No stories passed down with the Creole culture.  We never really got into that culture per se.  I understand it's a very rich heritage with the whole Creole culture but we've never sat to, to go through it with our family ties.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Nobody spoke any Creole in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, they did speak that Creole language.  I remember my grandmother, who was one of--I'm saying my grandmother, but my mother's mother died when she was young, so another family member and my grandfather [Charles Bevrotte], the one from the Haiti area, they used to speak a Creole language.  I could remember that very, slightly, back when I was young so they did have a, a few people within the family who spoke that Creole language.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I guess along with it goes the cooking and the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We have a lot of good cooks in the family with the gumbo, the jambalaya and the red beans and rice and the, and the greens, the mustard greens and the white beans and, that has come down through the family quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay, any musicians?
Speaker 2: No musicians in the family.  I had a cousin who, he was a drummer and, but that would be the only musician, per se, that we had in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is it a family tradition on your mother's [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] side, you know, basically here in New Orleans [Louisiana] itself, in the city (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, well, some of the, the family on my mother's side did move to Los Angeles [California], but for the most part, here in the New Orleans area, she had several brothers and a couple of sisters, and the brothers, two of the brothers were brick masons, which is an old Creole culture as well, and tradesmen and they were one of the few brick masonry companies that they owned back then.  I had another uncle who was in the post office and also worked in a bakery at night and baked the best French bread that you could lay eyes on and when he left the bakery, he would drop off a couple of French breads on the front porch of the house.  So we all looked forward to eating the hot French bread in the morning.
Story_ID: 465707
Speaker 1: --Did your mother [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] talk about growing up and going to school?  What neighborhood did she grow up in here?
Speaker 2: In the 7th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was raised by her oldest sister, Thelma Garnier [Thelma Bevrotte Garnier], and--because her mother died at a very young age.  The, the family unit was a very, very tight unit for us.  On my mother's side, for example, she had two sisters and two, three brothers and everybody lived within a three block radius.  We had the two sisters that lived next to each other and we had the two uncles that lived one block away, across from each other and another uncle lived two blocks the opposite direction.  So, our family really grew up together, on my mother's side, and we've had family gatherings every year for most major holidays and we still get together today.  So, and we have a lot of tradition that we do within our family that started on my mother's side and continued.  For example, we just passed Good Friday.  We have a Good Friday feast that was continued throughout my family history, and my brother is the one who picked it up and continued that Good Friday feast.  We would have crawfish bisque and crawfish bisque is, is a, is a dish that takes a lot of time to cook and so we have that once a year.  Not too many people take the time to cook it anymore.  We stuffed the heads, crawfish bodies with stuffing, et cetera and it's delicious but we have crawfish bisque.  We had fried fish.  We have fried oysters, fried shrimp, stuffed crab (background noise), raw oysters, boiled crawfish and we invite the family, all of the family members, and, and close friends and that event has grown to over a hundred people on Good Friday.  So, in the New Orleans [Louisiana] area, you have a lot of families that have Good Friday dinners.  We, we're Catholic, religious, and we, everyone will fast on Friday and so the feast is that after fasting the entire day, not eating anything, everybody sits down at the table and we go for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's been a very rich tradition in our family, and every holiday, for example, the Thanksgiving and the Christmas, I have those two days and, and those two days, again, we invite all the family members from, from both sides of the family and, and have a, a real good, a good time, and that has been a very strong tradition--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in our family.
Story_ID: 465708
Speaker 1: Your mother [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] went, went to school in the 7th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] then too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have a chance to go to college or did she--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no college.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well what high school did she go to?
Speaker 2: I forgot the name of the high school, but it's not in existence anymore--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and it's, it was a high school that was like a McDonogh 35 [McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], but I can sort of get that name for both she and my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] went to the same high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a housewife but had odd jobs and one odd job was that she picked up kids for school, for nursery school.  We had an aunt who, who taught in the nursery school and it was very interesting back then because at one point in history, females were not allowed to be teachers and my mother's sister [Thelma Bevrotte Garnier], who raised her, was a teacher.  So she had to teach in sort of a private setting.  So she and, and a friend, well the friend is Martinez nursery school [Martinez Kindergarten School, New Orleans, Louisiana], is, is a school where a lot of the leadership in New Orleans [Louisiana] attended nursery school, and she was a teacher at that school, at that nursery school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that's a historic place.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I've heard it was founded when there was no kindergarten for black children in the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the city?
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --there's no kindergarten and, and females were not allowed to teach.  So--
Speaker 1: It's founded by a female, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, yep, by Mrs. Martinez herself, Mildred Martinez [Mildred Bernard Martinez].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they had the royalty, you know, the fundraisers with the king and the queen, and the dukes, and the princes and, and maids and it was a big thing in the community back then to be part of that court and there's a real thick book with all of the pictures, which is a real history piece today, and the son tries to continue the legacy and, and also keep in touch with some of the individuals who attended that particular school.  So a lot of our friends attended that school who were start- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well who were some of the, just the names of, some of the names, I mean, you might as well, so--
Speaker 2: Well, like for example, one of our past mayors, Sidney Barthelemy, attended Martinez nursery.  A lot of the judges, that are judges today, and there's quite a few leaders in this community who attended that school and Numa Martinez is the, is the son who continues the school itself and he has a list with, with pride of, of individuals who attended that nursery school back then and it was the premier spot.
Story_ID: 465709
Speaker 1: So my mother [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] really picked up kids and brought them to school and, and brought them home. And it wasn't a formal bus service, but she did it, my uncle did it, as a second job from the post office, et cetera, and that was the way trans- people got around, some transportation, to not only nursery school but elementary school as well because back then, everybody didn't have automobiles to begin with and if you did, you only had one.  It's not like today where you have two and three cars in the family.  You had one car in the family, and so the transportation piece was a very important piece.
Speaker 2: So, so people would use their private cars as kind of like a jitney to--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --for, to raise--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --okay.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, that's exactly what it was.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And they would pay by the week and so that's how my mother earned extra money for the family because my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] was a waiter, and he didn't earn very much, he had another job as well and as a result of that, my mother really had this station wagon.  They didn't have vans back then, they had station wagons and vans became a thing later on in life but the vans--and, by the way, earlier you asked whether we had any musicians, I, I played drums in a band for a short period of time, never really took off with it, but my mother used to transport band members of different high schools to football games and, and things of that nature.  She used to transport the, the instruments and, again, that's parental participation that took place way back in the, in the early days and people used to do things like that and in addition to that, my mother used to make sure that myself, my siblings and all of our friends would have a ride to the extracurricular activities for school, whether it was a school dance, whether we were going to a Mardi Gras parade, or whether we were going to the circus, whether we were going to the park, all of my friends, we used to pile up in this, in this station wagon and we used to have ten, eleven, twelve people in this little small station wagon, but everybody had a ride someplace and so we used to share the little that we had with people in the neighborhood and friends and we didn't, we didn't have much back then.  Matter of fact, we didn't even know we were poor (laughter) and, you know, some of the things that are missing today in helping to, people develop themselves and to develop who they are and, and I think a lot of that hard work back in those days were, you didn't take things for granted, where you had to make things happen.  It was very, very important in the developmental process in, in my life and the lives of my siblings as well and--because everybody pitched in.
Story_ID: 465710
Speaker 1: Everybody had a day to do the dishes and things of that nature.  So, everybody pitched in to do things around the house.  Everybody pitched in to earn a dollar here, a dollar there and we had a lot of fun when we were kids and had to make a lot of things happen, you know.  One interesting story, that all of my friends make reference to as well, I've always had jobs, many jobs.  I always did things to, to earn a little extra money.  I'm talking about twelve years old and, and eleven years old and thirteen years old and we, we, we--my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] used to give us one big present at Christmas because we couldn't afford a whole bunch of stuff, but we'd get little presents as well, but the kids got one big present so we got to choose one big present.  And one year we wanted an 8mm movie projector and, no sound, it's just an 8mm movie projector and the reason we wanted that is because they had a place in downtown New Orleans [Louisiana] where you would go and rent the movies for thirty-five dollars--thirty-five cents a day.  So what we would do, and we lived in a two bedroom shotgun house, that's seven of us, five kids, my mother [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] and my father, and then from time to time, we had relatives to come live with us.  We, we had a grandfather on, on my daddy's side to, to live with us.  We had an aunt to live with us.  We always had some extra people in the household. And I remember when, when I brought my wi- my present wife [Rhesa Ortique McDonald] over to the house for the first time, she looked around, she said, "Damn, where do you all sleep, on the walls?" (Laughter) But, you know, it was very comfortable to us, two bedrooms, it has a living room, shotgun house, you could see straight through, no air conditioning and those things were nice but getting back to the other piece with this 8mm movie projector, we would put a white sheet on the clothesline, and we would enclose it where the kids couldn't see it from the street, and we'd charge people to come see a movie and we would rent the movie at three o'clock on a Saturday because we figured out that it was thirty-five cents a day, but if you rent it on a Saturday, bring it back on a Monday, they only charge you for one day.  So, we used to rent a movie and, and we purchased, over the years, some cartoons, so you'd have a main movie and a cartoon and then we would sell lemonade and cookies and things of that nature.  So, that was our (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So there's no, no sound?
Speaker 1: No sound.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was no sound.  It was just a 8mm movie and you just imagined.  Well, there was, well they had words on the screen--
Speaker 2: Oh, the silent films.  Oh, you'd sell the silent film?
Speaker 1: It was--yeah, there was no sound projector back then.  I mean, this is, this is when, this 8mm stuff first came out, and this is eleven or twelve or something like that, and five years ago a friend, friend and myself, we got together and had a handful of other investors and we built a movie theater.  We built this twelve screen movie theater.  So my friends always remember the, the movie piece that we did on the clothesline and we did a twelve screen digital movie theater just five years ago, so 2003 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: So from childhood, you know, we were in the movie business and to, to adulthood.
Speaker 2: So, entrepreneurs, though--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, and that was just one thing.  I mean, we went around the community and picked up old newspaper, rags, sold that to the junk man, made extra money, go buy a couple of pork chops when we wanted to have a real meal with the, with the red beans because we couldn't afford much meat, but that was our, that was our big, big piece, to be able to go buy a couple of pork chops, thin cut pork chops and have that with the red beans.  That was, that was the king's meal.
Story_ID: 465711
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Alden Joseph McDonald, Sr. [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Same, same as yours?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what is his date, his date is September 23rd as well, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, two years, two years older.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I'll get those dates for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have it right in the office.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he was born here in New Orleans [Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --too? Okay, now what do you know about his ancestors?  How far back can you trace your father's (unclear)?
Speaker 2: His ancestors, he grew up in two families out of wedlock and his, his father was, was in school at the time when he was born, et cetera, and later became a dentist and, but his mother's side, his mother and that family on that side, really raised him and, again, a very modest house and modest neighborhood and we have a number of cousins and stuff back then as well and I, I think on his mother's side, I think those individuals came from Haiti as well because they used to speak some of the language pieces as well.  And so that traces--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's Creole on his maternal grandmother's side?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --mother's, I mean, yeah on his mother's side.
Speaker 2: On his mother's side, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and his father's side wasn't Creole you said, as far as you know?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, it wasn't Creole, he was light-skinned so--
Speaker 1: It's McDonald but you don't, you know, but, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they had some Creole in there some place, I guess.
Story_ID: 465712
Speaker 1: This is when your father's [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] grandfather was a den- dentist you said or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a dentist (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandfather, okay so--
Speaker 2: My father's father--
Speaker 1: --father, yeah, right, okay.
Speaker 2: --was a dentist. But the, he was born prior to him getting into his profession, when he was in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know Andrew Young's father's [Andrew Young, Sr.] a dentist, too, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, as a matter of fact, they were good friends.  Andrew Young's father and my grandfather were best of friends.  As a matter of fact, they lived near each other, and he traveled around, he and his brother.  His brother had a dental lab and, and--he and his wife had the dental lab.  As a matter of fact, that's Grant Hill's mother [Janet Hill], mother's parents--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: Grant Hill, the NBA [National Basketball Association] basketball player, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, and, and his mother married Calvin Hill.
Speaker 1: Right, he's, he was a running back for the Cleveland Browns, went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]--
Speaker 2: Ri- Dallas [Dallas Cowboys], yeah.
Speaker 1: He's with the Browns, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was, okay.
Speaker 1: Dallas, then the Browns--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then he's a, he was a Yale graduate, one of the few Ivy League--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --running backs, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Roger Staubach and, and as a matter of fact we had the, the bridal party, the bachelor party at my house (laughter) when he got married, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, I just remember the Browns part 'cause I'm an Ohio person, see.
Speaker 2: Ohio, okay.
Speaker 1: Most people don't remember he played for the Browns but 'cause that wasn't his highlight of his career, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, his highlight was with Dallas Cowboys--
Speaker 1: Yes sir, yes sir.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and he still works for the Dallas Cowboys, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he had an interesting life as well because he and, and his brother traveled through the State of Louisiana with a travel trailer and set up dental- dentistry in different small towns and communities.  So they would travel and stop in various towns and they would have their appointments and people would get their dental work done and so he did that for a long period of time.
Speaker 1: So, did you, did you know him fairly well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I quote him all the time because he used to, well I mean, you know, we're all family, so we got together during the holidays as well and I used to do odd jobs around the house, around the office to earn extra money and my sister used to travel with him to Mexico because he used to travel to Mexico a lot and he spoke fluent Spanish and did work down there and stay in Mexico for a couple of months at a time but I remember he told me and maybe I'm sixteen or seventeen at the time and I, I used what he told me and taught me way back then that 97 percent of the people in the world are honest, so don't make the rules because of the 3 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Make the rules for the 97 percent who are honest people, honest working people; they will not beat you out of money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's before I even got to the banking business.  So I remembered that very clearly and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah that you remembered it is significant and, you know--
Speaker 2: It was very significant.
Story_ID: 465713
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talking about your father's [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] side of the family and you were saying that your grandfather had a traveling dental truck and he traveled (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, dental trailer.
Speaker 1: --around Louisiana and actually went to Mexico and did some dentistry too.
Speaker 2: Did some dentistry there as well and he used to go to Mexico several times, a couple times a year.
Speaker 1: Well, where did he go, go to dental school?  Did he go to Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] or, or--?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I'm, it had to be either Howard--I don't think Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] had a dental school back then so it probably had to be Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I would imagine.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I need to look that up.  I, I don't know that.
Speaker 1: So your father was raised primarily by his mother, though, right?
Speaker 2: His mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, matter of fact, I, I pulled out some, some family history from one of the, one of the family reunions on my daddy's mother's side, which was the Cavalier family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joseph Cavalier--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was his grandfather, and he was a waiter at the Boston Club, when he was fourteen as well, and my daddy was a waiter at the Boston Club ever since he was fourteen, and I really didn't realize that piece until recently.
Speaker 1: Okay, they both had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the Boston Club is, is a, is an old private club here in New Orleans [Louisiana] with a lot of the well-to-do folk, yeah, in the community.  So, he worked there since he was fourteen, until he died.  Well, prior to his death, he took sick for a few years but that's where he worked all of his life, et cetera and he was very proud to be the waiter.  He considered himself to be the best waiter in town, and he used to preach to us that we could be whatever we want to be and whatever that was, just be the best at it and that was something that he instilled in all of us and he took a lot of pride in, in his profession and he was known to be the best waiter in town.  Prominent families in town would schedule a party or an event around the time that he was available.  He was on the cover of one of the social magazines here, in his waiter outfit, et cetera.  He, he was the waiter of choice to, to bring the toasting of the king and queen of Mardi Gras here, and a ladder was placed next to the float at the Boston Club where the king of Rex and the queen of Rex and, and the queen of Comus toast on Mardi Gras day, which was, which is still a highlight today of Mardi Gras, King Rex toasting, and he would be all proud on that ladder with the, the champagne toast, to, to the king and queen of Carnival.
Story_ID: 465714
Speaker 1: You know, a waiter doesn't have a big salary, he [McDonald's father, Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] must have done all right with tips and probably food and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it wasn't a big salary at all.  As a matter of fact, we, we scuffled.  When he stopped working, which is maybe a total of--I want to say ten years, twelve years ago, he was only making $16,000, and this is 2008. And he had no pension, no retirement and so he worked all of his life as a waiter and with tips, and they didn't have tips on the job because it was a private club.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they, they couldn't even tip him there?
Speaker 2: They, they did not tip at the private club, but a lot of these members had him to work at their homes for private parties, and that's where he would make his tips and the extra money. And they had an event once a year, about two weeks prior to Christmas, and they had an all-night party and--at the club, and he'd come home with a lot of money, so he had a lot of tips, and that was the Christmas money, that was the money that he used for the Christmas gifts and he would come home, six, seven o'clock that morning from working all night.  He'd come home and we just remember that, he would just take the money and throw it on the bed (laughter) and it was a big scene for all of us because that was a large amount of money that, that he would receive each year, and it was tips.  I mean, you know it was like a few thousand dollars.  It wasn't a few hundred dollars, it was a few thousand dollars back then, so, we could remember that very clearly as, as kids, and that was the money that carried us through Christmas.
Speaker 1: So, but it was pretty lean, though, most of the time because of that, that salary being so low?
Speaker 2: Salary was very low--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --and he had to, sometimes he worked two extra jobs at night.  He would go on the job maybe at five o'clock and another one at nine o'clock.  So he would get two parties in and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he worked during the day and they could do the part- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And at night.
Speaker 1: --the parties at night?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had, he spent a lot of Sundays with us, and we had--we used to go to the park all of the time, to the zoo and to the park and picnics.  We had, he had some of his friends, et cetera, the families used to get together on the lakefront, or in City Park [New Orleans, Louisiana] and, and have picnics and fly kites and do the baseball and stuff like that.

Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald and Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: There was a story, but I don't quite remember.
Speaker 1: Did they grow up in the same neighborhood [7th Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: They grew up in the same neighborhood, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Attend the same church?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they really met at school, I believe it was, at school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they go to the same church?
Speaker 2: No, they went to the same school.  They lived in two different communities.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Two different communities.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now when you think about your parents' personalities and talents and dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: A combination of both.  Both of them were hard workers.  The work ethic, all of us got our work ethic from both of them.  I mean, my dad worked day and night, my mom worked as a housewife, did the little extra jobs picking up kids. She was always on the go and always doing things for other people.  And so, we picked up different things from, from both of the parents.  My mother had a heavy influence simply because we spent more time with her but the giving part was both of them.  I mean, we didn't have much but both my mother and my father, they would give people things if they, they needed something.  They were the first ones to reach out and, and, and give, and we didn't have anything to give.  I mean we would give hand-me-down clothes, we would get hand-me-down clothes.  We shared clothes with relatives, but it was always on a giving end, and that has, a lot of that we learned from both of our parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the activities, the, the, the family activities.  Both sides of the family were very strong with family and as a result of that today, we still have strong family ties and, and it's something that was inherited.  It's something that was taught.  It was something that we lived, and I'm happy today to even see my kids [Heidi McDonald Smith, Alden J. McDonald III, and Todd McDonald] living that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, how many?
Speaker 2: Two brothers [Byron McDonald and Aaron McDonald] and two sisters [Rhonda McDonald White and Deborah McDonald Wilson].
Speaker 1: And where do you fall in the--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 465716
Speaker 1: Give us an idea of what the neighborhood was like.  You said you all had, had a kind of a shotgun house and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --well what was, what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in the 7th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all they had quite a few rental properties.  People in our neighborhood, not too many people owned property and we lived down the street, who is my best friend today, his father was a bricklayer as well and had a company, he was a brick mason, and I remember when they bought the--when television first came out, and they had this little bitty, nine inch television, television screen.  Everybody used to go and, and sit at the house every Saturday and watch the cartoons.  We, all the kids in the neighborhood, we played kick the can, we played football, in the street, and the whole neighborhood gang enjoyed each other, families enjoyed each other.  Everybody in the neighborhood knew everybody.
Speaker 1: Now was it mostly Creole neighborhood as such?
Speaker 2: It's a mixed neighborhood but a lot of Creole neighborhood down in the 7th Ward had a lot of Creoles but it was pretty well mixed, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In terms of, you know--
Speaker 2: --no, no, very, very few people of means.
Speaker 1: Okay, but by mix you mean, I was asking, I guess--
Speaker 2: Non-Creole.
Speaker 1: --it's like, non-Creoles and Creoles, basically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --black people, basically?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: African Americans.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, but no white people--
Speaker 2: But the neighborhood itself, no white people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the white grocery store owner (laughter).
Speaker 1: The business, entrepreneur?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the entrepreneur.  As a matter of fact we had three grocery stores a block apart in different directions, and they were all owned by white people and--
Speaker 1: Were they mostly Jewish people in those days or, or did it make a difference (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, maybe one was Jewish but the other was Caucasian, Italian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Italian, so, a lot of the Italians owned the grocery stores.  One sort of specialized in the meat, meat market, and the other one had a grocery store and a barroom.  So the adults used to go down to the barroom and, and drink a beer and socialize but those were the businesses in the neighborhood.  Had a couple of cleaners, a couple of black people did own cleaners.  My grandfather [Charles Bevrotte] on my mother's [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] side had the shoe repair shop, in the back shed, behind the house that they were living in and he had his machinery.  I remember these big long machines that, and the sewing machines to sew the shoes and show the--sew the leather purses and things of that nature.  And so, a lot of the, a lot of the transactions were, were done and the merchants were done in the back of the homes, little sheds that were built to accommodate the different businesses.  A couple of people in the community were seamstress, sewed for Mardi Gras clubs, kings and queens.  So we had a mixture of a lot of things in the neighborhood, but the most important thing and the most important thing I remember is that for blocks, everybody knew each other.  Everybody was in and out of everybody's house.  If you did something wrong, by the time you got home, your parents knew about it and everybody respected everybody.
Story_ID: 465717
Speaker 1: Yeah we had the little neighborhood brawls like kids would have but for the most part, everybody got along extremely well.
Speaker 2: I know when we interviewed Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], who's, who's older than you by, you know, maybe a dozen years or so, he talked about fighting, he and his brother [HistoryMaker Dr. Walter Young] having to fight every day at school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was that, was that part of your experience?
Speaker 1: Well, we had some fights because what happened was, during my elementary and junior high school [Rivers Frederick Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], they had a change in the districts.  So they had a merging of some schools, the junior high schools, which was from two different parts of town, and I remember I used to get beat up a lot and one time I got fed up with it so I was in industrial arts class, and I picked up a board and started swinging it (laughter).  They threw me out of school for a little while, but I had to defend myself and got my butt beat a number of times after that 'cause of what I'd done, et cetera, as far as defending myself, but yeah, you had the neighborhood pieces that we used to get into but I wasn't, I was always on the receiving end, not the giving end so I was receiving the blows, not giving the blows.
Speaker 2: So it was pretty, still rough when you were coming along--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was rough (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in terms of, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know, the other thing too in the community is that the thugs, if you want to call them that, the thugs kept the younger people straight, would not permit us to do things the wrong way and these were individuals who, you know, just by word of mouth and the family said it, you know, this individual's been to prison or he's been to jail and those individuals used to really police the community, police the neighborhood [7th Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana] and keep the young people from getting into trouble and they used to break up the fights that we would have because of some argument and kept everything straight.  So we had a, we had a support system within the neighborhood that was also very, very important.
Speaker 2: So kind of a paternal terrorism (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: --in some way.
Speaker 1: What was your personality like when you were growing up?  I mean, what, what were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was very shy, very shy, very reserved.  We didn't have much so I wasn't the flashy dresser.  You know, we had clothes from wherever we got it from.  So, sort of reserved and didn't begin to flourish until, you know, my adult life.
Story_ID: 465718
Speaker 1: Okay, you--but you said you always had a job when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Always had a job--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --always had a job.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) An- and you said the community [in New Orleans, Louisiana] was close.  Was there any, were there any savings clubs or any, I mean, there were no black banks, I know that, but how did people handle their money?  I mean, in retrospect, since you're a banker now, what did you, what did, how did people handle their money in those days?
Speaker 2: We had piggy banks back then (laughter).  People used to just save their money, and I remember a metal box and the metal box had different slots in it for different coin and dollar bills and most people didn't have bank accounts back then.  I remember I had to, you know, my mother [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] would drive me to this finance company so that they'd make the payment on the loan that they made because banks didn't lend to black people back then.  So, very, very few black people had bank accounts and were welcomed in banks.  I was the first African American to be hired by a bank in State of Louisiana, 1966.  So we had no idea as to what happened in a bank.  I mean we knew that people went to the bank, but we felt that people who went to the bank were people with money, and we didn't have any money so we didn't have a bank account and my family used finance companies to, to bridge the gap in the income.  So if my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] would go to the finance company and borrow money for back to school clothes, borrow a couple of dollars, a hundred dollars, two hundred dollars for the Easter clothes and Christmas.  So, we'd get new clothes at Christmas and Easter and school, back to school, so that's when we made the purchase of the clothing for the most part.  So he would go to the finance company, borrow a couple dollars, $100, $150 in order to achieve that.
Speaker 1: So, so the Creole community didn't, I mean, or your family even didn't like pool money together to help each other do things?  I mean, you know, not just your immediately family but the extended family, they never really pooled their money to do anything significant, like, you know, you hear that immigrant families now come over and do that--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) not the Creoles, the immigrants, they've been here a long time but they didn't have the culture to try and put them in--
Speaker 2: No, none of the family members really had money to pool.  I mean, most of the family members, my family members, made it from, barely made it from paycheck to paycheck and they would pool money to help each other for a down payment on an automobile because the transportation, again, was used to transport kids.  Now, out of my mother's family of three boys and two girls, five of 'em, three of them drove station wagons and brought kids to school.  So, in order to get into that, you know, we had to borrow from each other, my family had to borrow from each other for the down payment for the car.  Sometimes you had to pool money to pay for the insurance when the insurance was due, pool money from that point of view but not for any ventures, per se.  My parents didn't own the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is an example of collective, you know, doing something with the money, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, let me, let me say this.  If somebody in the family needed something, we, we, the family came together and provided.  So, from that point of view, yes.  I mean, pooled resources to make things work.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And if--
Speaker 1: --savings outside of a piggybank or a tin box or something like that was pretty much not known in--
Speaker 2: Right.  I had an aunt [Thelma Bevrotte Garnier], that's the one who raised my mother, she had a bank account because her husband [Herman Garnier] was a supervisor in the housing projects.  So that was considered a real good job back then as well.  So they had a few dollars and they had a bank account, but my uncles who were in the business, masonry business, they had a bank account because they had to pay by check but outside of that, no experience.  So, people who had a business had a bank account, per se.
Story_ID: 465719
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: A little neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: Oh, the nursery school, that's the first one.  It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nursery school, right.
Speaker 1: --Martinez--
Speaker 2: Martinez.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Martinez nursery school [Martinez Kindergarten School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: And then I went to Epiphany Catholic School [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Epiphany Catholic School.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And then, then I transferred to Valena C. Jones [Valena C. Jones Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now, now, so when were you, when did you transfer to Valena C. Jones?
Speaker 2: I'd have to get the years, probably in the third grade or something like that--
Speaker 1: Okay, about third grade.
Speaker 2: --third, fourth grade, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's where, that, yeah, that's where--
Speaker 2: That went from a, from the Catholic school to a public school, Valena C. Jones was a public school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's where [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young went to school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And quite a few other people we've interviewed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Valena C., I mean (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lived on the other side of the track.  He lived in the area--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where we said the rich people live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Sugar Hill [Gentilly, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Valena C. Jones school--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then to Rivers Frederick [Rivers Frederick Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 1: Rivers--
Speaker 2: Frederick.
Speaker 1: --Frederick.
Speaker 2: That was a junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went a couple of years to Xavier Prep High School [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and then--
Speaker 1: Is that associated with Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, it's run by the same order of nuns--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --but that's about it.  And then Joseph S. Clark High School [Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] for two years.
Speaker 1: Joseph F. Clark (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) S, S--
Speaker 1: S. Clark.
Speaker 2: --like in Sam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that Clark with an E or--?
Speaker 2: C-L-A-R-K, without the E.
Speaker 1: --K, okay, all right.  Clark High School, okay.  Is that where you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Clark?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And when'd you come out in what s- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Matter of fact, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Came out in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960]? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 465720
Speaker 1: Matter of fact, you know at the end of the year, I'll never forget this as well.  The homeroom teacher went around the room talking about who would be what.
Speaker 2: And what grade is this now?
Speaker 1: This is in twelfth grade.
Speaker 2: Twelfth grade, okay.
Speaker 1: Graduate from high school, and I'll never forget, when he got to me, he told me I was the most likely not to succeed.
Speaker 2: Now why would he say that?  What's--
Speaker 1: I don't know but it stuck with me for a long time.
Speaker 2: Now that seems like a mean thing to say to a twelfth grader.  I mean, how are your grades?  Did you have good grades?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I, I, I was struggling in school.  I struggled through school.
Speaker 2: Now it's an all-black school, right, pretty much?
Speaker 1: Yeah, all black school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't because of your race you're saying that so.
Speaker 1: --I wasn't, I was, no, I was just an average student, not, didn't have good study habits, so I struggled and--
Speaker 2: Did you ever consider dropping out of high school or did you want to drop out?
Speaker 1: Never thought about dropping out of high school but wanted to, at least, finish.  Thought I would be a mail carrier or a brick mason, that's what I thought I would be in life.
Speaker 2: And he said you were the least likely to succeed--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of anybody in the class?  Now that's really a dramatic--
Speaker 1: It was brutal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was brutal.
Speaker 2: Well how did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was very embarrassed and I mean, he had a couple of others in the same ballpark so I wasn't the only one he told that to and maybe he was going around talking about, you know, that this one here will be great in life and this one here and not so much, so he was doing some of it in fun too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Cracking the facking [ph.], as they, as they say (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so, well was there any teacher or mentor that you met along the way, either in school or, or in some program that was a role model for you or tried to help you specifically?
Speaker 1: Well, you know back in both junior high [Rivers Frederick Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and high school, the coaches played a very, very important part in the lives of people--
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: --students.
Speaker 2: So were you an athlete (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and so the coaches sort of propped people up, helped them overcome different obstacles that they may have and did whatever they could.  I was not an athlete so I didn't have a close relationship but they had a couple of coaches that maybe felt sorry for me, so to speak, and, and tried helping me out and I shouldn't say that, maybe they thought I was a nice kid and so they would try to help me when I struggled but it wasn't until I attended college and didn't finish and then went to a business school after a couple of years and that's where I met an instructor [Melvin Jones], as a matter of fact I went to see him yesterday in the hospital, he's not doing well, and this individual worked in the post office and was also an instructor at, at this business school, Straight Business School [New Orleans, Louisiana] was the name of it, and this individual is the individual who really brought me around, brought my personality out, brought my abilities out, gave me a confidence level that was second to none and really, it was two of 'em, and really got the best out of me and as a result of that, I couldn't get accounting.  I mean, I just, I struggled with accounting and they simplified it for me and I'm very good in accounting.  Very few people are better than me in accounting.  I mean, that's how well I know the, the subject matter now and just my confidence level in itself just brought me to a whole another level and so that's when I began to blossom.
Speaker 2: Okay, you graduated in '60 [1960]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --from Clark High School [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then you went to, to college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I attended Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] for a while.
Speaker 2: Xavier, okay.  So you were at Xavier but you didn't do too well when you were there, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then in addition to that, keep in mind, you know, my family was struggling.  They, they couldn't really afford the college.  They couldn't really afford the private schools, I'm bouncing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was Straight- I'm sorry, it was Straight school of business that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Straight.
Speaker 2: --you, and about what year were you there?
Speaker 1: I'd have to go back and check that so--
Speaker 2: Was it--
Speaker 1: --sixty-three [1963]-ish.
Story_ID: 465721
Speaker 1: Straight Business School [New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all right, so that's, that's where you, you actually found some mentors to really--
Speaker 2: Yes, found mentors and, and found my confidence level, I mean, brought it all out.
Speaker 1: Now why bu- business?  I mean, what was the process that you decided that business was going to be where you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if you take a look at my childhood, I mean, I was in all sorts of business.  I mean, I sprayed houses for roaches, I taught driving.  Matter of fact, I had my driver's license very early in life and I used to drive the family car different places, and I utilized that to teach other people how to drive so I made a few extra dollars doing that.  I picked up the old newspaper and things of that nature.  I was always doing something.  I--at one point, I was working in a record store, helping this guy with his books, with the little bookkeeping I knew, prior to, I've done a lot of things.  So, the, the business part, I guess, was just a natural thing for me and when I did attend college, I attended as a major in accounting.  So, for some reason, I gravitated to, to the business side of things not knowing what I would end up doing and my, my first job after that, I was offered a couple of jobs in government, in bookkeeping, accounting, and I ended up at the Michoud Space Facility [sic. Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans, Louisiana] working for Chrysler Corporation [FCA US LLC].
Speaker 1: Now Michoud Space Facility, okay, why, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Michoud, M-I-C-H-O-U-D.
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they do the booster for the space shuttle.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now this is in what 1960--'63 [1963], '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Maybe '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Sixty-four [1964], '65 [1965]-ish.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I want to say, yeah, '64 [1964], '65 [1965]-ish.
Speaker 1: So you consider this your first professional job as such?
Speaker 2: That's my first job with a paycheck.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I have the stub of that paycheck.  I think I still have that one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) The first job with a paycheck.
Speaker 2: Or did it get caught in the, in the storm.  I don't know whether I got caught in the storm or not.  I might still have that one.
Story_ID: 465722
Speaker 1: When I was in high school [Joseph S. Clark High School; Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], I also participated in the civil rights demonstrations. And I might have been thirteen, something like that, and I'll never forget, came home and, and my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] found out that I was picketing this department store and I was very young so I was sort of like a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What store was it, I'm sorry?  What--
Speaker 1: Kaufmann's department store on Dryades Street [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: This is with a K?
Speaker 1: Kaufmann, K-A-U--I think it was K-A-U-F-M-A-N [sic.], it might have been two Fs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was the department store where blacks went and bought clothes and stuff like that and this is during the Civil Rights Movement where equal jobs and all this kind of stuff and my dad found out and my dad was angry.  He said, "Boy, you're going to get me fired.  People going to see you in the newspaper, you can't do that." And I was adamant about doing it and I said, "Well I'll be careful, I'll make sure, you know, that I'm not--," I said but, you know, we got to do this.  And so they had a few of us on the young side, but we were picketing with the CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] leaders, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] back then.
Speaker 2: It's Congress of Racial Equality, CORE, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Congress, right, um-hm, and I'll never forget the owner of the store came out and offered the group some ice cold Coca-Colas.  The guy from CORE said to him, he said, "Mr. So and So, if I were you I'd keep that," he said, "because when we finish with you, you're going to need every dollar that you can find," and refused the Cokes.
Speaker 2: The major complaint was no blacks worked there or--?
Speaker 1: No blacks, they didn't have any black cashiers, you know, stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Just the menial jobs--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --stock and janitor and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, and that's where we spent all of our money.  So, that was the beginning of trying to get some equality and, you know, when we were coming up, we had a colored window and a white window, colored water fountain, white water fountain, no bathrooms to go to.  I mean, so, when, when you moved around town, you had to understand where you can go for a comfort station or a restroom facility because you couldn't really use the facilities at any of the public places, I mean, even as a waiter because I did some wait service with my dad at night and at homes and things like that and they had, they had a separate restroom for the workers.  You still see some of that in the homes today, the antebellum homes today, and even if you went out to buy something to eat on the way home, you had to go to a service window.  You couldn't even go inside of the sandwich shop of the establishment.
Speaker 2: So this is going on throughout your high school days and--
Speaker 1: And elementary school, yeah, because you see, my dad used to work at night so we'd go pick him up from the job at night, everybody's in their pajamas.  So he'd call when he's finished working.  So, eleven o'clock, sometimes twelve o'clock, we would get in the car, my mom [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] would put us all in the car in the pajamas, some of us will continue sleeping in the back.  We used to put, yeah--
Speaker 2: So she wouldn't leave you at home by yourself?
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: She'd just take you all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we went every place in that station wagon and the station wagon was a, was a bed for many a nights.
Speaker 2: What kind did you have?  Do you remember what kind of wagon?
Speaker 1: It was a Chevrolet was the first one, Chevrolet and it was green.
Speaker 2: Like a '50 [1950]-something model, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was back then, yeah, green Chevrolet.  So, you know, it wasn't new, it was used initially.
Story_ID: 465723
Speaker 1: But a lot of memories in that green station wagon.
Speaker 2: Now I didn't ask you about this but, you know, there's so much musical culture here in New Orleans [Louisiana], growing up, do you remember like Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint and all that music was, was, was becoming super popular when you, when you were coming--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in your teenage years.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I know that, those, that's the age when rock and roll was here.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, Fats Domino's brother married one of my daddy's [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] relatives (laughter) and Joe Domino [Joseph Domino] was his name, so, I remember when we used to go over there, Fats Domino would be there sometimes as well but so we have part of that in the family, I guess.
Speaker 2: Joe Domino, so--
Speaker 1: Joe Domino is Fats Domino's brother.
Speaker 2: Okay, so his real name is Domino?  It's not a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not a stage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's the real name.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  We don't know around the rest of the world.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's his real name.
Speaker 2: You hear somebody that we don't know if it's really--
Speaker 1: No, it's his real name.
Speaker 2: Domino sounds so colorful, we, it could be fake but it's his real name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, real name.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: What about Allen Toussaint?  Did you know anything?
Speaker 1: Allen Toussaint, yeah, I didn't know him well but did know him, be in his company from time to time and, you know, [HistoryMaker] Irma Thomas, and a number of--Ernie K-Doe.  Matter of fact, his wife [Antoinette K-Doe] has this bar on Claiborne [Avenue] and this bar [Mother-in-Law Lounge, New Orleans, Louisiana] has a lot of his memorabilia in it and it's a neighborhood bar and it's painted all on the outside and from time to time, he'll, she'll put a mannequin out there dressed like Ernie K-Doe (laughter) sitting on a barstool.
Speaker 2: Well, that's New Orleans--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --culture.
Speaker 1: I mean I'm talking about today.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about back then, today, so, you know, a lot of these musicians we used to see around and there's--
Speaker 2: Now it's just surprising, you know, I was raised in Ohio but a lot of the music we got on 45 was inspired by, it was actually Fats Domino or Allen Toussaint's songs and stuff that we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tou- 45s--here, ours was 78 initially.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people would, okay.
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight, then 45.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then cassettes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but a lot of those songs, a lot of the music had its roots in New Orleans and a lot of--
Speaker 1: A lot of, a lot of the songs were written here in New Orleans and recorded in New Orleans.  A lot of the musicians came here and, and recorded music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that song, (singing)--all that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  'Blueberry Hill' and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: And it was recorded in an old antiquated studio.  I mean, nothing really plush, but a lot of recording took place and they had the deejays in the radio, Larry McKinley, 'Larry and Frank,' the 'The Larry and Frank Show' that was on the radio and those individuals used to promote a lot of musical concerts and a lot of people would come to town to record.  There'd be guests on the radio station.
Speaker 2: Was there a sense when you were growing up that, that a lot of this music, new rock and roll was coming out of New Orleans?  I mean, did you have a sense of it?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) Didn't realize.  I mean it was, didn't realize the significance of it at the time.  I mean it was just normal for us to know that so and so was in town recording, not that it was in the newspaper or anything, it was just word of mouth and we just thought it was just a normal piece.
Speaker 2: And going back even further, was there, did you know any of the relatives of Louis Armstrong or any, or him or--?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not much at all.  They, and here again, everybody knew of Louis Armstrong and we knew physicians, you know, from the neighborhood who played in those bands but back then, he was not, you know, recognized as the great musician (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sidney Bechet and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, he's another great one.  A lot of, King Oliver, I guess from--
Speaker 1: King Oliver, La La [Prince La La; Lawrence Nelson], right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, anyway just a great (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) La La Morgan [sic. Oliver Morgan]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --et cetera, um-hm, yep.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of tradition down here in music.
Speaker 1: A lot of tradition.
Speaker 2: I thought I'd raise that on some level.
Story_ID: 465724
Speaker 1: You were raised in Cath- Catholic church, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Catholic church (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, so, okay.  That's mostly, the Creole population is Catholic down here, I know.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, a lot of the town, a lot of New Orleans [Louisiana] is Catholic and probably has one of the largest pop- Catholic populations in the country.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And at one point it was close to 70 percent Catholic.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a high percentage for any town.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably the highest.  Well, back to bu- so we got you out of Straight Business School [New Orleans, Louisiana], you got your first job and a paycheck at, at Michoud, Michoud space company [Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Michoud.
Speaker 1: Michoud, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Michoud space company, and you were doing accounting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Accounting work over there.
Speaker 1: Accounting, okay.
Speaker 2: And then, again, the whole civil rights piece, et cetera.  Matter of fact, part of the family on my mother's [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald] side is the Chapitals and the Chapitals were big in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Now Chapitals are like a krewe?  Is that, what is that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that's a family name.
Speaker 1: Family name, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's a family name but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell that now?
Speaker 2: C-H-A-P-I-T-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the Chapitals were very, very big in the NAACP and the whole Civil Rights Movement.  So we had a couple of relatives in there and he was working at the Michoud complex and the lack of promotions for black folks there were, was very evident so they began talking with management, et cetera, and nothing happened.  So we signed a petition and we signed what was called a circular petition so nobody can say that an individual was first and started the trouble.  So, everybody signed it circular, a circular fashion, so nobody was first and that eventually went up to Washington [D.C.] for discrimination charges but in the meantime my dad [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] came home from one of the jobs and said, "These two individuals that I worked this party for last night asked me if I knew of any black people that wanted to work in the banking industry because they want to open a new bank, and they're going to hire black people." And he said, "Do you know of anybody?"  I said, "I don't know," I said, "I might be interested in working part-time." Again, penny jobs. And so I, I contacted one of the individuals and they put me in touch with the people who were doing the hiring, and this new bank that was going to open up, called the International City Bank [International City Bank and Trust Company; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], and they were scheduled to open January 11th, 1966 and they were going to have banking hours, which was unheard of at the time, nine to nine, Monday through Saturdays, nine P.M.--nine A.M. to nine P.M., Monday through Saturdays.  So they had to hire staff to cover all of those hours, so they were hiring part-time people, and I was initially hired to work in the accounting area, in the bookkeeping area in the backroom, and I'd get off my other job at 3:30, and then go to the banking job for four o'clock and work that 'til maybe ten o'clock at night because the bank was new, had a lot of work to do and it was very successful in opening, you know, with record deposits and things of that nature and that bank grew so fast they needed people to do different things.  So I worked various departments in that bank because they needed bodies to, to, to get things done.
Story_ID: 465725
Speaker 1: That was in January of 1966, and by July of 1966 they asked me to come on full-time in the auditing department, and I thought about it and we were going through this discrimination charge over at the Chrysler Corporation [FCA US LLC], Michoud Assembly Facility [New Orleans, Louisiana], and I said, well, I don't know what's going to come out of this over here, I don't know what type of career I'm going to end up with, this looks like an opportunity, I was treated very well, et cetera.  So I went ahead as a full-time employee of the bank. And because the bank was growing so fast, they just needed people to do different things.  So every time there was a project, every time there was a problem, I would be assigned to the project, I would be assigned to the problem, to either clean it up, fix it, put some systems in place, et cetera, and I would work twelve, fourteen hours a day 'cause I was learning everything that I possibly could.  Now I enjoyed what I was doing, and I was promoted, one after the other, and by 1972 I was a vice president of a bank and--
Speaker 2: Is this the--still International City Bank [International City Bank and Trust Company; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I was vice president prior to 1972, but 1972 is when Liberty [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] opened and [HistoryMaker] Norman Francis--. Well the thing is, I mean, I was doing a little bit of everything at the bank.  I mean, I was lending money, I was marketing the bank, I was in the audit area, I worked--
Speaker 2: So, so were you the highest ranking African American banking official in town?
Speaker 1: In the state.
Speaker 2: In the state, okay.
Speaker 1: In the state.  I was the first banking officer in the State of Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was the first black bank officer in the State of Louisiana.
Speaker 2: When would that be, like sixty--
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], okay.
Speaker 1: Well, '67 [1967] maybe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], I'm sorry, '66 [1966] because I was, I wasn't even an officer when I came on board.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], about '67 [1967], maybe it was a year.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1967.
Speaker 1: But I was promoted to different areas of the bank.  I got involved with a lot of the--they had a holding company, as a matter of fact, this bank is the bank that created the certificate of deposit.  This bank was the first bank in the United States to, to have an ATM machine [automated teller machine].  We, we got the first ATM machine off the assembly line in the country.  So this bank--
Speaker 2: Was that, was that from the NCR [National Cash Register; NCR Corporation] or--
Speaker 1: No, that was from, it wasn't NCR.  I remember the, Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation], it was the old Burroughs company.  This bank created the interest on checking account which is called the NOW account [negotiable order of withdrawal account] today, but we called it something else because we had to get around the law 'cause it was, you couldn't pay interest on, on a checking account, so we had a checking and a savings component.  So I was the director of that when it first came about so they put me in charge of that to get it going, put the systems in place.  It had problems in the loan department, they sent me to the loan department, clean it up.  I didn't know anything about loans, but I learned all of that in the process.
Story_ID: 465726
Speaker 1: And in 1972, [HistoryMaker] Norman Francis came and visited with me and he asked me, he said, "We're putting this bank together."  He said, "And we certainly would like you to be part of it." I turned him down three times.  I had only been in banking for six years and he finally convinced me.  My office was in the basement of the bank, and he finally convinced me that it's something that I might want to take a look at.  So at the age of twenty-nine I was a bank president, I was the youngest bank president in the State of Louisiana as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And from that, just a whole lot of things happened in life.  We became a very successful bank and, again, a lot of it is attributed to the hard work that my parents [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald and Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] had influenced myself and my siblings with, to do hard work to, you could do anything you want to do, just be the best at it, treat people the way you want people to treat you. And all of these things during my upbringing I applied in my everyday life on the job, at work and, you know, if you give to people, people will give back to you and the more you give, the more you receive--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as--
Speaker 2: Well can you tell us like, who besides Dr. Francis was involved in the establishment of Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: C.C. DeJoie [C.C. DeJoie, Jr.], who was a guy who owned the local newspaper [The Louisiana Weekly], Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial], they had couple of white guys on the board as well, couple of black physicians, a guy on the funeral home, the leadership.  Matter of fact, you know, it's really interesting because no matter where you go in America, the board members of most, if not all minority banks, makes up the black leadership of those communities. And back then, the bank was started in order to give black people an equal footing, equal access to money, equal access to economics. And those founders in black banks across the country did not look at the investment to make them rich or to, for that investment to be worth a lot of money; they did it for the good of the community.
Story_ID: 465727
Speaker 1: When you take a look at history again, and take a look at the contribution of black banking, going back to Madam C.J. Walker, who's the first female president in our country, black or white, she opened up a bank [sic.].  Take a look at the bank in Nashville [Citizens Savings Bank and Trust Company, Nashville, Tennessee], 1918 [sic.], look at the bank in South Carolina, different places in America, mechanics and farmers out of North Carolina, these banks survived the Depression [Great Depression]. And I later learned in life that there was a branch of the Freedman's Bank [New Orleans Bank of the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company] opened here in New Orleans [Louisiana] in 1872.  Liberty [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] was opened one hundred years later in 1972 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's something, that's, yeah.  The Freedman's Bank was a, well, yes--
Speaker 1: The Freedman's Bank was chartered by [U.S.] Congress--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in order to provide banking services for slaves and Negroes, back then.  So when you really began to look at history--. History is very, very interesting and I was a terrible student in history, didn't understand it, didn't know anything about it so my adult life I began looking into different things and found history to be very, very exciting and as a result of that, Sybil Morial [Sybil Haydel Morial] and I, we formed a group and put the African American museum at the World's Fair that was here in 1984 [1984 Louisiana World Exposition, New Orleans, Louisiana], and we dug out a lot of history for the State of Louisiana and we found that there were a significant number of blacks in the state legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] back in 1800s.  The first black elected to Congress was from Louisiana, but was refused his seat.  We had a black lieutenant governor, we had two black lieutenant governors, we had a black that was chairman of the Republican Party in the 1800s.
Speaker 2: O.J. Dunn [Oscar J. Dunn] and some- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --Pinchback [P.B.S. Pinchback].
Speaker 1: We had a black state treasurer, black state superintendent of education.  When you really go back and dig out history, you really, it's, it's amazing, it's very interesting and our history wasn't told.  None of this was in the history books for us.  So, as I grew and became an adult and became in position to begin exposing some of this history to our people, our community, that's where my love really lies today and to developing history and to document history for those of us who came behind.
Story_ID: 465728
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Freedman's Bank [Freedman's Savings and Trust Company].  Now we were discussing off-camera that it wasn't a development bank like South Shore [South Shore Bank; ShoreBank] in Chicago [Illinois] but it, but you took a lot of risks with small businesses and homeowners and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, the Freedman's Bank that was chartered by [U.S.] Congress was, was the, the vehicle to lend slaves and ex-slaves money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was talking about Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana], not Freedman's.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: You see I, I got, I say, oh he's giving me an answer about Freedman's Bank but Liberty Bank--
Speaker 2: That's what you asked.
Speaker 1: --is your bank and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Liberty Bank.  We got started in 1972 and the mission was to, to make available to our community, to the black community, financial services that were not necessarily available to the entire community.  So back when we started in 1972, most black people dealt with a credit union that was in a church or something of that nature or a school or finance companies.  So when the bank was formed, the bank was formed with the idea and the understanding that we were going to have financial services available to people who the regular banks ignored and didn't serve, and as a result of that, we came out of the shoot in November of 1972, October of 1972, it was a branch that was in November of 1972. October of 1972, and started in a trailer, in a mobile trailer that was parked on a lot that was later our main office, and we had a very successful opening.  The community wrapped their arms around us and supported us greatly.  We had the mayor [Moon Landrieu], the governor [Edwin Edwards], all of the elected officials, the union, the community as a whole.  We had a great, great opening that really brought new life to the, to our community as far as banking services are concerned, as far as loans are concerned.
Speaker 1: Now, now was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People didn't have to go to finance companies anymore.  They were able to come to a commercial bank and get a loan at a decent interest rate.
Story_ID: 465729
Speaker 1: Now was Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] the mayor of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dutch Morial--no, he wasn't the mayor at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dutch Morial was an attorney at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He later became mayor, but he was one of the--
Speaker 1: When you mentioned the mayor's support, I--
Speaker 2: --he was one of the original--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --board members and one of the original founders--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the bank and we moved ahead and built our first branch in 1974.  Again, I was president and CEO at the age of twenty-nine.  If I was to try some of the stuff I tried then, I'd probably go under but because of the energy that we had, because of the faith that we had in people, we did a lot of things that was out of the ordinary.  And so we built our first branch in 1974--that was a big hit as well.  And that particular branch bank, we, we, we take that development in a City of New Orleans [Louisiana] and that's when the other banks began hiring branch managers, black branch managers to run their branches.  We, we, the first branch that we opened was in the Gentilly area [New Orleans, Louisiana].  They had a couple of black people working as tellers, this is in 1974, but they had no black branch managers in the City of New Orleans working for major banks and when we opened that branch, that's when the three, two of the three banks began looking at and promoting blacks to management and officer positions in, in the banks surrounding our branch. And every community we've entered into, the same thing happened, whether it was in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], et cetera, when we opened up in a community, it changed the landscape, it changed the economics--
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it changed the way people thought and, and really opened up a lot of job positions that blacks were not in at the time.
Speaker 1: And we're talking about a city with a lot of black clout, 66 percent of the New Orleans I think is black.
Speaker 2: That, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: We, we did not hold a lot of political positions at the time.  That was in the beginning of moving toward the whole political piece.  I think Dutch Morial might have been in the state legislature [Louisiana State Legislature] back then, or if not shortly after that [sic.] but, and then the black political clout came about.  We would fund and we would loan groups of individuals money to fund a candidate, a black candidate, to run for political office.  So, it was a matter of pooling money and helping to move the black community to another level in politics, to another level in economics and economic development.  We loaned money to an individual to get into the offshore business providing services to the oil companies and we're not quite sure but we think it was the first black person to own crew boats and supply boats to supply the oil rigs in Louisiana for sure.  So, we did a lot of things that were not heard of, and, and a lot of emphasis in a lot of different directions.
Story_ID: 465730
Speaker 1: The one piece that gave us direction as well is that when I was with the International City Bank [International City Bank and Trust Company; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], I recalled when I went to buy a house, I didn't know I was going to buy a house, matter of fact I was embarrassed and shamed into buying a house.  One of my friends, the father of one of my friends was selling real estate on the side and he said, "Man, I have this great house for sale," he said, "and you need a house," and this is before I became president of the bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Make a long story short, I was too embarrassed to tell anybody I didn't have any money to buy a house, didn't know how to buy a house because my parents [Celestine Bevrotte McDonald and Alden J. McDonald, Sr.] didn't own a house, I didn't even know how to go about buying a house and he said--this house was $32,000.  This is a three bedroom, two and a half bath house, a fireplace, both in the living room, dining room, patio, I mean, great house, but I was too embarrassed to say I couldn't afford it, didn't know it, et cetera.  So he said, "Well make me an offer."  So, the, the house was in the thirties so I offered him $18,000, thinking that they would not accept it.  Well this person was being transferred out of town.  So they accepted my offer and the company picked up (laughter) the difference.  So I went to my boss, I said, "Remus [Remus A. Hebert]," I said, "Man," he said, I said, I said, "I signed a contract to buy a house, and I don't have any money, I don't know what to do."  He said, "Do you want to buy it?"  I said, "Yeah."  I said, "Can I afford it?"  He said, "I'm sure you can."  He said, "We'll make it work."  He said, "Do you have any bills you want to consolidate?"  I said, "Yeah, I can do that too."  He said, "How much?"  I told him how much.  He said, "Do you need any renovation money to fix up the house, paint the--?" "Yeah, I could use a little bit of that." So, he put this package together for me to buy a house with no money down.  I didn't even know that you could do that and as a result of that, I wanted everybody that I knew to be able to buy a house.  So when I became president of the bank, I said to myself, and I said to the board, we're going to change the way business is done in this community.  So we began lending money to people to buy a house and one thing led to another, et cetera, and our bank was very well received within the community because we helped a lot of people, not only get out of debt but to buy a house, to go into business and things that they never had the opportunity to do and the bank continued to grow and we continued to do different things in the community.
Story_ID: 465731
Speaker 1: The political community grew as a result of the bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] because now they had money available where they could pay for a political campaign and run and win political offices.  We, we financed a lot of the political campaigns, even Dutch Morial's [Ernest Morial] run for mayor, but we also financed his run for the House of Representatives [Louisiana House of Representatives], judgeships, all of these things, our particular institution was very, very instrumental in helping to make happen.  So, this is what minority banking is about and has been about in our community, back in the 1800s and the 1900s and still today in the year 2000 plus.  Our banks form the basis for economic development and to make things happen.  In addition to that, leadership comes out of these community banks and help formulate new policies in the community.  I've served on just about every board and commission in our community.  Our board members serve on just about every board and commission.  Our staff members, the officers of the bank, we have it as a policy that they're to serve on a minimum of two community boards and commissions because we feel it's very, very important to bring the whole economic development factor, the whole factor about minority banking into policy change and I like to view myself and my career in banking as a change agent.  We've been very supportive and very instrumental in changing policy that affects the quality of life for the African American community and--whether it's education, whether it was on crime, whether it was on politics, whether it's economic development, we've played a major role.  This institution has played a major role in changing policy.  Just recently, I presently sit on a special task force appointed by the chairman of the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] out of Washington, D.C.  It was our task force that began raising the issuance of prime lending over a year ago when nobody was paying attention to it.  We saw it coming and we rang the bell and there are many issues today that we need to change policy on and that is the credit bureau, the credit scores that affects the lives of thousands and millions of people and it affects how much you pay for insurance.  It affects whether or not you get a job, but yet that is unregulated and credit history is placed on an individual's account haphazardly, and that's the next policy change we're looking to make in this country, and we're pushing that issue.  So, when you take a look at minority banking, when you take a look at our community banks, it's super important for the community to be extremely supportive of minority banking because we create jobs, we create businesses.  It's not farfetched for your son, your daughter, your grandson, your great-grandchildren to become president of a bank.
Story_ID: 465732
Speaker 1: When I was coming up, when I was growing up, I had no idea that I would be in the banking business today. None.  I was the first African American to, to enter into the LSU School of Banking [Graduate School of Banking at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  So there are many doors that we have opened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, well just, just--yeah, just so on that note, now, you went to LSU School of Banking and there's some other educational things--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that you've done too in terms of just bolstering your own--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --capacity to do this--
Speaker 1: Well, you, you never stop learning, you never stop learning and--
Speaker 2: About what year did you go to LSU School of Banking?
Speaker 1: LSU School of Banking in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay, 1974, okay and--
Speaker 1: Maybe '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay, and, okay.  So you, and you attended the Columbia University's [Columbia University, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) commercial banking management program?
Speaker 1: --right, um-hm, right, and that was about, that was about '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976], okay.
Story_ID: 465733
Speaker 1: Black Enterprise rated Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] as number, the number three black bank in the country prior to Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  I don't know where it is now, but you had assets of nearly $400 million--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then so all of a sudden this hurricane comes and blows down your, some of your branches and sc- stalls your ATMs [automated teller machine] and disrupts, people need money and can't get it, I mean, this is 2004.
Speaker 2: Two thousand and five [2005].
Speaker 1: Five [2005], okay, when Katrina hit.
Speaker 2: August 29th, 2005.
Speaker 1: That's the day that nobody around here forgets, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Katrina came through here and we were operating the bank in three different cities: New Orleans [Louisiana]; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Jackson, Mississippi.  We had grown the bank to almost $400 million, thirteen locations in three different cities and we had been recognized throughout the country in many circles as far as the success of the bank and overnight, August 29th, 2005, Katrina hit the City of New Orleans and literally drowned the bank.  We were the hardest hit financial institution in the area.  No other bank received the type of blow we did.  Our operation center was completely underwater.  We lost all of our records, all of our files, all of our collateral files, all of our credit files.  Our computer center was knocked out because they had no power, no communication lines.
Speaker 1: Now, now just to put it in perspective, we're in the headquarters now the six--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a six-story, modern, glass instilled [ph.] building, the entire first floor was underwater from what I understand.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: I mean you could see some of it still downstairs.
Speaker 2: Right, that's correct.  The, and we had an operation center, that was a one-story building, about a mile away, but our computer center was on the third floor, we had generators, the whole bit, but with the water coming, the federal government seized all of the fuel so the fuel that we had for our generator, they seized all of the fuel to use for boats and rescue and, and helicopters and things, and trucks that were going through neighborhoods rescuing people, et cetera.  So, in addition to that, just picture an entire city losing all of its communication lines.  You had no telephone, no cellphones, no electricity, no water, no gas, all of the basic services needed to live was no longer available, overnight.  It's hard for one to imagine that you had none of this available to you.  So, we practice every year for a hurricane, and we sent four different backup tapes out, two with human beings and two by Federal Express [FedEx].  So four tapes went out in four different directions.  The water came, everybody knew that they were supposed to report to our Baton Rouge office once things settled down, and we had no tapes to be found.  So eventually, I evacuated to Atlanta, Georgia, stayed with some friends, looked at the TV, looked at the water rising and really the, the feeling that, that came upon me at this time was something that's indescribable because I worked all of these years to build this institution and overnight it's gone, the people are gone, my customer base is gone.  So, I had a decision to make, a very, very hard decision as to what to do.
Story_ID: 465734
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sixty years old plus, how do I rebuild this bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana], can I rebuild it? So the good Lord told me, get off your duff, a lot of people are depending on you, you get back in there and you build this piece.  So, we, we went to our site in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], began rebuilding the bank back, and none of our customers could contact us because we had no communications.  So they eventually got to call us by various means.  We had the media to tell people where we were, et cetera and we began helping people to survive.  We had to lend people money just to buy the essentials of life, to go buy a bed, go buy clothing, go buy sheets, towels. In order for them to rent an apartment we had to advance them money.  I left with my family with four pair of underwear, two pair of pants and I lost everything else.  So, I experienced what others experienced.  I go back to my childhood, my survival days, and people of color, we survive because we have survival in our blood.  We survive in the worst economic times in the history of our country.  We survived through slavery, and all of that's in our genes.  So it wasn't a question as to whether or not we were going to survive, we were in banking before they had PCs [personal computer].  We were in banking when a lot of this work was done manually and our staff pulled together and began putting the pieces back.
Speaker 2: Now how did, how did people get their money?  You said they couldn't go to the ATM [automated teller machine] and get it around here, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) People came into the bank.  People drove from Texas.  People drove from Tennessee.
Speaker 2: To Baton Rouge?
Speaker 1: To Baton Rouge.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We wired money to people all over the country.  We didn't have the computers working for the first week so we were giving and letting people withdraw money based on the honesty.  I went back to what my [paternal] grandfather told me, make the rules for 97 percent of the people because 97 percent of the people in the country are honest.  So people came in and wanted to cash a check.  We didn't know whether or not we had money in the bank for that account or not.  We went ahead and we did it.  People needed money, needed to borrow money.
Story_ID: 465735
Speaker 1: Interesting story.  Lady called from Houston, Texas, and--we had only four telephone lines--and this lady wanted to open an account from Houston, Texas, and the staff told her, "I'm sorry, we don't open accounts over the phone, you have to come in."  She said, "Well, I need to speak to the president because my girlfriend had an account with Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] and your bank is the only bank helping people out during this time period, and I want to bank with a bank that will let me take money out when I don't have money in the bank."  So I, it caught me and I just moved back and I said, what is going on here?  And what had happened is that we forgot to change some specs, and when you're offline, there's a certain amount of money you could take out of the bank and you don't know it.  Well, we didn't change these specs so people were able to take out a thousand dollars a day, whether they had money or not.  So, people were just using their check card and their ATM [automated teller machine] card and when we found this out, we put some controls in place to limit the amount of loss that we had.  We did lose some money, but we helped a lot of people survive.  We helped a lot of people get some of the necessary things in life that was absolutely needed for this worst disaster in the history of the country and our bank, even today, is helping to rebuild the City of New Orleans [Louisiana].  We put a loan program together in conjunction with the City of New Orleans when the state and the federal money wasn't here yet, they're still trying to figure out how to do it.  We loaned money in the meantime to people who wanted to rebuild their house, we called it the New Orleans Fast Track Road Home [One New Orleans Road Home Fast Track] program, and we loaned money to people who had bad credit scores, people who were sincere about bringing their family back, rebuilding their homes and that happened over a year ago and to date, we haven't lost one dime and these were people that perhaps couldn't get credit pre-Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] at other financial institutions.  So this institution, again, pre-Katrina, was doing things to help people improve the quality of life, helping the community grow economically, helping to change policy for quality life issues, helping to change policy for education and with the worst disaster in this country, we still continue to help people rebuild today and we're doing things that other financial institutions are not doing.  We're getting ready to start another new program where we're going to go door to door now and put programs together, financial programs, to help people rebuild and we're going to help create new programs, with the city, with the state and hopefully the federal government to bridge the gap for the people who need that extra help.  So we're going to be very aggressive, we're change agents.  We've been change agents for the thirty-five years that we've been in business, we're going to continue to be change agents, and we're going to continue to change the community in which we live in because through economic development, we could change the world.
Story_ID: 465736
Speaker 1: Fortune magazine recognized you as one of the, several, you know, strong leaders, I think, in two thousand--was it 2006, 2007?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 2006, 2007 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I think they, they said that you had your most profitable year, you know, after the disaster.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that seems, some people would scratch their heads say, how could this happen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we've been in business for thirty-five years.  We only lost money five years that we've been in business, out of thirty-five years, three years was during the Louisiana oil bust years, 1987, '88 [1988] and '89 [1989].  Sixty percent of the financial institutions in the State of Louisiana failed.  We were one of ten community banks, we were the--two of us, two out of the ten survived the oil crisis, the oil bust in '87 [1987], '88 [1988] and '89 [1989], that's three lost years, when 60 percent of the financial institutions failed, all of the banks collectively lost money for those three years.  Another year when we tried something new, a new program, we lost $250,000, was the fourth year of loss.  The fifth year of loss was Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], the year of Katrina.  The year after Katrina, in 2006, we had the most profitable year in the history of our company.  We were listed as the twentieth most profitable bank on return on equity in the country, not just at the minority banking community, in the country, the twentieth best performing return on equity bank in the country, 2007 exceeded 2006.  We had to put a whole new business model in place after Katrina.  You know, the Lord works in mysterious ways.  Something pushed us in a whole another direction.  This whole business model changed, but the bottom line is, we're still helping people.  We changed our business model to continue helping people and to stretch out and to do different things.  In 2008, in 2009, we are formulating two community development corporation entities, which will put us in a whole new direction.  We talked about development banks early on.  This is going to be development banking without the assistance of government.  We're going to go in and we're going to begin rebuilding not only this community but other communities in which we have a footprint.  So we are staffing up differently, we are looking in putting different products in place to go into different neighborhoods and rebuild the commercial structure, the businesses, the homes, we're going to start here in New Orleans [Louisiana].  In 2008, we just finished hiring some staff in order to do that.  We're putting the printed material together and I can guarantee you, in 2008, 2009, it's going to be a whole 'nother chapter in Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] in changing things and making things work for people.
Story_ID: 465737
Speaker 1: Well I want to ask you about your involvement in, in boards and, and other activities that are related to banking but not necessarily ba- banking.  Tell us about your medical and hospital board work.
Speaker 2: Well, at the beginning of my banking career, we started assisting medical doctors, people in the medical field of gaining an economic foothold.  These were professionals but yet had no place to turn for financing of their homes, their business practices, et cetera, so I got very much involved in the medical community, financed a lot of doctors and opening offices, et cetera and began identifying different issues in the community involving medicine and healthcare and as a result of that, there was a black hospital called Flint-Goodridge Hospital [New Orleans, Louisiana] and Flint-Goodridge Hospital was, has, had a huge history.  Here, it was owned by Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] and was not a separate entity, it was still part of Dillard University and Dillard University had a nursing school.  They developed nurses in, for the marketplace, et cetera.  To make a long story short, the black hospital was scuffling and, and really having a hard time surviving and I was on the board of Tulane University medical school [Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana] at the time, and we were building a new hospital, so I got to learn a number of things there.  And so I saw it was very, very important for us to have this black hospital survive.  Make a long story short, we, we began a strong, strong movement of getting support for it.  We changed some rules in Baton Rouge, Louisiana which they governed for support.  We saw there was a lot of inequities for reimbursement and there's still a lot of inequities today for reimbursement on the medical healthcare side and the hospital that I'm talking about back in nine- it's 1970s, we're talking about working with Flint-Goodridge Hospital and trying to get that to survive because when you take a look at that from an economic development point of view, it affects many physicians, black physicians, households, so it's a new business entity. And as a result of that, I served then as vice chair of Charity Hospital [New Orleans, Louisiana], which is a major teaching hospital, both for LSU [LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] as well as Tulane University med schools, and it served the indigent population for the entire state and, again, wanted to help create change, wanted to help change policy that would benefit our community for healthcare services and from that I served on a number of other hospital boards.  Pre-Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], I was chairman of the Lindy Boggs Hospital [Lindy Boggs Medical Center, New Orleans, Louisiana], which was part of the tenant group, et cetera.  I'm presently on the Ochsner hospital board, Ochsner Baptist [Ochsner Baptist Medical Center], which is located here in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So, my life continued to be an advocate for change, whether it was in banking, whether it was economic development and certainly education.  We did a lot of things in education, got things changed in education, as well as the medical community itself.  So, in, in doing business in the banking business, I take a look at what's needed in the community, how we can help our community grow economically and healthcare has certainly been one of my favorites because it helps so many people, not only on the business side, but people who can't help themselves, people without health coverage, and again, it's part of my upbringing of giving back, my early family lessons of giving to people, taking care of people who can't take care of themselves.
Story_ID: 465738
Speaker 1: Now you've also been the president of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce, and pre- pre- president--and helped form the Black Economic Development Council, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about that, that one first and then--
Speaker 2: The Black Economic Development Council, you know, in, in the history of the bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana], we continued to help things change in the community, politically, economically, so now we had a lot of people going from the civil rights days to open access, to equality in jobs, and so now we needed a piece of economic pie and still had a lot of obstacles in the way of helping people to get part of the economic pie.  And so what we did, we had a number of our customers and a number of people in the community to come together to form the Black Economic Development Council, and the purpose of that council was to help grow the economic pie for the black business community.
Speaker 1: What year was that, I just wonder?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  I'll have to get that year.
Speaker 1: Was it '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: It was, yeah.  I would say in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the--
Speaker 1: Early?
Speaker 2: --late '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 1: --late '80s [1980s], okay.
Speaker 2: --early '90s [1990s] and--
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead, I had to ask 'cause--
Speaker 2: That's all right.  We, we utilized a number of gains that we made in the political arena and began holding the community as a whole, accountable, for equality, for equal access.  You know, we started off with equal access to banking then we moved down to the whole economy and wanted a piece of the pie so that we can grow our community economically, so we can grow our own jobs, self-sufficiency is very, very important, and as a result of that, we were able to change a lot of things and question a lot of policies and practices that did not afford the black community entry into economic development and, and today a lot of people are benefiting from the, the organization and the growth and from there, we began looking at different boards and commissions.  We've, you know, I mentioned earlier that I served on a lot of boards and commissions and all of these, all of this service was to create change, advocate for change, and as a result of that, the, this community was sort of stumbling along and the community, the business community, both black and white, asked me if I would take over the role as president of chamber and which I did two years prior to Katrina [Hurricane Katrina].  And, again, one of the initiatives was to change the health system, the Charity Hospital health system [New Orleans, Louisiana] and the funding.  The change was to, to enhance the space program here in the New Orleans [Louisiana] area with its space contractors.  We brought black and white business people, men and women together to begin understanding all of the issues and how these issues affects our economy as a whole.  So we moved from zeroing in and specifically dealing on black business issues and how to get black people involved in the economy into helping solve the economic problems for the city by bringing people together and we were very successful in bringing people together and bringing leadership together to address the issues of, of our community.  My term ended a couple of months after Katrina, and we're very, very proud of the work that we did and the issues that we brought to light during that period of time.
Story_ID: 465739
Speaker 1: Now tell us about being president of the National Banking Association [sic.], the NBA--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --a different NBA for most of us (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  You know the National Bankers Association is another interesting story, another piece of history that people don't remember, it goes back to Madam C.J. Walker [sic. Maggie Lena Walker].  I think that bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia] was started in 1912 [sic.]. And this banking organization of blacks in the financial world, back in the early 1900s was formed, I think in the 1920s, and these were individuals who were involved in, in banking or in the world of finance.  Across the country, they formed this association and dealt with the different issues facing the, the black community and its need for financial institutions. And in 1972, when this bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] was formed, I took the opportunity to attend the first session after the bank was formed and really got to know people from all over the country that had been in this business long before me and help understand, they taught me to, to help understand the milestones that we've been through, number one, and the bridges that we have to cross in the future and being part of that organization, I wanted to become president of that association because of its history, because of what it meant to the entire country, et cetera.  And so I worked my way up through different officer levels of the association and became the president of the National Bankers Association and as president of the National Bankers Association, we were able to put in a lot of things.  We formed a corporate advisory board.  We felt it was important for corporate treasurers and CEOs of major corporations, the Fortune 500 corporations, to come together and understand the significance of minority banking, to put in play, how minority banking can also help their enterprise grow because as we grow the economy, everybody benefits.  So we traveled around the country and met with CEOs and chief financial officers of the Kellogg Company, Sears Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], American Express, Kraft Foods [Kraft Foods Inc.] back then, which is now owned by Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], R.J. Reynolds [R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company].  We met with the biggest companies in this country and sensitized them as far as the need for minority banking and as a result put minority bank deposit programs in place that would benefit all of the minority financial institutions around the country. And we had a board, our committee of about forty Fortune 100 CEOs and CFOs that began to get involved with business development out of minority banks, help put deposits in minority banks, helped raise capital for minority banks and from this, we went on to help changing some of the rules in [U.S.] Congress, helped changing some of the banking rules and this organization had done a lot of this since the 1920s.  So I was very happy to be able to make a contribution to the growth of the organization and the growth of minority banking.
Story_ID: 465740
Speaker 1: Today, in 2008, I'm the longest tenured African American bank president in the country, and it was because of some of the things I've learned from the people who came before me, the shoulders that I stand on today, and that's what we do in our community, that's what we must continue to do in the black, in the African American community.  We must stand on the shoulders of those who came before us so that we don't make the same mistakes and this organization has been a tremendous asset to my growth and development in the banking world.  So I've had a lot of teachers, I've had a lot of people to teach me basic things, all the way from my grandfather, my father [Alden J. McDonald, Sr.], to tell me how to help people, how to grow people and these organizations that we belong to and the things that we've been permitted to do out of this institution [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana] has just been enormous and I thank the good Lord, I thank all of the customers that supported this institution because, it's because of the support.  You know, we talked earlier about pooling resources.  Well guess what?  In minority banking, you're pooling resources to grow resources, to grow a community, to grow jobs and to grow people and to improve the quality of life for people.  So minority banking has been my life for the past thirty-five years.  Banking has been my life since 1966, and it's one of the greatest experiences I will ever have in life and I've enjoyed every minute of it.
Story_ID: 465741
Speaker 1: Now you're on the boards of some major corporations as well as lots of, scores of not-for-profits, BP [British Petroleum; BP P.L.C.], Entergy [Entergy New Orleans, Inc.], Stewart [Stewart Enterprises, Inc.], there's some others, but I'm going to ask you a question we always ask as we tail out the interview and that is, if you can do any major thing differently, you know, what would it be?  Is there anything that you would do differently when you look back?
Speaker 2: In life?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The only thing I would do different in life, I think I would want to do, is to get into the business a lot earlier.  This business has been very rewarding for me, for my family, for my community, for people and I just wish that I would have had an opportunity to begin some of these things much earlier.  Remember, I was the first in, in the South to enter the banking world.  So I had no idea as to what it was about.  So I had to learn all of these things as I grew and I just wish I would have known a lot of the things I know today a lot sooner because I could have helped a lot of people grow a lot bigger and a lot sooner.
Story_ID: 465742
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look at, over your life at this stage, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: An advocate for change.  I, I, I consider myself to be an advocate of change.  I was very fortunate in my young life to give back and to learn how to give back early on.  I've witnessed a lot of change and the bank has afforded me to, an opportunity to change a lot of things.  So I'm a change advocate in education, in health and in business.
Story_ID: 465743
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I would hope that the African American community would take hold of their own destiny and understand that there are a lot of tools in place today that we didn't have in place many years ago.  For them to take advantage of, of growing themselves, through education, through experiences in business.  I would like to see the African American community get more involved in building its own businesses, creating its own jobs and creating its own wealth.  I would like to see more collaboration.  I would like to see more cooperation and more pooling of resources to grow businesses.  I would like to see more family, more family get together, more family collaboration, without family we can't survive.  If we go back to slavery, we'll find that it was because of family that we were able to get through the worst times in our history.  Even family today, when we experience bad times, it's family that brings us through it.  So I would like to see more growth in the family unit, in the African American community.  I would like to see more growth in the economic development sector of this community and more attention to be paid in changing things to make life a better place for those less fortunate, it's called, participation in the process.  We fought for the right to vote, you got the right to vote, you got the right to become educated, you got the right of equality.  We need to use those things to help our community grow, educationally, economically and to have a better quality of life.
Story_ID: 465744
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your family?
Speaker 2: (Cough) The, I have a very blessed family.  I have three kids.  I have a daughter, her name is Heidi McDonald [Heidi McDonald Smith].  She has completed all of her course work for a Ph.D. in early childhood education.  She's been a teacher, graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for her master's [degree] and her course work at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I have a son, Alden, III [Alden J. McDonald III], we call him Chip, and he's thirty years old, my daughter's thirty-three.  He is doing a fellowship in cardiology.  Went to undergrad, Harvard undergrad, Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts], did his residency at Mass General [Massachusetts General Hospital] in Boston [Massachusetts] and doing a fellowship at St. Luke's Heart Institute [Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center Texas Heart Institute] in Houston, Texas.  I have a third child, Todd [Todd McDonald], he's twenty-seven years old, he's the banker.  He works for the bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana].  He's been working for the bank, he graduated from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and he started and wanted to be an entrepreneur as well.  He has three jobs, he follows his dad, as far as many jobs are concerned.  He works at the bank full-time.  He wants to become a real estate developer so he's doing a little stuff in real estate, managing some real estate as well, owns a few pieces of real estate and right after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], he purchased a fast food franchise and today he's about to open his third store and without any influence from the parents, my three kids are in that business together and they all have their responsibilities.  He was living in Boston, my daughter was in Houston, he was here, they get on the telephone, have their weekly meetings, they have their responsibilities and the business is successful.  My daughter, at the end of this month, is going to purchase a daycare center in Houston, Texas and she'll teach early childhood education at a community college.  So, our kids, they all do more than one thing just like their dad and their mom [Rhesa Ortique McDonald] is responsible for really raising them to be the beautiful kids that they are today.
Speaker 1: Now now I didn't ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a teacher.
Story_ID: 465745
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't ask you how you met your, your wife, Rhesa [Rhesa Ortique McDonald].
Speaker 2: I met my wife at a political party, her dad was running for a judgeship.  My wife Rhesa Ortique, and her dad was a prominent civil rights attorney in New Orleans [Louisiana] and it's real interesting because, you know, I came from this other background and didn't know whether or not I was worthy to, to really fall in love or date or even marry this person, after I got over that and, and felt that I could do that 'cause I didn't have anything, I mean, I just started my banking career.  I wasn't, you know, I mean, Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company, New Orleans, Louisiana], I was just starting, wasn't making a whole lot of money, and we dated, well, I met her at her dad's fundraiser, at my board member's home, who had given a political fundraising party for him and she struck me and I asked her to go out, she went out with me and a couple of years later, we got married and have three beautiful children [Heidi McDonald Smith, Alden J. McDonald III, and Todd McDonald].  She was a teacher at the time and she taught until her retirement.  So she was a teacher in the Orleans Parish [Louisiana] school system and a very good teacher and--
Speaker 1: About what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Got married in 1974.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974], okay.  Your father-in-law's one of the, the, Judge Ortique [HistoryMaker Revius Oliver Ortique, Jr.] is one of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --real mainstays of the community here, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep, he was the first black civil court judge.  He was the first black on the state supreme court [Louisiana Supreme Court], elected position.  He served under, just, he served in some kind of capacity, commission member, under quite a few presidents of the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, and he was very well known nationally for his legal career and a very fine fellow in changing policy, changing history as well. So I was very blessed to marry into a family with that legacy.

Speaker 1: One of the reasons why I did marry my wife [Rhesa Ortique McDonald] is because in looking at someone to be supportive of what I was about, I saw the things that I was doing at that early age similar to what her dad [HistoryMaker Revius Oliver Ortique, Jr.] had done, being a change agent, going to meetings, being very busy in the community, so I had to have someone that understood my plate in life and be supportive of it and she has been extremely supportive.   She's been my best friend, she is my best friend, she's my wife, she's the mother of our children [Heidi McDonald Smith, Alden J. McDonald III, and Todd McDonald] and she's a very, very brilliant person, and no matter what you think, how smart you think you are, you're only as good as the woman behind you and I tell young people today that black women, black women represents the pillar and the strength of our community.  They were there during slavery.  When black men were put down by slave owners, it was the black women that made them feel good about themselves.  That kept them going, and in my life, it's been black women again who continues to give me the strength and to give me the courage and to push me to do the things that I do.  So everything I've done and everything I've achieved, in my married life, I, I give my wife the praise for it because she's been the one that has done the most and helped me get through all of the obstacles in life.  There's a saying that I say in life for--there's an O for obstacle and that same O is for opportunity.  So wherever you see an obstacle, just look at that O, that letter O, it means opportunity.  You can pull an opportunity out of every obstacle you have in life, and that's the phrase that I give to everyone that I speak to.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't talked about we need to talk about before this tape runs out and before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I probably will remember five things or ten things later on, but we've covered a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Well the, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered in life as a person that helped change life for many.  I'd like to be remembered as a person that gave back to its community because the community gave to me.  I would like to be remembered as a person that was responsible and was an agent of change.
