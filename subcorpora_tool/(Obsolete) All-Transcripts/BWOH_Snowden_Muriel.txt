Tell me about yourself.
You know, it's interesting, because when we were going to handle the oral history project of black women, the question was how to get into the subject. I think what we felt made sense was to have people talk about the things that they thought were most important in their lives. And, for me, I suppose one of the most important things, as I try to reflect now off the top of my head, is that I managed to combine a lot of things in my life that, provide a lot of personal satisfactions. That includes an education background of a certain quality, which in turn I've been able to use in not only self-satisfying kinds of things, which is a kind of spin-off, but having been able to work with my husband to do things in the community, and I think that kind of contribution makes life worth living.
I missed that...you talked about the Martin. Luther King breakfast. I didn't get to the breakfast. I was supposed to, but the day before, I had done the Martin Luther King convocation speech at MIT [Massachusetts Instititue of Technology], and in it, I think I tried to express my feelings. I was really trying to share some personal reflections, reflections based upon sixty years of being black and female in white America.
Is that how old you are?
Yes. And about twenty-eight years of working with Otto, and trying to bring about some of the things that Martin Luther King had dreamed about, and making them real for a least a few people in Boston. That was really the takeoff point and I talked about, and again it' very personal, about the fact that formal educational training is important, but as for real education—the theme of the talk that I gave was "The Dream: Education is Freedom"--I said that in my mind, my subject was "The Dream Education is Freedom?" because I think that people tend to think in terms of the narrow academic formal training as education; but that for me, education is a synthesis of your life﻿2
MS: (cont.) experience and your formal training. I felt that a real case in point was Pat Harris, and Senator Proxmire's questioning of Pat Harris. His questions and her answers seem to sum up for me what this is all about. She did not talk about her academic degrees in her reply. She talked about remembering who she was and where she came from. But the other side of that coin, as I said in the speech, was that without her formal training she would have never been in a position to be questioned in this way or to be a viable, visible candidate for the office of Secretary of HUD [Housing and Urban Development] in the United States government. So that I think that, in a nutshell, encapsulates how I feel about myself and about what we've been trying to do. I have had to do some things that have been turnarounds for me and this is the personal...because of my own background.
All right, my father was a dentist, and he was a successful dentist if you measure success in material terms. We had a big house, thirteen rooms, lived in a community, it was a bedroom community, for people who worked in New York and New Jersey. But I have some very sharp memories of moving into that house. I think I was three years old, three and a half, when we moved from Orange, New Jersey, to Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Glen Ridge had never had any black people. There was a gentleman's agreement that very effectively kept people out. It was all tied up in all kinds of restrictions, so my father—I learned this later, I didn't know this when I was three years old—had to buy through a straw, but I do remember moving in at night. And I was fascinated with this house. We ran—I remember running through the house and exploring this great big house. My mother had decided on it when they were looking for a place to move. The reason my father was moving from Orange was my mother was very upset about the growing ghetto type atmosphere that was developing in Orange. She was concerned with her three kids—I'm the middle child—and she wanted to get us out of Orange because she was concerned about all of the negative community impact that there could be on her kids. So she decided that this was the one house- in all of the places that they had looked that she wanted. My father was a very good husband, and one of his goals in life was to try to please my mother. So he bought this house, and we moved in. Again, this is all reflection and later kinds of information. I didn't know at that early stage what was going on. But later I found out that there had been all kinds of community meetings over this black family having moved in, that Glen Ridge had gone to hell. They were genteel, you know, they didn't burn any crosses, but there was a great, great ferment in the community. Incidentally, Glen Ridge is a quarter of a mile wide and two or three miles long, and I think the total population is something like 6,000 people, a very small, very small community. But things simmered down, and then my father immediately started making improvements on this big house, and pretty soon people began to talk about it; you know, these people are "different."
Yet we ran into racism, and I constantly say this, for I have great trouble with black people who say that they have never experienced any kind of discrimination. I don't care who you are, where you come from, what your status in life is, at some point if you live in white America, you have felt it. There are various degrees, and certainly for me and my family, we did not have "the man's" foot on our neck every day of our lives as some people do. We weren't exposed. Because my father was a professional man﻿3
MS: (cont.) and because we had some of the amenities of life, we could
insulate ourselves from this kind of constant irritant, the abrasion. You know, you had this whole thing about, was it the black newspapers that used to have that chart that showed you how you got across country without running into discrimination. How black people can travel? See, I go way back. Well, that was just one of the things that we were able to take advantage of. All right, we were mobile. We had two cars. We had connections. My father had graduated from Howard Dental School and it was possible, because my mother was also a Washingtonian, it was possible because of family connections and friendships to move easily. But that still didn't keep us from having to go through some kinds of things that were...not that scarring. They were enough to make you aware.
My father had his office in Bloomfield, which was the next town and there was one theater. And I can remember we used to go to the movies a lot. And I can remember going to that movie, that theater. The theater had no balcony. Therefore, black people were always shunted over to the left-hand side of the theater. Well, because my father was a dentist, and because he practiced two doors down the street from that theater, now his kids weren't about to take that. So we told Daddy about what was happening and he went in and raised hell. Result? From then on in, we weren't subject to this. But I knew even then that that wasn't good enough. There was still the fact that we were spared and that other black people were still being shunted over to the side; I decided there was something radically wrong with that. And 1 think I knew that way back then. And there are other things that stand out in my mind. There was an ice cream parlor in a neighboring town, East Orange, where we used to go on Sundays. My brother and I would get all dressed up, and this was probably when we were teenagers, because I was driving. We would get all dressed up and we'd go over there to get ice cream. I remember going on a Sunday afternoon and being told that we could not be served, but would have to take it out. We couldn't eat there. So, getting back to my family, we raised hell again. We were really very hurt about it. I can remember being very hurt, and again we talked to our parents about it and my father raised Cain, and again we were not subjected to that kind of treatment as individuals.
It says something, I think, about the kind of self-image that our parents tried to provide for us. They were secure enough, economically secure, and my father wasn't looking to anybody for his job. He was an independent professional man, which meant that he could operate from a position of strength rather than weakness. My mother was a firebrand, and she wasn't about to take nothing from nobody. We went to school in Glen Ridge, we were the only black kids in the school. Anytime that anything came up, like my having a part in a play and being told at the last minute I couldn't be in it, my mother went around and raised the roof. Then, when my brother was in the first grade, and the teacher told her—the teacher was from South Carolina or someplace—don't send Bill Sutherland to school anymore with that hair tonic on his hair, because other children objected to it, Mom went around and raised hell again. It got to the point that when she was coming, and she'd fly around (I think she never even took off her apron), she'd run around to the school, because we were very close, and would walk into . that school and everybody in the school started shaking, including the principal. So she established early on that this Sutherland family was not to be tampered with and don't insult my children.﻿4
MS: (cont.) There's one other piece that I will tell you about as part of this conditioning process. There was a child, a girl, white, who lived two blocks from me; and every day, starting with kindergarten, she would come by on her way to school, because she had to pass my house, and stop for me, and we would go to school together. I think that it was about the time we got to the third grade that Peggy said to me one morning, "I cannot walk to school with you anymore." I said, "Why," and she said, "Because I'm from Tennessee." That was her only explanation, and I wondered what was wrong with people from Tennessee. I remember now what my mother told me. At any point that we got called "nigger," and we did get called "niggers," a couple of times, her answer was always, "This is an ignorant, stupid kind of action on the part of the people who are calling you these names, so don't pay any attention to it." That put the weight on the^ other side. It was never you are inferior; it was that you are superior and that these are stupid people.
So again, I think that all this went into image building, but it wasn't until much later on that I began to make the transition from personal kinds of coping with prejudice to making it a... Well, it's the way I feel about women. You know, so I had a fairly decent life as a female, not a black female, but as a female and being able to realize certain kinds of personal potential and all that and working with my husband, but I'm not satisfied with that. I realize you know, that it's the old bit that nobody is free until everybody is free. So there's a whole kind of class action thing that I came to much later in my life. I was going to have to put something together that was going to move beyond personal satisfaction, but that didn't come until after college.
I decided in the third grade that I wanted to go to Radcliffe because I had a cousin, a woman who was my mother's cousin, who was a Radcliffe woman, and I was so impressed with this person. She was just such a wonderful woman and she was brilliant, and I felt, you know, if that's the school-that can turn out somebody like this, then that was where I wanted to go. So I never thought about any other school. From the time I was in the third grade, I was going to go to Radcliffe, and you see how lucky I was, because not many people get to realize that kind of dream. And I went to Radcliffe. I graduated from high school as valedictorian of my class, all right, and that was the largest class that they had ever had in Glen Ridge High School, which was 103. Incidentally, I think this high school was ranked about the seventh best in the country, a good school but then again, this old racism piece.
Even though my father was... You know, he got hit by the depression, professional people were hit very hard by the depression, and I'm talking about going to college in 1934, my senior year. So that this was a period when money was not as plentiful as it had been. We weren't hungry, but it meant that there was a crunch. My father made most of his money during World War I, but he had three children to educate, and a big house and taxes and all the other kinds of things that made... As most people say now, what you make is relative in terms of your standard of living. So when I got ready to go to college, there was no question that I was going to go if he had to beg, borrow, steal, or whatever to get me there. There was no question about my going, but what I found out after I had applied, and I guess actually after I had been accepted, was that there was a Radcliffe﻿5
MS: (cont.) Club in New Jersey that gave scholarships. However, the person who was my guidance counselor in high school did not tell me about it. Even though my grades were better than the girl who got the scholarship. You got it on merit then, not so much on need. A girl from Montclair, a white girl, got the scholarship. Again, I thought that this was a kind of a dirty deal.
But anyway, I got to Radcliffe and when I got there I couldn't live in the dormitory because Radcliffe was concerned about my "happiness," as if I lived in a dormitory, I wouldn't be happy. I was advised that I should live out my freshman year and make friends, and move into the dormitory where my friends lived. Theory, pure theory, because anybody that is a day hop makes friends with other day hops, and at the end of that first year I was no better off in terms of friendships than I was when I first went there. That was one of the most traumatic things that ever happened to me, because I think my mother had invested so much in me. She didn't go to college. She finished high school, she went to high school in Washington. I don't know whether she went to Dunbar or not, I can't remember now. But she had taken millinery at Hampton. That was her post high school education. She was really a very ambitious woman; she was very class conscious, she was color conscious. These are some of the negative things that, as you think back, you realize they were there, but you didn't realize it at the time. But she was a product of that Washington society that was based on a lot of false kinds of values. I think that one of the things that came out of the sixties, that black is beautiful, helped to turn some of those people's heads around so that they got them on straight. But she invested so much in me, and then this first year when they wouldn't let me in the dormitory, she was furious. We didn't accept any of the places that Radcliffe offered as possible outside places. Instead, we found a friend, a relative really, of a family that we were very close to in New Jersey, who lived in Belmont. So I lived in Belmont in my freshman year. These people had no children, and it was a real, a new thing for them. It was my first time away from, home and I had just turned eighteen, and it was their first experience at having a young person in the house. We got along very well, as a matter of fact.
But at the end of that year, we went back to the dean and talked about my living in the dormitory, and they gave me a whole hoopla about I wouldn't be happy, and I was attractive and I should have gone south to school, and all that jazz. My mother said that she hadn't asked Radcliffe to take care of her daughter's social life. She said, "This is not what I'm sending her here for. We will take care of that; the dormitory is what we want." So I moved into a dormitory. It was a small one with several single rooms. That was my sophomore year, and that first day that I moved into the dormitory... I can see this so clearly. ..it was supper time and I just wasn't up to it. You see, after a time, you get to be color conscious, you get to be race conscious, and I just was not up to that first night, going in there with all those white kids for supper. My mother just sat there and wept, because after she had gone through so much to get me there, she could not understand what I was going through at that time. With her attitude and her kind of strong personality and never taking anything from anybody, she couldn't understand why I didn't go on out there and go to supper. I'll never forget that that was a tough night. But we worked it out, and I lived in the dormitory, and it was a good experience.﻿6
(cont.) I have had problems since then, when I first came out, thinking about what a liberal arts education means. I felt that I had been in a sense shortchanged because I had nothing to sell. Sure, I was a French major. I had made a mistake, I shouldn't have been a Romance language major. I found out halfway through my college career that I was really interested in sociology, so what I did was to audit all the sociology courses wile I was still majoring in French. I tended to do my French papers based on sociology field trips that I had taken. But I couldn't go back and pick up the credits that I needed for a major in sociology, so that I came out of Radcliffe as a Romance language major. My mother's dream for me was—remember this was 1938—for a black female what was there to do? Social work? Teaching? Mostly teaching. She was very disappointed that that was not where I seemed to want to go.
I didn't know where I really wanted to go, but again, I had a friend in New Jersey, a friend of the family. And after doing volunteer work at my church, the black church was in Newark, seven miles away, that's where we went, my father was a deacon in the church, the Thirteenth Avenue Presbyterian Church. We had gone there from the time we were little kids. I did volunteer work at the church and I began to get some sense that I kind of like this, and this friend of mine who was a lawyer and a politician told me, "You really want to work somewhere?" And I said, "I certainly do." It was like six months after I had graduated from college; I had done volunteer work during that summer. He said, "Well, there's a job opening at the welfare board. You should take the exam." It was a civil service exam, and he set up an appointment for me to go in and see the head of this agency. This man—I looked younger than my twenty-two years—didn't quite believe that I had graduated from college. But when he found that I had, he said, "Where did you go?" And I said, "I went to Radcliffe," and he said, "I went to Harvard." And for one hour we talked about the white casement windows at Harvard, and the Charles River and all of that. That man then sent me a telegram, this is like in December, saying that I had been hired as an investigator for the Essex County Welfare Board, doing investigations for old age Assistance. Here I am, six months out of college, and a Romance language major and I'm going to work doing something that's absolutely remote from anything I've ever done.
I worked for the Essex County Welfare Board as a social welfare investigator, investigating such things as carrying a case load of x number of people who were on old age assistance, processing applications for old age assistance, and also investigating their relatives who were legally responsible for them. That was the first time, Cheryl, that I had really any exposure to the way in which poor black people lived. I was working in Newark's third ward, which was the red light district. It was the toughest district, I suppose, in the city, and there had been some real reservations on the part of the welfare board about my assignments. They were a little concerned, again, because they said you look young and maybe you wouldn't be safe; but I guess even then I had more nerve than good sense, and I guess that's something that protects you. I think it has a lot to do with your own attitude. I think people sense it. If you're out for something, I think people know, and I think I was able to establish fairly soon that my job was a helping job.
I had some funny experiences of going in and asking for an old gentleman who was on my list, and I spoke to this man, and I said, "Do you know Pop?" And﻿7
MS: (cont.) he said, "Who are you?" I said that I was from the welfare
board. "What do you want?" I said that it's six months, and I need to talk to him. I said, "He lives here, doesn't he?" He said, "You're the investigator?" I said yes, and he said, "I'm Pop." You know, that kind of thing. And I had friends who were plainclothesmen and detectives and whatnot, and they would say that if you're down there, don't walk alone on certain kinds of stress, let us know what you're doing. All kinds of protection.
But it was a real eye-opener for me to see people living behind apartment houses, in shacks with brown paper in the windows and potbellied stoves. All this to me was brand new. I lived only seven miles from it and I had never seen it. So that whole business of working there, I worked there for five years, I worked there from 1938 to 1943, and by the end of that time I had come to a very definite conclusion. Number one, I had to leave because I could no longer tell people that they could live on thirty dollars a month. This is what the budget allowed, so much for rent, so much for food, two dollars a month for clothing and a dollar for incidentals. I'll never forget it, I had to run around telling people whowere scuffling like crazy, trying to hold themselves together, that if they had any little bit of excess, at least on paper in terms of money, that they should be giving that to their parents or grandparents. It was crazy.
CG: Becuase the depression wasn't over then.
MS: No, it was insane. So I decided that I was going to leave. I couldn't be loyal to that organization anymore; it was tearing me apart. There was another piece to that, for even while I was being torn apart... One of my first visits was to a man, and it was in the winter time; it was cold, and he said that he had no coal there or nothing. So I got my first check and I cashed it and I went and bought him his coal. I found that was not veiry good social work because, you know, he was much more astute and experienced at survival than I was, so that he was taking advantage. He had enough money to buy the coal, so I fell for his story, but I learned that... there's another piece of that too. There was one other black worker at that welfare board, and this told me something about the kinds of things that black folks can do to one another. He could have made it very difficult for me, you know, he was there, he was the black and he was a very capable man and here I come, young and a woman, and he actually took me under his wings. For the first couple of days that I was on the job, I was in tears because I didn't know what I was doing. I had no experience with this stuff, and I would go to his house before I started out and he would teach me what to do, how to go. I saw his wife not too long ago—he's dead—and I was saying I would never forget the fact that he was willing to give me that kind of support, and if anything, if I owed anybody anything in terms of my being able to do that job, it was because Charlie was so good to me. Always when I got into trouble, he was there.
But after those five years of working there... Now it's 1943, and there's a war going on, and I talked to my brother. My brother is two and a half years younger than I am. My sister is nine years older. There was a boy between my sister and me, but he lived only five days. In a sense, my sister was very much the adult side of the family. So my brother and I﻿(cont.) became really... The closeness between us is, I suppose, extraordinary. We did everything together ,and, you know how kids team up against their parents. We were very supportive of one another. So that when I talked to my brother about what I wanted to do, I always thought that he had kind of a maturity and a clear vision that I didn't quite have. He said, "You know what. Because of the way we have been brought up, and because of the way you feel about what you've been doing with black people and all that..." Only we weren't talking about black people, we were still talking about "Negroes." He said, "You know, you could be a bridge between the black community and the white community in which we move easily because of our educational background and because of the advantages that we have had, so that you could do this." 1 said, "Why don't I go back to school because I think what I've been doing instinctively may have been all right, but I want to have some kind of a base; I really don't have a theoretical base for what I'm doing."
So I applied for a National Urban League Fellowship. There were few male applicants; the men were all off in the army, the young men. The Urban League wasn't really keen about giving scholarships to women, but I applied and the executive director of the Urban League then was Mr. Lester Granger, again, was an old friend of my family. Lester was very supportive. He said, "If you want to do it, I think it's a very important thing for you to do. I think more of us need to have some sense of responsibility for one another and I'll help you." So I made out the application and I got the fellowship. Part of it, I think, was based not solely on merit, but I had a decent background, and then I had strong support within the league. Lester Granger said one thing to me. He said, "I can help open the door," he said, "but you know, your going through it is up to you." I thanked him for helping me to get the fellowship, for all kinds of good things he'd said about me, but I realized that it was a far cry from getting it and then performing.
I went into the New York School for Social Work, but I wanted to go to Atlanta. I thought I needed more exposure to black people, that since my whole life had been "oreo" type, I needed to get with it. Lester said, "You have worked in Newark, you know something about Harlem. So there ain't nothing in Atlanta that you can't find here. You go to the New York School of Social Work." So I stayed and I went to the New York School of Social Work. I fussed about the kind of courses that I wanted to take. I wanted to go into community organizations with a special emphasis on race relations, but the New York School of Social Work is a casework school. So I found myself kind of, you know, neither fish nor fowl. I insisted that I had five years' experience, that I didn't want to be doing field work. So they let me take seven courses and no field work, and what I found was at the end of the first semester that I had fourteen papers due at the same time, two papers in each course. That drove me into taking some field work, but trying to find a placement for me was not easy. Things like doing files with the New York Urban League which was merging with the Brooklyn Urban League, and I'm sure that after I got through with the files, that they were never able to find anything because I didn't know anything about filing. The school itself was not able to provide what I needed. I used to scream about the case material that we got. I said, "Don't you have any cases on black people? Why isn't that part of the curriculum?" Then they would tell me, "Well, you know we're trying to do something about that." A lot﻿/
9
MS: (cont.) of it I ended up doing on my own and coming to the conclusion,
with the help of a woman that I talked to very frankly, about my not being able to get community organizations courses out of that school... She said that casework, in the final analysis you deal with individuals, so that if you have casework skills, that's a good base for community organization. If you can learn how to use your casework skills, then you can think in terms of larger things like groups and communities. You're still going to be working with individuals and the interaction of individuals.
So I stayed, but I got married. I went to the New York School of Social Work from 1943 to 1945. I got married in May of 1944, and my daughter was born in July of 1945, so I was still in school. Again, this is about the female piece of this. I had pernicious vomiting. I was really sick, and then again I was pregnant, but my doctor, my gynecologist—Dr. May Edward Chinn—was a woman, a black woman, and I think that she understood. She and 1 sat down, and she said, "Do you really want to have this baby?" And I said, "Yes, but I've got this obligation. I've got the fellowship, they would have really preferred to give it to a man than to a woman and here I am and I don't know..." So she said, "You're going to have to work that through for yourself, if you really want the baby." So by the time I got through talking to her, she was very supportive, and after three months of that nausea, I was going to school the whole time, I got myself straightened out and, Girl, I stayed in school up to the time, just about two weeks before the baby was born. I did my last paper in the hospital. I had them roll me up because I had one more paper to do and I wanted to get it done. I had no problem with the birth business and the time went fast. It was a good pregnancy, and I was so busy that I just didn't have time to think or brood or anything else. I had no complications.
The only thing was that my grandfather died the day before Gail was born so I had gone home. He had asked me, he was ninety-five years old, and , I had gone home to New Jersey. First thing that happened was that I was about eight months pregnant, and the elevator in my building had stopped running, and I lived on the seventh floor. And it wasn't just seven floors, it was double landings, so you really had to go up fourteen flights of steps.
CG: Because those are the old style buildings.
MS: That's right. So I decided, what I would do is not go home, because that's insane, so I got myself together and went over to New Jersey, and then my grandfather died. He was a wonderful man and had a great influence on my brother. He was the son of a slave and he used to tell us these stories, and why we never listened to him... You know, it's like we've heard that story a million times before, why are you going, don't come out when my friends are there and start going over all this old stuff. But the things that he used to tell us about the fact that his father was a plantation owner and that he had never married, and that this slave who was his mother and who, in a sense, was his mistress. But the relationship was such that this man never married, and that when he was born, his father used to take him around the plantation on horseback, taught him to read and write, and his mother decided that she was going to leave him. Emancipation came, the Civil War. She left and took my grandfather to Washington, and that was where my mother was born, and the boy that was her brother died. And my grandfather was a bricklayer. He was one of the artisans, you see.﻿/
10
Ms. (cont.) He built half of southwest Washington; I'm sure he was part of the building crew, that no longer exists...but I have to get off on that? I was talking about going to school and having a baby.
That whole process of getting married was really something. I was twenty-eight years old when I got married, and even then I wasn't really sure. I can remember after deciding on the basis of... And I said this to Otto, but I was really quite careful in terms of looking around at the young men that I knew. I was fairly popular, and what I was really looking for and I found that it was important to me to have somebody who came out of a similar background. I had known Otto, I had met him when I was a freshman in college. I had visited his home, I had seen the way his family lived, and I thought this would make sense, plus the fact that he was good looking and charming and all the rest, and I loved him. So then I decided that I would tell him that I was using my head and [it was] not my heart that was making a decision about getting married. Also there was the whole business of peer pressure, the business of being twenty-eight years old and unmarried. In the level of society in which I traveled, you know, the "What's wrong with you, why aren't you getting married?" kind of thing. I guess I was having inner conflict about career versus marriage that I wasn't aware of, so I decided that I would get married and the night before, a week before the wedding, I was walking the floor saying, "Am I doing the right thing, should I really get married, do I want to get married?" I was talking to all my old good friends about it, "Do I want to get married?" Finally I decided if I want to have children and I did, and if I want to have a life that approximates the lives of my friends, then you know, you fall into this conforming pattern, that's the way it went in 1944.
Gail was born in July of 1945 and I stayed with her. I took her home to my mother and I stayed with my family until he [Otto] got out of the army, and that's when we came [to Boston], in the 1940s. In February, of '46 he got out of the army, and I came the next month with the baby. We lived in his house, his family had lived here for years, thirty years or more. It was a kind of one-family thing. Well, there were some problems in trying to combine two generations. His mother and father were really very good to us, particularly after my husband decided that he was going to leave Saint Mark's Center. At Saint Mark's Center, he was the director of Saint Mark's, he had raised the money to build a gym...
CG: So you picked somebody with the same kind of commitments you had.
Ms= Well, that's right, there was that, and I also felt that, even though he was not the kind of person you sat down and read poetry with, but it took more than that to make a life, and that Otto had a lot of plain, good common sense and good management skills, and that I could settle for that. So at Saint Mark's we talked about starting a nursery school. Again, we had a child and were thinking about the future, so he said, "What we need to have at Saint Mark's is a nursery school." And I got into that; as I used to say, I was his favorite and most exploited volunteer. I worked at Saint Mark's, I did everything I could to help on a voluntary basis because Saint Mark's was close to my house. My mother-in-law was a built-in babysitter, so that I had some feeling, even before I began to work, my paid work, I was not paid at Saint Mark's.﻿11
MS: (cont.) So when we decided to leave Saint Mark's, after all kinds of
things that happened, I guess we needed something bigger than a sectarian connected operation. We couldn't provide a community base for community improvement through anything that was as narrowly constricted as that church. And so Otto talked about giving up and resigning his job, along with the program. And that's what he did. He resigned at Saint Mark's without anything, no money, except what his father was willing to give us in way of subsidy. We lived off insurances and he borrowed and we paid no rent. And we didn't have a car and his father loaned us a car. His family undergirded us because... I don't think they really knew what Otto was talking about. He wanted to start something else. They said, "If you want to do it and you believe in it, then we'll help you." Whether they really understood what we were about or not... I'm sure they didn't know because there was a lot of vagueness in our own minds about what it was we would end up with. It has ended up being Freedom House. But it started out being the Upper Roxbury Community Project and some sense of how are you going to pull this community together? We had to make a decision about whether we were going to run away from here and take our child and solve our personal problems which would be... The handwriting was on the wall; the community was deteriorating. Otto's mother and father had moved here from the South End thirty years before. Were we going to start moving? And we said, No, it doesn't make sense to move, we ought to stay, because if we have any talent, if we have our skill, this is the community that we know. Otto had been here all these years, why should we go someplace else and start from scratch? There was old Booker T. Washington's "putting down your buckets where you are" and that's what we decided to do. I usually make a speech and talk about having our feet firmly planted in mid-air, as we started off on this noble experiment which has lasted, what, twenty-eight years.
There was a point at which...I think was important in terms of, again, being a woman. Otto was really very helpful with Gail, and his family was helpful with Gail when she was little. But at the point we ran out of insurances to borrow on and all the rest of it, we said, well... First, his father had been helpful, but you know, no matter how much, your independence is totally eroded when you're an adult and you're dependent on your parents, and it gave them more say in our lives than they needed to have, than was healthy. So I went to work in Cambridge. I went to work with the Civic Unity Committee; I was working with the executive of the Civic Unity Committee on a program which she was trying to get together on democratic human relations for the Cambridge public school teachers, and I was supposed to be a resource person. And in the process of talking with this gal about it, I told her I was looking for a job, and she said, "You're serious." She said, "Why don't you just step into my place? My father is very ill and I can't stay here. I'd love to see you have this job." She was white, but I had known her before. And she made the recommendation that I should be her successor, and I went to work after a whole lot of shenanigans. Number one, the city manager was not too keen about a human relations... Cambridge Civic Unity Committee, as you know...
CG; I'm on the board.
All right, you know the Cambridge Civic Unity Committee. Well, John﻿12
(cont.) Atkinson was the city manager and I don't know how keen he was about having this municipal arm, human relations arm. And remember it was very early on that [it] started, because it was after the riots in Detroit and Sojourner Truth, that these committees began to come into being. Detroit had the first one in 1947, then Chicago followed suit, and I think, Cambridge. Interestingly enough, Cambridge, which did not have at all the same kind of population problems or anything, the third one. So Atkinson... I gave them the names for recommendations and whatnot Friday or Monday, and he said that he'd never seen such glowing references for anybody, and the chairman of the committee said to me... The two of them started talking, and the chairman turned to me and said, "You know what? I wish you were a man so we could pay you a decent salary." The salary was $3,200. He said, "You know, we could pay you $6,000 or $7,000. We wish you were a man." And so what I found myself facing then was trying to do a better job than any man could do or would do, knowing that they would throw that at me. I had an address in Cambridge, but I was back and forth from Roxbury and we were still trying to get Freedom House straight, so what I was doing was going to Cambridge, working all day, and going back for these night meetings, then going back and doing secretarial work at Freedom House, trying to get it started. And I did that for a year and a half.
As I think back on it, you know, youthful energy and enthusiasm, whatever it was that kept me going, plus the fact that, again, my mother-in-law was cooking meals and looking after my child, so I didn't have that kind of anxiety. The only anxiety I had was the kind, I think, that most working mothers feel, is that you don't have enough time to spend with the child.
Right.
After I had been there a year and a half, Otto said to me... And part of it was that he saw me going down a path that was going to lead somewhere that was totally divorced from our joint effort. Really not totally divorced because I was doing this work at Freedom House. We had no secretary; we had nothing. So it was a kind of trying to put a dream together, and it just meant that 1 was working all the time, trying to do these things, and still trying to do a creditable job in Cambridge. I think he was beginning to realize that it was very wearing on me, plus the fact that I was developing a little side thing here that was taking some of the energy that I needed in order to help Freedom House, if we were going to be a team. So I think I went to New Jersey, and when I came back, Otto told me that he had spoken to his father and he had said he would give us $1,000 cash as a kind of springboard to start working on Freedom House. That he'd like for me to give up the job in Cambridge. I wept and I said I would do it. The day when I went in to tell the chairman of the committee that I was leaving... He kids me about it, he says that I sat there in tears, worried about his handkerchief. He told me how sorry he was to have me going, but he told me he understood. But that was one of the turning points in my life.
I gave up the job and I wept about it, but it was a decision that I made in the interests of the team and the marriage, and not in my own personal position, because maybe I might have gone on down that road which would have led me in an entirely different direction, but you know, you make these choices, and you live with them. My regrets are not that strong,﻿13
MS: (cont.) because working with Otto has been very good in many ways,
and it's thirty-two years now since we got married. I would say that the cement that has held us together has been the fact that we had something that was bigger than either one of us, along with our child. There was this working together and the complementary relationship that existed between us. He's practical, he's a businessperson, he's a good manager. So that he was able to squeeze out of a penny more than anybody ever thought, both in our personal finances, which were practically nothing, and in organizing and running Freedom House, because you have to have business sense. There are a lot of black organizations that have fallen apart because they did not have this good management piece. But in a sense then, we're atypical, because it's seldom that you find the two things combined in one person.
CG: People with good business sense go into business.
MS: Yes. I'm the visionary, I'm the idealist, I'm the conceptualizer. Otto in the beginning raised most of the money. He went around here saying, "We're trying to start something," and people believed in him. They didn't really know what he was doing, but "If you say so, Otto." You know, he delivered newspapers, he worked in the A&P, he was known in the community. And then we were also smart enough to recognize that people like Mrs. Cass were people of experience and knowledge and background. You don't go out and start from scratch what other people have gone through, you learn. And Mrs. Cass was a charter member of the board of Freedom House, along with people like Lucy Mitchell. Again, people in this community, who knew the community and whose wisdom and years could be helpful to us. I think I have a strong sense of a continuum. You know, nobody starts from scratch; we all start on the basis of what has gone before. And hopefully we will have added to it so that those who come after you will be that much further down the road, so that I think that that kind of sense that we were perfectly willing and open to the guidance and direction of people like Mrs. Cass and Mrs. Mitchell...were really very helpful.
And as I said, we raised the first money from the board on the basis that you can't sell what you won't buy yourself. So whatever people were willing to give, and we talked to them about "community insurance." You buy insurance for everything, for some protection, so why not insure your community. It costs you fifty cents a month. If you will support Freedom House to that extent, then we will become the people who will be your eyes and your ears, and look after the garbage and the trash and the snow removal and community problems that most people cannot give full-time attention to, because they've got to make their living. And that was the theory on which we started, and moved from... After a while, after having raised the magnificent sum of $869 in 1949, that was the total income and disbursements, and by 1959 we were up to nearly $50,000 or $60,000, and now I think it may be around a quarter of a million. All private funds, except for a few federal contracts that we had from time to time, that we are not happy about because they involve so much red tape, and the whole bureaucracy thing, plus the fact that they are not reliable. You get a federal grant for a year, and you try to hire staff and get a program going, and then if that grant is not renewed, you're stuck in the middle of something, and no way of supporting it. So diversification of your financial base is something we learned early on. So that if any party that supports us﻿14
MS: (cont.) financially pulls out, then we would hurt, but we wouldn't
collapse. And in the sixties, all the people that just depended on 0E0 just fell apart when the bottom fell out of that. There was no place for them to go.
CG: Like the whole Blue Hill Avenue thing, a good example of that.
MS: The whole Blue Hill Avenue "strip thing." But do you have some questions now that maybe you want to lead me somewhere else?
CG: In a sense, you've told me a lot of the things I was going to ask you, especially around education, where you took the courses, and you got interested in sociology... By the way, did you get your degree from the New York School of Social Work?
MS: No, I did not. I did all of my work, you needed eighty-four credits for your degree, your master's in social work. And I had seventy-six, all except my project, which is your thesis. But I was pregnant, and I said, You only have a first baby once, and I'm not going to do a makeshift kind of project, that is, just a library kind of thing. That didn't make any sense to me, and I was not physically able to be running around doing research, or anything, so I decided that I would do my project afterward. You have a six-year grace period. However, I got so busy when I came to Boston to live, and I had more stuff that I could have used. We started a nursery school at Saint Mark's, an interracial nursery school, the whole process of setting up a new structure in the community, any of this stuff would have made beautiful material for the...never got around to it. So then when the six-year grace period ran out, I said to hell with it, and I never bothered. And then later on down the line, people would ask me, you know, in terms of qualifications... For example, I taught at Simmons for twelve years in the School of Social Work, when the question comes up, you know, do you have your degree, then I just assumed the posture that I would be willing to stack my experience against anybody's degree at this point. And that I would not be willing to get the degree simply to have that tacked onto my name. Because that's a point, in fact that I feel very, a sore point in terms of overestimating what a degree, an earned degree, means. On the other hand, you know, I'm not saying people shouldn't have them, all I'm saying is, don't make this a hard and fast criterion that opts out the value of somebody's life experience, which in the long run will probably—if the person is a capable person—will enable that person to move much faster and do whatever the job is than the person who is fresh out of school with a degree.
CG"- Right.
MS: And I tend to believe people ought to go take a break between college and graduate school, to find out what life is all about, rather than to be a perennial student. I think that the meaning of graduate school then is so much more intense that when you go...
CG: It's more focused.
MS: Right. It's focused and I think there are a whole lot of things happening in education now, a turnaround, and certainly found that that is not the﻿15
MS : CG: MS: CG: MS:
(cont.) answer to everything. What is a typical day for you? What is a typical day? Right.
Well, I guess maybe a typical day... Well, I just did a panel. There are always problems, I think, between... I did the piece on "Black Women and Equal Rights" for the Urban League, for the National Urban League conference, and I think I ended up at some point by saying I was tired of trying to be superwoman. And I got tremendous applause from the group. But I felt that it was necessary to get up again and explain what I meant by being superwoman. It had nothing to do with the accolades and the degrees and the honors. I was really talking about the pressure to do so many things well. It's unrealistic. I used to be a housekeeper that was concerned about no dust, and I was running myself ragged trying to keep my house clean, cooking, my husband did the marketing—that was traditional in his family—but I had this real compulsion about keeping the house clean and all that. Until I realized that my child and my husband couldn't have cared less about whether there was dust, but I had run myself ragged trying to do this. At the same time, trying to carry on a job, do a job, and this kind of work.
When you talk about women involved in community change, you're not talking about a nine-to-five job, you're not talking about a structured situation in which it is possible to set aside time for yourself. And I think that I have resentment, I guess I still do. But I have so many things I have to do, I never have time to do what I want to do. So that there's this kind °f...how do you manage to balance? And I think that somehow women are going to have to find ways in which they can achieve this kind of delicate relationship between being parents, homemakers, if you will, and also careers. And part of it's going to have to mean that there are going to have to be some societal changes that will enable women to cope. As things are now, there are obstacles in your way, you know, in terms of child care, you can't get anybody that you can afford, really, to do the work. My daughter's up against this, you know, she's an officer at the First National Bank, the branch officer, she's got a child who's three, her husband works, she's got a house, she's going to school. Now, she's tired, she worries about it, and I used to say to my husband, that unless I could have a little time for me, that I couldn't be good for them either. So how do you end up being good to yourself when there aren't enough hours in the day. And if you do take the time, how do you do it without feeling guilty?
And so when I talk about a typical day, and it starts—because we don't run the kind of hours, as I say, it's not nine to five, I'm not necessarily here at nine o'clock, but before I come, I like to do a certain degree of straightening up around the house; I can't bear to come back into a house where the beds are unmade, and where dishes are draining in the sink. And I used to try to plan my meals; I don't do that anymore. You know, if I'm tired, I lie down. You know, it's catch as catch can on the food thing; it's not that important. Then to get paperwork done. There's so much Paperwork, and we don't have a big staff. And I do all of the writing for﻿16
MS: (cont.) Freedom House, and I do a lot of the proposal writing, the
public relations pieces; I do all of that. This is a responsibility that falls within my particular area of competence. I also do the downtown fundraising. And I have all these boards and things that I belong to , so that a day usually includes some kind of a committee meeting. And except for two things that I belong to, most of my life, if you look at the kind of things that I have done in a civic sense, they have been related, they have been things that have been supportive of what Freedom House is trying to do.
Like the Committee for Boston. I had several thoughts about taking that on, but we've been working at this level, trying to bring change about in the school, and change takes place at so many different levels that it seemed to me that if we could bring about some fundamental change in the system, which has to do with restructuring the School Committee, which people have been talking about for so long, that maybe I ought to be part of that. So that was my rationale for getting into that. To be a woman and black on the board of the Shawmut Bank, again, it wasn't because of the "first" piece that I resent, just as I do for blacks... We're still in a position where we're talking about somebody being "first." But it was a chance, I felt, to find out something about how a whole area of life functions that I know nothing about. I don't know anything about money and business, really, in terms of who calls the shots. So that that kind of education—but it is also work too, it works for the benefit of Freedom House, because Freedom House gets better known. So that except, as I say, for the Aquarium and the Museum of Science, which are two things that are interesting to me—I'm a Cancerian, and so the water, the sea, always was very important to me.
CG: My father is a Cancer...
MS: Your father? Well, you know we're moody people, sensitive people, and
all that kind of thing, but the sea is very important. So I enjoy being on the board of the Aquarium, though I cannot get to as many meetings as I'd like to. Things like Babson... Again, it's a matter of trying to find out where the opportunities are for young black folks. And being in a position where you have some clout, being a corporation member, perhaps, gives me an opportunity to talk about minority students, minority faculty, and some feeling about how Babson can better relate to the black community. I haven't done as much of it as I would like. I did more of it when I was on the board of the University of Massachusetts. And that one, I felt that even though I was appointed by Governor Francis Sargent, and was not elected by anybody, I felt that I had a constituency. I had to be accountable to black students and to black faculty, and I have pushed... the trustees, they have university governing boards, the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities, suggesting that there ought to be some kind of session that deals with the role of the black trustee in a white institution. Because there's something special about the way in which the black trustee has to function in the role, the expectations that are different, in a way, from the white person on the board. And I think they included some of that, in the last few conferences I think they've had some sense of black trusteeship. I had also always hoped that there would be a black caucus of black trustees, you know, a minority grouping and that they would do their own thing, but I haven't been involved in that, and﻿17
(cont.) I'm not on the board anymore, so that is not a conference I go to.
Being on the advisory committee for a small foundation is also another kind of new experience in which I am on the giving end rather than on the receiving end, and that broadens one's perspective about money and how it can be used. And so it puts you in a position of putting in a good word where it's called for, for programs and projects that might not get the same kind of attention if we weren't there. So you do that; I don't think that's any secret. You try to be objective in the allocation of funds, and this is not a big foundation, but I think that the fact that I bring a community perspective, that I can help with the evaluation of projects, particularly as they relate to black people. I have strong feelings about black people being in decision making, policy making spots, that unless there's that kind of input from us, we're always forced to react...
GG: Instead of just act.
^S: Yes, and if it's after the fact, so frequently the opportunities for
making change are minimized. But if you're there in the beginning, and this is the whole thrust of this Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education, to try to have an impact. It's a two-fold purpose. One was to provide the black children and their parents some of the kinds of information that they needed in order to make intelligent decisions, and to know what the options are about education, in its broadest sense, and also in terms of public school or private school, whatever. The other piece of it was to have a mechanism whereby knowledgeable black people could, if necessary, force input into these many decisions that are made at the local and at the state level and even at the federal level, about things that affect black children in the educational process. Those are the two purposes. • Ellen Jackson will spell it out for you a little differently, but essentially that was what we were about, and the getting involved in the day-to-day kind of problems of desegregation is not really what we intended, but we felt that we had to fill the void. Now we're back, we're trying to take a look at the university pairings, what's happening in the schools, also the support program that we're running now under contract with the school department, on helping kids prepare for SSATs and SATs.
GG: Yes. Because that's what they do for them in the private schools, which is why they do so well.
MS: We've got problems, what we can do is limited at best. The most important thing that we've been doing is familiarizing kids with the process of exam taking, so they won't be so fearful when they go in to take an exam. What we cannot do is make up for the deficiencies, even at the sixth grade level. Because you talk about sixth graders and the eighth graders who are the ones with the SSAT program. There are 247 of them, I think, who are registered, and the exam has been postponed, so we have no way of measuring what the net result is of having this opportunity to participate in classes. We've done pretests, but posttest results have not been tabulated yet.
But again, it's a...you almost come a full circle. We started out with﻿18
MS: (cont.) Freedom House being concerned about things like recreational facilities and clean up campaigns, then into urban renewal for seven years; we were concerned about the physical environment thing. It is important to keep the community such that, you know, keep the community safe for kids to be on the street, never mind just taking them off the street. Somebody took...who was it, I don't know whether it was Mike Barnicle or Alan Lupo, somebody the other day said something that was very interesting. That as crime rises in the cities, and even in the suburbs, that people adjust to the situation by buying guns, more locks on the doors. Rather than trying to fight the problem, they adjust themselves to it. So that it was like the reason for leaving the welfare board. I could no longer ask people to adjust to an unfavorable environment. This is my whole thing in my inability to relate to, well, social workers. I never made a professional identification with social workers. Whatever I had in the beginning was with the intergroup relations people, for that was more of my concern. This whole sense that if you are out of step, there's something wrong with you, rather than there's something wrong with the system and that you've got to make some changes there.
So it's this kind of thing we were doing; we were trying to make the community environment a safe one for kids to be in, not just taking them off the streets for two hours during the day. But you came full circle, because after going through urban renewal, job fairs, and trying to increase the economic opportunities for black folks by pushing downtown into aggressive affirmative action programs, you come right back to the beginning point, which is that unless black young people, who are our future, no question about it, unless black kids have an equal shot so that they can come up... Because what we're finding now is that you have enough black people who have educational backgrounds, so that blacks are not competing solely with whites, they are competing with other blacks. And if black kids don't have even just the basic survival tools, masses of black kids ,are going to be left behind that eightball forever. And how do you help them to break out? And I guess this is what we're really trying to do, whether it was sending kids to Europe and Africa on a travel-study program, or taking this contract to see if we can provide some support and interest.
And incidentally, we'll be interested in the returns on these exams. We'll be interested in the kids that pass, even though they might have passed anyway. We're really interested very much in the kids who didn't get by the exam, particularly sixth graders, because we'll be able to help them, and they'll get another shot at it. All right? But also the others, who don't have another shot, what are their alternatives? If they were sufficiently motivated, and had incentive, and if they came here, regularly, and stuck with this thing, how do you keep that from being killed? You tell them it's the end of the world because you didn't pass the SSAT? Of course, it isn't the end of the world. But they need to know, and their parents need to know, what other kinds of things, what else is out there. You got a good kid, one parent came in here years ago, and said, "My son is a good C+ student, what do I do? He can't go to Latin School, what am I supposed to do, take him out into the back yard and shoot him?" 'Cause there are no schools that I see,good high schools, in this town, other than the Latin School. Some of them move.﻿19
CG: And there you go, another well-motivated kid that should be in with his friends is gone.
MS: That's right. And then you've got the whole teacher thing, there's
still so much... But I think that's a matter of keeping somehow in view, short range and long range kinds of goals, plus a sense that nobody's expendable. And so you try to...you know, you don't say that it'll be generations before such and such a thing happens. What can you do now to salvage at least a few—you can't salvage them all—but to salvage a few, so that that future becomes more possible, because you have more troops, if that's the way of saying it.
CG: Yes, more troops.
MS: We need more troops, and we need to get them in place, and to put them
in. You can't put troops in place that don't have any equipment, because then they just get killed off. So all we're trying to do is fit them out, give people what they need, help them get what they need--we can't give it to them, we can help them try to get it—and 1 suppose that has to do with the whole business of fundamental change that I'm talking about.
My husband and I have differences about this. I think that he is more present-oriented than I am. H.e really is the kind of person who says, "Let's help somebody today. Let's try to help somebody today." Because I think he has less hope about changing the system, and I say that I feel that it's all down the drain, if all we do is help today, because you're on a treadmill. It will always be to do. So this other piece of it you've got to work at, all the time, too. We have big arguments about that. It's a matter, I think, of orientation, philosophy, temperament; he's very impatient, very impatient. Very impatient with talk. Well, I get impatient with talk, too, but I also feel strongly that, you know, you've got to have some kinds of dialogue, and that people who are trying to work together need to understand one another, and you keep needing to add to that, you know, the good old spiral theory of change. We start with an idea here, but you've got to add those loops so you build up some pressure, because if you're out there by yourself, you can forget it.
CG: I can see, in terms of what you do every day, and what kinds of broad areas. . .
MS: Yes, well, I'm working on a lot of levels, and I feel frustrated, really.
But I'm tired now, of course you know, I've been at this a long time. When I was younger I didn't quite feel the same kind of...I'm still enthusiastic, but I don't really have the energy. I would make five meetings in a day; now I say that's stupid for me to do that. I will make three. I can't make five. For example, tonight, I don't see any way of going to Babson tonight, because I not only have these other meetings that I have today, but I don't have transportation. So that I'm really stymied, in terms of getting to Wellesley. But I have attended meetings that started early in the morning... Yesterday I started at the bank at 11:30; I didn't leave the bank until 4:00, because I'm not only on the board of directors, and they met from 11:30 to 1:30, and then have lunch, and I'm also on the urban affairs committee of the bank which met from 2:00 to 4:00. And then where did I go? Well, then I stopped by my daughter's and I came back home.﻿20
MS: (cont.) By then I'm tired, so I rest for a couple of hours. If I can sleep for a couple of hours, I can get a second wind.
Talk about my day, I'm a lark. I'm good in the morning, I feel energetic, I'm bright and sharp and whatnot, I run down in the middle of the day, and I believe, incidentally, I believe in flex time. I believe that people should work hours when they are most productive. I don't know how, my husband argues with me, you know, how are you ever going to achieve it. "Nothing will run." I maintain that things will run, and there will be more productivity if people are able to work according to their body time and according to some kind of flex time program. And I also see it as working more for women, in terms of responsibilities that they may want to carry out. The assumption is that women don't want to do these things. Frankly, if I had nothing else to do, I'm a pretty good cook, and I enjoy it as a kind of creativity...
CG: Right.
MS: in cooking, all right? You know, the challenge of cooking, and starting, and coming up with something new, and also if you belive that giving of food is an expression of love, there are all these things that you would be doing, but you cannot do them, you cannot do all these things at the same time and do them all equally well. Something has to suffer. I'm wondering why it is not possible for people to do many more things well, if the arrangements are such that they can.
CG: You mean more flexible?
MS: Yes. You know? This whole business of people being able to work at home, I think there are certain kinds of things that can be done at home. Sure, if you're on a machine, you're not going to be able to work at home. Or- if you're a secretary who has responsibilities to another person, you have to be physically present where that person is, then sure you cannot work at home. But you could take some of the work home, after it's dictated, or whatnot and do it, probably get it done that much faster. But for people like me, when I have a lot of creative kinds of things to do, it's very important for me to work at home, so that many mornings, when you asked me, what was a typical day, I may not even come in here until late afternoon, or not come at all. That's the day that I can do in one hour what it takes me five hours to do all week, because I don't have all that running in and out, and telephone and all that to deal with.
If at some point I can see, and I'm getting down the road now, don't have as many years ahead as I have behind, that at some point we're going to have to think about the transition for Freedom House. Somebody's going to have to take over. We're not going to be here forever. We'd like to see Freedom House stand; I think it has a capability of standing as an institution of its own. That it is not solely dependent upon the personalities and the energies and thrusts of the Snowdens. If that's all it is, I'll be very disappointed in it, because you're not leaving very much behind, and I would really like to see Freedom House go on. I think the philosophy is valid, it's a viable institution. But if I'm going to move from this, I think that my tendency would be to move into more things that are related to women. I don't know where—you've got age, you've got a whole lot of﻿21
MS: (cont.) things. You've got age stereotypes and you have barriers. But I would like to think of doing a couple kinds of things. Number one would be actively working in women's stuff...
I don't know whether I'm really talking about paid employment; I think that that's still important, to earn something at your work. I have a whole lot of problems with volunteerism, particularly as it relates to women, and whether or not that's not a trick bag, and exploitation that works to the detriment of women. So I don't know quite where I would like to become involved. I thought many times that I would like to go live at Radcliffe, and take time out at the institute and write a book or two, or at least a monograph or something. I feel that there are a whole lot of more in-depth kinds of things about being black and female, and what you're able to do in something like this, that I would like to get down on paper. Travel is very important to me; I don't know whether I will have enough money to do it, but I enjoy going other places, learning from other cultures. I'm excited about what goes on in Africa these days, and I like going back. Three trips and I'd like to make another, I may go in July, I'm not sure, but I think there's a great deal... There's so much to living, and there are other things that I have never had time to do. I'd like to see that the period of still being physically active and whatnot devoted in that way.
I've given up on "retirement." If Mrs. Cass cannot retire into elder stateswomanhood, I don't see how I can. I don't think for us there's any such thing, where you just sort of are around for consultation and advice. I think a big problem is that we have... Well, in Boston, you've got a limited number of black people, so in terms of the population, there is leadership here, there's no question about the fact that there are very talented black people in Boston, but the problem is that you're pulled in so many different directions at the same time. You know, it's like health today, education tomorrow, welfare the next day, whatever, that you're living a very fragmented kind of life. The people who are the planners and the thinkers also have to be the implementers, and that's asking a hell of a lot. So I sit down in a committee meeting...what do I do? Talk about my day? We sit down in a committee meeting, and we decide that these are the things that need to be done. There ain't no way that you can hand all of that over to somebody else and say, the best brains around here decided that this is what we need to do, and we need to have it done, and the next echelon people are going to carry it out. You sit down and you plan it all out, and then you do it. Which means that you don't have, I guess one of the shortcomings, it's a shortfall of our community, is that so many things that we anticipate, and been ahead of the game, and thought about, and knew were coming, we've not been able to do anything about it, because we haven't had enough person power to carry it out. Well, we^ knew desegregation was coming, we've known that, what was the last thing... there was just something the other day that we were talking about having anticipated.
In June we had an "Ad Hoc Assembly on Desegregation in Boston," which Freedom House Institute, in cooperation with Northeastern, pulled together to try to get black people in this town together, to talk about the impact of deseg on black people. The theme was how to achieve education equity for black children under desegregation. You know, we weren't solely concerned﻿22
(cont.) with the transportation piece. In the process of sitting down talking about that, we talked about employment, straight throughout the school system, and the need to desegregate the total system, including the School Committee. The other thing had to do with the impact of national political movements on us here in Boston. So they talked about the candidacy of Jimmy Carter and how you're going to get some things in place. But we were never able...we've got this beautiful report that we did. The report has not been published, it's never been printed up, and it never had a follow-up. And I am distressed about it because I worked so damn hard to put that conference together and to try to make it possible.
Trying to put the stuff in motion, even though we know names all along the way, that there are plenty of people in Boston who are fully aware of what the problems are, but that we just have not been able... Even for example, Cheryl, there should not be this great division between black people in Cambridge and black people in Boston. That's a foreign territory over there. It was a foreign territory when I was working there. You know, I was really schizophrenic, that part of me was in Roxbury and part in Cambridge, but really two very different kinds of experiences for me. There is a whole business of talented young black people who are now living in suburban communities. There oughta be a mechanism, because I stoutly maintain that the black community is psychological and not geographical, that there is a need to keep those young people who are on the move related to the rest of the black people who are stuck in inner city and who need their help. We need to be imaginative and creative about the ways in which we ask them to help. Now I'm not saying, "You have to sacrifice and live here." If they've got children, they need better schools; we can't ask them to make that kind of a sacrifice. But there must be, there's got to be some way, and they're looking for it—they always say they're anxious, they want to know what's going on in town. How do you find a way for them to relate? I think we've gotta do more and we've gotta do more than jus't talking about role models, because so many times that's unrealistic.
My daughter was in that youth incentive program or something, and she went around to schools to talk about getting into banks, you know, black people in banking. She's alert enough and aware enough and astute enough to say, "It does not make that much sense for me to go. If you look at my own background, and the fact that my mother went to Radcliffe—we've got ten Harvard/Radcliffe degrees in our family—that I went to college, I've had all kinds of advantages. I started with a foot up on the ladder. For me to go down and talk to kids and tell them, 'I did it, you can do it,' is just plain nonsense. It makes more sense for somebody who comes out of that environment, who has made it, to go back and say, 'I did it and I've come from exactly the same background you come from.'"
That is how to?
This is how to, that does not mean that people who have advantages don't have a responsibility, but how do you use them more constructively, productively, and intelligently? During the explosion in Roxbury, I long ago felt that I would be the biggest phony. I don't talk street language...
You're talking about the sixties?﻿23
MS: In 1967. I don't talk street language. I wasn't brought up that way. I find that people who, particularly among whites who can talk that jargon, that kind of lanugage, and being hip and all that, they come off so phony, that I would come off in exactly the same way. I cannot go down Blue Hill Avenue and say, "Hey baby," and all like that; that is not me. And the first people to recognize it are those people that you're supposed to be trying to relate to, so I don't do that; I let somebody else do it who does it better. That does not mean that whatever background that I've had that could be used, that somebody else can use in reaching people, should not be used. If I remove myself entirely, then they've lost the benefit of what I know, and I've also lost the opportunity to stay in touch. If you get out of touch, which is also one reason why here we try very hard—and it may not be good administration and we've been criticized for it, are you going to be administrators or are you going to be the people who run around—we really try to remain accessible to people. If you call on the phone and you want to speak to us, we try if we possibly can, if a person really insists and if it can't be handled somewhere else. Or if somebody comes in off the streets, often people come in off the street without an appointment—we have to do a little screening on that 'cause they can take up all your time. But you never let it be that you can't talk to somebody about something that is of concern to them, either on the phone or in person. We do not have an unlisted phone. And as long as we're in this business...
CG: Do people call you at home at various hours of the day and night?
MS: They call at home, and we have an extension of the Freedom House phone at home, and particularly when there's a crisis kind of situation, we turn that phone on. There's one downstairs, and one in the bedroom that we put in after we had the fire at Freedom House, and we were out of there for a year. We had to have a phone, so we put in the extension to Freedom House. We have an extension of the phone upstairs and that phone is on Saturdays and Sundays, holidays, whenever, so that some of these people can reach us, and people have felt that that was one of the things that was a strength about Freedom House. If they couldn't reach anybody else, they'd call us. They used to call CORE, or they'd call the NAACP or one of the "strip agencies," and couldn't get any help, but they'd call Freedom House and somebody would answer. It's not always true now. It was much more true back in the early days, but it's not as true now. But our phone is not unlisted, so if anybody really wants to get to us, they can and with Otto now in the Boston Housing Authority, he gets lots of calls at home.
CG: Does he get calls at like 5:30 in the morning?
MS : oh, yes.
CG: Very late at night?
MS: Oh, yes. We have a hotline. There are about twenty of us on a hotline
so that in any kind of an emergency situation, they have both home numbers and business numbers, and the agreement is that no matter what time of day or night, if there is a need, we are willing to have calls made.﻿24
CG: But it's that kind of philosophy that's very antithetical to the general philosophy of the successful person in American life. You're supposed to distance yourself as much as possible.
MS: But if you distance yourself, you're killing yourself, really. You're not really doing, you're out of touch; therefore you are not effective. You don't know what you're doing because your ear isn't close enough to the ground.
CG: I see what you mean.
MS: And I've got a 1:00 meeting with my staff, and I've got to put
some stuff together because Otto's not going to be there until about one 1:30 or 2:00, and of course we kind of pinch-hit for one another. As I say, I think that it's important to note the atypical aspects of my life.
CG: Can I ask you one other quick question? Because a lot of these other questions you've already answered. Heroes or heroine living or dead?
MS: I don't know, I think people like, you know...you really draw your
inspiration from, you think of somebody like Mary Bethune, and again that MIT thing I gave, I do consider in many ways, although nobody's said so, that somehow you're a caretaker and a transmitter of the basic philosophy of Martin Luther King. I've had people in the Urban League movement who... it's Lester Granger and Harold Lett, people who were in the Urban League, who were mentors and who helped me to get a philosophy of living crystallized. I don't really think I think about heroes and heroines. I've never really thought very much about it, knowing that you owe a lot to other people. I don't think I've ever really sat down and just identified, I'd have to think about that one.
CG: But just the ones that you talked about, off the top of your head, the Urban League people, matches your biography and some of the things that you've been doing. I'm trying to choose between two quick questions. I guess I'll ask you the one about black women in particular. You started off the interview by saying the problem of being a black woman in America, black and female in America. What are some of the most important problems, do you think?
MS: Well, it has to do with your—what is it somebody once said? Because you are black you're no less female; because you're female, you're no less black. So that we've got the double whammy to deal with. My concern is that I think that black women have a stake, for example, in the women's movement, at the point that it deals with personhood. Because black women are women and so they're going to suffer both the second class status of being black and the second class or whatever class status of being female.
We have to get ourselves straightened out in terms of where we fit in the women's movement. And I think that one has to be careful that as black poeple move up the economic ladder, as Linda LaRue said, that black women don't start moving into the warmed-over throne that white women are vacating. That "back to the kitchen" movement and "back in the home" and all that, saying that black women have been out of their homes and they want to be in the home and white women are trying to get out—that's too﻿25
MS: (cont.) simplistic, because I don't think that's what black women are all about. I think they want to be treated just like the equals and partners as they've always been, and they want to share the burden; they don't want to be carrying it by themselves.
CG: Right. Right! We've had a lot of that, [laughter]
[Part Two]
MS: Name? Muriel Sophronia Sutherland Snowden, all right? I was born
July 14, 1916, which makes me sixty-one, almost sixty-one and a half, all right? And I was born in Orange, New Jersey. My parents were William H. and Reiter Sutherland. My father was a dentist, graduated from Howard Dental School in 1905; he and my mother were married in 1906 and there were four children, one of whom died almost immediately after birth. My sister is the oldest and interestingly enough, her name is Reiter Lucinda Thomas, which was my mother's maiden name, that's her married name. Then there was a boy who lived only five days. He died of convulsions. My mother's mother died just before she was about to deliver—this is what I hear—and the shock was so great to her that apparently it had some kind of a negative impact. It was very traumatic and this boy didn't live. So there's a nine-year gap between my sister and me, I'm the next child. And then my brother was born. Reiter's birthday is 1908, January 23, 1908, so that makes her almost seventy, doesn't it? And my brother was the baby, born on December 24, what, he'll be fifty-eight, fifty-nine. He'll be fifty-nine in December, how's your arithmetic, whatever, he's two and a half years younger than I am, that's the family. I think I may have told you sometime before that my mother's father came to live with us.
CG: Now what was your mother's maiden name?
MS: My mother's maiden name was Thomas. Her father's name was John Ira
Thomas, and we know a little bit about him because he lived with us, and he died when he was ninety-five. He died the day before my Gail was born. He tried to wait for her, I think I told you this, and one Sunday he said to me, "I don't think I'm going to make it," he said, "I'm trying to wait for that baby of yours, but I'm not going to make it." So that we had a sense of continuity. He used to tell us stories about being in the Indian wars and being at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and about his own background of being born of a slave mother on a plantation in Virginia. He came to live with my family because his wife had died, and my mother was after him to come because he was still living in Washington, and he said, "Reiter, I will come only when you have a son." Shows something about his chauvinistic attitude—she had two daughters. But when my brother was born, he came to live with us in Orange, New Jersey, and he lived with us from then until the time he died. When my brother was born and was to be christened, his name officially was to be William Henry Sutherland, Jr., after my father. My grandfather said, "No, he's going to have to be named after me." So Bill's full name of record is William Henry John Sutherland, Jr., and as long as my grandfather lived, he never called Bill anything but John.
A strong sense of family.﻿26
MS: Right. Well, I think that the thing was that my grandfather had only two children, my mother and a son. When his son was about ten or eleven years old—they lived in Ivy City in Washington—he was hopping on the back of a wagon or something and he fell and was killed. So that for my grandfather, this grandson was so important to take the place of a son who never grew up. At my grandfather's knee, my brother learned all the kinds of things that I think have been so important to him and his life. He was strongly religious, my grandfather was strongly religious, read the Bible every day. He was very, very alert, very much like Otto's father. He never lost any of his senses even though he was ninety-five, and he had rheumatism and he had asthma, but he was as straight as a ramrod. I have pictures of him, handsome gentleman and very, very warm and understanding, always reached out to the children— that's my sister and my brother-in-law. My grandfather was easier to talk with about problems than our parents. Of course it's always the business of the generations. Grandpa didn't have to discipline us, but he was there and flexible, you know, like he voted for Roosevelt. A lifelong Republican, and he decided that when Mr. Roosevelt came in, that he meant something good for black people, and whatever age it was, this was a great change for him, he voted for Roosevelt.
My sister has three sons, three grandsons, and I have one granddaughter, and my one daughter, Gail. Gail was born on July 5, 1945, and Leigh is now four, she was born October 11, what is that, 1973. Well, that's the family, the immediate family.
CG: Do you ever have family reunions?
MS: Well, there are family reunions, but we're just getting into family reunions that we're going to be part of, because of the whole thing that Era Bell Thompson did on the family, the Nigerian family. Didn't . I tell you about this? Era Bell Thompson, international editor of Ebony, did that story in February of 175 on a "Tale of Two Continents." And it was a story of two families, the American family and the African family that had been in touch with each other over a hundred-year span. All right? It's the Scipio Vaughan family, Carter, and we're on the American side of that family. I'm still trying to find out exactly what the relationship is. Era Bell never could get it straight.
CG: You're also related to Jewel LaFontant.
MS: Yes, Jewel is my cousin. I just saw her when I was in Washington at the National Urban League Conference, and when I was in Chicago the end of September, I meant to call her. Jewel and Ayo-Vaughan Richards are counterparts—she's the Nigerian who's the head of nursing, I'm not sure what her title is, in Lagos. And Jewel has been there to visit her, so there's been this kind of cross relationship that's still continuing after a hundred years. There have been gatherings of the Vaughan Carter clan and Bill, my brother, has taken part in some of them, but he is very anxious for us to get related to that total family group again. The thing that was so exciting to me was that when Era Bell was doing her research, she kept naming all of these people, and I said, "Those are people that I have called "cousin" all of my life," my father's family, and the thing that I think I'm trying... You see, my mother tended to be..﻿27
MS: (cont.) She was from Washington, D.C., and she belonged to that way
of thinking about color and class, which said that you don't want to be tied in with black people in that way. So that when my father talked about his cousin from Africa, she would say that we don't want to talk about it, so we never really did. We did meet one of them, Ada Carter, and she was a Nigerian relative who came to visit the Carters in New York, with whom we were in constant touch.
There is this whole business of finding out what the cousin thing is, and I've still not found out exactly. I went to Washington to the Urban League meeting, and while I was there I went to visit my eighth-year-old cousin, whose mother and father were the people that I felt must have raised my father, 'cause he seemed to be very close to them. Even from him, I cannot get out what was my father's exact relationship to Sallie Lee and Gene Dibble, his mother and father. Incidentally, Era Bell indicated that Sallie Lee is a direct descendant of Scipio Vaughan. Eugene Dibble whom she married, there's some question whether or not they were cousins, so the family gets into this overlap thing, and then there were all kinds of things going on. There were six children of the Sallie Lee-Gene Dibble union, and when my father comes into this, I don't know. But he used to take us to Camden when we were little, South Carolina, to visit with the Dibbles summer after summer after summer. And I knew Cousin Sallie and Cousin Gene, but my father never really talked about his parents.
Now I was named for his mother, Sophronia. I have cussed him out many times for that name [laughter], which I have dropped, and you'll never see Sophronia in anything that I have, you know it'll be Muriel Sutherland Snowden, to hang on to the family name. But that Sophronia always bothered me, and then he told me that I was named for his mother, but I don't really know anything about it. My grandfather on my mother's side, John I. Thomas, his mother was a slave. His grandmother, as far as we're able to tell and he used to say, she was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. So we're part of that strange mixture of white, Indian, and black which is found all over the Caribbean. When I went to Puerto Rico, I had people following me around, speaking Spanish, and my saying, you know, I don't really understand Spanish, and they looked at me askance because obviously I looked like a Puerto Rican.
You should.
But that's the immediate family.
CG: It's a rich, rich heritage.
Ms: Well, roots, roots. I just did a little monograph. Every now and then, I sit down when something strikes me and I write it up. But I wrote this piece up after I had seen "Roots" on television and there was so much talk about it. And the thing that I said was—it didn't have anything to do with my family roots as such—but I said that I felt that when I was the only black kid in the class in high school, well, there were no black children in Glen Ridge where I grew up. We were the only black family for a long time. There was another one that lived on the edge of Glen Ridge and Montclair. Incidentally, we moved from Orange, New Jersey. My father﻿28
MS: (cont.) was practicing in Orange, and my mother was very unhappy because Orange was beginning to show all the symptoms of a ghetto community, and she wanted to get herself and her kids out of there. So they looked and looked and looked for a house, and she finally found one she liked in Glen Ridge. A thirteen-room house sitting smack in the middle of three-quarters of an acre of land, with an orchard and all kinds of flowers and trees. It was a very beautiful house. And my father, who loved her dearly, said, "If that's what you want, dear, that's what we'll get." And so he bought the house. And the first memory I have, conscious memory of anything, I would have been two and a half...
CG: That would have been around World War I.
MS: The first conscious memory I have of that, of anything really, was going to look at that house and going through it at night with my family and remembering the stairs. There were two steps on the second floor that led down to the bathroom, and there was a little closet there, and I was intrigued by this kind of an arrangement. I can remember that, I can almost see us running through that house and up the stairs. It was a very elegant house. But Glen Ridge had never had any black people living in that community and they were very resistant. We bought through a "straw" and moved in at night. I didn't know that at age two and a half, not till later. But then we found out that there had been all kinds of town meetings, what were they going to do about the black family that moved in? They were very genteel about it, this was before, they didn't burn any crosses or anything on the front lawn, but they were very distressed and didn't really know what to do about the family. And then when we moved into, my father moved his practice from Orange, but for a while he ran two offices, one in Orange and one in Bloomfield, which was the next town. But they saw that there was a family, and my father immediately started fixing up and renovating, and people were kind of hard put to keep up with the improvements that he was making on his property, which is the old story about black people always overcompensating, moving in and not providing any kind of problem. But I started to say something else and went into that, this memory. What was I saying?
CG: You were talking about being the only one in school and relating back to roots. . .
MS: So living in this kind of town where there were no black people, naturally my family, the children in my family, were the only black children in the schools, and they were very good schools. The high school was the seventh best high school in the United States. A very small community, Glen Ridge is a quarter of a mile wide and something like three miles long, a little bedroom community, very wealthy people living there, working in New York. The public schools were extraordinary, really good, so that when we were in high school and I had a history teacher, and I think it was probably in high school because we were studying American history, that when we came to the period of slavery, there was so much obvious discomfort in the classroom. There was a kind of a tension, the teacher felt it; the students felt it; I felt it. And there was a kind of looking, you know, sort of looking at me to see how I was taking it. I said that what I felt Roots was all about, is that if I had had Roots in my background, instead of them looking at me, I'd have been looking at them to see how they were﻿29
MS: (cont.) handling the guilt that they should have felt about the way the
white people had treated black people during the slavery and Reconstruction period. There's a little monograph that I wrote on this, because I felt so strongly about it, and why I feel that somehow the whole content of Roots needs to be adapted for inclusion in public school curriculum straight throughout the country. But I'm also very concerned that it not be done the way the television program was done, but that some black people, knowledgeable black people, good educators, can take the essence of Roots and put it into a form that'll be used for both black kids and white kids, without providing the sops to whites that the television program seemed to have to do...
CG: Because I was glad I had read the book first before...
MS: Oh, there were so many things in it that just drove me crazy. I spoke to Alex about it because he did do the editing and he was the consultant on it, but he was very vague, and I guess everybody recognizes that in order to do certain kinds of things, you have to make deals. He did say that he had written in the original the captain of the ship, the slaveship, but that he had taken that character out, because he was writing from the standpoint of Kunta Kinte and how did he know that this man was going through all this emotional turmoil, you know, so he took the character out, so that he said it wasn't that far afield.
CG: I did not watch all of it on television.
MS: I missed one segment, that was the night that Muhammad Ali did the benefit for Elma Lewis, so I was there. What else do we need from the early background?
CG: You discussed how you happened to go to Radcliffe. I'm trying to think-.-we discussed your situation in terms of the movie theaters and going for ice cream. You mentioned that briefly in your other interview with me, do you want to expand a little on it, what your parents did to protect you...
MS: I think we talked about that in terms of...
CG: Your parents tried to provide opportunities for you...
MS: The strength to cope... Well, moving was one kind of thing. Trying to
move into a community where the schools were good, where the neighborhood environment was healthy, all of this, you know, just normal kinds of things. Plus I think there was an element of snobbery in it for my mother. She just was anxious to get out of Orange, it was too much for her to deal with, and she was concerned about what kinds of people her children would be associating with. I think it was just very normal for parents in that generation, that it was a kind of upward mobility and that they constantly looked towards how do we make life better for their children, and they were very much into the, you know, "white is right" kind of syndrome, and getting us far away from black people.
CG: How did you react to those statements, did your mother ever make any direct statements to you as a child or...﻿30
MS: About?
CG: About class, color...
MS: Well, she always tended to talk about black people, black in color, in derogatory terms. I don't think I have any specific kind of things, I know that I was aware of it. The interesting thing to me is how we made the overleap to get away from it, and I'm not sure. I can remember, and this was part of the society in which we traveled, having, I think I told you this, this tremendous argument among my mother's friends about Paul Robeson. Paul Robeson had been to our house. I guess we had been to see him in summer theater; he was doing Othello in Maplewood, which is another town closeby. They had good summer theater. We went to see him, my mother knew him, and I can remember this man coming out of his dressing room because he was so big and the dressing room was so small that there was no room in it for him and for us. He stepped outside and I don't know how old I was, I have no way of remembering that, but I was just overwhelmed by this giant of a man with his magnificent voice. And when later we were talking about the play, and there was some other woman there, and I said, "I thought that Paul Robeson was just about the handsomest man I had ever seen," and they jumped all over me with both feet. How could anybody that black be handsome, how can you think of him in terms of good looks? So I must have been into an area of consciousness then about not accepting white Anglo-Saxon skin as beauty. So I probably was in high school, because this was where I think you would begin to get this sense.
But in the early days, you asked about how we would cope. When we moved to Glen Ridge and we started going to school, that's when we had the first immediate exposure to prejudice and for me it was pretty much, oh, I told you this stuff, the kid that went to kindergarten with me every day... she was from Tennessee and couldn't walk to school with me anymore after the first or second grade because "she was from Tennessee." Then when my brother started school and he was two years behind me, he had a first grade teacher who was from Virginia. That's the first grade teacher who didn't want him to wear the tonic on his hair. The third grade for me is another kind of thing that sticks out in my mind. I was going to be in a play, and that's when after going through all the rehearsals and everything, and I was all excited about being in it, at the last minute the teacher told me I wasn't going to be in it. And that's when my mother came around to the school and blasted everybody in the school out of the place. My mother had a very fiery temper, a very short fuse and she was really the original mother hen, you know, don't touch her chicks. And if you came near, she would fly into a temper like you've never seen before, she had a wicked temper. But she scared those people around there, I don't think she even took off her apron. We didn't live far from school and she walked, flying around to the school with her apron strings in the wind to get this teacher told. "You never do this to my child." And I think I told you the questions, when I asked her what was a nigger—this little girl was talking about niggers and she lived in Tennessee. She simply said that they are very ignorant people and you need to feel sorry for people who use words like this. All right, I think that this was probably one of the classic, the standard ways for black parents to help their kids with their own identity and not to get overwhelmed with the inferiority piece.﻿31
MS: (cont.) But going to school from then on in, we got special attention, the Sutherland kids were special, they were "exceptions." Their father was a professional man, we were obviously well off, we had two cars, all the children were extraordinarily well dressed. We had books in my household, we had good music in my household. Therefore, from the standpoint of the people in the community, it wasn't really that difficult to become accepting, at least superficially. Plus the fact that I was fairly quick and could learn fast and so there was a big push. My brother kept saying he felt, he said, "I used to feel sorry for you because I thought you were being pushed," and I said to him—this was just recently—I said, "I don't remember being pushed. I really enjoyed school." I enjoyed the competition, and I enjoyed being number one. I stayed number one all the way through until I graduated from high school as valedictorian. The blow came when the boy who was salutatorian met a friend of mine who was very fair, at college. And not knowing that this boy was black, they got into a conversation about where the salutatorian had come from. He said he came from Glen Ridge, and this boy said to him, "Oh, you must know Muriel Sutherland," and he said, "Yes, I knew her." "Well, what was she like?" And he said, "Just another nigger wench." And I think about that boy, I boil now because all through school, we were in the same classroom from kindergarten through graduation from high school. We had studied together, on the phone together and I always felt involved with him. I really wasn't thinking race, I was thinking a friend. We were in competition, and maybe it was because he lost out on the valedictorian, that his attitude was such that he had to downgrade me in some way when he was talking about it later. But I still remember that, that really got under my skin.
But I did enjoy that competition and my father and mother were both, as I say, very protective. Whether it was around that whole business of not being able to sit where you wanted to, the theater in Bloomfield, being shunted over to the side where they sent all black people. Well, when we, came in, we were never shunted aside after my father went in there and blew up. Getting the ice cream, we just didn't go back to that place even though...we blasted them again because, as I told you, when we were all dressed up on Sunday, we'd go to this little place, Delcrest or whatever it was called, to get ice cream and to be told you can't eat it here. These little snips who looked at you and told you you couldn't eat the ice cream, so we went back home and told our parents and they were always there. Particularly my mother. Mama had a lot more fire than my father. My father was very easygoing, very warm. I did the eulogy for him and my brother did it for my mother. My mother died in 1950 and my father died in 1951. Although people today tend to do this kind of thing, it was kind of unheard of then. But the Sutherlands are a very strong-minded people, as my husband will tell you, and we decided that we didn't want people talking about our parents, who didn't know them.
CG: Right.
MS: So that when Bill did it for Mama, he talked about Mama in terms of being fire and thunder and lightning and how her temper flared, but also what she meant to us. And then when I did it for my father, I talked about my father as a community person who had led a drive for the YMCA building, and he went to meetings all the time on Sundays and sometimes he took us back to﻿32
MS: (cont.) Orange. By the way, he was the one that kept the bridge going between the old community and the new. I don't think he felt as comfortable in Glen Ridge as my mother did.
My mother made this leap from Glen Ridge then to New York and Brooklyn, to the in-migrants from Washington as the contact for her children. You talk about how you establish a...she knew that we could not make it in a white world that had these social barriers. She wasn't really concerned so much about that; she was concerned about our going to school, getting a good education. She graduated from high school and went to Hampton and took millinery. My father, of course, had gone to professional school, but you didn't go to college then, remember, you went straight into dental school. So that this whole business of a drive for a good educational background and college was of tremendous concern to her. So that's what she wanted out of Glen Ridge, and a beautiful home which she could show off to her friends. But then, for social life she began calling her friends in Brooklyn and New York and those that had children our age, these were the people with whom I first began, when I got to dating age and stuff. This is where I began to make my contacts. Like I told you. Well, I had a friend in Orange, a girl in Orange that was a friend of mine when I was thirteen, fourteen, but in terms of getting involved in that social group, the first contact that I had in that direction was in my home. Lena's grandmother and my mother were very good friends, so Mama kept talking about, "Well, you know, Muriel doesn't know very many girls," and Mrs. Home said, "Well, you know, Lena is a part of the Junior Debs of Brooklyn." So Lena came over and visited and I can see her now, lying across my bed, giving me a run-down on all the members of the Junior Debs. Her descriptions were very accurate. She was wonderful; she proposed my name, and I became a member of this social group. If whatever there is in black society that's the 400s, this is it and this is where I started out.
CG: who else do you remember as being in that group?
MS: Well, there was Theresa Birnie, Dr. Birnie's daughter in Brooklyn; Catherine Chestnut, Catherine and Laurie Chestnut, they were from Washington. I think most of these people came from Washington, I don't know about the Birnies. They tended to be fair, if you noticed, the coloring of the Junior Debs was generally pretty fair. I would guess that maybe Lena and I were the darkest ones in the room. Oh no, there were a couple of girls who were brown, but they were all professional people's children, primarily lawyers, doctors. They had status and they were economically comfortable, so it was an interesting group of people. But my friend, Ellen Craft, was not in that group, 'cause she lived in New York. But there was a kind of relationship between the New York society and the Brooklyn society and once in a while they would cross. I don't know if I told you, I met Ellen because some of the Brooklyn kids decided they'd go to Ellen's house. They heard there was a party going on, and they crashed the party, and that's when I met her, at her house. And somehow or other, I really don't know what the progression was, but we gravitated towards one another and we've been friends over all these years.
Chestnut is a name that stands out in my mind.﻿33
MS: Oh, I think that you'd probably find it in this group, that there would be a lot of people who come out of... Well, you know, like Jimmy Carter who was Colonel Young's grandson. Jimmy was in that New York crowd; I'd met Jimmy when he went to Bates, and then he came to B.U. law school, but there was that kind of social grouping, you know, it was like Houston and who else...
Well, I did have a cousin, and again I don't know what the relationship, how it stems, what degree of "cousinry" there is, but Roscoe Conklin Bruce, he was a black senator during the Reconstruction and his son married Clara Burrill who was my mother's cousin. I don't know about the relationship...how close it was. But she is the woman, as I told you before, who went to Radcliffe, Clara Burrill Bruce. She was the one that went to Radcliffe and who inspired me with the idea of going to Radcliffe, and staying with that from the third grade up. And she was the one who helped me write my valedictory speech. And that was a very extraordinary family...her side, Clara Burrill's side, there are the Burrills of Washington and are tied in with Mary Church Terrell and all of that crowd. It's something I was talking about with a friend of mine, that in the old days, that there was a kind of relationship among black people, you know, this network. Those that could afford it and who could manage to escape the 'ban's" foot on your neck all the time, but there was this kind of... You did it through the fraternities, you did it through the professional societies, and you did it through your social relationships, so you could travel all over the country and you always knew somebody.
CG: Was your father a member of a fraternity?
MS: No, I don't know...I think it was some kind of dental fraternity.
CG: He graduated in 1905...
MS: I don't know when the fraternities began. He belonged to the dental society...
CG: it was just at that time, right in that period was when national
organizations and professional organizations and fraternities begin to...
MS: Right. I don't think that this would have been... He kept up with his dentistry, but I don't think that he would have been particularly interested in that kind of thing. That would have been more my mother's speed, big sororities, you know, she would have been gung-ho. As a matter of fact, she was very interested in my joining a sorority, and I joined the AKAs when I was in college, under duress. At that time, I was not really into the idea of sororities, and I was annoyed at sorority and fraternity shenanigans. So I joined because of social pressure, not because of any desire of mine to be involved. And I've never been active. I think I paid my initiation fee, never bought a pin, never did anything and there have been people...and I know that the AKAs have done some extraordinarily good work and so have the Deltas. And I think that I just got too far out into my own life to come back into it, although I'm hoping to go see Colored Girls with the AKAs. They've got a block of seats for the opening night, so I want to go to that. I think I'll go.﻿34
CG: Are they still selling tickets for that?
MS: What, for opening night? You can get them through these...Sheila Banks, and you know Carmen Fields?
CG: I don't know her personally, but I know who she...
MS: Well, Carmen and Sheila, apparently, are the people from whom tickets
can be bought, and they asked me, and I got a letter and forget when it is, November something or other.
CG: Carmen spoke at Mrs. Crawford's testimonial.
MS: The what?
CG: We had a testimonial for her...
MS: I think I was awav. When did she die?
CG: She died in November of...
MS: Well, 'cause I think that that was, you know I was getting ready to go to Africa, and I knew about it and that I just couldn't... I was very fond of Glennie; she was very supportive of us.
CG: she was the beginning, she was the beginning spot for my thesis.
MS: Really? That's very exciting!
CG: And that's who it's dedicated to.
MS: Good, good. Let's go back to something, because I don't want... You know, I said something about birthday and my concern at this point, at my age, looking back over a span of time. It's not ninety and it's not a hundred and five like some of the other women proposed in the project, but I have real concern now about reaching to age. You know, you do some talking to yourself. I can remember at age forty, bolstering myself up with "life begins at forty," and then, because I think that I was fortunate enough to maybe look ten years younger than I ever was at any given moment, that I began to say, well you know, old will be ten years older than I ever am. And I think now I'm really into a posture that says I do not intend to be defeated by age stereotypes, that if you put down just cold, Muriel Snowden, age sixty-one, you have one kind of picture that comes in your mind and it ain't me. All right? So that now I'm beginning to say, like if you say it enough, then you begin to get comfortable about it. So now I don't have an hesitancy at all in talking publicly to groups and saying, after a span of sixty-one years of being black and female in American white society, this is how I feel. And I get a boot now out of the kind of gasp that goes up when I say I'm sixty-one. Because it just does not jive with what people in this youth-oriented society are used to thinking about sixty-one-year-olds.
The second piece has to do with my own looking forward, and that if I let myself think that I'm a sixty-one-year-old matron with all that that used to imply, with the fur neckpiece and the hat and the gloves, then I'm﻿35
MS: (cont.) going to do something to myself. So I was just talking to my husband this morning about where do we go from here. And I think about all the things that we know and how do we share them, what should we do? I said maybe we should make more of our consultant operation, we have a Snowden Associates; we have only one client, so maybe we should make more of that, helping black people move into positions of power. We know black people who are perfectly competent and able to contribute to being on boards of directors of the important kinds of power groups in this country. Where those power groups just look like they want to be a little more inclusive, they need somebody to help them, and we could do that.
I think about a school like Babson, that has a lot of money that's available for scholarships for black students. Babson needs somebody who will help them recruit black kids, particularly from this area. And they also need somebody who will provide, as I am doing now, names of people who might made good corporation members, who would make good trustees. I am a corporation member at Babson. I see this as a particular kind of responsibility that I have. George Johnson in Chicago is sponsoring a black girl at Babson. He graduated from Babson and he was their commencement speaker this past year. That means that there is one lone individual that they seem to turn to for help, and so the black kids at Babson tend to come out of the Midwest, 'cause George Johnson's doing a damn good job. But you know, there has to be more than that, and Babson's only one school. Being on the Board of Overseers at Harvard now, I've got to decide, you know, how am I going to make some kind of 'an impact on this highly symbolic group of the old boy network. You know, how am I going to do it?
Well, this is in my head now, but I do feel that people need to take another look at their attitude towards age. I think for women it's particularly important, because this whole society tends to portray women in television, you know, you're a sex symbol and youth and beauty and clear skin and Murine in the eyes or whatever. These are all the things that you get clobbered with all the time. And even in a fashion show, how many times do you see fashions for the mature woman? This is just not in the thinking. So that I think you have to make a conscious effort to resist what is being thrown at us through the commercials, through the media, through whatever, or even through attitudes towards age and sex in the work force.
So that these are things that are on my mind now, very much on my mind, and I say jokingly to people that my next move is into the Grey Panther set. Maggie Kuhn is a magnificent person and I say, God, you know, I am sure that you could make a move in that direction, particularly with the growing group in this... You see it growing all the time, you see its influence growing all the time, and you run into that whole business of mandatory retirement age and I'm trying to make up my mind how I feel about that. I do understand the economics of this, and I am concerned, and I think there's validity to the argument that if we do not have some way of moving people of older years into some other kind of productive work, that it's going to work a hardship on black people, on young people, on women, in terms of having a chance to get in; that is, if you have people that are going to stay until they're ninety. Particularly when you talk about this in a university setting, the tenured professor who stays and stays and stays and stays, what opportunities are there going to be?﻿36
MS: (cont.) And that's going to be something that is going to mean that
you're going to get hardening of the arteries unless there's a way of individualizing it; I think there must be. I think there can be some general rules that will deal with this kind of big problem, but then, individually, people are going to have to be looked at in terms of their health, their mental capacity. You're not going to toss out the baby with the bath, why should you lose a man like Buckminster Fuller? Just off the top of my head, he's one of the most exciting people I've ever met in my life, he's fun, he's impatient, he's fiery, and there are a lot of people like that. And I don't think that we should throw them away. I just think that doesn't make any sense.
So these are some of the things that have to do with my feelings about age, and I'm going to have to find my niche, because every year I'm getting closer to the point where I'm really going to have to deal with it on a personal level. I was trying to find out, you know, where I'd go. I tell my husband, Otto's aged sixty-three, he was sixty-three...he doesn't even talk about it, he'll be sixty-four, I think, in February. We were going through people left and right, but he'll be sixty-four in February. I was saying to him that, currently he's on the Boston Housing Authority and he probably knows more about how public housing impacts on black people and on elderly people in this community than anybody else around, except, you know, the administrator. So why not think about moving into making an application somehow to become part of HUD, knowing what's needed for elderly people, the kind of housing that's needed and the amenities. My sister, who is almost seventy with glaucoma and cataracts, lives alone, has to have drugs four times a day. Having just come out of the hospital and with one eye covered with a patch, she cannot do her own eyedrops. There is no provision for looking after this particular medical need for her. We had to teach a friend to put the drops in. I will probably have to go and put the drops in until she gets rid of the patch and gets back to doing the drops herself. This is ridiculous, they don't build into public housing the services that you need for elderly people. I just think that this is something that's...
GG: And Otto...
MS: So I think he needs to be involved, with his experience and his knowledge of both sides, how a public housing authority works and what the needs are. He knew where the gaps are, and I say to him, "You need to be where it makes a difference." It really doesn't make any difference at the Boston Housing Authority level, it makes a difference at our level, and who is going to do this? And that leads me very logically, Cheryl, into something else, which has to do with this meeting that I went to in Chicago on the 29th of September, the National Association of Bank Women. You know I'm a director, the only black and the only female they've ever had on the board of directors of the Shawmut Bank.
CG: The only female as well?
MS: The only female as well, so I have this double kind of thing that I have
to cope with. Talk about the "solo woman in a peer group," you know I'm it. It's not an easy situation. I'm not really, I don't tell them this, but I'm not really terribly comfortable. I feel as if I'm out beyond my﻿37
MS: (cont.) depth, but I guess from a personality and temperament point of view, I have never really shied away from new experiences. I find that new experiences offer a challenge, though even though at this point I've been on that board now for three years, and I'm not yet comfortable with the handling of the figures and understanding how banks work, but I have to come from so far. There's nothing in my own background that has prepared me to be a director of a bank. My election to that board has to do with affirmative action, it really didn't have much to do with me, other than maybe I looked safe. They look around the community and say, now where can we find a black and a female that we can put on this board that's not going to make any waves? So, you know, then how about Muriel Snowden? And then you find that six people on the board know Muriel Snowden already from having had contacts in a whole lot of organizations and whatnot. So that's beautiful, so I get elected. So that there's a... I'm still struggling with that piece of it.
CG: Have you ever had any specific instance where your discomfort is, you know, that exemplifies the kind of discomforts that you have?
MS: Yes, the business of having the officers make a report to the board, and say, you know, "Gentlemen," this is the way they start out. I have a fairly low-keyed style, and my way of doing things is not really very flamboyant, I don't stand up and scream; but I think I made my point when I simply said to the chairman of the board at lunch, I said, "Really, you're going to have to do something about this, because you're either going to have to get more women or you're going to have to tell your senior officers that I'm there, because I really don't like being the little director that isn't there when they stand up and say, 'Gentlemen.'" So he got kind of red around the ears and kind of smiled. Since then, almost always when they make reports and they start out with anything that addresses the group, they say, "Mrs. Snowden and Gentlemen," so that, you know, the message got there, and I would, say, mention it at lunch.
Where I make the social relationships is by staying to lunch after the board meeting, and you sit around and you talk, and they ask me questions about desegregation. We talk about higher education for black kids, we talk about a lot of things that have to do with the city, about schools or something. So that's where I feel comfortable. And I also feel comfortable being the director who's the only director who serves on the urban affairs committee at the bank, so at that point I'm beginning to know about minority lending practices. I'm always talking about the use of black vendors and suppliers from the black community. I'm concerned about the attitudes of people, bank people, who work in branches in black neighborhoods, that kind of thing, and I feel comfortable with that, and I feel as if I know a lot more than they do about it, and they do too. So that there's...
CG: i always feel more comfortable when I go into a Shawmut Bank.
MS: Well, I don't know about that. I would like to feel that that's true, but there's a hell of a lot more that they need to do. I think there's a commitment at the top. I think it may not always sift all the way down through and I'm working on that.
But what I was saying about the NABW meeting that I went to, they were﻿38
MS: (cont.) talking about the courses. This is an undergraduate program
for women in banking, management training, like the MBA at Simmons, but this is an undergraduate program and Simmons is also a pioneer, and now there's... Simmons was the pilot and now there's one, Mundelein in Chicago, there's one at Pitzer, do you know Pitzer College? There's one supposedly at Florida State, I've forgotten, I think there are four of them. Anyway, they were talking about what the program was all about, helping women understand what this world of banking was all about, and management and whatnot. And I finally sat there and I said, "You know, I understand what we're saying, and I think we ought to take a lesson from the black movement, that you're talking about teaching people to deal with stress. Why aren't we also talking about removing some of the stress?" You know it doesn't do us any good to teach a whole generation of black people how to deal with prejudice and discrimination. We've got to remove it so they don't have to expend their energies, good energy which could be used in other ways. Struggling with this whole business of stress, that if there's anybody in NABW that has any influence with the American Banking Association, where all of this stress comes from, then this is where we ought to be putting some effort also. So I think that this is something that we have to deal with as women. There's all these levels on which we have to work, that's what I was talking about to the National Association of Bank Women, that there cannot be these pieces of this thing; it's not a fragmented picture, there's a whole picture and unless you see the whole picture, you've got the wrong questions for which you're seeking answers. But I think we really have to work on those things.
CG: How long...in which portions of your career, how long did it take you to develop your perspective on the whole picture?
MS: Absolutely evolutionary, you know, absolutely evolutionary, because I started out in my first job, working in Newark's third ward. Just exposure, just seeing people live, as I told you before, seeing people live under conditions that I never dreamed existed in my insulated, isolated, protected, sheltered environment of Glen Ridge. Not having any sense of what...and living in an all-white community, and I think this was one of the great drawbacks, living in an all-white community, I think that people today maybe have more, maybe more consciousness. I'm not sure, you see, 'cause my mother was conscious of it, but she was solving only a personal problem: how does she get her children related to other black people and black people of a certain social standing. Her feeling about black people generally, you know, Negroes, as she would have called them, or colored people, as she would have called them, her feelings didn't extend beyond her immediate family. So that for me, to see people living...
CG: But your father's did.
MS: Yes, my father's did, and I think that this is by osmosis, that keeping us going back to Orange and seeing him function with the people that he had left, and being concerned about the youth of the community and the "i'MCA and getting the building on, somehow some of that must have registered with us.﻿39
MS: (cont.) But when I started working in 1938, I graduated from college in 1938 with an A.B. from Radcliffe in Romance languages, for me to teach or something. It had started because I was good in Latin in high school, I had a way of being able to translate Latin into idiomatic English. It was a flair. And my Latin teacher was always so pleased with me because I could do this, and every now and then I had to get up and read something that I had done, so that the people would understand that what we were translating was not a dead language, that you could do things with it, So my mother seemed to feel that that would be a beautiful thing for me to do, to teach Latin and then, you know, when I got to college and I got to taking Romance languages, it was always what are the acceptable kinds of work situations for genteel black women? Young black women. Well, it's social work, no, not really social work. It was teaching, government service, I don't know what else. The options were pretty limited, so I thought teaching, and that's how I went through college, with that Romance language piece, looking forward to teaching sometime. But I found out then that it wasn't for me, and I think I told you the first glimpse I had even before I started working was when the AKAs got me into doing a volunteer stint with a group of girls over at 464 Mass. Avenue. It was either 464 or 458, I've forgotten which one, I think it was probably 464.
CG: League of Women for Community Service?
MS: League of Women for Community Service, and they had a group of little girls who were coming in there on Friday afternoons and they needed a volunteer leader. And Lorena Cuzzens, who was the Big Sister to every black girl that ever came to Boston to college in those days and a staunch AKAer, asked me if I would do that, if I would teach them French on Friday afternoons. And I went over, leaving the sheltered halls of Harvard and Radcliffe, going over on Mass. Avenue on Friday afternoons' to teach these little girls French, and I found out that that was the last thing that they needed to...they didn't really have any grounding in English and public school education never has been good in this town. Well, it hasn't been good for a long time. That what they really needed was a kind of...I had a sense of being a kind of role model, and that friendship and affection from some black girl who was going to college was what they really needed. So we did things like play the piano, and they had a lot of verve and pizzazz and they were fun. So I did it, and maybe once in a while we learned a French word like hello or goodbye or something, but that was not really what it was all about. But that was the first exposure, I guess I really had in that kind of a setting, to people who weren't quite like me. And then I went to work, after having gone the route of "whom-do-you-know?" and whatnot and ending up at the Essex County Welfare Board as a social investigator for old-age assistance. That was seven miles from where I lived; Newark was seven miles from Glen Ridge and driving down and coming back every day and going into the third ward and into the Iron-bound District was when I really... talk about cultural shock!
CG: Iron-bound.. ,
MS: The Iron-bound District was the district beyond the railroad tracks. Most of the people who lived in that area were ethnic groups, the﻿40
MS: (cont.) European ethnics. Black people tended to live in the third ward, and as a black worker, I was assigned to that area by the Essex County Welfare Board. It was a civil service job, there were two black workers, a man and myself. I think I told you that he was the one who really took me under his wing and tutored me, when I was crying because I didn't know anything about what I was doing, and he taught me the ropes. And then I began to see all these conditions under which people lived, and that was then an eye opener. And five years of that drove me, really literally drove me, back to school. Because I said, "Even if I m not hurting these people because I am doing something that's right intuitively, I really don't have the skills to help people."
CG: You also mentioned...
MS: Oh, the thirty dollars a month? I was, you know, I was lying to myself, and I really felt no sense of loyalty to that organization. It was time to leave, and that's when I went back to school. But that was part of this evolutionary process. It was the kids when I was in college, and then it was this five-year stint at the welfare board which also did something else. You asked me when I began to get a sense of the wholeness, that I could see, in those five years I worked there, that trying to talk to people... Children were legally responsible for their parents and grandparents in those days under the welfare regulations. To go to talk to children and grandchildren who had all they could do to maintain themselves, and try to pull a dollar out of them for the old folks didn't make any sense to me. And I knew that it was just a kind of routine I did. I went to see the old person, and I'd write down all the information that had to be put on the blank. Every six mofiths you had to visit them, and then you had to go and visit their legally responsible relatives. Some of them had relatives, and it would be ten pages on their form, and I would go to see them, and not one of them, there were some that had .been on, already then, this was from '38 to '43, already had been two generations on welfare. So that I said, you know, "Why am I doing this? There must be some way that you can prevent some of this from happening, and that s when I decided that I needed to go back to school and get some social work training to deal with the whole business of prevention.
And when I went to school, I decided my focus would be community organization rather than casework, and I've stayed with that ever since then. I'm not downgrading casework or group work, but I m saying that unless you see this thing in a whole way, that you're just on a treadmill, you're spinning wheels. And that has to do with the whole thrust of Freedom House. We could have set up a recreational center for kids a group work organization, or we could have had a whole lot of caseworkers running around trying to deal with the individuals, back again to this business about teaching individuals to cope with society. Hell, you ve got to change society so that they don't have to cope so hard. This has always been,"This is' the way it is done." The actual tangible expression of this kind of philosophy, and it's more mine than it is my husband s is this business of systematic change, that there has got to be, and that is what I'll be doing until, I think, I die.
He tends to be...and you know since we are a team, we've worked together, we've been married thirty-three years now, it will be thirty-four in May,﻿41
MS: (cont.) we were married May 28, 1944, and we've worked together all the time, and except for five years, those were the first five years when he was still at Saint Mark's and in the army, we have done Freedom House. Freedom House will be thirty years old in February of '79. That's a long time to mind the same store, but it has been a growth thing for us, and always my feeling has been, how does this organization help to make some fundamental changes? For him, and here I agree with him, you cannot stick with that kind of thing without some satisfactions and rewards, because change comes so slowly that you're defeated if that's all you have. So it is the individual, the child that makes good because you gave him a little help, or the woman who wanted to go back to school long before they were talking about nontraditioanl students. And Otto helps her, and she not only goes through school, but ends up teaching at Suffolk University, and she's the one with four or five kids, and her children are doing things because somebody helped her. And I think that that kind of human interest piece of Freedom House really doesn't get told, because we tend not to, oh it's a kind of ethics, you know, and there's a confidentiality. There are all of these beautiful stories about individual human beings. I thought that maybe for the 30th anniversary of Freedom House, T. should just do an open letter to something like The Bay State Banner, and ask anybody who has ever been touched by Freedom House, if they would just let us know where they are and what they're doing.
CG: You should.
MS: That's what I'm getting ready to do now. What I'm getting ready to do now. Because when I walked into the Harambee, a store which doesn't exist anymore, I was buying a dashiki, and there was this little girl at the counter. I made out my check, I said, "Will you accept a check?" and she said yes. I made it out and she said, "Oh, you're Muriel Snowden," she said, "you don't know me. I'm sure you don't remember me, but I want you to know that I came to some classes at Freedom House when I was pregnant in high school. And I had my baby, and I got my diploma from high school, and that somebody at Freedom House helped me." I have no recollection at all of this girl, I don't know what program it was that was in Freedom House at the time, but Freedom House touched her life and made a difference. And I think that there must be thousands of people that there are that I don't know about. There's a girl, I don't know whether I told you this before, during these preparatory workshops we're having for kids for entry into the Latin School.
CG: You used to have workshops when I was a kid; I went to some.
MS: All right. Well, Urban League used to have business courses, and all
kinds of groups that came in—the sickle cell anemia group us^d to meet there, there was the Association for Retarded Children, these were all groups that used the building facilities. We didn't really have direct connections with them, but we had a place where it was possible for them to hold their meetings so that we were, in an indirect way, helping. But this girl, during the SSAT workshop last year they had, and she came to me, I guess it was somewhere along the line, I've forgotten, maybe second or third session. And I noticed that she came all the time with her daughter. And she came over and she said, "You don't remember me, do you?"﻿42
MS: (cont.) And I looked at her and she was familiar, so I said, "I do, but I don't remember your name." So she told me, and she said, "Do you remember now, don't you, that you helped me get that scholarship so that I could go to school and I graduated." She went to a school of nursing. She came to us through a board member for whom she worked, a white board member for whom she worked, and now she says, "Knowing that you helped me, now you're helping my daughter."
There is that kind of continuity that if you're going to talk about community organization and what it means, there's always a running argument between whether it is possible for people to go into a community and organize it and leave, or whether people should stay. I think that there's validity to both points. I think there is such a thing as a professional community organizer who can be in a neighborhood and who can help to empower a community. But I do not see, I do not see, unless built into that is some money and some kind of institution building, that it's going to last when that person leaves. So that you can't really talk about a short run. If you ever talk about a matter of going into a community for six months, and running around and contacting "the leadership" and getting people all steamed up about things and then you move out, how do you leave behind a structure which is going to be able to carry through whatever it is that people have started? And so we had to make the decision about whether we were going to stay or not, and when we started Freedom House we made that commitment. We decided we weren't going anywhere, but this was for life, commitment for life, as long as we were able to do it, we would do it. And I feel that the stability of Freedom House and its viability does rest on that whole business of the commitment and the continuity. Well, maybe it's comparable to the black church.
CG: Yes.
MS: It's something that lives in the community. My problem is, you know, how do you keep it going? We still got to think about the long haul. So I'm not sure, I'm still not sure what the answer is for that, but we're working on that. But I think that the black church, with all of its faults and with all of its weaknesses, has been the springboard from which our leadership has sprung, from which the continuity and survival of black folks, you know, it's been the force, in addition to the other organizations and structures that we've built.
CG: It's interesting in the church where the male leaders tend to come from, because you can't just primarily...
MS: Well, the role of the black woman, I don't know, did you see the Ebony issue on the black woman? I nearly went through the roof. I thought that was the most chauvinistic, inaccurate presentation of the black woman, and I was particularly concerned about A1 Poussaint. He's a friend of mine, that A1 and his wife did such a disservice. I kept the magazine 'cause I said I'm going to sit down and I'm going to read it again carefully and try to be objective and not emotional, and then I'm going to write Johnny Johnson a letter. But I see that in the most recent issue of Ebony that there have been women who have really written in...﻿43
CG: Joyce Ladner complained that they did not give them enough...
MS: Well, incidentally, she's going to be here, do you know? Boston
University. No, she's coming as, Hubie Jones has a special visiting scholar program, and I've forgotten what day it is, I think it's November something or other, it's in the next month.
CG: I'll call her then, she...
MS: She is a guest. I can tell you. It's in my stuff at the office and
I'll give it to you, if you'll call and remind me because I'm going to get ready to put it all in the calendar. I don't want to miss her. Well, I don't know if you don't have enough time to do these things, but didn't you feel...
CG: I can understand your frustration about...I have felt frustration with him for several years. He does not have...and the trouble with psychiatrists who attempt to discuss the society is they see the society through the people who troop through their office and...
MS: How did they put it? That anybody who looks at a community (like society) through those eyes, tends to measure that community and the society by the degree of sickness rather than by the degree of health.
CG: That's right.
MS: So that I think you're absolutely right.
CG: And you can't do that in the psychiatric area with black people, 'cause black people have a low rate of mental illness where certain structures built into the black community... People do depress the rate of actual illness even though the symptoms are...
MS: Well, the mental illness has to, again, do with the systematic racism.
that the prssure that was put upon us to conform to white Anglo-Saxon Protestant standards, you know... Even if you're talking about old age, as we were talking about a few minutes ago and you're talking about work. You're really talking about work in terms of the Puritan ethic, you're not talking about what I feel is what... One has to do something with one's life, otherwise as a human being, I think that you haven't done anything with what God gave you, the gift. So that you've got somehow to make life meaningful for yourself, and it's the lucky person today that works for the joy of working. It's not for the dollars, it's not for prestige, influence, it is for the pure joy of doing something. And I don't think we've got this built into anything, and I'm concerned about it, because the reality is that that's the way it is.
So what are you going to do with black kids? We had Head Start kids at Freedom House. We had one little group, they asked us to take a group, so we took a group of kids, and we were so excited about these wonderful little kids in Head Start, that we hired a person to do follow-up on them when they got into public school We were so sure—the hypothesis was that these were going to be the kids that were going to be so outstanding having gone through Head Start. The person that we hired came back and﻿44
MS: (cont.) said, "I hate to disappoint you all, because I know what you
thought, but let me tell you what my findings were. Everywhere I went where these kids were in school, the teachers said that they were the most maladjusted, difficult children because they couldn't fit in." A very simple thing. Head Start children were told to raise their hands when they wanted to go to the bathroom, they wanted to go to the toilet. When they go to public schools, you raise your hand you want to go to the "basement." They were terrified by this euphemism about going to the "basement." They weren't ready for the rigidity of the public school system. All right?
And this is my problem with the alternative school system, that unless we can develop, say we had the financial undergirding to run alternative schools, even if that were so, unless the alternative school could run from preschool through high school, we'll be preparing kids for a system that they can't handle. When they come out of an alternative school system that's a good one that teaches them, you know, learning is fun, and you get into this public school system in this town, they're dead. And so, hopefully, under desegregation, we're getting some new kinds of approaches and innovative... But I'm not convinced yet that until we get rid of this generation of teachers who don't teach for the love of teaching, and that we don't get schools that train teachers to teach, that we're going to go anywhere, really, with education for all kids.
And so I do have very strong feelings about that Ebony article, that Ebony issue. I think they did a much better job with the black family, and I think they did a pretty good job with the black child. I'm not too sure now what they said about black men.
CG: There were some problems, because black men are now going through a
period, especially the black men in my generation, and it's frightening. They have been so schooled in the dominant group's vision of the male role, that they have a complex about allowing black women...and they are saying, Please take a back seat; and we are saying, no, and they get very upset. It's a real problem.
MS: Do you know, who is the man who was head of the Deacons For Defense?
CG: I know who you mean, but I can't say the name, but I know who you mean.
MS: He came to Freedom House. We had a big meeting, and I don't remember
whether we sponsored the meeting or not, it doesn't matter, all I know is I was standing on the balcony and I was listening to this man, and he was talking about how black men are going to have to take up arms and defend themselves in the South, and that they were no longer going to take this stuff from the KKK and all this. And then he said something about "and black women have got to get back into the kitchen where they belong," and I blew a gasket and I walked out. And I said, "That man lost me completely," because I think that this, again, until black people as a group begin to define for ourselves what our goals and objectives are, what we need in order to survive, then I think we're forever going to be running around being schizophrenic about how we fit into this society.
CG: And the men from your generation...﻿45
MS: ...are impossible.
CG: Well, a lot of the older men are much more understanding and receptive because they had been through and seen what women had done, you know, they had that long-range perspective. The young men are just outrageous.
MS: Well, I don't know. I think that there's...I think it's very difficult for men of my generation to be open about the women's movement, for example. They see it as very threatening. They tend to have taken on all the trappings, because they were the people who were trying to get into the mainstream, they took on all the superficial trappings of the white society, you know, establishing family, being the breadwinner, looking after... I tell you my mother held my father personally responsible for the depression, you know; it was his job, his responsibility to look after her and those children, and run that house and give her everything that she wanted. She almost had a Phyllis Schafley attitude towards marriage and a husband, you know. I just think that that's so punitive, and then I think that there was a generation of young men who would have been, you know, my father's children's age. My brother's an exception, he's a, what do you call it, a free spirit. He just never has been part of this whole thing.
But Otto and his friends, I think that they had a feeling about what their responsibilities were, that it was threatening for them, you know, "my wife-wil-never-work" kind of thing. That "my-wife-will-never-work" piece, even though knowing that for black people to maintain any kind of middle class standard of living, they both have got to work, otherwise they're not going to make it, unless they have a very highly successful professional man. But "my wife is not going to work" meant that my wife is going to "look after my needs, so that I can look after the family," and it's this kind of thing which was valid, it was valid. The trouble is that we have outgrown that, and that women no longer find their own satisfaction in making somebody else a success. Did you see David Susskind last night?
CG: No, I didn't.
MS: Secretaries, there was one black secretary in the group, but they were talking, and Susskind, you know his biases always come through, and he was saying that after you train a secretary who gets to know your way of doing things, who in a sense becomes a kind of office wife, then you're not going to let her go. They were talking about how you give all these big pluses for competency and attractiveness and ability to deal with people better, then the bottom line carries the weight, "Would you recommend her for promotion?" and you say no. Then what? And he says, "Well, you wouldn't let her go, 'cause you've put all this investment in her, and she has finally learned all the things that you need to have her learn." And one woman said, "Yes," she said, "but don't you hear what you're saying? As a secretary, I'm not really committed to your success, I'm committed to my own. Therefore, I want to go somewhere as a result of having done all this." And I think that this is the new trend. You're just not comfortable in this spending your whole life making someone else successful and you are simply an adjunct...﻿46
CG: An accessory.
MS: An accessory and yet there are a lot of women in my generation, "the
bitches and sad ladies" who have made peace with this, this is their... you know that book, I haven't read it yet, but I just love it because I read the reviews. It's called Bitches and Sad Ladies, and the essence of it is that the women who have really denied their own individuality in order to play this role of support to a man, have had to rationalize themselves into making peace with it. The "bitches" are the ones that have never made their peace and who fuss and fight about it, and I said, "I have no problem identifying myself...I ain't no sad lady."
What I think you want to get for the record, to add to the appendix, would be this article, which is called "Freedom House: A Team and a Dream," which I did for the Radcliffe Quarterly. And there's another one that appeared in the Radcliffe Quarterly, I think, but it's in writing, it's called "Citizen Participation in Urban Renewal," it was in the Journal of Housing originally. We have copies of that at Freedom House. Here are a couple of statements that I think maybe might also be there; there's a statement that we made, I think the Freedom House position on urban renewal, and trying to get into the renewal of Washington Park, and there had to be a statement, all of these things are in the Freedom House records. These are the things that I wrote myself, and I have a hell of a lot of speeches.
CG: Does Mrs. Draper have these things filed away?
MS: The Freedom House things she has, and maybe copies of these.
CG: 'Cause your speeches, you make very good speeches.
MS: My speeches? Well, speeches I've been trying to collect, some of them I have, and I have to look them up because, you know, they asked me if I would put them in the [Schlesinger] Library.
CG: You could probably edit them...
MS: If I could ever get anybody to edit them for me, but I've been keeping them... I've got a few from way back, I find speeches I made in 1960, which sound as if all I had to do is change a few little time sequences and it could be, it would be good for today. Speeches that I've written, there's a speech, well, the Martin Luther King speech is one that I'm particularly proud of, that one you have.
CG: Yes. I don't have the printed speech, but I've talked about some of the things...
MS: The printed speech is available, so you should get that one too. Because that one was on education, you know, "Education is Freedom?" I don't know what else we have over there, but I'll try to get some of that stuff together. But we were talking about the kinds of affiliations, so if we start with the present, I can think of things that I am really active in now. You mentioned the board of directors of the bank, board of directors, Shawmut Bank of Boston, N.A. Then there is the National Association of
■k
Rotter, Pat, ed., Bitches and Sad Ladies (New York: Harper's Magazine Press, 1975).﻿47
MS: (cont.) Bank Women, that's the NABW Educational Foundation, and I'm
on the national advisory committee for that. There is a study going on now, out of the Rand Corporation, on an evaluation of ESAA-funded nonprofit organizations—ESAA, Emergency School Assistance Act funding— and there's a national advisory committee and I serve on that. The Committee for Boston, out of which charter reform came and died, and has now been shunted off into the Galvin Bill, which I hope people will vote for, because I think it's the only chance to get, again, systemic change. We've got to change the structure of the School Committee and the City Council in Boston, if anything else is going to happen.
I was talking to a young man, this is a digression, but a young man from Kentucky; he was an associate superintendent of schools, black, and he was talking about how they had made the changes in Kentucky under desegregation. He started with an elected school board, and that on the school board there were representatives of various interest groups. And I said to him, that this microstructure that you are describing is beautiful, but in Boston I can't get involved in what you're describing because we haven't changed the school board yet. We don't have a school committee on which there is space for representation, so what you have to do, you've got to move in, this is exactly what I'm talking about, when I'm talking about the impact of the power centers on the minority communities and particularly in the desegregation process. So what do you have to do? You've got to find a way of getting into the change piece of it, so that's the reason I'm on this Committee for Boston, was that I saw an opportunity to do a couple things. The Committee for Boston grew out of the Committee on Violence which the mayor appointed, and one of its recommendations was that there be a permanent committee that would deal with community relations on a broad scale in Boston, that would not be desegregation-related so much as it would deal with the spill over from desegregation, the hostilities and tensions that have . arisen around it.
So I'm still on that committee. Last year I served as vice-chairperson when the committee was in the process of being revived again around the problems of jobs, particularly jobs for youth which again has to do, if you want to make sense of out something, I said it has to do with being concerned about education,for what? If you're going to educate, then you're not educating in a vacuum, you've got to be aware of occupational forecasts, you've got to be aware of where the opportunities are for minorities, so that you help steer kids in that kind of direction. I'm on the corporation of Babson College, and that has to do with my concern about management and business and areas in which minorities have been traditionally weak, so the invitation to serve on the Babson Corporation I accepted for that reason.
CG: I wanted to ask you how, what route, how did you happen to have the contacts..
MS: What route? Well, the route for the Shawmut Bank, I really don't know, other than as I said, I think they were looking. They had people on the board of the Shawmut that I knew already. One man, who was formerly president of the bank, had come to Freedom House years ago because Shawmut Bank at Dudley Street had an officer who was on the board of Freedom House, that was way back in 1950 or 1951. So that I knew him. The﻿48
MS: (cont.) president of Liberty Mutual—Liberty Mutual is one of the
companies that Freedom House has been working with—and through a board member I had met this man. There just were enough people on that board that when they began to look at their affirmative action, and at the composition of their board, that because I was known as a person to a lot of board members, then I think that was the route, and I got to be known to the board members because of all these other things, plus the reputation of Freedom House in the community. This has been the network of influence.
Babson, again, I think was the same kind of thing, because Freedom House had run for a number of years a board of visitors program which was trying to raise money and extend out relationships into the suburban communities, and one of the people who had come to a party for a board of visitors was a big deal at Babson. So again, when they began to look around at their board, the corporation group from which they draw for their board members, their trustees, I think that he probably was the one who recommended my name. And then when somebody recommends your name and they say you're codirector and cofounder of Freedom House, then all this begins to ring some bells. People who don't even know a thing about it, what Freedom House does, but who are aware of the name, and that somehow or other this organization has had a role to play in the Boston community on an interracial basis. But then they say, oh, that's fine, this is somebody who doesn't make waves.
And then, what other one did I say? The NABW, well again, that's a natural. Anne Byrant, who's the educational director, I think is a Radcliffe woman, I'm not sure, but anyway, somehow, I think through Radcliffe, she got my name, I'm not sure. And then I recommended Gail, because Gail was in the banking field, and so the two of us together were supposed to be alternates for that. The Harvard Board of Overseers, that comes... Incidentally I don't know whether you know how the election ran. There were two women running out of the six people. One was for an unexpired term—there are five that run each year. There's a woman from Calfornia who got the highest number of votes, something like 15,000; the second person was Maurice Lazarus, who has been a director, an overseer, and very active in Harvard affairs and he was second with 13,000 something; and I was third. There was only a seven-vote spread between him and me, and then the next two were 12,000 votes. But I had been on the board of the Associated Harvard Alumni; I was elected to that. I think what they do, the way you do that, is in order to be a member of a board of overseers or the AHA, you had to be an alumnus or an alumna, so that they simply look through... Again, always, if it has to do with making your representation look a little bit better, 'cause people are concerned about that, then they look and they say, oh, she was on the AHA; we should make her a candidate for the board of overseers. So that's why I got elected to that. The AHA one was a nice one, I guess because before the Associated Harvard Alumni, I was on the board of directors at Radcliffe Alumnae Association, so there has been a progression, you know, you served, I'm not sure I was that valuable...
CG: But you participated in the affairs of your alma mater.
MS: That's right, so on that basis, this was the way the progression went.
The AHA election was interesting,enough, I think for them to take a good﻿49
MS: (cont.) look at me, because I got the highest number of votes of anybody who had ever been elected to the board of overseers or to the AHA. That was 24,000, and that's across the country and again, there's a network of people who know and I have now at the board, again, the overlap. At the last board of directors meeting of the bank, there were at least five people who told me that they had voted for me for the board of overseers. So I said, now these were all people who had a connection with Harvard. When they said, "How did the election come out?" and I said, "I won," and they said, "We want you to know that I voted for you" with great pride. So I said, "Thank you very much, I'm very grateful to all my friends who did this." But then they also began to talk to their friends, who should we vote for, and that's the way that worked. And it's this pattern that has to do with my serving on the board of the New England Aquarium; on the board of Boston's Huseum of Science, that one is a direct result of my working in Cambridge as an executive director of the Cambridge Civic Unity Committee, because the chairman of the Civic Unity Committee has remained a friend ever since I left there.
CG: Miriam...
MS: No, Carlton Fuller. He was an executive vice-president for Polaroid, and chairman of the Cambridge Civic Unity Committee.
CG: Oh, when you were...
MS: When I was the executive there, he was the chairman of the committee and we became very close friends. His wife is a Radcliffe graduate, and she was at the Cambridge Community Relations Committee and I worked closely with her. So when the Museum of Science started looking for people, it's Carlton Fuller who recommends that they ask me, and I'm hard put to say no for several reasons. First, because this is a man that I respect highly and he's been a good friend, he's been a strong contributor to Freedom House, so you know it's who scratches whose back and that's part of the deal. You have to pay your dues and all this, and it's very difficult, because I'm in a position where I have to keep asking people for money to support Freedom House and in return, they ask me to serve on a committee and I'm hard put to say no. That's one of the reasons that I'm spread so thin. That's the Aquarium, the Museum of Science, Babson, the board of overseers at Harvard, there's the NABW, the Committee for Boston, I'm on the advisory committee for something else. What else?
CG: Black Women Oral History Project.
MS: Black Women Oral History Project! We mentioned the Rand Corporation,
that will run out. Just recently I renewed my membership in the National Association of Human Relations Workers which I belonged to years ago. I joined in 1950 and went until the end of the sixties and then dropped out for ten years, but now I'm back again. Just a member, nothing...I'm trying to think of all the other things that take my time. I should look at my calendar and see what I've got on there for commitments. Those seem to be... Well, the Freedom House Coalition is part of Freedom House in a sense, but it is a spin-off.
CG: Now what exactly is the Freedom House Coalition?﻿50
MS: It's made up of twelve people. Organizationally it's Freedom House, the Roxbury Multiservice Center, Lena Park Community Development Corporation; and then there are people on it like Ruth Batson and Betty Johnson and Laura Morris of Family Service, Ron Edmonds and Ken Haskins from Harvard, and Frieda Garcia from the Hispanic community. Rudy Pierce is an unoffical member of the coalition. He is a magistrate now, and it's difficult for him to take positions here, but Rudy is an informal member of the group. Jim Breeden, and who else on on that? I guess there are thirteen members on it now, and the Freedom House Coalition was a direct outgrowth of the 1974 desegregation process when we needed to have some kind of network among black people in the community so that we could respond to crises. We developed what we called a "community contingency protection plan"that operated out of the Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center Crisis and Prevention Team. Laura Morris, brought from the family service social workers, helped with problems that people came in with over and above desegregation. So this, what we called the "socio-legal team," that is how really Pierce got involved with us, because he acted as the lawyer and began to organize black lawyers in particular, but also anybody who would help; for black kids would get into trouble under desegregation. So that is a kind of run-down, and it's just starting up again, but we met every Monday morning from 1974 until now at my house for breakfast at 8:30 in the morning. In a sense Freedom House, specifically, and I have held the thing together; we've acted as a secretariat and kept it moving. Now there are some other kinds of things that I go to, that I can't even tell you what they are now. I have to look at the calendar, not the calendar, there's a whole list of things... Oh, I'm on the advisory committee now of the Junior League.
CG: What?
MS: Community advisory committee to the Junior League of Greater Boston.
CG: You are a member of the Junior League?
MS: No, I am not. I'm too old. Junior League membership is between twenty-one and thirty-five. They're very anxious to have black women, but I have to keep explaining that young women in that age bracket tend not to have the kind of time that the Junior League demands in terms of volunteer services and all of that. They're trying to get their feet on the ground, and that they just don't have the luxury, that they need to make some changes in their structure if they want to be able to include young black women. However, they have found a way of involving me, and they put me on a community advisory committee, and what we're doing is developing a program, the Junior League program, of pulling together information about women that all women need, whether it's battered women or child abuse, or health services for teenagers, whatever. And they're going to get a mobile van which they will move around from neighborhood to neighborhood, bringing to women in each neighborhood this kind of information, centralized in one spot. And to move it, rather than to have people come to it, because they never get there. So in order for them to get into neighborhoods like Roxbury and Dorchester and Mattapan— the Junior League has an image that's not too good, so that they're not going to be able to just come in and say, "We think we've got something﻿51
MS: (cont.) that you might like,"—they need to have an entree, so this is my job. So that's my role and function, and as a matter of fact, that grew out of serving on the advisory committee for the distribution of some funds they had raised last year, the Up With People program. I got to know Junior League women and I was impressed, I got rid of some of my own stereotypical thinking about the kinds of people who were in the league, and on the 28th of September they asked me to be their guest speaker for their first big meeting of the year, and they had about 500 women there. And what I had to say was really very well received. I think they say they have about seventy-five women who are involved in this project which was called WINS, Women's Information Network Service. But anyway, that's another. I forget about the Junior League, I'm trying to look at the calendar and see what other things that I have on the calendar.
CG: You received an...
MS: ...an honorary degree from U. Mass. in 1968, yes, 1968, and in 1969, I became a member of the board of trustees of U. Mass., and I served a seven-year term which meant it expired the first of January 1976. Then I got the Radcliffe Alumnae Achievement Award in 1964. And let's see, I don't know, when we talk again, I'll have that list in front of me and I can refresh my memory, because I do do a lot of running around. I'm just trying to think what kinds of things carry me on my trips. I've mentioned the ones that do.
CG: As well as the oral history project.
MS: Yes, the oral history project. We met in Washington and that was really a very good meeting.
CG: Have you ever been involved with the National Council of Negro Women?
MS: I'm a life member. It's a very interesting thing, I'm a life member. You know, my first speech I ever made in my whole life, I made on a platform with Dorothy Height in Brooklyn, I was either just out of college, or just beginning college, I don't even remember what I talked about, but I remember being so impressed with Dorothy, she was so great. And when Lena Home was national life member chairman, chairperson, I joined because of my friendship with Lena. I have really not been active. I've gone to a couple of the meetings, and they're having someone coming in from Washington next month. There's also another kind of connection which goes way back. My mother knew Mrs. Bethune, and when I first got out of college, I was looking for a job, and that was in the NYA days, and Mrs. Bethune was very powerful. So my mother took me to see Mrs. Bethune and she was sick, and I don't remember now where she was, it was in New York, and I can see this darkened room, and she was lying in bed and my mother said, "Now, Mary, mydaughter's just out of college and she needs a job." And Mrs. Bethune said, "Now you go and you tell the regional director of NYA that I told you to come and see him." So I went to see this guy and he was black and he was so arrogant. I was so mad. He said, "You, Dr. Sutherland's daughter, how are you going to qualify for relief?" I said, "Mrs. Bethune said that there were a certain number of nonrelief jobs in this," so he said, "Yeah, but there are none for﻿52
MS: (cont.) you." So she tried, but because the National Council of
Negro Women, you know, to all intents and purposes was Mary McLeod Bethune, I've had a warm feeling toward them. I'm particularly interested now in studying... But I'm still trying to find a niche as a black woman, and I think that the black women's corporate network, which is one that has an affiliation with the National Urban League, is one that I would be interested in, women in the corporate structure, and they are primarily out of New York. I sort of feel that's the place that I would be interested in making an affiliation. If I have to roll off something else, I would like to belong to that, I haven't really made an offical application for membership. Well, as I say, I have to get the list, 'cause I can't remember them all...
CG: But just say, by being a life member of the National Council, you get all the publications...you're part of that network.
MS: I think that she was so prophetic and ahead of her time.
CG: That's what I... The Afro-American woman's journal that became Women
United and all of the developments in the black community were prefigured in that journal, everything.
MS: That's right. I think that's one of the great tragedies of life, it
has to do with time, and maybe this is in the design of things, that you can see ahead, but you can't make it happen, even in your lifetime. All you can hope to do is to set some patterns and some models, and trust that people will take a look at them and not keep reinventing the wheel. I think that that is the thing that worries you when you see where people are failing and anticipating, we've done this at Freedom House. You look back at the stuff that we wrote in 1950, it really isn't that different, the goals and objectives have stayed the same, it's just that you've • changed your methods of achieving, according to the change in the times and the new tools that have become available, but I don't think we make the best use of the new tools. I think there tends to be, we're still cutting with unsophisticated instruments, when there are more things that you could use. So that I wonder about that, maybe that's part of what we ought to be putting down, too. An inventory, these are the things that one might use now to move us ahead more rapidly than we were able to go in our time. What else did you want to talk about?
CG: I wanted to talk to you about your involvement in desegregation.
MS: Well, if you look at the Freedom House twentieth anniversary yearbook, you should have for the records, the twenty-fifth, I wrote those, the twenty-fifth, the twentieth, and I don't know whether there is a fifteenth or not, I think not. But the twentieth and the twenty-fifty are interesting because in the twentieth, we talked about where we were going, our objectives, and one of them had to do with, we were going to do everything in our power to see minority children through the educational maze, and that would be 1969. In 1974, there's something in it about where we made a start. We did things in education, but they were spasmodic, you know, whether it was a travel/study program, which is, as I say, a special kind of thing in education...﻿53
CG: How old is the travel/study program?
MS: From 1968, eight years.
CG: Freedom House comes earlier, though in education...
MS: Yes, well, we got involved in 1950 in the fight for a democratic Home and School Association in the Higginson district. They have some of that material, and I'll have to find it because I was showing it to someone. It showed how we helped to document...a group of parents had been fighting for the right to elect the officers of the Home and School Association in the district, and they wanted to be able to come into school when it rained and not have to stand outside with the children's umbrellas. And they wanted more interpMy between parents and teachers around children, rather than coming three times a year to hear the children play the fiddle and listen to your child perform, and then go home. There was very little exchange among the parents and teachers. At that time you had a mix in the Higginson district; you still had a large number of Jewish parents and Jewish children. The principal was the original authoritarian personality, Miss Clony, who decided that her way of survival was to play off the Jewish parents against the black parents, and suggest to the Jews that the black children were going to bring down the quality of the education in the district, and that they should stay in control of the Home and School Association. She tended to appoint the chairman of the Home and School Association. Then when we entered into a coalition with some forward looking parents...I've forgotten what the group was called. The Hebrew YMCA was still in the community then, when we got into a coalition then with them, she then appointed herself chairperson of the Home and School Association.
At that time, there was, as you say, 1950 would be the McCarthy era, and there was a woman who was a card-carrying Communist whom we knew. Her name was Ann Burlack Timpson, she was known as the "Red Flame." She had a child in the district and she was a member of the Higginson Home and School Association, and she had been a strong leader in the Home and School Association so that when we got involved in it, Otto and I, to help black parents document what they had tried to do with this woman-Miss Clony—there was a newspaper article that came out that she had leaked to the press. There was a big headline that said, "Otto Snowden assumes leadership of the Henry L. Higginson Home and School Association from the Red Flame," and we were then tarred with the Communist brush and it was a difficult thing for us to deal with. We had just started trying to raise money and to have people... We went to see one of the members of the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination, an old man, a judge, Judge Cohen, and we asked him what we should do. "What should do?" And he said, "You don't want to carry coals to Newcastle." He said, "Forget it, don't try to deal with it in the paper, just go ahead and do whatever it is you're doing and forget about it." And it did die down, but It was a hard time for us to have this kind of clobbering, but we fought that woman tooth and nail. We went to the superintendent...
CG: Miss Clony.
we﻿54
MS: Went to the superintendent, told him what we were trying to do, all we
want is a democratic Home and School Association. We had had a meeting, we passed out brochures, she had the police there. All the brochures, see, were a documentation of the steps we had taken in order to try and get this woman to permit free elections. And finally she resigned, under protest, before she was to retire. And I was interested to see that when she died, they talked about all she had done in this district to help... If anybody didn't know this, you would have felt that she had been a great woman, she had been a great educator. But she really was a very difficult person, and that was one of our first brushes—this was before Gail was going to public school—this was one of our first brushes with the school system and it had not been a pleasant one. But then when Gail started going to school, and she was in the third grade and we called the school, she answered the phone, and Otto said, "Let me speak to your teacher."
CG: Gail answered the phone?
MS: Gail answered the phone at the Ellis School, so we talked to her teacher, and the teacher said, "I have a problem, and I'll tell you very frankly. Gail is very quick, and the only way I can keep Gail occupied, because I've got to have time to deal with some of the children who don't get their lessons as fast, so I let her answer the phone." I said, "I'm not sending my child to school to answer the phone. She learned to answer the phone before she went to kindergarten, so she doesn't need that." But that again was part of the school system that we were dealing with. We also, it goes back even further, because when Otto's brother, I think I told you this, when Otto's brother was ready to go to Latin School, they told him that he was not Latin School material. And Otto's father said, "I don't care what you say, I want my boy to go to Latin School," and so Frank took the exam and he went to Latin School, and he got the Benjamin Franklin Merit Award for excellence. From Latin School he went to Harvard, and he got his A.B., his M.A., and his Ph.D.
So that we knew again that this system was one that tended to push black people out, and if it had not been that Otto's father was a man of great strength who did not rely on the system... Again, I think that black people tended to think that the system was going to take care of our kids, that we rely on the teacher, we turn our little children over to the teacher, and then the teachers have failed us. The system has failed us, and so you had to learn how to deal with the system, so then we maneuvered Gail through the system, through to the ninth grade simply by finding out who was the best kindergarten teacher, and the next year who was the best first grade teacher, and every step of the way, because you knew how to pull the strings. You got your child under the teacher that other people said was a good teacher, and so there was this kind of informal method.
This has to do then, with Freedom House being concerned, sporadically, up until desegregation, becauseyou had nothing to hang your hat on. You had it in 1965 with the Racial Imbalance Act, that's one of the reasons we supported it; I served on the advisory committee on racial imbalance at the state department of education. I served on that committee and we had helped Ellen Jackson with Operation Exodus in 1965, always we were﻿55
MS: (cont.) trying to get around the system. But having taken our child through that, and the social engineering that had to be done, we were fed up with it by the time she had reached the ninth grade. And Latin School, even Latin School, and we had great hopes for that school. Frank Snowden, for example, because Frank came through Latin School, and it was good, the discipline, all the kinds of things that made it possible for Frank Snowden to go to Harvard and to become head of the Department of Classics at Howard University. All of this Frank remembers, he does not know, or chooses not to remember, how the system didn't work for black kids generally. It worked for him. "If it works for me, it ought to work for everybody." Well, this is crazy, it doesn't work this way. I think this is the trouble with a lot of black people in a certain generation. They say, "I made it; you can make it, just work hard." You know, "Be good, play the game by the rules," and then they never recognize that they constantly change the rules of the game.
CG: They don't even recognize the help that they had from their parents fighting.
MS: Yes, well, I think he recognizes that, but he thinks that Latin School is very good. And the Latin School and the Technical High School are the best of a poor public school system; but even the quality of Latin School education has deteriorated. When I came to Boston to live in 1946, Otto got out of the army in 1945, and he came ahead. I had had Gail and I was at home, after I had left the New York School of Social Work, because I had Gail while I was there. I went home and I stayed eight months, and when Otto got settled here, I came to join him in Boston. He came in March and I came in April of 1946 with Gail. And one of the reasons that I was really kind of gung-ho about coming back to Boston to live was that I had such positive feelings about this excellent public school system. And when I got here, it didn't take ihe long to find out that this was a myth and a delusion, and that the public school system had deteriorated, that all they were doing was coasting along on reputation.
Not long after I came to Boston, the NEA [National Education Association] had a national conference here and people were amazed at the difference between Boston schools' reputation and the reality. And the fact that you couldn't have...do you know that in Boston you have no Parent-Teachers Association; you have the Home and School because Parent-Teachers means that you get some guidance and direction out of New York national headquarters, and Boston does not need anybody dictating what they should or should not be doing. So we have the Home and School. So all of this is background, personal experience with our own child, and when someone starts telling me, you know, you don't have a child in the system, so how can you know or how can you speak? Louise Day Hicks's favorite argument, "You don't have any children in the system; how dare you speak?"
CG: She does actually say that to you?
MS: Oh, she says that to everybody that doesn't have a child in the system.
And we say now, you know, we don't have to take that. Number one, I had a child in the system and had to take her out; and number two, is that as far as we're concerned, every black child in this system is our own﻿56
MS: (cont.) child. That we have an advocate role to play, and when we
left, when we took our child out of the Boston public schools, we did not take ourselves out of the Boston public schools system despite that. And I think this is a tough problem for black people who have the decision to make, because my friends have had to make it in New York: to what extent can you sacrifice your child on the altar of a principle?
CG: In my study, this has been a major problem.
MS: Isn't it the problem?
CG: It's a moral, internal, soul problem.
MS: It is, and yet when you look at the realities, if you're talking about children in a public school system as it is in New York, where there is actual physical danger to your child, that there is the exposure to drugs, that there is exposure to an underclass life style, all these things... But this exposure to all of these things, and there's no reason why black people, simply because they're black, should not have options. And I think that as long as you don't desert the rest of the kids, that you may have to do this for your own children's survival. Until such time as you can see yourself leaving something to your children. The only thing you can leave, most of us, is the ability, some saleable skills, the capacity to support themselves, and form them to "make it" in whatever way, the opportunity to "make it," and to have the qualifications so they don't have to look for support systems and whatnot in order just to get a foot on the low rung of the ladder. So that this has been, it is, it's a terrible kind of thing, and we struggled with it and we thought about it. We said, "We can't do it." We had to take Gail out of the Latin School even, and we sent her to Saint Mary's in the Mountains. Saint Mary's had eighty—four girls in the entire school. You don't expect private school and public school to be comparable in what they offer, they can't possibly do it, so our expectations from the public schools were not the same as they were from the private school. But the chance to be creative, not to be in the college mill process that Latin School is, for us, was a plus and I think it's been a plus for Gail, and I think it's given her some of the inner kinds of things that she needs in order to survive.
Because it isn't solely, you know, education in a total sense has to do with that business of inner resources as well as basics. All that I say about basics and why we're into basics in desegregation, whatever that word means to so many different kinds of people, is that without these survival skills, reading, writing, being able to understand and use math, you're nowhere in this society, you can't survive. You can't survive here, you can't survive in any third world countries either as they're developing, because these are the tools that they need too. So this is pretty fundamental. And when people ask you to analyze your Radcliffe education, I say there that one of the things that to me was most important, and I'm very glad that I had the opportunity, and I wish a lot of people had the opportunity, was that... What were we talking about?
CG:
We were talking about the whole.﻿57
MS: Oh yes, how we got into deseg and this whole business about the personal experience...
CG: You were saying why Radcliffe was important, why you felt...
MS: Yes, the opportunity to have more than just a basic education, and it has to do with learning to think, problem solving, also the kind of inner resource that makes it possible to be alone with yourself and like it, an appreciation for things that are food for the soul and the spirit, as well as for the mind. And I think that that's a very important kind of thing. I'm not saying that it's for everybody, I think for certain kinds of people it's very important. It was important for me.
CG: But you can see from those experiences, those little details, structures where those details can be [useful], because I argue many times with a lot of academics who have left the church and were disgusted with the whole spiritual aspect. But it was very important to teach little children how to pray, so that they can think to themselves, and even if they leave the church later on, they still have had that experience within themselves.
MS: I have deserted the church. I haven't been to church on any kind of
regular basis since I was eighteen years old. I told my father the day I was eighteen, I was not getting up on Sunday morning and going to church, and he didn't like it, but that's the way it was. I had had enough of going down, sitting in the special family pew. He was a deacon in the church. I don't know, there was just something about the whole church thing that to me was just not satisfying. And that's not to say that I'm nonreligious; I do have a sense of some kind of divine design, and I'm not sure what it is. In my more skeptical moments, cynical moments, I have felt that maybe the grand design is that you never solve problems in any generation, 'cause the next one's got to have something to deal with.
CG: Getting up in the morning, keep the excitement in life, yes.
MS: Somehow that's part of whatever it is, that has put this whole thing
together, that'^ when I'm cynical. But anyway, I do think that this kind of discipline, mental discipline and whatnot has been important to me. I think you can get it in other ways; you don't have to go to Radcliffe to get it. I think you can go to any good college where people are concerned with what learning means in the broadest sense, and that will serve you in good stead as you go down the line with whatever you're going to do with your life. But all of this business of education and this, I suppose, is part of my, our, heritage, was that education was very important to my parents' generation, important to my generation, and I guess it will be important for a long time to come. Therefore these were Black Advocates for Quality Education, and in that group were people like Ruth Batson who had been involved and concerned about education for so long, had even contemplated running for School Committee back in the days when we were on Humboldt Avenue, so it had to be between 1949 and 1952.
CG: That was about the time.﻿58
MS: It was. Ruth was trying to run for School Committee, and didn't get very much support either from us or from the black community as a whole, 'cause we figured she couldn't make it, the time wasn't right. I'm not sure that we were right, but she should have made the effort, and that we might have mounted something, achieved some momentum over the years. It meant John 0'Bryant wouldn't have had to start so far back.
But in any event, we didn't have any way of incorporating our concern about Freedom House into a programmatic structure and besides, the thing that was of uppermost concern to us in 1949 when we started Freedom House, was the physical deterioration of the community. It was going downhill fast, the blight was everywhere, and the major thing that people were concerned about and complaining about was really not the schools. Unhappy with the schools, yes, those of us who had children in the schools, but generally the property owners in the community were upset, you know, about no street cleaning, no garbage and trash removal, general neglect, concern about recreational facilities for children. The tenants were concerned about the lack of interest on the part of absentee landlords, so that in keeping with Freedom House's basic philosophy and objective of being flexible and being able to ride with the current, this was what got us into urban renewal. 'Cause here was a tool that appeared on the scene that had not been there from 1949 to 1960. We had tried organizing block groups, and we had gotten people involved in civic kinds of projects, and there were clean-up campaigns and block associations and people running up and down ringing doorbells, trying to get the cars moved so that the street cleaners could go through. I heard a boy standing up in a Coordinating Social Services Council meeting two days ago talking about how are we going to get the cars moved so that the street cleaner can go down and not have to do that swerving in and out? And I said that for thirty years I've been listening to that, and that's what's discouraging, that nobody has been able to come up with a system that gets the cars off the streets so the street cleaning equipment can work.
CG: I have to give you a suggestion 'cause they do it in my aunt's neighborhood in New York; they double-park on one side that day, and then the people on the street just tell everybody and they...
MS: Double-park. Never thought about that.
CG: Because the people who are there during the day aren't going to move.
MS: That's right. They just are not going to move. So except that we did have one clean-up campaign in which on a Sunday, we got the trucks out on a Sunday and the night before, they did this Saturday and Sunday, we actually, what do you call it? Placarded the community, went everywhere, we had flyers that came out of Freedom House, don't park on your street, such and such a date on this side. And on Sunday, I can remember this so clearly, there was some street, 1 don't know whether it was Homestead Street or what, on which there was one car with an out-of-state license on it, and the block captain called Freedom House and said, "You've got every car off the street except this." He said, "Ring everybody's door-﻿59
MS: (cont.) bell and find out to whom that car belongs; if you can't find out, tow it."
CG: In Cambridge, they tow. They ticket and tow. I had my car towed once because I overslept.
MS: But there's a racial dimension to this.
CG: Yes.
MS: You live in a congested neighborhood, no place to park cars, black
people have lots of cars. How are you going then to do the ticketing and towing without developing within the black community a very negative response? We say black people have to do it themselves; there has to be a black organization that says, for God's sake, you're complaining about the dirty streets, the only way we're going to get them clean is for you to move your cars. We can say it, the police can't say it. Or we can say, if you don't move them, we're going to go along with the police in towing your car and ticketing it, because we've got to have them cleaned. But it was just a one-shot deal and then, you know, back to normal.
So from 1960, when John Collins came in on this program of revitalizing Boston, till 1968...from '54 to '59 we were organizing block groups and working on trying to work as a kind of little splinter effort in Roxbury, neighbors helping neighbors, block groups and all of that. In '59, we had a new mayor, we were getting smart now, see, we were doing all of this, and people were running around and they had some good block group activities, but it's not taking us anywhere. In 1959 there was a change in administration, and we knew that unless we got tied in with the city, we just weren't going to go anywhere with this program. And that was the point at which we began to...we have minutes of the meeting which says, the block leaders coordinating council decided that— this is in '59—our next step in to go to City Council and the mayor, to get some action here and to become involved in the city as a whole. So when Collins came in on a "revitalizing Boston" platform and was bringing in Ed Logue from New Haven as Boston redevelopment administrator, that was the point at which we sent a telegram saying, "You can't talk about revitalizing Boston unless you include Roxbury," and that we stand ready, we've got experience, we've got some background, we stand ready to do anything that's necessary, but you've got to include this neighborhood.
So from '60 to '69, it was urban renewal all the way, with the meetings and all the rest of that, and that is also documented, I guess, in the Citizens' Participation Movement, which was a pioneering effort on the part of this community which had nationwide implications, because out of it came the Model City approach, which incorporated the social piece, which was totally lacking in the physical renewal operation.
CG: See, this is an example where your ingenuity at Freedom House in pursuing your profession had implications that just resounded all over.
MS: That's right.﻿60
CG: And that route has not been traced back. I've run into many national implications.
MS: Yes, because Washington Park was a residential renewal program, and I think there was something in your commitment to citizen participation. Now the extent to, you know whether this is real, at least we have documentation to show that 2,000 people participated in the planning of Washington Park. They asked constantly in our group, the things that were pointedly raised, "What about 'people renewal,'" which is what they meant, when they used the term, they meant social renewal. Out of it, spun off the job fairs, because we were worried that economic under-girding of the physical renewal of the community was hopeless unless people could afford to keep the property up, so we got into job fairs, 1965. That was the first job fair. There was another spin-off, there was an ad hoc committee on education which included Betty Price, who's dead now. Betty was a teacher, and that group developed a plan for desegregating Washington Park, saying that the neighborhood schools at the elementary level we'd have to live with, but they would probably be all black. And so we were going along with the clearing of the land for the three elementary schools, of which only one has been built, which is the William Monroe Trotter. But at the junior high and high school level, kids are able to travel, therefore we would recommend that they put high school and junior high schools at the periphery, and try to take a look at what the demographic trend is, so that you can see that you won't have a resegregated school. This is all in the report that this ad hoc committee made, and it was comparable to the report that was made by, oh, I've forgotten who, the Sargent study? Whatever the study is on schools that was made in that period.
This is the same thing, out of a lay group in the community; you know, the professionals got paid for it; our group came up with grievances-and the right questions because they cared and they were knowledgeable. That's one of my big gripes all the time, that you know, that people that know get their brains picked and then somebody else gets the money and the credit. Straight down the line, from John Spiegel's violence center out there at Brandeis, and his committee and his report on violence, I forget what it was called. He got a big grant, and all he did was run up and down Blue Hill Avenue. Anybody on Blue Hill Avenue could have written that thing, but he got money for it and he put it in fancy language so Brandeis becomes the authority on the causes and control of violence.
But anyway, that was eight years of urban renewal and then you see, you're almost up to 1970. Meanwhile, you've had the Kennedy assassination, you've had the Martin Luther King assassination, we've lost Malcolm... incidentally, Whitney Young had been here at Harvard and Whitney helped us in developing what was called, what was that thing called? He did something, he did a survey of a GNRA, General Neighborhood Renewal Area, which included more than Washington Park, it was a whole Washington Park-North Dorchester thing. And a lot of the stuff that's in his report came from meetings that were held at Freedom House and other areas of the community that we had setup for him. And he came with some recommendations. One of them was, he didn't say it, but somebody connected with our group said that equality is not enough. And you remember Whitney wrote a book﻿61
MS: (cont.) called Beyond Equality? I said, "Whitney, you ought to give us credit." Not a credit line anywhere. But in any event, he was here, and he was helping and using his Harvard grant and experience in writing this piece up. Equality studies exist and you know, if you went back to them, you wouldn't have to do any more studies 'cause it's all there.
So after then, get up to 1970; you've had the Racial Imbalance Act in 1965; you've got a School Committee that's dragging its feet, refusing to do anything; and then you begin to get into the NAACP's desegregation actions around the country and you begin... The NAACP here plus people in the community concerned about education said that Boston's in violation, and the movement was mounted to submit a case on de facto segregation. So they needed plaintiffs, and through Ellen Jackson and some other people, we got Tallulah Morgan and the company who became the individual plaintiffs in the case, and that's how we got in desegregation. The Black Advocates then began, and Toye Lewis, you know Toye...
CG: I know the name. She just got her Ph.D. from the Ed School where she was formerly...
MS: That's right. Toye is very bright, and Toye was one of the people,
members of the Black Advocates, along with Bob Hayden, an interesting group of people. In the course of deliberations in that group, we were meeting downstairs in the basement of our house, we said we needed to have some kind of ongoing structure. Something's got to be in place around education, and we sat for almost a year, talking to people and finally the idea crystallized into the Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education. Logically it would be under the aegis of Freedom House, because we were the oldest of the new organizations, and that if we could get Ellen to come, and we'd try to get money for it, then we would have something that could deal with education on a twenty-five-.hour-a-day, eight-day-a-week basis. The recognition was that black leadership, even though it exists in this town, is too fragmented in order to deal with any single problem over the long haul. That constantly, it's health today, welfare tomorrow, and housing the next day, and education the next day and even though there is leadership, it's very difficult. But if we had a structure, we could call upon the people with expertise on an ad hoc basis. So since we had the connections and this is another piece...that Freedom House in a sense represents the efforts of middle class black people to fulfill a responsibility to their own. And when I say their own, I mean all black people. That then you've got an already built-in relationship with the people in the black community who have the stability and the economic wherewithal and the educational background. Black people are no different from anybody else because, traditionally, reform has always come from the middle class. They're the only people who have the time and the energy to do it, so that in a sense we were following a very well known and well worn sociological concept. So that our ability to call upon the professional people, whoever they were, was built in.
You had in the group, both in the Black Advocates and in Freedom House itself, people who really cared about black people, who had not lost their sense of identification, who had not moved away in order to escape from other black people. Yet those who moved had really been quite realistic. They moved because they had to have better housing, and they﻿62
MS: (cont.) had to have schools for their kids, and they had to have
opportunities. But as long as they didn't move and forget, we could live with that, and we kept them tied in. And I think this is probably one of the few organizations, we know the NAACP with its mass membership claim to fame, people pay to have membership to NAACP, at least in Boston, but there's not participation. I don't think much is going on. And also there was a split. When I first came to Boston, Mrs. LeSueur was running for president of the NAACP and...Otto, what was Steele's name? Wasn't his name Steele, he ran against Flossie LeSueur?
a
OS: Julian.
MS: Julian. Julian Steele. And it was a very open thing, that Julian
represented the "silkstocking" group in the black community, and Flossie represented "the people." When you came to that meeting, and I went, the people were sitting either on Julian's side or on Flossie's side, and I was very proud to sit on Flossie's side, 'cause I figured that that's where it's at for the masses of black people. And to vote along these lines, without a regard for the qualifications for the job to be done was pretty silly. But that was...that's part of the problem. I think that mass membership organizations like the NAACP, where you have lip service and you have support, but there's no emotional involvement in it... And the Urban League has not functioned in this town for a long while, and I think that that's too bad, because there's room in Boston for the Urban League, for the NAACP, for Freedom House, for as many strong organizations as we can build. And we should not be in competition with one another. They can work on a cooperative basis. One of the strengths of the Freedom House Coalition, for the first time since I don't know where, three black organizations were going downtown and not letting them play us off, one against the other. "Talk about funding, fund us all. We're coming to you with a joint budget for desegregation, we're talking." They couldn't believe it, it blew their minds, 'cause heretofore, it was, "Give it to me, don't give it to them," you know, I don't want to get involved in that. But we tried to go in a bloc, and we need to build more of this into the Boston scene. And I'm not sure how we're going to do it, because the dollars are drying up, and that's a game where we find ourselves at the mercy of the system. And black people are not doing enough, I strongly believe, are not doing enough in terms of raising money to support their own institutions.
CG: Because I tend to take a fairly rigid view of that because... you know, I think back to all the organizations that helped me, I've got to at least put back the amount that was done for me, and you know, it adds up.
MS: Sure it adds up. And even if you can't... When we started Freedom
House, you know, we said there was no such thing as a small contribution. The man that gave us fifty cents, which to him was a good fifty-dollar contribution out of his income, was as important to us as those who could afford to give more. We started out running Freedom House, you know, on a six-dollar membership, fifty cents a month as insurance. We had a little brochure that said, "You insure everything else; you insure your house against fire, you insure your life. Why don't you put a little into your community and insure it?" And this is what it's going to cost
*
Otto Snowden﻿63
(cont.) you, fifty cents a month, anybody can afford that." But you know, that was the pitch that we had then.
So after going through that whole bit, urban renewal and the bottom dropping out of that, and our concern about schools, that is how we actually got into developing this department at Freedom House. A part of it was that if we had not been able to get Ellen Jackson to come and head it up, I'm not sure that we would have been willing to take it on, because it needed somebody with educational expertise. Ellen has a rich background, Exodus, State Department of Education, she helped to write the first desegregation plan, she wasn't happy with it, but she helped to write it. She had been at the Kennedy Institute of Politics; she had been in Washington as an intern on some kind of program, I forget, but she had a wide range in her background that was particularly important to getting this thing going. So when she came on, she came on in May of '74, and the institute has really been under her direction, although I've involved myself in it because it is the major thrust, the board has made the decision that for the forseeable future, that education will be it. We do other things, but that is the primary focus. And you're into now, we are all into now, it's what we originally intended to do, which was to get information out to parents and help them learn how to deal with the system, as some of us had been able to do in our dealings with it originally. That this kind of information, interpreted, explained in simple language, not the kind of language that's intended to confuse, that would help people to be able to act on their own.
But we got all caught up in the violence and the hostility and the tension, protection of black kids, worry about white kids coming into the community, so that from '74 really, '74 and '75, all of our energies were drained off in that direction. Then in '76, things were a little calmer, and we had a feeling we had kind of turned the corner in terms of overt hostility, that then we needed to concentrate on taking a look at what our kids were learning. And educational excellence, which was the original goal, is now uppermost, and that's why we're working on these SSAT workshops; we have fee waiving information for kids wanting to go to college; we've got the travel/study which is kind of an adjunct, but not necessarily under the educational department. Last year we gave $21,000 to eleven kids interested in careers in science and engineering. We're hoping we'll be able to do it again. We've recruited across the state, and we managed to get some money from a foundation in New York, plus a business here in order to give these scholarships.
One thing I think that is important, is that Freedom House is, in a sense, a "community broker," and that is even more important, from where I sit, than having large stashes of money in your own hands, 'cause you never have enough. But if you know where the money is, and you can identify the people who have needs, and you put the two together, that to me is a very important contribution, because then the responsibility rests on the person who gets the help. You know, you say, you can open the door, but you've got to go through yourself, and once you get through, you're going to have to perform, and if you produce, you're on your way, on your own, ain't nobody going to turn you around; you can do it. All you have to say to people is, "You can do it," and that's not like, so much like Sammy Davis's "Yes, I can," but it's more like, "Take﻿64
MS: (cont.) a look," and there are people around with our vocational
educational piece of the institute, which is what we're doing under contract with the school department. There are eight schools in this city which have programs in electricity, furniture repair, upholstering, sheet metal work, you know, where the money is today. We've got to take a new look, that if college has been the goal for everybody in the past, and we've gone along with that program, and the tradesmen and all the skills are being lost over the centuries that black people had, take another look at how you make a living. You're not downgrading, you're not trying to trap black people, but you're saying, you ought to take a look at this. Because it costs too much to go to college and your return on your college investment is not necessarily very great, when all these college educated people are running around looking for jobs and can't get them.
CG: And there's a 1 ot of the things that are taught in college that can be taught at the high school level and...
MS: But that whole thing is another whole bag in and of itself. There is no reason for people to spend twelve years in elementary and secondary schools, and come out and have to go on to higher education, and then on to some kind of specialty. That's too much time out of your life, and it could be utilized more effectively. Which says a lot about who's going to revamp the educational system, and you're up against the fact of what purpose does the educational system serve in the United States? It's always served to bolster the white Anglo-Saxon male's needs, to turn out people who can move easily and quickly into the system. And at the point that this is no longer happening, then they desert the system and they find other ways. So you have the independent schools, you have all kinds of ways that people who have had the power, have manipulated the system that was supposed to help everybody enter into the mainstream of American life.
That's a whole thing that has to do with, and I don't know how you get into...you only take a piece of it. The only way I think that we have survival is to try to figure out what pieces of this we can deal with. And try to deal with them in depth, and not be dilettantish and run around and hit here today and here tomorrow. There has to be some continuity and there has to be some stability, there has to be a commitment, and you've got to stick with them until you see that they're no longer viable. When we found out that urban renewal was no longer viable, that there was no way to get Washington to put the money into this community that it needed in order to finish, there was no sense in hanging in there, you're just spinning wheels. So you move out, knowing that there are unfulfilled pieces. See, Washington Park has never been finished, and it's a strong possibility that unless some way is found that it's going to...it'll retrogress, you've got vacant land, you've got vacant housing. You've got all that in-fill stuff around here, a blighting influence, and unless we get rid of that and clean out, really clean out the cancerous conditions in the community, the possibilities of slippage are great. I'm really worried about that. But somebody else will have to take it on. You see young people coming around here in their compaigns, and you've got people over at Roxbury Multi-Service Center running the programs, and they're running them, again as I say,﻿65
MS: (cont.) they are running them with different tools and a different
climate, so maybe they'll get one more step down the road. Hopefully, who knows?
Who knows what Mr. Carter is going to do? I don't know, I really don't know .anymore. I had such hopes for that man, and Otto was saying that there was a question about whether he's going to do any more...he's got into balancing the budget and all that kind of stuff. What is he going to do for black people, and maybe he feels that because he's got Andy, and he's got third world commitments, and making pious statements about South Africa, that that is going to satisfy black people in the United States.
CG: Has the issue of the krugerrand come up at your bank?
MS: Oh yes, not at the bank. Not at the bank, but I think I should send that article from the Banner to the chairman of the board. I don't even know, I hadn't heard anything about it. There are banks in this town that invest heavily in South Africa, so that there's a bind, and it's hard to tell what should be done. The business of whether multinationals should pull out of South Africa altogether, what short range harm that does to the long range goal. I'm not clear on that, that's what I've been talking to my brother about, divestiture. He has strong feelings about...
CG: Yes, I can understand it because since Sharpeville, Sharpeville is really the critical point, because the United States had no real investment presence there up until 1961, when other European countries pulled out.
MS: It's a very complex...
CG: It's a can of worms, it's like you were saying before, see how one piece is connected to another.
MS: That's right.
CG: I gave a paper on also the preliminaries of my research. I told people I'd do the paper before I had finished the research, thinking I'd be farther along and one thing in the paper, the point I had made is that you just find out that one thing is connected to another, and once you're out there, you just can't stop. That's very clear.
MS: That's right, and the problem is to keep yourself from being pulled into so many different directions at once that you get torn apart. That is another kind of thing, and this is my final word for today, which is that I do feel strongly that for women, like you and like me... Of course, I've been through the whole business of having family, limited to be sure, and I'm not going along with the ideology of me for me, that seems so prevalent now, you know, looking out for number one and all that, but I do feel strongly that there is a necessity to be selfish at the point of trying to save a little bit of yourself for yourself. That is the only way, and I keep telling my daughter this, that the only way she can really be useful to herself, to her child and to her husband, and to others is even if nobody else agrees, and if it looks as if you're being﻿66
MS: (cont.) hardhearted, take a little time to restore your own soul.
Otherwise, you become so bitter and resentful and your productivity is limited, but you've got to take time for yourself and I think that that is not unreasonable, but the problem is how to do it.
And I think that that's a whole thrust, as I see it, in the women's movement, which has to do with this piece of it, that there are certain kinds of things that women enjoy doing. You don't have to be defensive about it. I like to cook, I'm a good cook, but I don't have time to cook. I resent having to spend time washing dishes and cleaning, so I have a woman who comes in twice a week. Now, I couldn't afford it when I was much younger, and I had more energy then, so I did a lot of things, and it took a lot out of me. And in those early days I guess I felt it, but I wasn't as resentful as I am now. I used to write all my speeches in my head, washing dishes, mopping the floor, that was the time that I utilized for my headwork. And yet I think I still thought that I ought to be able to sit down and be creative and whatnot without having all these demands on me. And I don't know how you work that into a schedule. I guess one of the things that a woman needs to do, is going to have to figure out, is how you manage a life that does not necessarily deprive you of any piece of what you want to do. You want to be a parent, you want to be mother, you want to do a little cooking, you like doing a little housework, then be able to do all of that. You want a job, but you've got to be able to manage it, and it's the how, and we haven't learned that yet. Society doesn't build it in for us. The options aren't there. You've still got to make choices. And most of them are killing choices. Okay? I've talked enough.
Let's talk about it for one minute before you go away. Where have you found the material valuable? Because I think this is one of the dimensions of this study. If all we're going to do is to go around and compile the information from a lot of interesting women and put it on record somewhere. At the last meeting of the committee, I suggested that we needed to do a public relations piece that makes it known and that for you, this has been useful, having this kind of material available. Where did you say you went, now you...
CG: I went and looked through the card file where they had collections like Afro-American sources, and just went through the card file on women.
MS: All right, but you're in, you know, a very special kind of thing, 'cause you're in an educational atmosphere, so that you have access to this. I think the question that we raise is not only should the people who are in educational circles and who are doing studying have access, but I think that this ought to be somehow...
CG: Somebody should be encouraged or commissioned to write children's
stories from this material. I mean, I constantly think of just the interviews that I have done on a very small scale, yet, you know, beautiful little children's books that would be inspiring to little girls and boys could be written from them.
MS: You,know, with Martin Luther King and George Washington Carver and Charlie Drew, there are so many...﻿67
CG: ...a variety of experiences and especially with what the women did, because that history has not been written yet. There's some very real divisions that took place in the black community, nationally and locally, the women were not as mobile as men . I went through Carter Woodson's piece the other night, on the Negro washerwoman, and he talks about the fact that she was taking washing into her home which made her available while working, contributing economically, to educate her children, to suuport her husband's career or support the family. She was available for community contacts, for mobilization for various causes such as abolition, such as fighting Jim Crow, and all of these other things that happened. There's a whole piece there that when things for black women were political responsibilities, things that other women take for granted and are pushing them away, when these were actively taken on by black women as political responsibilities, and that has been the base and how, you know, most of the people in my study got out in the community was through these particular women things. Racism affects the life cycle and it affects it early, and their concerns about the early parts of their children's life cycle got them moving. And Chris Nteta spoke...we tried to give a program on South Africa, and we had Chris Nteta, and he made the point that for some reason in his experience, he's from South Africa, he said the women get involved in the movement, they don't cook till it's over. Men can always leave, but for some reason women can't, for the same reason that 80 percent of the runaways during slavery were men. It's that very same reason and so there was something that was...
MS: ...that when women ran, they took their kids, when the men ran, they went alone.
CG: All the notable runaways went with the family and Harriet Tubman went back nineteen times for the families...
MS: ...and she transported her community with her, you know. I just read that somewhere and I'm not sure where it was, that there was a special note made of the fact that the women did this.
CG: I'd be curious to see the reference to that, because I just got through writing a whole section, a chapter...
MS: I don't know where I saw this, whether it was in Ebony or wherever. That's another thing I...
CG: Ellen Craft took her husband.
MS: That's right. Incidentally, when we were at the Black Women History
Project meeting, you know Ruth Hill's husband, Brother Blue, was there and Brother Blue entertained us and Ellen has given him Running a Thousand Miles to Freedom, in the hope that he can read the tale. The thing that he's done with the "Ugly Duckling" is absolutely fascinating. Have you...
CG: MS:
No, I haven't heard it.
That is just incredible. It is so, it's so full of pathos and so full﻿68
MS: (cont.) of meaning for children, whose self-image is so important.
And he did several things for us, but Ellen thought that there was a part of this story that he could probably do something very interesting with. So he's in California now, they're out there on a three-week tour.
CG: Oh yes, she told me she was going.
MS: Yes, and maybe he might come up with something, maybe by the time he gets back. But we need to talk, too, maybe another time then.
MS: Every year the Freedom House board, and this is sort of at our insistence, tries to evaluate, redefine, take a look at where you've been and where you're going, so that you don't get locked in year after year without having applied some thought to what you've been doing and how it relates to what's happening. One of the things that I think I said to you was that at this conference that I went to on human rights, to hear people talking in a fragmented way about education, housing and welfare, et cetera, as if all these things do not impinge and impact upon one another, so that the report that we gave suggested that the board members needed to review the totality in which we operate in this town, and then to see how well we were doing with the program pieces that we could handle, given staff and money limitations. So that if you expand that, you make another jump, and then you begin to think about, well, it's not only what you're doing in Boston and in Massachusetts, but how does this relate to what's going on in the world.
I don't think I had much sense of the world situation, other than what I got through my brother, until I actually got on a plane and went to Africa, and ever since... When I went to Europe it was different, I was really a tourist. When Gail graduated from college in June of '67, and she joined her husband in Germany, Otto and I chased after her that Christmas and we got a twenty-one-day tour that took us to London, Munich, and from Munich to Rome and Paris. We stayed a day and a half in London, which is interesting. I think that as I read the papers, little essays that our kids write who are in the travel/study project that we have at Freedom House, you know, sending the kids to Europe. Their first stop is London and they had the same feeling, I guess anybody does when you go to London. You really get a sense that this is New England, that London, it's so familiar, there's so much about it, the names of the streets and the places and whatnot, that it's so familiar. We stayed a day and a half, and the interesting thing there was that this youngster whom we had befriended, a young Jewish boy who had been at Freedom House, which was the Hebrew Teacher College when we moved into the building in 1952, and he was one who became so friendly with us, because he was really interested in what we were doing and why we were doing it. And we helped him through school, and then he ended up as an assistant professor in anthropology. And he has spent a lot of time in Botswana, doing research there. But anyway, he was at the University of Manchester, and he came down to London and sort of squired us around so that we got... We went to Parliament and we went to the Tower of London and all kinds of things that he helped us do. The familiarity of the place was very impressive. Then we went to Munich, and from Munich we went to Rome to﻿69
MS: (cont.) visit Otto's niece, who had married an Italian and x^as living in Rome. And then we went back to Munich and spent New Year's. And then from Munich, we went to Geneva, and spent a day and a half because we had friends in Geneva, and then we spent four days in Paris. Paris was the only place we didn't know anybody, and we didn't particularly like it. There was a lot of anti-American feeling in Paris, this was 1967, 1968, and we felt it, you know. As you move around, it wasn't so much that you felt, you don't feel the racial thing, you felt that the problem was that you were an American, not that you were black. But that twenty-one days didn't do much, other than actually seeing places you'd read about.
CG: And this was the first time you had been to Europe.
MS: That was the first time I had been to Europe. First time, I guess, we'd ever been anywhere that was any distance. We've been to California, but we'd never been out of the country, really, until then. And then the difference between that and going to Africa was just tremendous, because first of all, I was visiting family, and my brother's wif e... I guess the first time I went was in 1970. In 1970 I had been fooling around saying that I wanted to go, I wanted to go, and then Freedom House had its twentieth anniversary in 1969, and part of the anniversary celebration was also our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. So they had put together a purse for us and the purse was actually earmarked for me to go to Africa, for us to go to Africa, 'cause I'd been talking about going to visit my brother. My husband didn't want to go, so I said, "Stay home, I will go." When I think about it now. just the thing about going off, that far, and I wasn't in any tour group, I was by myself, and I just got on a plane and I went to Ghana first. And my sister-in-law met me there, and I had seen her only once before, when she came to the United States; maybe I told you, she's Ghanaian.
CG: No, you hadn't mentioned that.
MS: Oh, she's Ghanaian, so these three children... As I used to tell the young people, who in the sixties when they were giving me a hard time about, you know, being "Uncle Toms" and all that, how we needed to get back to our roots and identity, I said, "You know, I can't take all this from you. I am concerned about Africa, but it seems to me that, you know, my blood runs in the veins of three African children, how about yours?" I have blood relatives. At this point, I'm not just running to Africa to find my identity. And my sister-in-law was really very helpful, 'cause she said after I'd been there for three days, she said, "I want to tell you something." She said, "If you had gotten off that plane and leaned down and kissed the earth and looked skyward and said, 'Ah, Mother Africa, home at last,' I don't think I would have spoken to you again in my life!" Because by this time, I think she and a lot of other Africans, particularly the intellectuals, were a little bit fed up with people dashing, all these black people running to Africa in a search for which they had made no preparation. I don't think I had made any preparation either; I didn't know what I was expecting, I really didn't. But whatever it was, it wasn't what I found, because when I got there and I landed, the first stop out of here was Dakar, and we got to Dakar at something like three o'clock in the morning, it's a beautiful airport, and﻿70
MS: (cont.) it was hot. Because I had left New York at five o'clock, and that was the first stop and it was hot. They've got a magnificent airport, and then the next one was Roberts Field, I guess, and that was in Monrovia and that wasn't too exciting, Liberia. And then, I guess, Ac era was the third stop, so 1 had the whole business of jet lag; but the family was very welcoming and very warm and they have a very lovely house. I have to show you...oh, I just sent those pictures off. I wanted to show you the pictures of their house. But anyway, I stayed there for a week, walking around, going to the marketplace. I think I went to Tema; my sister-in-law took me to Tema, which was the new town that Nkrumah had started way before the coup. It was an interesting experience because Tema, and again, this was a linkage, because I had been involved with the Minnesota Experimental City. Did I ever tell you about that?
CG: No.
MS: The Minnesota Experimental City was a proposal to build a comuletelv
self-contained new town in Minnesota, far enough away from Minneapolis and Saint Paul so it wouldn't be a bedroom community. There was a great deal of talk about limiting the population to 250,000 people, and that it would have all kinds of innovations, you know, "people-movers" and probably nuclear power for a source of energy and all this. And so I was on this National Advisory Committee to the Minnesota Experimental City, and there were some exciting people on that committee. Rita Hauser was on that committee, she was the only other woman, she was at the U.N. then. Buckminster Fuller, fantastic experience to know Buckminster Fuller. Bill Wheaton, who had been very active out in California in housing and development. Who else, big, big...it wasn't a big committee, but these were exciting people.
So having had that experience, and having heard about Jonathan and Columbia and Reston, to go to a new town in Africa was very interesting. It's a sea town, a seaport, and I guess the principal industry was the shipbuilding, and you'd see the women who had been fishing, and they'd be selling their wares. But the story that they told, and I'm not sure who told it to me, was that people were distressed, because in the process of putting Tema together, all the people who had lived there in this area before Tema became a reality were displaced, and when they left, they took everything with them. They took all of the artifacts, they took all of their religious symbols and everything. I guess it was Efua who said that what they had done was to have left Tema a city without a soul, because all the people who came in were immigrants, you see. And then you think about the West End of Boston, where you had this disastrous urban renewal program, where everybody was moved out, and the people who came in to live there were an entirely different kind of person.
So I began to make some of these linkages, you know, and then I went back to Tema again in '75, and it was interesting to see how it had grown. Instead of having neighborhoods, they're called "community," and there's community one through ten. Community Ten is where I go because I have a friend, a friend of my brother's and a friend of his family, who's a magnificent woman who had started an SOS children's village. SOS children's﻿71
MS: (cont.) villages started in Austria. They are settlements for neglected, abandoned, destitute children, and this one, Alice Appea had started. I went to visit it, because again, I guess this was still a busman's holiday for me. My sister-in-law was very sensitive, and she didn't just take me around to see the things that tourists see. She said, "What are you interested in?" So then she took me to the University of Ghana where she taught, at Legon, and she took me to Tema, and she took me to the Rain Forest—all things that I really wanted to see. Then, this friends of hers, Auntie Alice, said, "Wouldn't you like to come and see my little village?" And I went. And it is again, it's a woman thing, the women run this, this woman founded it. They have a series of little houses in which they have a mix of children, they don't have children all of one age. That isn't a family kind of thing; they have children of various ages. I think there are not more than ten children to a unit, and each unit is painted different colors, so there is some individuality, it's not institutionalized. And they have a kitchen, and they have a housemother in each one. I don't know, they had grown so when I went back in '75, I couldn't believe it. So that I send, I don't have a great deal of money to give to good causes, but 1 send money to Tema because ten dollars in Tema does a lot for the children. And in '70 when I was there, they had found a pair of twins who were near death, I guess they were abandoned. And when I got back there in '75, these little brown roly-poly things, I couldn't believe that they had been nursed back to health. It was just a great experience, and I stay in touch now. I get a newsletter from them and I send money when I can. But again, it was the linkage between things that I was interested in here, and to see how universal, again, this kind of thing is, the women caring for children, and it's been done very well. So that was one kind of thing that happened.
I stayed for ten days, got over jet lag, got to know my nieces and my nephew whom I had never seen before. At that time, how old were they, fourteen, fifteen? Teenagers, and I think again, the thing that impressed me was that these were very bright personable youngsters, but there was something different about them. I kept thinking, what's different about these teenagers from the ones at home? I finally realized that you could sit down and have a conversation with them in which they did not agree with you, but there was none of that belligerence that, you know...oh, you don't know anything. They were very respectful, and you could sit and you had adult kind of conversation with them, and I said, there's really something very special about these children. And then when I came back home, people got tired of hearing me talk about the African kids that I had met, these children and their friends who were very sophisticated politically, far more so than our young people. I mean, they liked to dance, they liked to date, you know, James Brown was big then, they're up on all the new music, American music, they watch "Hawaii Five-0" on television. They were normal teenagers, they was nothing stuffy about them, but at the same time, they had this grasp of what was going on in their country. They could sit down and talk about politics in a way that I just found, unless you find a very elite group of youngsters, and particularly black young people, if you ever make the connection here, I just found, you know, the disco and all of that was so uppermost in their minds.﻿72

CG: MS:
(cont.) So then when I left Ghana, I went to Tanzania. I went straight, straight across the continent to my brother in Dar es Salaam. And at that time he was working for the Tanzanian government, and he was in one of the ministries, and I stayed with him for, I don't know, four or five weeks and that again was an exciting time. Julius Nyerere wasn't there then. They had arranged for me to have tea with him, and I was a day late or something getting there, and Nyerere had gone off to the villages. And again, talking about how this affects your world view, Nyerere's rationale for going out—and he spent a lot of time in the villages—was that he couldn't govern his people from some central spot equivalent to a White House in Dar es Salaam, he had to get out among them. He was going to explain his concept of Ujamaa and what it meant and why it was so important for everybody to hear it from the man in charge. He's a very warm man. In a sense, he's very sophisticated and he's very knowledgeable, but he's also a simple man; you just don't get a sense that he's the president. I guess he doesn't, he is a politician and he's got to manuever and he's got to operate and he's got to deal, but you had a sense that there was a great deal of integrity and honesty to this whole...
Isn't he called the conscience of Africa?
I guess so. My brother Bill felt that he was an "innocent." He said he was kind of a "freak," because he was a totally honest person who was not searching for power, and because he doesn't search for power, he doesn't have the same kinds of things that worried Nkrumah. Nkrumah got paranoid; he had to worry about who's going to kill you. I suppose Nyerere's got people who would kill him, but not for the same reasons, you know.
So that whole business of being in Tanzania, and then the comparison between West Africa and East Africa. West Africa, I think people who go to West Africa feel, as I did, that there's a certain kind, just like London has a certain kind of familiarity because of New England, that after all, the slave trade to the United States was out of the west coast of Africa, so you do look around and you look at people and you say, oh, they look like somebody I know. There is a difference and it's very hard to put your finger on the difference between, say, Accra and Dar es Salaam. But I think Dar es Salaam is more exotic, and the slave trade was over the Indian Ocean, so you have the Arabian influence and you have the large number of Asians. In West Africa, you have the Lebanese, but in East Africa, in Dar es Salaam, all the tension that existed between the Asians—remember this is a period in which they were beginning to expel the Asians. Nyerere's approach was one in which, I think that they were beginning to nationalize a lot of things that the Asians controlled, but there wasn't the cruelty. You could sense the feeling, because I can remember every night the Asians, the Indians would dress in their beautiful saris and they would be walking up and down the waterfront. Somebody said that they were hoping that one of these days they'd be walking down that waterfront, and when they look longingly across the Indian Ocean at India, he said, somebody'11 tell them to start walking. Bill had an Indian friend, a lawyer, whom I got to know who was very nice, so that there was, again as I say, I never would have met these people on an ordinary tour.﻿73
MS: (cont.) Then Bill had a friend who was getting married, a colleague
in the ministry, and he was getting married out in the bush, so we went to his wedding. And I've forgotten how long—he was getting married at a place called Ifakara, and the village was dominated by a Catholic mission there. There was a church and a school, and Bill and I set out to go to Ifakara to a wedding at three o'clock in the afternoon. Well, getting ready to go on that safari—first, I learned that "safari" is a trip; it does not necessarily mean hunting or photographing, it is a trip. Safari is simply trip. So we were getting ready to go on safari, and Bill wanted to borrow a car. We went in his car which was sort of falling apart, and you had to make sure that you had enough gas, put a can of gas in. You had to make sure you had all the tools that you needed to change tires or whatnot, because there weren't any gas stations along the way and there weren't going to be any garages with mechanics. All right? So I didn't know why Bill took so long to get us together to go on this trip.
Well, we finally got ourselves organized and off we went. And one of the first places we stopped, well there's a Teachers College, Morogoro— the names are so, you know, like water—Morogoro Teachers College; I think we stopped there for a minute. Bill had a friend that he had to see. And later we stopped, there was a lodge and a small game park called Mikumi, and we hit there around twelve o'clock. The game lodge you wouldn't believe, it was like something that you'd see...very western, swimming pool,there was a restaurant and we stopped there to eat. By then, I said to Bill, "Are we going through the game park?" I would see these signs saying "For the next twenty-two miles the animals have the right of way," and I said, "I don't see anything." I saw ostriches running along beside the road and you would see an occasional giraffe, but Bill said, "You know, it's noontime, the animals aren't out. It's hot and they're resting." So we continued our way down the road, and I was disappointed I didn't see any animals.
We got to Ifakara about two minutes of three and I was frantic. By this time I was covered from head to foot with the red dust. After you leave the tarmac and hit the dirt roads, that dust is incredible. It is red, we were riding behind trucks, the Chinese were building this Tanzam railroad, and we would keep running into these trucks with the Chinese laborers. If you got behind one of those trucks, they kicked up the dust, it was like heavy fog, you couldn't see, and then you ended up, my eyebrows, my eyelashes, I had on black pants, they had turned red, I was a mess. I had my hair done up in a bandana. So we got to Ifakara, and it was two minutes of three, and I had planned to have a nice shower, change my clothes, and go into the church for the wedding, but we didn't have time. So I walked in the church, incidentally I was a little distressed... Like a traveler, I sort of expected I was going to see something very special, very different from anything I'd ever seen before. But the wedding was a kind of a traditional wedding in the sense the bride wore white. She was Catholic, so she was being married in this church and her husband was a Moslem...
CG: That's interesting.
MS: And there was a question about this, because at the reception afterwards,﻿74
MS: (cont.) the parents were talking about this mixed marriage. There
was a lot of conversation going on about it. I didn't understand... People speak Swahili, I didn't know any Swahili except jambo and asante. I learned rather early on how to say hello and thank you and please and that's it. But when I went into church, we were so late, we sat down and tried to be as inconspicuous as possible, and this little boy was sitting like over here, and he kept looking at me with these great big eyes. I felt so uncomfortable because he kept staring at me, and suddenly I realized that I was on the men's side of the church! All the women were on the other side, and I was sitting on this side. So I said, "Well, I've got on my slacks," and I pushed my hair some more underneath my bandana and stayed there, because to move would have been, it would have just drawn attention. And then after the wedding, when I was outside, I took pictures, and the bride came out and the groom came out and then you got a witch doctor and a few other things, you know, that looked a little more like what you expected to see.
We stayed overnight, and the next morning, I went to the bride's hut, and it was only as big as a room, a mud hut, just one room, and all the relatives were coming from everywhere. And she was sort of sitting on a bed, greeting everybody, there wasn't enough room, they'd come in and go out, and you know, I'd never been inside a mud hut before, and that was really something. Here's a wedding that I had attended, and I said, "You know, this is another kind of experience that's just great." The night we spent there, I guess they had a room. I think the biggest problem I had was I had a touch of Montezuma's revenge then. I think between jet lag and the rushing and everything to get there, I was having a time, so I said, "Bill, you have got to find a bathroom for me that is western." 'Cause the eastern style is not...that was another thing that I learned early on, that if you travel in Africa and you travel in East Africa, then you're going to find eastern style toilets, it's better not to be wearing slacks. So Bill told me, he said, "Well, we'll find a place, but you've got to make a few adjustments," so I was making adjustments.
Then back in Dar es Salaam, by this time we were waiting because Bill was going to go to Ngorongoro Crater. I wanted to see the animals and Bill thought that would be a nice trip to take. So we waited for his children to come, with a great deal of anxiety because communications were so bad, we couldn't seem to reach them and they hadn't reached us, so we didn't know when they were arriving. Finally they arrived, and it was the first time they had ever been away from home. And they'd come to see their father whom they hadn't seen in five years. So in a sense, I was a bridge; I had just left them and then they came and I was in Dar. So they came, and I guess the next morning we got up and started off for Ngorongoro. Again, there were all these preparations for the trip and this time we took another car.
Incidentally, on the way back from Ifakara, Bill's car hit a rock, and because the bottom of his car had rusted out, all the dust was coming up through the floor. We hit a rock and it locked his steering gear. And it happened, I don't know, we had hit on of those checkpoints. As you go along, there are all these checkpoints, taxes and stuff, and as we stopped at this place, a couple guys came, one came upon a motorbike﻿75
MS: (cont.) and took Bill off. The last I saw of Bill, he was off on the back of this motorbike, going to a garage. And we were very lucky because he was at a place where, I'd forgotten what they made, but they were expert mechanics on Peugeots—that's what Bill's car is, a Peugeot. And we went to a hospital that was in this little village where we were, and the doctor was Dutch or something, and he was very nice, and he brought cold drinks and allowed us to stay there while the car was repaired.
It took a long time so that when we hit Mikumi, it was dusk. Bill had been trying to get across; he said, "Now we've got to get past Mikumi before dark," 'cause then you know, this whole business about "the animals having the right of way" becomes another kind of scene. So it was just dusk, and we were tearing down the road. All of a sudden, I said to Bill, "What's that in front of us down there?" And he said, "I think those are elephant," you don't say elephants, and he said, "now roll up the windows and we'll go very slowly." You know, I said, "Here my brother's been in Africa all these years." I figured that he would take all this in stride, but I looked at his face and he didn't look very happy. So we went slowly down the road because he said that if you drive fast and scare them, they'll charge you. So here an elephant going across the road, there were two or three of them and that was something else. I wanted to see the animals, but that was a little closer than I intended.
CG: A Peugeot is very much smaller than an elephant.
MS: Oh goodness, they could pick it up in their trunk and throw it over the road. Bill's concern was that it was getting dark and he couldn't really see. So I think we were glad to get back. But then we took off for Ngorongoro which is what? I think it was 750 miles, 1500 round trip, and Bill did all the driving. Again, it reminded me in some way, not in the same context, but you know we talked about black people finding their way across the United States, how you had to have the linkage, so that you could avoid discrimination. Well, you have the linkage in Africa, but it's not to avoid discrimination. It's to avoid getting someplace to find out you're starving to death and there are no restaurants or nothing! So Bill had sent cablegrams ahead to various people that he knew along the way to Arusha, saying we'll be arriving approximately at such and such a time. So when we got to, I think the first stop we had was in Same which is a little village, I've forgotten how far it was.
Where Bob Moses and his wife Janet were teaching... She had just had their first child, she was a black American, and her mother had come on from New York to be with her. When we arrived at the Moseses' house, they had prepared lunch and we were able to go and lie down and rest. Then Mrs. Jemmott, I've forgotten her first name, Mrs. Jemmott, Janet Moses's mother, said she'd been there since April, that this was August, and she was ready to make a move. So we said, "Why don't you come and go with us to Ngorongoro?" So we piled her into the car, so now there are what, five of us—there's Bill's three children, and Bill...there are more than that, six, with Mrs. Jemmott. From there, when we left Same, the next stop was at a judge's house in Arusha which is at the foot﻿76
MS: (cont.) of Mount Kilimanjaro. Seems to me we even stopped before we got to Arusha.
We spent a night at a YMCA, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro there's a YMCA with a swimming pool [laughter]; out of my window at the foot of the mountain I could look and it almost seemed, it was like being in the Alps, in Garmisch, Germany, or someplace, where you have the mountains right up on you. So you're right at the foot of Kilimanjaro. When we got to this town, I cannot remember what it was, isn't that funny? Anyway, it was just before we got to Arusha. Kilimanjaro is always in the clouds, you can't see it. And Mrs. Jemmott said that she had been there, I think twice, and she had never seen Kilimanjaro. That day, I think that day at five o'clock, the clouds disappeared and you could see the top of the mountain. It was spectacular. We stopped and I tried to take some pictures. And then we stayed at the YMCA for something like two dollars a night per person, and I don't know, the meals were incredibly cheap, and they were good.
Then the next morning, when we started on toward Arusha, we had this luncheon, again the same process as stopping at the Moseses', was to stop at Bill's friend who was a judge in Arusha. He had a beautiful home, and they had an elaborate luncheon for us, and then we headed out to Ngorongoro Crater. When we arrived, it was dark, we had no reservations, "there was no room at the inn." Bill and his son slept in a youth hostel, and the girls and Mrs. Jemmott and I had one room. The motel had one room that wasn't finished, but it had a stove in it, and it had hot water. That's the point at which I began to feel like a tourist. If I can have hot water or warm water, you know, plumbing is very important. Then it was cold. It was so cold, I couldn't believe it. We were going north towards Kenya, and were going up. Nairobi is always cold, you know. Nairobi is so high. In Kenya, it's cold and you're almost at the border of Kenya and Tanzania.
When we got up in the morning to go down into the crater, it was forty-nine degrees. We just begged our way into that room. You have a very elegant lodge where people from all over the world stay, because Ngorongoro is famous. When we got up in the morning at eight o'clock to go down into the crater, there was this heavy, heavy fog and it was forty-nine degrees. There was a big thermometer that was outside and it registered forty-nine degrees, and I said, "Wait until I get back and tell people that in August in Africa, it was forty-nine degrees." It was so cold that the children had taken everything that I owned, because I had sweaters and all kinds of things. Everybody borrowed my stuff— windbreakers, everything, so that I ended up going down the crater in a white stole. It was the only thing I had left. Incidentally, when you travel, you travel with the bedsheets, pillowcases, towels, toilet tissue, Kleenex. The children got to laughing 'cause they said, "Auntie Muriel has everything," every time anybody wanted something, I would reach into a bag and pull it out. [laughter] 'Cause Bill had told me, "Be prepared." Then we went down into the crater and I thought, at one point, that the whole Sutherland family would disappear from the face of the earth. The crater is 2,000 feet deep and in order to get into it, you do this circular thing in a Land Rover. It takes an hour to get down there, and Land Rovers are not the most comfortable things in the world to sit in, and we got down to the bottom of the crater, and again it was﻿77
MS: (cont.) a cloudy day because it was winter, it's their winter, it's not. ..
CG: That's right, they're upside down.
MS: So the grass was brown and it was not lush, but then you had the herds, the wildebeests and the zebras, which they call zebras, and I guess maybe the most spectacular thing was to see a whole flock of flamingos take off, this cloud of pink going up in the air, there must have been thousands of them. And then we saw black rhinoceros and they were squaring off at each other just like you see in the documentaries; a pride of 1 ions that had just killed an eland, so you had a pride of lions with a kill. A pregnant lioness was sitting right in front of the Land Rover, and she never even moved as if, you know, who cares about you; the animals are very used to people.
The first thing you saw when you got down were the Masai. We had met some along the road and then you know, you look at them and you say now these are black people, and the Masai are very arrogant, and well, they're so striking that there's nothing subservient about the Masai at all. There's a difference, people did say they felt a difference between West Africans and East Africans. West Africans tended to be more friendly. People always talk about the "happy West African;" you don't hear so much about the happy East African. I think that West Africans are more loose, if you can make generalizations. When I was waiting for the plane in Nairobi, when I was on my way from Ghana to Tanzania, I had to wait in Nairobi for my plane to leave. This guy was sitting next to me, and he was making this comparison. "These people here don't look happy," he said, "they're no longer happy since the colonialism disappeared." I said, "I would think that maybe they dqn't have any reason to look happy at this point. They've got business to attend to." I never said another word to this man. It made me so mad. I sat there in that airport and looked at the sign that said, "New York City, 7,000 and something miles" and I said, "What am I doing here, what am I doing here?" But Ngorongoro was a big experience, and we had to see the animals and come back up out of the crater, and then the trip back was just the repeat of what had gone on going up. That I felt was one of the things that you should see if you go, you should see it, but I don't think that I would go traipsing back to the game parks over and over again. And I do have movies of the whole trip and there are times when I sort of sit down and look at them. I've spliced 400 feet of that first trip.
So that was...I fell in love with the whole experience, of not searching for identity, I think that I had my head on straight enough. I just wanted, I was curious, curious, and there were many rewards, and I think just meeting people and talking to them. I did feel one thing though, I said I should never go back to East Africa without learning Swahili, because when we were in one of the villages and I was talking to a little boy, beyond jambo and asante sana, hello and thank you, and what other words did I know? I knew kwa herimeans goodbye. I said I want to be able to communicate with this child. He does not have to have the equipment to communicate with me. See, I wasn't going to feel that everybody ought to speak English. I really felt strongly that I should﻿78
MS: (cont.) know Swahili so I could have talked with him a little bit
more. And I always said I was going to learn, but I haven't learned yet. Maybe when I go back one more time I will have taken a crash course in Swahili. Swahili's a beautiful language, it's beautiful, but it's difficult. My brother speaks Swahili, but he's picked it up, but he's had to learn in order to get along. But he's not that fluent, but he's fluent. So then you know, my whole life was geared to when could I go back. And I didn't go back until '74.
CG: Now when you went back in '74, did you go to the East...
MS: Same thing, only this time I went to East Africa first; I went straight from New York to Tanzania.
CG: Now was this for the congress...
MS: Sixth Pan-African Congress. I was on a charter plane going out of New York with all these people from the West Indies; there were people from the West Indies who were very much involved in planning the Sixth Pan-African Congress, and there were people that I knew from here...you know Charley Cobb? Charley Cobb used to be at Saint Mark's; he succeeded Otto as director of Saint Mark's Center.
CG: Is he a minister?
MS: Yes. Reverend Cobb.
CG: My father knows him. I don't remember him, but my father would.
MS: All right, he's living in Connecticut. I'm standing in line at the airport, and I look at these people and I say, "Are you going to Tanzania?" "Yes, we're going to Tanzania," and I said, "My name's Muriel Snowden," and the woman said, "My name..." I forget what her first name is "...is Cobb." I said, "I don't believe it." So we were on the same plane; we weren't sitting together and that's a long trip. I think it's seventeen hours from here to Dar, because Dar is eight hours ahead of us.
CG: Seventeen flying hours?
MS: Um hmm. And again, this time I said to my brother, "I want some real comfort, really comfort this time; I'm going to stay in a hotel maybe, and not stay with you," 'cause he has so many people coming in and out of his house. "I've decided to stay someplace else," so he arranged for me to stay at a place called the Bahari Beach. It was twenty-two miles from Dar es Salaam and again, one of these elegant tourist places, beautiful.
CG: What was the name of it again...
MS: Bahari, Bahari Beach Hotel and we had special rates because of the
conference. You were in little coral huts, they were made of coral, had four units in them.
CG: Coral, like coral from the sea?﻿79
MS: Coral from the sea, and there were four units in each one of them. They were circular, like a hut.
CG: Oh, that sounds beautiful.
MS: And you were right on the ocean, on the Indian Ocean, you walk out the back and you're on the beach. I'll show you some pictures of them.
CG: These are the little houses?
MS: Those are the units. This is a kind of main pavilion; that's my
brother. This is a main pavilion where they had dancing on Sundays, and they had Indian meals on Sundays. This is the Indian, I told you about my brother's Indian friend, the lawyer, and he had a...one Sunday evening he asked us to come, he'd just built a beach house and he had a little party. This was a German, and we had a long talk about women and women's rights and stuff. That's a baobab tree, you know that great... This is on the road from my brother's house in town; it's right in Dar es Salaam. This is the beach, this is Oyster Bay, this is the Oyster Bay Hotel, and this is the beach right across the street from that hotel. We used to go there to eat. This is the road...you see a lot of the California type... Now one of the hotels where a lot of people here stayed is the Africana, at the Sixth Pan-African Congress, 'cause they had spill-overs. This was a young man from Washington. This was a driver with the car that we had to take us around. This is outside my brother's house and this is a Somali that I met at the Bahari Beach Hotel. He had me smuggling for him. [laughter] This I thought fantastic, I did this everywhere I went. Here's Esso all over the world, you start talking about multi-nationals, again, you keep talking about how does this affect the fact that you see, you know, Esso and I think there are a few Kentucky Fried Chickens, I'm not sure, but you know, the influence and the controls that are exercised by multi-nationals, you find Exxan stations everywhere.
This is Beverly Carter who was the ambassador to Tanzania when I was there and this is—unfortunately these pictures are dark—but that's the American embassy. This is Bobby Lee who was an American dentist, he and his wife were both dentists, they have lived in Ghana for twenty-three years. They got to Ghana the same way my brother did, almost. This was a young man from California, this is again, this is Bahari Beach. He was at the Sixth Pan-African Congress too. These are some Somalis who came and asked me to take a picture because I had a Polaroid camera, they were... Here's the room inside, this is the inside of this room, and again you can see the huts and the beach. Here's Charley Cobb, Martha and Charley Cobb. Right here Martha and Charley Cobb, was a friend of theirs. This young man was Senegalese and an interpreter, and they had a little child and they were so sweet. This is my brother in front of his beach house. Now this man is Ras McKonnen. He was one of the founders of the Pan-African movement.
CG: Is he from the West Indies?
MS: From Guyana. He lives in Kenya. Here we were at the beach house that Bill looks after and all of us were sitting around. This is Mel McCaw, African-American Institute in Washington, he runs it. And we were all﻿80
MS: (cont.) sitting there enthralled as Ras McKonnen was telling us, he's about eighty years old now.
CG: That's fascinating. Tell me something about the congress, how did you happen to go?
MG: The congress was only incidental. I was going to visit my brother, and I figured I would come to the congress. Bill said that it would be interesting, there were black people coming from all over the world. But you know, a conference is a conference is a conference. The United States delegation didn't do too well, it was the largest delegation, there was a lot of concern about whether they would dominate the conference because there were so many, but the interesting thing was that the Americans couldn't get themselves together, they only came up with one resolution that was of any real significance. There was a lot of internal stuff going on, and I went to some of the sessions, but I have a tendency to try to get away from busman's holidays, you know. This is the University of Dar es Salaam, this is where the sessions were held. Did you know George Lythcott? George Lythcott was a pediatrician here in Boston and he went to Bates, he was a friend of my brother. This is his daughter and I bumped into her, I hadn't seen her since she was a little bit of a thing. Here she is at the congress. There were all kinds of interesting people. That's a little Somali girl... The Somali women are very much in evidence. That's the beach outside. This is just trips that we took. This is Mombasa; that's the airport in Mombasa. This is in Kenya. Now when we get to Mombasa, you're down on the coast and it's warm there.
CG: It's the altitude...
MS: Um hmm. East African Airways, which is folded up, and I think that's Mount Kilimanjaro through the clouds from the plane. That's a Nairobi Hilton [laughter].
CG: Hilton is there.
MS: The Nairobi Hilton. This is, I think, oh, I can't remember the name. It means "here we leave our hearts," it was a road over which the slaves traveled. Oh, I can't think, isn't that awful, I can't remember the name of it. It's Swahili for it, but this was one of the slave points of departure, you have a slave...
CG: "Here we leave our hearts," that's...
MS: Yes, I'll get it. This was some friends, this guy had lived in Tanzania all his life, he's a Tanzanian. We went to visit some people, these are little Indian children. I've got just gobs of pictures, but it's so different from, I think, what you would expect in the cities. I think I told you this wonderful story about the place in the section of Dar es Salaam that they call Alabama.
CG: No, you didn't.
MS: I didn't tell you? That's one of my favorite stories. When Bill was﻿81
MS: (cont.) here, I took him down to the Vineyard; there's a place on the Vineyard where the black people go to swim. And first, there was one section they called the "Inkwell," and then there was another place where they started going down, they called it "The Congo." So I was telling Bill that they call this section of the beach "The Congo."
CG: Now who...
MS: The black people at the Vineyard.
CG: Oh, I see.
MS: They call it the "Inkwell," and "The Congo"...Bill was really very
annoyed that they would call this section of the beach the Congo, so when I went back to Dar, he took me to a section that was really a bombed-out slum-looking section of Dar, and he said, "Do you know what the Africans call this?" I said no, and he said, "They call it Alabama." [laughter]
CG: Oh no.
MS: Which I think is delightful. But anyway, during this stay there, I not only stayed for the congress, and I went to some of the sessions; it was like a United Nations. The thing I think was distressful, Bill had been very much involved in planning it, he was supposed to be the coordinator in Africa...
CG: This was for the congress.
MS: This was for the congress. And there had been a lot of, as I said,
internal, the in-fighting and disputes and differences of opinion about how it should come. C.L.R. James did not come to the conference because his idea, as he conceived it, was to have a people's conference, and it ended up being a conference that was made up of governmental delegates. A lot of OAU, it was an OAU kind of thing. When you looked down on the floor at the conference, you had all these sections with the signs up, like an American political conference, where people came from, and there were people who'd get up and speak. And there were a lot of speeches made, and again, conferences do not really take place on the floor or the sessions. They take place at the New Africa Hotel, where if you stayed at the New Africa Hotel—which was my brother's favorite place, which is right in the center of Dar, they had just remodeled it—and if you sat there long enough, it seemed like the crossroads of the world. Walter Carrington, one I hadn't seen in I don't know how long, I look up and I'm sitting there having lunch and here's Walter Carrington. I was sitting having lunch another day and here's somebody saying, "Muriel, Muriel." Margaret Ashurst, there she is with her troop, trying to take the pictures and do her documentary. Who else was there? There were all kinds of people that you say that you hadn't seen in years.
The New Africa is like, again, there's a, you get a warm feeling of recognition, to be sitting... It's like the Hotel Theresa, you know, only it's outdoors and it's very, very attractive. And that was where I had a terrible experience of lesing my passport. I lost my passport, it was stolen. I was buying a dress in an Indian shop, and when I went﻿82
MS: (cont.) in the shop, I put my passport folder down on the counter; I paid for the dress and put my passport folder down on the counter. I went over to the mirror to see if it looked all right, and came back and got my package and went to the New Africa for lunch. When I went to pay for my lunch at the New Africa, I didn't have my wallet and my passport folder; in it was my plane ticket, my health certificate, my visas and what else was in it? About $350 in traveler's checks and I had about $30 in shillings. All gone. I couldn't believe it was gone. And I ran all around, I looked in everybody's car. I went back to the store, nobody had seen it. So then I had to call the ambassador, Beverly Carter, who was a friend of my brother-in-law, so that made it nice, and he was very helpful, and I got my passport back quickly. They told me I'd have to have my shots over again, and at that point I was ready to come home. I wasn't about to have yellow fever and all that again. But I cabled and I got from my doctor all the information they needed from the health certificate for me. For a few days I was an illegal alien because I didn't have visas. I had to get a new visa for Tanzania, and I had to get a visa for Ghana, because I was going from there on to Ghana. So that was kind of a very distressing thing. Yet you know, I had a feeling, I said, "This would have happened at home," people were talking about being ripped off, when you think about it, the high crime rate here. What you found was that there was a great deal of petty crime, you know, the haves and havenots kind of thing. And you've got people running around, up and down, in and out of the stores, buying, coming with money that it must have been a great temptation.
CG: Considering the economy there.
MS: That's right. There is great poverty in the sense that...relatively speaking there's great poverty. So that people who were complaining about things like that, well, I tried not to have that feeling. There was a girl across the street from my brother, a white girl who kept having things stolen from her...because you didn't have crimes of violence, people weren't hurt. My brother had lived, what, thirteen years; in thirteen years he'd lived in Tanzania, he'd been robbed fourteen times, because there's very little security. His house was open and it was easy to get in. He had locks on all the doors, it was just like home. But he didn't have any great feeling, he was distressed that his things would be stolen, but you didn't have people hitting other people over the head, you didn't have people being murdered for material things. After the congress was over, I stayed on because it was the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Tanzanian African National Union, TANU. In Swahili, seven, I think I had...did I have on a dress the last time, the Saba dress?
CG: No.
MS: Seven in Swahili is Saba, and the actual date of the formation of TANU was July 7, so it is called Saba Saba, the seventh month and seventh day. So the Saba Saba celebration was just tremendous. It was state-wide with the greatest concentration of activities in Dar es Salaam. I went to see the Guinea dancers, oh, they were...that was the most incredible experience. Because even though you couldn't understand what they were saying, the vitality, exuberance, they were beautiful dancers. And﻿83
MS: (cont.) Nyerere was sitting in front of me. Bill, because he was working for the government, had all kinds of special things, so I had a car and a driver and tickets to all of these things.
CG: Oh great.
MS: We had a big national, oh I don't know what you would call it, it was a party, outdoors, you know, and they had all these tables of food and the drummers. The drummers came from all over Tanzania. And to be in a place and to hear the drums. I said at this point, I was talking to a friend of mine, I said, "At least this is something that has not been bred out of me. Those drums get to you." They really get to you. And the drummers and the dancers, and all this again was exciting, and then they had a big review. Nyerere reviewed the military strength of the country, and for three hours I stood up there watching all the people go by. And I finally said to my friend who was with me, I said, "I don't believe there are this many people, I think they've gone out there and they're changing their uniforms..." and they had two or three jet planes, and they had thousands and thousands of people who were there. And I got a picture of Nyerere; he was right below me and he stood in the reviewing stands, stood the whole time. But that Saba Saba was really something. So I said to Bill, "I'll stay, because next year, it won't be a twentieth anniversary, but they always have the Saba Saba." He said, "Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, but I don't think they expect you to stay until the next Saba Saba, 'cause we had our driver, and the drivers were only assigned to us for the period of the affair." And here we were staying on and on and on, but it was really something. I would like to be there again in July because that's something to be experienced. And from there I went back to Ghana and spent some time with the kids and came home.
And then in '75, when I went again, my brother was here and I went back with him when he left, going back to Africa for his six-month tour of duty in Africa. We left here and went from here to Abidjan. Well, we were hung up in Abidjan because we had to change planes, and we got hung up there because there was a problem with the flights. They'd overbooked them; it was at Christmas time, and there were storms all around the world, and people were getting hung up with late planes and whatnot. I got to Ghana with no suitcase the day before Christmas, two days before Christmas. My suitcase wasn't with me on the plane. Anyway, it was the whole bit, everybody was running around getting my clothes, but by this time, you know, this was my third trip so that I'm family and I'm coming home in a sense. And my suitcase showed up on Christmas eve. It had a big slash on it, they had left it in Abidjan. But Christmas was with Bill's family. In all the two other trips, even though I'd gone to Ghana, he and I had never been in Ghana at the same time. So this was to spend Christmas with his family, and that was really, it was very nice. We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. I had visited the Ambassador Hotel twice before when I had been there. Who did I see? I walked in the door and there was Leon Sullivan standing on the stepsMy first trip to Ghana in '70, and I spent Sunday afternoon at an OIC*meeting. Leon Sullivan was starting an OIC in Lagos, in Nigeria, and one in Accra. I went to hear his speech that Sunday afternoon because the family insisted that I go, but I really didn't want to. The '75 trip, the Christmas trip, was
*
Opportunities Industrialization Centers﻿84
MS: (cont.) nice because I had never been to Ghana at that time of year and
again, what do you expect? You do have Christmas. It's very traditional, they have Christmas trees, they have all the Christmas decorations, and the streets all have street lights, beautiful lights and it's a very gay time. They have, what is it, there's another kind of thing, it's very British. You have Christmas and then the next day is the day you take your gifts around to your friends...
CG: Boxing Day.
MS: Boxing Day, right. I guess Bill and I didn't do very much. We were going to go to Togo, but we never got there. We just sort of went to parties, and I had roast goat for the first time.
CG: What did that taste like?
MS: I don't know, I don't remember now. All I remember is that I was eating exotic food. I tried to eat, at least taste, some of the things that were there. Although my sister-in-law was very concerned about my stomach, she wasn't about to have me end up being sick, so she would drag out of her freezer. You know, I'd get roast lamb and sometimes we'd have mashed potatoes and peas, like that. The thing that I love is that fried plantain, kili wili; I love that stuff!
CG: I've never tried it.
MS: Oh, I could eat that forever. Oh, I love it, I've been trying to figure out how you make it. I was in Chicago a couple of years ago and there was an international festival which reminds me, I ought to be going to Hynes Auditorium...
CG: I have a Xerox of instructions on how to do plantains...
MS: You do? Because, you know, the International Institute is having its big ethnic festival at Hynes Auditorium this weekend. I guess today's the last day. I had planned to go, because it was really great to go in Chicago, and to visit the West African booth. They had had some of this [plantain] and I asked for it, and the woman asked me, "How do you know about this?" So then we had a great conversation. Again, you get this kind of thing, and I found out in talking with this woman—she was Ghanaian—and she had gone to grammar school with Efua, and I said, "What a small world."
I spent three weeks in Ghana, and left Ghana and went with my brother to visit his daughter in Dakar. He was a delegate, an unofficial delegate, to the International Jurists' Conference on Human Rights being held in Senegal. That was the first time I'd ever been to French West Africa. Very'different. I guess we were there for three or four days. His oldest daughter was in school at the University of Dakar, taking her year of French, and she had not been able to come home for Christmas, so it was a chance to see her, too. Being in Dakar was interesting and Harry Elam, you know Judge Elam's sister Harriet was a special assistant to the consul in Dakar, so she had us for dinner, a beautiful apartment that she had, on the night that I was to leave. We stayed in, again,﻿85
MS: (cont.) Bahari Beach was beautiful and elegant and touristy, and in Dakar, the Hotel Teranga, which is the big one—I think it runs you something like seventy dollars a day, American dollars. You know, by this time at the end of my trip I couldn't afford it and I don't think I would have spent it anyway, so we stayed at a place that the girl in school found in old Dakar which was called the Hotel Jama for fifteen dollars a night. So it's possible, in traveling, to find places that give you a sense of where you are, rather than... What the hell, who needs to travel and go stay in Hiltons, you might just as well stay home; you know the Hilton, the Holiday Inn, that type of place you don't need to go to. In Dar es Salaam, the Kilimanjaro is a beautiful hotel, very modern, very fancy, but if you were going to go to Dar es Salaam, to stay at the Kilimanjaro doesn't make that much sense. It's better to go out to Bahari Beach, which has a kind of Tanzanian flavor to it.
CG: Plus the beach.
MS: Well, the beaches in East Africa are beautiful, but West Africa has very little in the way of... In Accra I didn't see many beaches. We went swimming in a swimming pool, but not at the beach. The Atlantic Ocean is very rough, the Indian Ocean is so different, you know, it's warm, it's like the Caribbean, it's lovely, beautiful. But that was Senegal; I spent a day and a half in Nairobi with friends of my brother. That was nice, but I didn't get a chance to see much of it. At one point I think we went downtown in Nairobi, and I felt as I was driving down this main street with an island in the center. I looked out the window, and I said, "This is Seventh Avenue and 125th Street," it's exactly what it looked like. Nairobi is very Western, very Western, it's a bustling place.
CG: When did the Freedom House start the travel/study program?
MS: It was '68, I think. It will be ten years next year, '68. The travel/ study program, we wish that they had more trips to Africa, particularly for our black kids; but the setup is to go to Europe and go to the University of Salamanca in Spain and Strasbourg in France, and they've had some side trips to North Africa. Two children we sent, two young people we sent, one to Ghana, but that was under Operation Crossroads, we simply made the connection so he could go into Operation Crossroads, and one we actually sent to Kenya. But they don't have...again, this is again, white people run this show, the American Institute for Foreign Study, and I guess Africa isn't high upon their list of priorities. And we've been trying to get them to do more. Of course the expense, the cost, is more. It cost me $1080 round trip, when was that, the last time I went...
CG: That was just the plane fare?
MS: That's the plane fare. So you know, I couldn't go if I didn't have all the contacts that I have. Because I don't have to worry about food, I don't have to worry about a hotel bill because I stay with family all along, or friends, my brother's got friends all over the world. He passes me along, you know, "My sister's coming, take care of her," and﻿86
MS: (cont.) every place I go, there's a great welcome mat out. So that
makes it possible for me to travel. And then of course, I like going to the West Indies, and I think part of going to the West Indies, which is purely vacation, Barbados particularly, is because in a sense Barbados is as close as you can get to Africa without going there, or any other place in the West Indies. I went to Saint Thomas. Saint Thomas, Barbados, but Barbados... the first time I went to Barbados was in 1971, and then in '72 we took our Goldenaires, I think I told you that, we took 100 Goldenaires to Barbados who had never traveled before, most of them had never been out of the country.
CG: One hundred Goldenaires.
MS: We had 141 people on the trip. We chartered a plane and spent a week in Barbados at the Barbados Hilton. And that's worth staying at, because the Barbados Hilton has been very carefully built to maintain the atmosphere, built around an atrium, it's a tropical hotel. They had a great time, and we had a great time, and we took them again in '73. The second time we took about sixty, and the wife of the then premier of Barbados, who was my bridesmaid and she was my child's godmother, rolled out the red carpet, and had a big reception for the Goldenaires at the official estate. It was really very nice. And when we went the first time, we did it a second time, but the first time we went, we talked about going... Black people, I think I told you this, going from the United States to a black-run island and feeling that you should, even if we were staying at the Barbados Hilton, that if we had money to spend, we should not leave all of our dollars there, and that what we should do is make some kind of a contribution. So there were four money gifts, the first time the Goldenaires gave to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, to the Home for Deaf Children, the YWCA, and I've forgotten the fourth one. And the response to that was so great, nobody has ever come, they said, as a tourist group, that made this kind of a gesture. The second time we went they made a gift to the Programs for the Elderly, making the connection between being old and black in the United States and being old and black in Barbados.
CG: What was your feeling? You have probably been to more black-run
countries than anyone else I know, except possibly Walter Carrington. What was your feeling going in and out of these countries? Did it have any effect on your perspectives at all?
MS: It sure did. That whole feeling of seeing black people in charge, the inner boot that you get out of that is just... And in Tanzania where there are still a few colonialists, they are the ones, you know, when you see a white face, that's a strange face, and to see whites in the minority and to see black people doing every kind of—the black stewardesses on the East African Airlines with their little leopard hats and there's a whole turn around that you do. The closest I've come to that feeling here was the time I went to Atlanta, and knowing that Maynard was the black mayor of Atlanta. I know damn well Atlanta isn't a black city, but the feeling that I had when I got to Atlanta knowing that we kind of run this place, you know, it's a good feeling, it's a good feeling. To see the black heads of state, those people who came to the Pan-African Congress, to be able to talk to Nyerere and I also met—because my﻿87
MS: (cont.) brother, I told you, was involved in the whole business of
southern Africa—I had met the head of Frelimo in Dar es Salaam, this was before Mozambique's independence.
CG: Oh, so this is the one that passed away, I can't think of his name now.
MS: He was killed. I've forgotten his name, Sam somebody. Then I met
Sam Nujama who was head of the Southwest African Peoples Organization, SWAPO; I have a SWAPO pin I wear with great pride. He was at the Sixth Pan-African Congress. The thing is, just standing by my brother and seeing all these people who come from everywhere in Africa, who come up and say, "Hi, Bill, how are you Bill, I haven't seen you for a long time, Bill," all these accents. He's just been there so long that it's a very special experience. And it certainly is one that I realize is totally atypical, and when people talk about "I ain't lost nothing out there," they're not interested in going, I can understand that the thought of going to such a strange place, you think it's strange, and exotic and without having some connections. Tour groups tend to be... Well, Olivia Stokes was taking tour groups around for a while. Did you know her?
CG: My mother knew her, because I was going to call my mother one day and
ask her who Olivia Stokes was, because I knew the name, it was a household name, constantly talked about...
MS: I think Olivia's on our list to be interviewed. Olivia's with the
Mass. Council of Churches, I think she's in New York now, the National Council of Churches in the educational division.
CG: Isn't Olivia her middle name, isn't she...
MS: Olivia Pearl.
CG: Oh, it's Olivia Pearl.
MS: And Olivia was taking tour groups to Africa and I was in the airport in Accra, and I look up and there's Olivia with twelve people going out on the same plane I'm going out on. She was going to Nigeria and she couldn't get visas for her group—this was a time of great tension in Nigeria—so she was going to bypass Nigeria and she said she was going to take them, they were going to go to Uganda; they were going to get off at Entebbe. This was in 1970, I guess, in 1970. [laughter] The plane never stopped in Entebbe; the last I saw of Olivia, she'd been tearing her hair out in Accra because she couldn't get the visa for Nigeria, and she said, "To hell with it, we'll just go to Entebbe," the fog was bad, they couldn't land and the last I saw of her, she was in Nairobi tearing her hair out, trying to figure out how to get all these people back to Entebbe. I was going on to Dar es Salaam. But taking a tour group is no joke, and she had a queer kind of grouping. I think most of the people were white, and there was this Canadian, I'll never forget, he came up and said something to my sister-in-law. I cannot remember what it was, but whatever it was, it was one of those trite things that you ask, it was like "Say something in French," that kind of a remark, trying to make conversation. And Efua, who was about 5' 7", just drew herself up to her full height and just sort of looked down at him. So he got on﻿88
MS: (cont.) the plane, he was trying to pursue with me something about
race relations or something, so I told him I was very tired, I'd been traveling. I said, "I'm going to sleep," and I didn't want anything to do with him.
One thing, let me tell you about, and that is that in '75, when I came back to Ghana, I had, again, a tremendous experience. My sister-in-law is an intellectual and she's a writer. She had taken me to see... She was doing this oral history, this business with children, primarily with children. What she had discovered was that children who were being forced to speak in English, they were totally inarticulate, but if you let them speak in their own language, in Akan, that they were so verbal and so full of life. She was playing these tapes and you could just hear all this...and she was just excited about, with her tape recorder... One morning I was sitting out, and what she was doing, she was taping the bird songs in her backyard as background for these children's pieces that she was doing.
But on Sundays, Efua doesn't leave her house and she runs a kind of French salon; she sits and people come. And there was [a man] who had been the Ghanaian representative to the United Nations; he came by. Wole Soyinka, I don't remember how you pronounce Wole's name, he's the great Nigerian poet. Wole comes in and I said, "I have met you before, haven't I?" And he said, "Yes, you have." We'd just met at the Sixth Pan-African Congress, he was in Tanzania. I think we started sitting around noon time, around the table because we had lunch, and at six o'clock we were still sitting there, and people had been coming and going, and there was this great conversation which was fascinating. If I had a tape recorder... Because there was a young poet from the Institute for African Studies, I guess, at the University of Legon, who was part of a beginning new cult of Nkrumah, he was a contemporary of Nkrumah's, so what the conversation was, was that they weren't putting down Nkrumah, the people who knew him, but they were talking about his faults and don't idealize the man... And these conversations, and Efua would come in every now and then, and they would call her, you know, "Auntie," your title of respect, but "Auntie Efua," then when you got really angry, "Madam." [laughter]
I felt that, again, intellectually stimulating, that somehow it would be nice if we had some kinds of things like this, where black people, you know it wouldn't have to be all black, I was just thinking in terms of Africans, black people would get together, whether it be on a Sunday once a month or what, and just sit down together and share this kind of thought, and bouncing ideas off one another and staying abreast of the issues of the world, rather than just the ones that are closest to you. That was really one of the most exciting things of the whole time I was there. And she has entertained Nikki Giovanni and Maya Angelou, all the people that come through. People make a bee-line to Efua because she really is an extraordinary woman. There's a young black writer named Ayi Kwei Armah who's Ghanaian. He wrote _The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born and he wrote Fragments and he did Why Are We So Blessed, and to read his stuff...then I met him in Dar. He is a prize example of a young African who really got messed up in his head by coming here and going to Harvard and being Westernized. His books reflect all of the conflict﻿89
MS: (cont.) that he feels, whether it's the cynicism about the future of black Africa in a Western world, in the whole complex of first-rate powers, where does Africa come in, his confusion and conflict around his relationships with white women. You ought to read his stuff. The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born is taken from the mammywagons; on the back of the mammywagons they have all these sayings, some of them are fantastically funny. The mammywagons are the trucks, you know, they're like buses.
CG: Oh, I kept thinking they were like taxis.
MS: No, they're buses, and on the back of them they have these sayings and one of them was "the beautyful ones are not yet born," and beautiful is spelled beauty, and "God is our salvation," a whole lot of religious kinds of things. But the mammywagons, and that's why you find people walking, because it's easier to walk. You may wait two or three hours for the bus to come, and when it gets there, you can't get on. So they are walking. No wonder black folks take taxis. Ride all the time, they have walked too much.
CG: Right. 'Cause also the mammywagons are the ones that are owned by the women, but driven by the men.
MS: 1 don't know whether they're owned by the women or not, I don't even know why they call them mammywagons. But they're the buses, you can get taxis, the taxis are not too expensive, you can get a taxi. Efua has a driver and a car, she has her own car, and the children drive now. But again, the whole business of getting parts and getting repairs done is a big, big hassle. Nyerere's classic statement as far as I was concerned, when we were asking what can people like us do to help, and he was saying, "Help me educate my people," and he meant education'in a broad sense, not just education that meant preparing to go to college or anything. But his concern was "What we need are things like something in between the ox drawn plow and the tractor, because the tractor does us no good. First, we don't have people who are trained to run them, secondly when they break down, we have no parts and we can't afford...but we can step up our production." and he's been trying very hard, I know, to get people to do more intensive farming, and to do it on some kind of scientific basis, because they wear out the land, you know. There are some things that can be done. Then I met a very exciting Swedish architect who was trying to design improvements on the mud hut, using the basic design of the mud hut, but adding things like sanitary facilities and you know, not having the smoke.
That business of those smudge pots, people get red eyes, it's a combination of the smudge pot and malaria. And if you notice the whites Of their eyes are very red. Now my nephew has had malaria, his eyes are quite red. Efua's eyes are red, the girls' eyes are not red, they haven't suffered as much from it. But once you get it, you've got it. My brother has it and when he gets overtired... I'd never seen anyone with malaria before, until the Sixth Pan-African Congress in '74, and he called me and said he was coming home from work. I couldn't get the driver to go get him, so finally he got a colleague to bring him home, and when he walked in the house, he said, "Now for once I want you to do what I tell you to do﻿90
MS: (cont.) and don't ask me any questions, because I know exactly what's happening." And he had the shakes, and we had to wrap him up in everything we could find in the house, and he started taking whatever he takes...
CG: Quinine?
MS: Yes, but it's a brand name. And he was taking double doses, but the thing that bothered him was...that was on Monday. By Wednesday the worst of it had subsided, but he had a very high temperature, and he said that he had a lot of free flowing anxiety, almost like he was hallucinating, he was walking the floor at night on Wednesday simply because he hadn't recovered fully. I've never seen anybody...I was scared to death, I couldn't get a doctor, couldn't find his doctor. Those are some of the things that you begin... Telephones that you may take for granted, trying to make a phone call, that is one of the most frustrating experiences in the world. You finally get your connections... Well, I had to call Ghana when my brother was named executor of the family's estate, you know, question mark. He was in Africa, and I would have to call him to try and get him ready to sign things. Do you know, I called him, I'll never forget it, it took me almost two hours to get the connection through, and when I finally got it through to Ghana from here, when I finally got it through, they informed me that the Ghanaian telephone office was closing down for the day, and that I'd have to place the call again the next day. And I said, "Can't we start where we left off?" And they said, "No, you have to start all over again."
CG: So they closed down the office.
MS: If you want to call the United States, first you go down to the telephone office or call them and tell them what time you want to place your 'call. The office is only open two hours out of the day for these calls, and if they are booked for the day, you can't make your phone call. And this friend of ours, who was in Tanzania when we were there, was trying to call his wife in Ghana, because her mother was sick, and she was to come back to the United States, and he was trying to reach her to tell her he was going to stay on for Saba Saba. For three days, we went down to the Hotel Kilimanjaro to try to put these calls through, and he had to put them through at three o'clock, and he couldn't get the calls through.
You know, you get a sense then that communication... My feeling is that there are two things that African nations that I have been to—and I'm sure it holds for the rest of them—have got to lick. They've got to lick the problem of communication and transportation. And that is not to say that we need Western style communication in terms of media, advertising and all that junk. But they do need to have a way in which people can be put in contact with one another because without that, it's going to take much longer. I looked at the newspapers, I suggested to a friend of mine who runs a newspaper that really what he could do if he was interested in Africa is to send some good journalists, hopefully black ones, who can go and who would not dictate the content, but who would develop writing style. You'd be amazed at the newspapers. They're funny, they're really funny. Let me see now, there was one where they﻿91
MS: (cont.) had found, I forget, it was something really minor, it was front page news, and the other thing that hits you is that, I know that in Tanzania, as I read the newspapers, there might be a reference to the United States on the back page, about half an inch, you'd miss it if you didn't look for it. So you got a sense that the United States didn't exist. There's that kind of divorcement from the Western world, other than if you go to somebody's house where they had a television set. In addition to the local controlled government news, you will get something like "Hawaii-Five-0." If they could really figure out how they could get some of our good black programs beamed in, that would be one step towards building better relationships between black Americans and black Africans.
CG: Also some sort of cultural exchange.
MS: Yes. So those are my travels, and I think they have had a real impact on my concern now. I spend a lot of time reading. My eye will go to something that speaks of Africa. I'm particularly interested now in what's happening in South Africa, and my brother, because he's now tied in with the whole southern African piece, I get all the material from the American Friends Service Committee's South Africa Education piece, so that I tend to have a much broader world view. Africa is of particular importance to me, so I would say that that's a major impact. I'm also interested in things here that are related, whether it's Africare—Percy Wilson heads up the local unit of Africare—or whether it's the Afro-American Institute, and now Willard Johnson's got something going. That's called what, TransAfrica?
CG: I don't know what he's doing, I know...
MS: I think it's an effort to raise money among black people in the United States for Africa.
CG: Oh good.
MS: I've got the little flyer on it: and I'm sending a contribution. It's Willard and some other people. I think they're operating out of Washington. In order to have freedom, it's the kind of thing where you need to have the noncontrol of the donors, so that you don't get this kind of dictating. That there can be a lobby for Africa, or for blacks around the world, without having to be dependent on white dollars. I don't know how far it'll go, because we haven't been able to get a Black United Front together too well, or a United Fund going too well here.
I also find, Cheryl, that one of the things that distresses me is that I don't find that many black Americans who have not been to Africa having very much interest, real interest. They tend to still be caught up in the postslavery mentality of "I'd like to be as far removed..." and they think of Africa as the Dark Continent. They think of Africa in the same terms as other people who have seen too many Tarzan movies, they think about animals and they think about...they have no idea of the sophistication, they don't know the great rich history of Africa. They have no sense, and I find that unless we can get it into the schools and unless it becomes part of the learning process, we're going to keep on﻿92
MS: (cont.) with these people who will transmit to their children this
saire attitude, so you're going to have to interrupt that cycle somehow. So I think there's a big, big opportunity for someone with imagination and skill who can begin to develop curriculum that will include African history. Black American history is fine, but black American history... I used to say that I don't have this feeling about the identity piece because I felt strongly that I am an American, therefore, my history begins at the point that I was cut off from my ancestors. That's crazy, because I do have a history which is related to those black ancestors, not to say that I have not been changed culturally. From a cultural point of view I am an American, this I cannot do anything about, 'cause my forebears were brought here against their will and I am now part of this country. But that does not say that I should not have an interest and a concern and an excitement about the place from which those ancestors came.
CG: I know my experience in teaching I would start giving examples, in terms of sociological concepts, using African cultures, using some of the current politics and they would say, "Why don't we know this?" Because it is totally ignored.
MS: It's totally ignored, it is not taught anywhere and you know about the great... Ghana as it was, Zimbabwe, to know about Africans before the European conquest, and I told you about this lovely little book I have about African cities prior to European conquest. African Cities and Towns Before the European Conquest?
CG: Yes, I've heard of that book.
MS: It is a little volume, but so big. And in it you get a sense of the way streets were laid out, also the social implications of the way in which people lived. The most important people lived in the center of the" town and then as you became lesser and lesser in terms of your position in the hierarchy, you were further and further out in this series of concentric... either they were circles... But there was a definite pattern, and I've forgotten who wrote that book, but it's downstairs. So that I suppose if I think about what I would like to do, I think that in the time that I have, I probably won't be able to keep running back and forth to Africa forever, but I would like to sort of use that as an area that I would like to keep on exploring as long as I'm intellectually capable. As long as mentally I'm all right, I really would like to know, and I think that there's so much and that becomes kind of an exciting thing, to have the time to sit down and to do a lot of this reminiscing. And to get involved maybe with other black Americans who are concerned about Africa. I could see that as a very nice...retirement is a nasty word, I'm not think about that. I'm thinking about when you change...
CG: You have more time to do things.
MS: Well, you might or you might not. You're supposed to make time to do then, but there has been that whole impact. You were asking me about how I felt about black-run countries, I have the same thing about the West Indies, seeing the blacks in charge. There is something about that—the Senegalese were just handsome. To see the Senegalese in the Senegalese garb and these very tall, stately, black, black, black people, I mean

MS: (cont.) blue-black, wearing those red robes, standing at attention.
This was when the Sixth Pan-African Congress was over, no, this was the jurists' conference in Dakar. When you saw them there, you really were overwhelmed. I have movies of them, too.
CG: There was a slide show at one point in the IWY conference that was held in West Germany, and the Senegalese women all came, and all the African women and the Asian women brought their husbands along. It was just the Western women that left their husbands home, [laughter] They were beautiful. They have a sense of theater about themselves so that they carry themselves in such a way, it's so complimentary, it's grand.
MS: They are incredibly stunning. My niece was saying to me, you know, she was putting on her cloth, she had two pieces she sort of tied around her waist and that tying , process is so complicated for me. She tied a piece around her waist and then she had the other piece which she tied around the top and she was saying, you know, African women, part of it is you don't have to worry about any figure faults, if they want to call them faults. She says, that's all you do, you wear your cloth and you look stunning, you look stunning.
I think that was one of the things that hit me hardest, I spent a day on Zanzibar, on the island of Zanzibar and Tanganyika. I'm not sure what the relationship is now, but the day I spent on the island of Zanzibar, I've forgotten what the percentage is, but it's very high in Moslems and the women wore those black things, I forget what they call them, it begins with a b, bububaba or something... These women wore these...black cotton sateen was what it looked like. They wore them wrapped around and around their heads and I found it so depressing, I couldn't wait to get back to Dar to see the women in their bright colors, and to see them moving around. There was a kind of repressed feeling, you know, these women, all this black, everybody walking down the street in black.
CG: Like being at one great big funeral.
MS: Right. So what else do we have on here?
CG: Ah. We have...
MS: Awards and honors.
CG: Why don't we save that and why don't we skip down to the Moynihan report because I think...
MS: Well, I haven't read the Moynihan report; which one are you talking about, the black family?
CG: Yes, what was your initial reaction, and then what are your thoughts on the issues, debate and turmoil surrounding this thing called the black family?
MS: Well, you know, I think not having read the Moynihan report, but just
knowing from where he was coming that... When you have worked with people,
and I started working back in 1938 when I had my first job with the Essex
* ,
International Women s Year﻿94
MS: (cont.) County Welfare Board, and meeting people, and in all of my life working with people, being related to black people, that you knew from the outset that there was something wrong when this man keeps talking about black families, the pathology of black families. Because they don't meet the criteria set for white middle class families, and that anything that deviates from that is an aberration, rather than looking at what is it that has made it possible for the black family to survive. How do you study the strengths of black families rather than their weaknesses, or number one, whether what he considers weaknesses are weaknesses at all. I heard Joyce Ladner when she was here last week, and she was talking about the adoption thing... were you there?
CG: No, I wasn't there, but I've read her book and I've heard her lecture before.
MS: She gave a speech, it was a dinner thing in Hubie Jones's visiting
lecture series, and she was talking about the business of transracial adoption. And she also was talking about the black family. The other thing was that I always felt...again, I haven't done enough research on the black family, you know, I knew about E. Franklin Frazier and the Black Bourgeoisie? Then there's this whole business of part of the adaptation of black people to white American culture, black men marrying women who were fairer than themselves to lighten up the race, recognizing that though people laugh at that, there was a very pragmatic reason for it. Light skinned black folks got along better in this society than dark skinned black folks, then what is to say that this is not an acculturation process that looks towards survival? I think to put it solely on the basis...it got into being conscious color prejudice, I think. But certainly from an unconscious kind of thing, I don't think they deliberately married one, but that was part of the thought processes. I mean I've never, you know, never read that scientifically or whatnot, but it would seem to me to make some sense. And then this business of
"k k
whether or not, I think we were talking about the book called All Our Kin...
That the whole business of... Again, the ways in which black people survive who were at the lowest end of the economic spectrum. Being able to survive simply because there was a sharing, there's extension, there's expansion, all the kinds of things that made it possible and at the same time confused and upset the system, 'cause the system is not set up to deal with them. So what then comes to mind is, how do we manage to establish some kind of compromise? I think there has to be some compromise, if we're going to stay in this society, we're going to have to deal with its realities, but at the same time, do you surrender everything that has made it possible to make it this far. What's the price?
Incidentally, Ebony has got an article on the price people pay for making it, which has to do with sublimation of blackness, and I've had this kind of thing too, even with Gail. Her going to Saint Mary's in the Mountains, and if she reflects on her experience there of being the only black youngster in the school, that if she had not made any kind of noise about

MS: (cont.) race relations, racial problems and whatnot, there would have been absolutely no reason why she could not have sailed through that experience being whiter than she was. She said that the price you had to pay to... They kept telling her, why are you beating this horse, don't we treat you well?" As if this is all she should ask. "Why are you writing these papers about racial problems?" She said, "Because I'm interested in it and because I'm concerned about them." The question was, "Why do you do this, why are you stirring this up? Because it doesn't need to be done here. We are all treating you well." One black child out of eighty-four kids, all-white faculty, well of course, you know, how do you find your way in this. So I think that her ability to understand what was happening to her, even as she reflects on it, is important. So I think the price you pay, and I think that black people have to take a good look at this, I think they have to continue to take a good look at it. I think, I just think we have a long way to go in understanding ourselves and whether we have to adopt some other things, and when we start talking about the realities, the reason we're doing... SSATs are a reality of life and if you want to move in a certain direction, you're going to have to deal with that reality.
CG: One of the mountains in the terrain, so to speak.
MS. Yes. But does that mean that then you have to give up identity as a
black person? I think that's probably the major problem for us. Because I think that after the sixties when you got into black power and black identity, I'm not sure where we are with that now. Now we may be in a lull period, a period of transition, I just hope we're not slipping backwards, [laughter] That's my concern, are we going to get so caught up in making money, and whatever else it is that we're bombarded with daily on the tube. Is that going to be where we end up with our goals. I'm not sure at all about the black on black crime thing that we have to deal with, black unemployment, now I think the black male, the black female is another very important piece that black people are going to have to deal with. I'm thinking now of middle class black men who are taking on all the trappings of the white Anglo-Saxon male, I mean he begins to expect the same kind of support system, and to expect it from black women is insane. But there are black women who come from that same social class, it seems to me, who have exactly the same kind of effect, that their expectations of what they're supposed to do are the same as they are for the women, but the women are moving, the white women are moving away from this sort of thing, the black woman ought to start taking a look at. If the white women are running from this, then we ought to be taking a look at it too, as females.
CG: As somebody said, to be careful not to move into Miss Anne's seat.
MS: Yes, that was Linda La Rue who said that. But I don't have any real depth of information or...I have concern about the black family primarily in terms of how we define black family. You know, the nuclear family and all of that, all that jazz for us, or are we talking about something else when we talk about family? Because I'd like to think about what's happening now as people are beginning to get together. I was talking to Reiter last night about...the cousins are getting together, that whole group that comes out of our family, that they're really doing that cousin﻿96
MS: (cont.) thing when they get 300 of them together. That kind of mutual support and strength and sense of family to me, personally, is so much more exciting than to think about me and mine with one and a half children, whatever it is, you know?
CG: Yes.
MS: Let me get a cigarette. Can we quickly, could we run over that, what
organizations are most important to racial progress? We've been talking about black family, and we talked a little bit about the black church. I don't think there's any way to deny that the black church is the powerful source of leadership, whether it's Martin Luther King or Andy Young or whoever, that out of the black church has come a great deal of the leadership, so that even though I don't think it occupies the spot that it once did, I don't think you can ignore the black church. Then, just generally the NAACP and the Urban League, as your national organizations. Then there was a time when, I suppose, the new ones that cropped up, whether it was SCLC or SNCC, I think when you talk about racial progress you have to talk about it on so many different levels. So you've got to tAlk about the young people and the kind of thing that came out of the SCLC, you know, certainly you're going to talk about it in terms of a kind of overleap, the sixties. Those are the ones that would come to mind, plus the NAACP's constant digging away at the legal defense and the legal aspects. The Urban League, as of now, probably carries the most weight in terms of its relationship with the white power structure, with the establishment. I guess the league has always done that in the days of Eugene Kinckle Jones and Lester Granger, that they did establish contacts and bonds and linkages which have enabled them to make use of funds from the white community to help the black, and that's very sound.
CG: I wanted to explore,	you know, you talked about your being an Urban
League fellow during	World War II, and talking to Lester Granger about
you wanting to go to	Atlanta, and he told you there wasn't anything in Atlanta...
MS: That I wouldn't find in Harlem.
CG: Right. But I wanted to ask you, since you knew Lester Granger, what do you think in terms of his personal style and what you know about him, his effects were? How important was the program, say, the program that you were a part of?
MS: The fellowship program... Well again, it was a matter of the Urban League collecting the funds that made it possible to send black people to schools of social work. Right? And it was a way, too, of developing the kind of people who could come into the league, you know, it's been done all the time, it's a way you do... We had social work, so we developed more social workers; you got the business community and the white community, they were developing bankers and whatnot. So I think it's a new day, we ought to be developing some more of these other kinds of people. But at that particular period, I think the idea of having trained social workers and people who could come into leadership positions in the league was very important. I think that it's very hard, you have to do it within, and I keep saying this to younger people, that you have﻿97
MS: (cont.) to look at people and their impact in terms of the time and place in which they are functioning. So that if you don't have the same tools with which to work, you have to do the best with what you got.
And I would say that Lester's leadership... First, there was Lester's personality, in a sense a lot of the league was tied, I think to the personalities of Lester Granger and Eugene Kinckle Jones, charming men with a vision and with a commitment, and that they parlayed that into support for an organization that was going to help black people. Nothing wrong with that, I think it's important. I think if you try to gauge Lester's impact now, the people who were there when he was there, Julius Thomas who was an extraordinary person. Julius Thomas was in charge of the employment division of the National Urban League, and Julius Thomas was as suave and as cultured and as refined as anybody you'd want to see. He dealt with big business. When he got to Brooklyn and was dealing with the labor unions, you know, he could get down, he was a real rabble rouser. He had this facility, he was good. It was part of our acting maybe, you know, put on a show. You had Ann Tanneyhill, forty years in the league. Ann Tanneyhill developing that beautiful vocational guidance program long before...now everybody's talking about vocational and occupational education, Ann Tanneyhill, Julius Thomas, Lester Granger, all these people were so far ahead, really, in their thinking, but they could not move because the time wasn't right. So they moved as far as they could, and then I think that Whitney's stewardship of the league took it another step that was more in the tradition of Lester Granger. I think maybe it was a little more flair than Lester ever had, but Whitney had such a style in talking, and also he used that old home boy stuff, you know, Lester was not out of the South.
Lester's from the West Indies, I think. Did you know there were six sons in that Granger family? Six sons. Lester went to Dartmouth. Of those six sons, let's see, Lloyd was a dentist; Lester was always going to write his book and I don't think he ever did before he died. He came out of the generation when you didn't have this kind of background, too many blacks who had this kind of a record, of achievement, and how did this family, you talk about the black family, how did his parents manage to educate six sons? And I mean really at many higher education levels that many whites did not attain. How did they do it? And they all turned out to be extremely successful people in more than just an economic sense; they were successful human beings.
I think that Whitney's impact, as I say, was great because he carried that business into the White House, and now Vernon's an entirely different style. First nonsocial worker who's ever headed the league, and I think that in this time and in this place a Vernon Jordan is very important. So that, I think that anytime that you ask about these kinds of things, you have to think about the continuum, where they came on the continuum.
You know, I think that Freedom House is interesting because it's local, and because we've been there for almost thirty years, but you can then see the continuum, what did you do back in 1949-50, and then how did you manage, or did you manage to stay on target with what was going on, thinking about things in the larger sense. That's what the twenty-fifth anniversary﻿98
MS: (cont.) booklet that you have tried to do... What's the national
scene, what is the local scene and then where do you fit in? And I think that's still valid, a valid way to look at things.
White organizations. Well, you know, you are able to work with white groups in different ways, I think that during the sixties you weren't working with so much as you were in a confrontation kind of situation, because I think that's very important. I have tended to belong to interracial organizations and intergroup organizations at one time or another, and I have seen the swing from people who were the liberals, now the split that you have now around the Bakke case, which is interesting because the traditional bond between Jews and blacks... We were talking about this last Sunday, though. I think you have to look at this very critically, like the Jewish liberal groups. I think they're having trouble now; it isn't solely around the question of being threatened because of the use of the word "quota" and the great emotional tie to that word and their worry about it. But it is tied to leadership and power, that as long as black people are riding on the coattails of Jews in their fight for civil rights, that it was much easier, much easier, to maintain relationships. But the minute black people were saying, now just a minute, you've spoken for us long enough, we're perfectly capable of speaking for ourselves, that you began to get some of this split off. I think it's come to a head under the Bakke case because now you're threatening something else, not only are you threatening leadership, but you're threatening what they consider one of the hardest earned fights they've ever fought, which was to open it up. And I think that then you start getting people fighting each other for this kind of thing. But it says something about where the commitment was in the first place. That they cannot understand, I mean intelligent people, who cannot understand what black people are saying when they talk about why the Bakke case is going to have such long range implications and ramifications, and insist that quotas are going to do damage...I get a little concerned.
Who was it? I guess it was Ken Clark who talked about in the sixties how he began to feel awfully guilty about having white friends, that there was that kind of...and not only feeling guilty, but having suspicions about them. I think that there's been a change. I've worked with this white community ever since I've been in Boston, I grew up in a white community, I went to white schools, so that my whole background is relationships with white people. Which means then that somewhere along the line I established relationships which had to transcend race, that they were relationships with individuals, so that I do have people that I considered very good friends. I think that the kind of things you can argue with, the kind of things you sit down and have open discussion about race without tiptoeing around the tulips, you know, walking on eggs all the time , and playing footsy, so that you never feel that the issues... There are people like that. But I also have found that over this whole long period that I have become, I think more sophisticated in my ability to analyze what I hear. I think this is one of the things that the young blacks in the sixties did, they cut through all that verbiage, [laughter] They began to say, now I don't need to hear what you're saying; you listen to me for a change.﻿98
CG: Right.
MS: And that business of always being—because it was a kind of an
accommodation of people of my generation—you were always polite because that was what was expected of you. And you wanted to be considered... Well, the way we put it, the extent to which black people, and this is still true, are able to provide a reflection of what white people think we ought to be like, which is like them, then we are acceptable, all right? It's very easy, and I think that the big overleap that white people have made, is that they have managed now to cut out a little bit of the color. They don't care if you're quite the same color anymore. That was also part of it, the fairer you were, you know, the more white you were in your actions, your thinking, your looks, your hair texture. James Baldwin said, "Why say that my kinky hair is not beautiful, and who says that Bach is better than jazz?" These are some of the things that I think black people have to then start thinking about, if they're then going to act on a peer level. The other one is an accommodation kind of thing, and I think that's one of the things that came out. I think that really was one of the big pluses out of the sixties, that you started talking about, you made race important, now don't tell me now that it's not important and that I shouldn't be thinking racially. You made it, we didn't do it, you did it. I think that black people really intended to be part of the American scene, and they weren't permitted, and then to take the posture that since you did not permit us, now we have to go our own way and define ourselves and our goals in our own terms. It's probably the healthiest thing that ever happened to black people in this country.
And I think that also is related worldwide to the movement of black nations toward independence in Africa. I think there's a very impprtant tie-in between the two. That those who don't want to see it will not see, but it's there. Who was it that said, you know in the sixties, that all of black Africa will be free while we're trying to get a damn cup of coffee at a counter in the South. You know, that whole business of the stepping up, the acceleration of the movement. At the same time I think we have to look again at what kinds of people are emerging in Africa, that the power plays, the Amins, this kind of thing. I mean there are a lot of things that we have to be looking at critically. But there's no question that this movement and what's happening in South Africa now, I think, is really headed for...that article on whites in South Africa. My brother says that Swaziland is probaby one of the most beautiful spots in the whole world, it is the playground for the white South Africans. It's like going to the French Riviera and he said that the countryside, it's incredibly beautiful and they've reserved it for themselves. But he went there. I don't know whether he's ever been inside, I don't think he's been, he hasn't been to Johannesburg. Again, because of his connections. When we were talking with Miriam Makeba years ago at the Latin quarter, wherever it was we went to hear her, and Bill knew her, and she came over to the table and she sat. It was exciting to sit there and listen to this woman talk about how she'd got out of South Africa.
But that whole business of the relations between whites and blacks, whether it's in South Africa, or whether it's with what's left of the﻿99
MS: (cont.) colonials, whether it's with the French in Senegal because there their influence is still there, they run the restaurants, you talk in, you see... Wherever we are, and certainly blacks and whites in the United States, is still a big unfinished piece of business.
And again, I think that worldwide black...worldwide, you know it just occurred to me, worldwide, black people have got to overcome the influence of whites, whether it's French culture in French West Africa, whether it is British culture, the whole artificial dividing up of the continent of Africa and making this imprint on people. So that now when they're fighting each other, they don't speak the same language, they don't have the same cultural background. The elite who are trained, who go to France, are very different from those who go to England, you know, whatever .
This is a long, long fight and then black Americans have got to find out what white Americans have done to them. But I do think, I think somebody said we had to do it for ourselves, which is true. But I think if you're—and this is a difference—here we're a numerical minority, as opposed to blacks who are numerically in the majority in Africa. That if you are a numerical minority, I do think that there is a need not to kill off your allies, and that does not mean that you let them lead you by the nose or anything. But I do think that if there are assets in relationships with the white community that can be parlayed for the benefit of the black community, then what's wrong with taking advantage of that, or even cultivating it, because economically, again, it's a matter of realities. We are not economically able to go it ourselves, sr that until we get to the point where we've got more jobs and we've got more money coming into the black community, we've got more sophistication about helping one another, that until that time, we'd better just think that... We've got to work on the education, we don't want school systems, when we try to run them, we can't run them because we don't have the money. So we've got a long way to go, but I think when you talk about the relationship with the white groups the way we have been able to work with white groups is that we have been able to develop.
We've had an interracial board at Freedom House all these years, which is... I don't talk, I don't talk in terms of being, I'm an integrationist, you know. I don't see that, that isn't why really I'm talking about an interracial board at Freedom House, it's because I'm not an integrationist anymore. I'm not talking about that anymore. I'm talking about options, I think that's what I'm really talking about. I think that black people have got to have the options to move where they want to and how they want to, and until such time as separation is voluntary, if that's what you want, see I think self-segregation is not a problem with me. If you have the option for a desegregated or an integrated kind of life, I think it should be your choice. And now you get upset when people start talking about why do black students draw apart. I think black students need the strength that comes from that kind of exchange among themselves, and I think the women have finally made a women's caucus, you got to have a black caucus, you can't deal with somebody else until you get yourself together.
This is a big turn around for me, because I at one point would have said, I don't see why, for example, should we have black girl scout troops in﻿100
MS: (cont.) Roxbury. I had a fight with a friend of mine, but I thought that was not the way to break down discrimination in scouting. I thought they should just go and make their way, force their way into the white troops. So this was against our position, which was probably what, in the fifties. Our position, and this was a personal one that we had, that there should not be a black troop. This woman went ahead and organized a black troop, and that made it possible for the kids in that troop to have a scouting experience which then enable them to move very comfortably into scouting at another level. Because, number one, they knew the ropes, they'd been through the whole process, they hadn't had to deal with discrimination and all the little irritants of being the only black or a few blacks in a white group. They had been able to be scouts. Period. And because they were scouts, period, they moved into leadership position, so I did a turn around on that, I said, there is something to black people having... I just think if they stay there and don't move, because they find it comfortable and easy, and do not accept the challenge of then fighting it out out there, you know, then I have some trouble with that.
CG: That's happened in some professional caucuses and professional associations, by putting on alternate programs, sometimes you lose your chance to move ahead, for power and allies...
MS: That's right. If you're talking about black child development, for
example, are you talking about black children growing up in isolation, or are you talking about black children who are able to handle themselves and the world in which they live. Now you can say, if you're going to stay in Roxbury all your life and never go anywhere else, then you can do pretty much as you damn please. I have real feelings about black English, I don't see that there's anything wrong with black English, but I do recognize that if you're going to communicate, then you've got to have English as a second language, because black English is not standard English. You've got to be able to speak both without putting down black English, and that's where I part from some of my friends who insist, who are teachers for example, there ain't no such thing as black English.
CG: Oh, it's there. It needs very special punctuation, and writing it down is very difficult because there is meaning in the way those words are grouped together and you cannot translate it that easily...
MS: Somebody did it. I think the telephone company did it, or somebody did it. That whole business of, you know, 'that's the way it be sometime," but that whole business of tense, and even black educated people, whether they admit it or not, tend to think of that black idiom when they get mad or when they get excited. I have maintained that there is no way of saying this any stronger, that says it with more meaning than, "I ain't going to do nothing," you say that, that has the... "I don't intend to do anything," has none of that in it.
CG: Right.
MS: It's just that "I ain't going to do nothing," says a whole lot. And that the teachers who are the best ones, particularly black, it seems to me,﻿101
MS: (cont.) should be the ones who are able to relate to black youngsters. And I think that where you get black teachers who are also middle class oriented, and who have really taken on all the trappings, they're as bad, and I really think they're worse. They're worse, I think, because there's less excuse for them. For the whites that don't know any better, I'll say, "Now they're white and that's their attitude, and they haven't had the black experience." But for black people to deny the black experience and then try to bring kids:, into that white orbit is, to me, something that should be watched very closely. But then where do we train these black teachers? Where do we train them? They are going to go through the white schools and they come out, unless they're strong people, they come out with very distorted perceptions of what it is they're supposed to be about.
CG: Unless there's something there that, you know, in your life that has strengthened you against what you're going to be hit with. The way your daughter resisted at Saint Mary's, you know, unless they are taught to resist some of these encroachments on themselves.
MS: I know that METCO'"* had been concerned about this because of what happens to kids when they go into white communities to school.
CG: I had that experience, it was pretty awful. I had my church...
MS: What are the support systems, and we were talking about this in the Freedom House Coalition. What kind of support systems, in addition say, to the church, should we be establishing in the black community that provide this. And I think that one needs to be practical; you don't expect this from the schools. This is not what the school...if the schools would simply teach our children to read and to write and to count, and mental discipline, and whatever you need in order to 'survive in this society, and don't damage them psychologically, I think that's all we should ask of the schools. The rest of it, I think, part of that not damaging them psychologically does mean that you've got to incorporate into the school curriculum some sense of black history and black contributions and black identity and all of that. That needs to be part of teaching. But in the deeper things, at deeper levels, I don't think that you can expect the schools to do, not as long as they're white-run.
CG: No, they will not. You're talking in a sense about the spiritual level, it's not just the psychological, it's the spiritual.
MS: You wanted to talk about your...
CG: Well, one of the questions, how have you been able to work with whites, how do you feel about it, leads into a question of basically how have things changed? In a way you've talked about that, how things have changed since you first started out...
MS: Well, in a way, you go through cycles where you have, just say the support, the monetary support from the white community, the kind of things that they support, ard you can get some patterns if you look at the kinds of things supported at any given time. Like throwing money during
* . .
Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunities﻿102
a
MS: (cont.) 0E0 at all the strip agencies on Blue Hill Avenue. Very
different from again, the selective giving. Then when that got hot, how they pull that money out. So the United Way pulled out money because other people were complaining about United Way dollars going into organizations like those around Blue Hill Avenue, and the bottom falling out of 0E0. I think you can see some trends.
What the Carter administration is going to do is still unclear, but whether dollars are going to go into the urban centers concentrated in any amounts to make a difference, how is that money going to be handled? Are you going to get a structure where it all goes for administration and all the administrators are white, and somehow or other by the time it gets down to the people it's supposed to serve, that it's been so filtered down, both the program and the funds are filtered down and weakened, watered down, so that they get minimum benefit from these programs? I think that's one of the reasons why it's important to have black people in positions of power and decision making, whether it is a Pat Harris or whether it's a Bob Weaver. With HUD, you know, HEW is just crazy with Califano sitting up there. There needs to be, I don't know who the regional director of HEW is now, but I think he's black. That's another thing I think we ought to do is to develop some strategies for the different people in these spots, and then as we've said in the coalition, nc,tonly do we need to get them in these spots, but once you've got them there, you've got to make them accountable to you.
CG: Right.
MS: And I think that that is more easily said than done. The only way
people are going to remain accountable to you is if they owe you, #nd they've got to see how they owe you.
CG: Right. They've got to remember.
MS: That's right. Now, John 0'Bryant got into office, and black people did vote for John, there's no question about it, but he couldn't have made it on black votes. But I think that John, because he's the kind of person that he is, will feel that he owes the black community. But it's hard, because you get in these spots and the name of the game is wheel and deal, and the deals that you have to make for political expedience, expedience unless you've got somebody that you can tell, "What I've got to do in order to do this for you..." and that's where they're coming from and not from, "This is what I'd like to do because this is the way the game is played or it's going to be a personal benefit to me."
I don't think these people understand Ed Brooke too well because he really is a master politician. And Ed did some things that people don't even know about. When he gave this speech at his birthday party, he talked about things that I never even knew he was responsible for, that he had initiated. And he said he wanted it on his record, he wasn't running 'cause he was black, on being black, or anything else. He said that he felt that comfortable running on his record. And when he laid that record out before people, I think they could see a lot of things, a lot of
*
Office of Economic Opportunity﻿103
MS: (cont.) positions that he's taken for the benefit of the black people. And he's done it where he's had to stand by himself. Because on the bussing thing, he really went way out on the limb. But part of it was that he had his own person at Freedom House, working with us, moving around in the community so he wasn't given any secondhand information; he was getting it from a person that was assigned to bring in that kind of information. Ed's decisions are always based on a great deal of background knowledge and information. There's no off-the-top-of-his-head and off-the-wall kind of statements. If he makes a statement, he's thought it through. I think that this is the kind of thing that we need to know about.
I think that maybe in desegregation what we may have to understand somewhat, is that if you are going to accept "different strokes for different folks," and if your temperament is such that you're the kind of person who is going to be a confronter, that there's no way on earth for any one person or any one group to be the accuser and the mediator and the judge. So it's a division of responsibility, but there has to be communication. So that when I worked, I think I mentioned it, when I worked in Cambridge as the executive of the Civic Unity Committee, my real strength as the executive of the Civic Unity Committee in moving those people who were very much removed from the problems that we were dealing with, was to have a private group, not a government group, but a private group, out there making the noise. But that group was headed by a black woman, and between us, we used to plan things so that I knew that when Jane made this move, it was then going to be possible for me to say, "We've got to do something about this, because people out there are making noise."
CG: What was the connection with Jane?
MS: I was with the Civic Unity Committee, Jane was with the Cambridge Community Relations Committee. Jane Sadler, she's dead now, a remarkable woman. And it was possible to do a lot of things because Jane was there. And then I'll tell you who else was there, Odile Sweeney. Do you know Odile? Odile was with the national YWCA; she was head of the Cambridge Community Center. So we had a really little thing going over there in Cambridge.
CG: She probably knew my father because that was around the time that Adelaide Cromwell was living in Cambridge, wasn't it?
MS: But it is the desegregation thing, of course. I think we've rounded a
corner in many ways. Some things are beginning to happen in the schools that have to do with educational objectives and not with bussing and mixing up kids and numbers. The fact of the matter, racism whatever it is, it's not dead when you can get those kids beaten in Charlestown, or when you can have racial incidents, when you don't even hear about what's going on.
CG: 'Cause my reaction to that was...
MS: Yes. Well, it's like the question people ask, would everybody have been so up in arms if they'd been local kids? So it's like wearing a fez in the South during the days of, the hardship days of discrimination. If﻿104
MS: (cont.) you were black and wore a fez, you got a different kind of
treatment than if you were just plain old black American, [laughter]
CG: Right.
MS: You know I could go down as a visiting queen from Egypt or something, that makes a big different, you know. I think that there are changes, I think they're moving. I think John's election is symbolically important, but the question is will it be practically important. That still remains to be seen; he is one out of four. You look at his colleagues on it...but then he would say, but you got rid of Louise and Kerrigan and Pixie. But I don't take as much comfort in that because I think that the Louises and the Kerrigans simply wore themselves out. There's no need for them anymore, because there are people just like them coming behind. When they stop being vocal and leading the fight, when they themselves saw that there was no political future in it, except for Kerrigan, and were one-issue people, their communities, constituencies denied them. Because they can find somebody else to do what they were doing. And I think that that is probably one of the things that is most disturbing. What will happen with the Boston Plan, I don't know. It sounds good on paper.
CG: This was the Galvin plan that just got defeated.
MS: The Galvin bill got defeated, that was for district representation. The Boston Plan is the one that is intended to bring federal dollars into the city for the revitalization of, specifically, poor neighborhoods, poor areas. Columbia Point, and the Harbor campus, the Harbor development, it's not just the U Mass., but it's that whole peninsula development over there, the Bayside Mall and the public housing and all the other kinds of improvements, they're trying to claim for that. I was at a meeting of the President's Council, I'm on the U. Mass. President's Council, which is an advisory group; whether it'll still last after Bob Wood goes out, I don't know. There was a meeting the other day, and it dealt with the planning now for the peninsula and its broader ramifications, now that the Kennedy Center is going to be built there. And my question, and this again has to do with what kind of a role you play as a black person in this group, I'm the only black one there. They make a big presentation, and then I ask a question. My question is this: That I was a member, as a former member of the board of trustees ofU. Mass., I was also a lightning rod in the meetings that we held where people came, the Dorchester community, black and white. There was a commitment made by the university that people who lived in Columbia Point and the surrounding Dorchester area were not really going to be driven out by the university. Now that you've gotten a broader group which includes more than the university, you've got the Kennedy Center board, you've got the private sector people involved in the development of the Bayside Mall, and the [Boston] Housing Authority, who is going to make that commitment stand? The university was the first one in there. Who is going to make them honor that commitment? And I really got a let of runaround in the answer. I never got a real straight answer. But that was the question that I was concerned about.
And I said, "If those families stay, and they upgrade Columbia Point, as they've apparently already started to do, will there be, in the planning,﻿105
MS: (cont.) provision made for more low income families to return to
Columbia Foint, maybe those who might have wanted to stay there and got run out because of the conditions?" Because if they don't make these provisions, they talk about mixed income housing, and there's no provision, and these are going to be the only low income families there, then I think that there's something wrong with this, it will be what they feared all the time.
CG: [It will be a] pocket of poor people who are still just as isolated.
MS: Well, they won't be isolated...I think they can incorporate them into the community. My point is, there won't be any more, so you'll be limiting the numbers of people who are going to be able to enjoy this brand new community that is cropping up there.
When there were originally 1500 families out there, you know... Well, they weren't all black in the beginning, there were a number of...but anyway, that's one of my concerns. Now the Civic Education Project. I didn't mention anything about the Civic Education Foundation of the Lincoln Filene Center. I'm also a trustee of that. And they met the other day, and we were talking about citizen participation. And we were talking about developing a national conference on citizen participation, and they listed the groups with which they were going to cosponsor this, and I said, "Listen, if you're going to talk about citizen participation at the national level, I went to Houston to one of these affairs on citizen participation in education, and the only thing I got out of it was a trip to Houston. There was very little of substance, and I also thought they were manipulative, they brought people there and they came up with some program that they had already worked out apparently. Which really didn't involve citizen participation in my understanding of it. So what provision are you making in this conference for the participation of blacks and women and other minorities?" You know, whatever this conference is supposed to do, citizen participation in what? The process of participation, then these are the people who have the most need for being involved in something like this, so I suggested that they should approach the National Urban League, as one of their cosponsors if they're really serious. Now I would think that they might want to approach maybe NOW or National Council of Negro Women, whatever, national organizations that would come into this with a different perspective and a different viewpoint that they don't have and that they need.
But my role now has become to ask the questions. I used to sit quietly and I didn't say anything. I would kind of go home and mull over what was said; later I might write a letter. Now it's come to the point where I'm impatient and I'm tired, and I've had it up to the eyeballs with some of this kind of dillydallying around, sidestepping issues. That I tend now to try to ask the questions, make some other people in the room think. So when we talked about the things that I belonged to, I wasn't really quite sure I mentioned that.
There's a Civic Education Foundation which is part of the Lincoln Filene Center, and that's the one that has its own separate board of trustees. That's the one that I'm on. That's the one with the...I was thinking about the things that I belonged to; I don't think I mentioned that. And then﻿106
MS: (cont.) I went down the whole list and said, "Oh, I've got a whole lot of things that I didn't..." but I'm going to give you the file which I didn't get to you, and you can add your own on the tape if you want to. Are we going to be done now, or are we going to do any more? In terms of the design, as the questionnaire?
CG: We've finished all of the general areas. Oh no, there's one other thing left. What are your hobbies? Do you have any hobbies?
MS: I don't really have time for hobbies. I have one major one and I try to make time for that, and that is I do...you know I'm a shutterbug. And movies and...I'vegot acamera around; I do enjoy that.
CG: Do you go swimming?
MS: No, I don't swim that well. I like going to the beach, lying in the sun, unhinging my mind. I do that as often as I can.
CG: We can go to the beach, eight or nine o'clock	in the morning and...
MS: Stay all day.
CG: I used to work all night at the hospital, and	I'd get in my car at
6:30 in the morning, pick up my friend, and	I'd say, "You realize you've
got to stay here until I've got all the sleep	I need from working at
night," and they'd realize that they're stuck	on the beach for eight or nine hours, [laughter]
MS: CG:
That I find really very rewarding.
But you had mentioned before that you were a Cancer and you liked the
r 4- rt -v
water.
MS: Yes, I do. So that I like going to the beach and trying to detach myself from all those things that are problem-type things, and of course being able to travel at the drop of a hat is also something else that is important to me. To get away and get some new kinds of perspectives. I like going to new places, I think that when you get to the point where change becomes very difficult, then you know, the hardening of the arteries is setting in. So I still like to expose myself to new kinds of things and challenge kinds of things. When I go to cities, I tend to walk around the city. Shopping is probably my greatest therapy. I'm a bargain hunter and like yesterday I spent all day. I left at 11:30 in the morning and I came back at four o'clock in the afternoon and hadn't really bought that much, but I'd been tramping around downtown. I don't know, it's just something about getting out of the house, getting away from the phone, and I like pretty clothes, I like to look at them. So i think part of it's the therapy, sometimes I buy them, but a bargain is a big thing with me. If I can get something that costs thirty-four dollars for nineteen dollars, I feel as if I've accomplished something. Not that it was worth more than nineteen dollars in the first place, but it's just that idea of paying full price. I'd like to spend more time with my granddaughter, she's fun, but I don't. I really don't have the time to do what...I should call Gail, too. She probably wants me to sit﻿107
MS: (cont.) with her today because she has to study for an exam. I used to read a lot, and then I found myself reading only job-connected things. I read mystery stories, I love science fiction and I will read science fiction. This is my escape mechanism. Anything that will give me a chance to move away from the problem areas that I have to deal with.
CG: Something else just occurred to me. You've been out here,	officially
in the community, thirty years with Freedom House. You've seen a lot of
other people working on these problems. How much wear and	tear is it on
you, and the people you've seen working, how much wear and	tear is it on you physically and mentally?
MS: Oh, I think it depends on the individual. I find, I think that there's a stimulation in it that keeps me alive and keeps me moving. I have a feeling it also keeps me young in outlook. Even just being able to talk to younger people, and being able to hear what they say in a listening way, and not toss them out because they're twenty years younger than you are, you know. Older is not necessarily better, in not having that attitude. But I think that there are people who are more worn down by this. I think it depends, I don't know, unless you have some escape hatches. See, I have my own escape hatches, I can turn Freedom House off completely. For twenty-four hours I could go and not think about Freedom House at all. When I go away to a conference, I am aware there are things going on at Freedom House, but I'm not like my husband who calls back every day. I am able to make that kind of a detachment. When I go on vacation, I feel it's a vacation, and that means that I'm not going to be calling, I'm not going to be worried about what's going on. Unless there's an emergency.
CG: This is another unique thing. You and your husband have a dual career...
MS: Well, there's something to that that has to do with wear and tear. I
think that maybe I'm able to do it better than he is, but his personality is such that he's a worrier, he's a chronic worrier, unless he's worried he's not happy. That kind of thing is difficult to deal with, [laughter] Isn't that true? Unless he's worrying about some problem, he sits there five o'clock on Friday afternoon and rehearses all the problems of the week. And I say, "I don't want to hear that," but there's something about having this relationship which is important in terms of your sanity. One of the things that's very difficult to work like this, is that there's so much of a confidential nature. There's so many things that you would like to talk about with somebody, but trust is difficult. You have to be careful it's not going to come back to haunt you. So that in the relationship where the two of us were together, there was this kind of opportunity to tell the things that worry you most, and to talk about some of the things that you couldn't possibly talk with anybody else. And to have that kind of an outlet, although I suppose people could do it if they weren't married, if they had a very good working relationship. But there is something about the marriage kind of thing, and certainly early on. It's what, I guess, Rosalynn Carter's talking about all the time, you know, when she says that I'm going to talk to you... Betty Ford, they were always talking about this pillow talk. I'm not really too much into that, but I think what they're really talking about is that there is an intimate relationship between two people of such a nature that it is possible to be yourself and to expose your fears and all the other kinds of things that you may have. I think that﻿108
MS: (cont.) in the early part of the marriage it works very well.
CG: Has there been any kind of division of labor between you and your husband regarding Freedom House?
MS: Yes, I wasn't really that conscious, I don't think, in the beginning.
It was a natural, it was an evolutionary kind of thing, you know, who does what best. So Otto is the business end of it, he's a manager, he loves figures, he liked to do it. I can do it if I put my mind to it, but not having to do it was a relief, and he has also done an extraordinary job of money management, which I'm not at all sure that unless I went to school and... He had it; he has that skill. Then the whole business of raising money and public speaking, he doesn't like to do public speaking, so I got sort of shoved out in front, whether I wanted to be there or not, in terms of being made the p.r. person for Freedom House. And from the p.r. kind of thing, the connections that I made also led into fund raising, so I'm the major fund raiser, and writing which I did, that kind of thing. Otto has tended to have the responsibility for the administrative day to day kinds of tasks. But we didn't sit down and make out a list and say this is...as I have done here at the house.
Ten years ago I put together the domestic harmony chart, which I suggested might be discussed in terms of how do you handle the home situation when you are both working. And I felt, again that in a sense this was avant-garde, in terms of people coming up now with contracts and all of that. But this was something that I felt very strongly about, and I have never been able even to get to first base with it, because Otto has tended to retreat in the fact of the women's movement rather than to get with it, in a sense. He's more threatened by it. I think that because middle-aged men are probably the most threatened, because they have had more years of a pattern that they have come to expect, and when you try to change expectations at this stage in life, you're up against something pretty tough. So we have big arguments about that. That's a real bone of contention with us. He keeps saying to me in a very sarcastic way, "Now that you are so liberated," I get that regularly. It's something brand new. But the domestic harmony chart, and I've talked about contracts, the question about money; these are all things in a marriage that are difficult.
They say that money and sex are the two things in marriage that are most difficult for us to deal with. And I have such strong feelings about having funds of one's own... Because he's an "our" person, and very honestly and sincerely, Otto is very much "our." He tends to think of us as one, which means that I've had to.fight all along to maintain my individuality, because I am very much an individual, and that then becomes something that is difficult for him, and I think it's difficult for anybody, you know. That if you are the giving kind and you want to be "one," why does the other person want to be something else? And I think this is part of being a male/female thing. We sat up a long time last weekend at our best friends' talking about this.
CG: But you talk about it.
MS: Well, it's not that easy to talk about it. I talk about it. He tends not﻿109
MS: (cont.) to want to listen, and I want him to listen...I'm always giving him things to read, and I'm always asking him to listen to television when people come on. I tried to get him to listen to that "Today Show" on workaholics last week, because I thought it very important. This man had finally given up and started to analyze why he was a workaholic, and he's now become a new human being because he has been able to cope. He talks about theory and philosophy, as opposed to what he perceives as reality and that's tough. Because if new things are coming down the pipe, you've got to be open-minded, you can extract from them those things that sound as if they might be pertinent, they might be of some use and some value. You know, it's like throwing everything in the past simply because it's past, or accepting everything that's new because it's new. And we're at an impasse now because he tends to think that everything in the past somehow is good, and he thinks that I accept everything that's new, and you know, I can't convince him that that's not it. But I do think that change is occurring, that there are things that one ought to be looking at, that we are in a process of transition, and out of it is going to come something that is different from what was before, whether it's family life, whether it's relationships with children, whether it's women's positions. I think that all these things are going to, they're going shed down eventually, and they'll go into another one of those plateaus for awhile. I won't be around, but it's going to be.
I don't know if there's anything else really you should know about being involved in the desegregation, other than I think that it sharpens your sensitivity to what the problems are, that you begin to look at things... Again, in looking in a context of what is desegregation about, what is the agony about, and trying to keep your eyes focused on the objective of trying to help children, black children in this town, and in other cities throughout the country. Just to have a chance, that they were not going to have a chance unless there is this kind of equity. There's got to be educational equity and what it takes, there are two kinds of things. It takes something to bring them to the point where they start at the beginning line, unencumbered. Then there are those who are at the point that need to be showed that they don't get tripped up or rabbit punched or something along the way.
So I think this is really what that's all about, whether the next few years will make a really big difference, I don't know. I think it should, I'm optimistic, cautiously optimistic, as I always say. There are days when I have my doubts and am discouraged, and I don't think we're going anywhere. And I think I get most discouraged about the fact that the black community, particularly in Boston, doesn't have the cohesion that it needs. When we can't even get together and decide on one black candidate, because that's the only way you're going to win, and the candidates themselves will not abide by a black convention in this town, then we're in trouble. Because if you're going to talk about power, you're going to have to have political power. Economic power in this town is going to be a long time coming, because it's not that kind of a city where you've got...you don't have a Ford Motor Company, you don't have the big industry. The biggest industries in this town are the universities and nonprofits and the banking and utilities, which traditionally have not taken blacks in. They're taking them in, but it's still way down at the bottom of the list of priorities. I just think that we've got to figure out some other way of achieving power leverage, and﻿110
MS: (cont.) I'm not sure that we're doing it. And then I think that
Boston's probably one of the most difficult places to do it, because those who've been here so long don't recognize the problem. They look for the wrong answers, the right answers, maybe, but the wrong problems. They don't face the problems enough. So you get all this stuff down.
CG: I'll go see Ruth Hill, and I'll probably be calling Mrs. Draper as soon as I get my paper typed and...
MS: All right. Then we'll add this stuff to it.
CG: Right. Because the only thing that's really missing are your awards...
MS: They're all on that sheet.
CG: Okay. That way, one day when you have a little bit of time, a little appendix on your feelings about the different ones.
MS: The only one that I really had feelings about was the one from Radcliffe. I think that when they told me that I was in for the Radcliffe Alumnae Achievement Award, that I was...I remember I thought, "That's very nice." And I didn't think anything more about it until...Otto got a party together for me and made a big deal out of it. That was in '64, I guess, and that was a period when I was really going through a lot of questioning, and I think I was really ungracious about it, because I really think that in my speech—I've got it somewhere—that I wondered whether they had given me the award because I had deserved it, or whether they looked around and said, "Now where's somebody black that graduated from Radcliffe that we can give it to in good conscience?" And I had that question in my mind and I really think that in my acceptance speech I spoke about it. How ungracious I was, but it wasn't a matter of being ungracious, I had to have that kind of suspicion. Because I think that's healthy, because if black people do not take a look at some of the things that happen to them, they tend then to buy what somebody else is saying about them, rather than what's fact. I'm not going to have such an overinflated idea of myself, so that I would automatically think, well, hell, weren't they smart to give that to me. I had to question what it was and why they gave it and then afterwards, when I worked it through, and I became proud of it. The honorary degree I got fromU. Mass. I was very proud of. I like that. Because I had never received an honorary degree from anybody before, and that the University of Massachusetts, with which I had absolutely no connection at all, had selected me along with Walter Reuther, and who else got it at that time? Beatrice Park, Roger Lavelle was a great oceanographer, Nathan Pusey, but in this group of very distinguished people that I was included and there was no...I couldn't see any deal. Of course the deal eventually came out, because there I was, a member of the board of trustees, [laughter] But those two were kind of special.
The other kinds of things were kind of routine, you know. You get the "Most Distinguished Citizen" award for something or other, and Otto and I have gotten a lot of joint awards, and Freedom House has had a citation on its own from the city. One that I did that wasn't even an award for me,﻿Ill
MS: (cont.) was a chance to get the All-American City Award for Boston, to
have been a part of that process was really very nice. I felt good about that. But I think generally, very generally, I just tend to think these things are nice, it would be nice for my grandchild to see them at some point. But I'm not that set up about awards. I think it's kind of a prophet without honor. I think that awards that come from people in your own community...we got one from OIC, I thought that that was nice, a community key from OIC, that's a very special kind of thing when your own recognize you, you're not a prophet without honor, so generally when I think about it, I would say that's my honest opinion. Oh dear, I was going to stop at one o'clock. It's now quarter past two.
CG: Oh, really?

'Citizen Participation," by Muriel and Otto Snowden 'The Dream: Education is Freedom," by Muriel Snowden 'Freedom House: A Team and a Dream," by Muriel Snowden﻿CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
Like the old sections of many other cities, Washington Park, in Boston, is an area of great contrasts. Within its 502 acres are included some of the worst slum property in the city, some of the lowest income families, a great number of serious social
problems, and a high degree of social disorganization. On the positive side, it does have homes as structurally sound and as beautifully maintained as any in Boston and counts among its Negro population —which is now 70 per cent of the total neighborhood population of
25,000 persons—many families of high	_
socio-economic and educational achievement.
Historically, successive waves
of migration have washed through this once proud, aristocratic neighborhood; old-line Yankees, Irish Catholics, Jews, and then Negroes. Each group, in its turn, sought a residential escape from the encroaching central city and moved into and out of Washington Park, in what has become a regular sociological pattern—each group, that is, except the Negroes. Caught in the noose of discrimination in private housing,
they found themselves trapped in an area that has been steadily declining over the past 40 years as a desirable place in which to live, own property, conduct business, or raise a family.
If there is anything unique about Washington Park, perhaps it lies in the vital community concern among its citizens, who have, themselves, worked for years to try to stem the tide of blight.
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
by
OTTO SNOWDEN Co-founder and Director, Freedom House
MURIEL SNOWDEN Co-founder and Assistant Director, Freedom House Roxbury, Massachusetts
On a cold February night in 1949, we—a husband and wife team of social workers—invited 17 local people to join us at our home to talk about ways of keeping the Roxbury section of Boston, in which all of us lived, from becoming another slum. As citizens, we were disturbed by the many signs of blight already evident in the community: dirty streets and yards, property in varying stages of neglect and deterioration, increase in petty crime and delinquency.
The alternatives placed before this interracial, interreligious meeting were: Move out of the community? Sit idly by? Or do something? Thoughtful consideration resulted in genera] agreement that Upper Roxbury still had assets and strengths that outweighed its liabilities and that the effort should be made to harness and direct them.
This was the beginning of Freedom House, an organization that consisted, originally, of only a few people armed with nothing but enthusiasm, faith in their community's potential, and sheer determination. In December 1949, it was incorporated as a charitable, nonprofit organization, with its boundaries of operation coinciding almost exactly with those that, in 1962, were to become the boundaries of the Washington Park urban renewal area.
The incorporators became the first board of directors and we volunteered to serve, without salary, as executive director and associate director.
Although somewhat fuzzy and nebulous at first, the objectives of
5*printed from the Journal of Housing, Volume 20, Number £. September 30, 1963 Publication of the Nat.ono' Assoc,ot,on of Housing ond ^development Officials, 1413 < Street, N W., Washington 5, D C﻿Freedom House eventually crystallized into (1) conserving and improving the Upper Roxbury neighborhood (now Washington Park) and (2) providing opportunities for greater interracial contact and understanding, both within the community itself and between its residents and those of greater Boston. Both the members of the board and the professional staff share a deep Personal commitment to these goals. I The early days were far from £asy. This was, quite consciously, a "bootstrap" operation, an attempt 'o establish an attitude of self-help among the people—predominantly Negro—of Upper Roxbury. Therefore, for the first year, the funds required to rent office space, to purchase second-hand typewriters and desks, and to cover minimal operating costs came out of the pockets of fte original 17 members. We spent days and nights walking the streets, diking to people about joining this effort to save the community. Sup-Port came in all kinds of ways: permission to use names as sponsors of t^e project; small contributions; benefits organized by club groups.
It was slow, tedious work. Reac-l)ons seemed to take one of three forms: (1) the Snowdens must have an "angle"—nobody works for nothing; (2) they are starry-eyed J'isionaries; or (3) maybe they are honestly concerned about the community. It was to those who shared °ur honest concern that initial approaches were made and it was they ^ho added the first strength to the movement.
In 1951, mainly through contacts made by board members and by the ®ssociate director, Freedom House moved out and beyond the local cprnmunity, in its search for finan-c'al backing. The concept of community self-help and in-depth democracy intrigued some of Boston's most influential businessmen and Philanthropists. As a result, they hacked a series of capital fund campaigns to raise the money required [°r the purchase of a building to "ouse the Freedom House "dream." . From its tiny office, Freedom "°use had been able to "sell" an '?ea; to encourage community par-f'cipation in clean-up campaigns; to 'nitiate a high school applicant prep-aration workshop, to supplement ^ocational guidance, for Negro and evvish youngsters; to equip and staff Summer playgrounds; to fight the

transfer of liquor licenses into the neighborhood. However, three years experience proved the futility of trying to bring about community communication and cohesion without adequate central headquarters. For this reason, in 1952, with a $15,000 downpayment on a $40,-000 plant, Freedom House moved into another phase of its development as a tangible, living focal point for the efforts of Upper Roxbury citizens to promote a program of community betterment and brotherhood.
New Home, New Programs
The first programs in the building were geared towards building greater contact and understanding among the heterogeneous population, both within and outside the Roxbury community. Notable among these was a play school for pre-school children, a semi-monthly coffee hour for women, a series of annual international teas, and the use of the building facilities by all kinds of social, civic, and fraternal organizations.
Yet, the constant demands of this kind of programming, of raising capital and operating funds, and of trying to steer Freedom House on a course related to total social planning for the city, left little time or energy for grappling with the problems of neighborhood deterioration.
A tentative start was made in 1954 when a local woman, greatly-upset by conditions on her street, responded to an offer from Freedom
House of help in organizing her neighbors into a block improvement group. Some interest developed, but, actually, the paving of the street; the planting of trees; and somewhat improved garbage, trash, and snow removal resulted from the drive of this one woman, with backing from Freedom House.
Learning from this experience and working from the Hyde Park-Kenwood pattern of block organization in Chicago and that of the Urban League in St. Louis, Freedom House began a more intensive and sophisticated approach in 1957. This time, the key individual was a Freedom House board member who, having laid the groundwork on his block, called together five interested neighbors to talk with the associate director of Freedom House about the value of group action. These five agreed to get five more for the next meeting, when attention would be given to the most pressing problems facing the neighborhood and to possible steps towards their solution.
A disreputable cafe was undoubtedly the most disturbing irritant and served as the rallying point around which the group of ten issued a broadside invitation to the entire street to attend the organizational meeting for a block association. Freedom House prepared the notices, researched police listings for names and addresses, did the secretarial work, and paid the costs of postage. Enough people responded to enable the setting up of a simple organizational structure and the﻿planning of a course of action. With the tavern's license coming up for renewal, the block group set in motion a campaign to get neighbors to sign petitions against it, to send postcards to the licensing board, and to appear in person at the hearing. Result: the licensing board felt the impact of citizen action and surrounded the renewal of the license with all kinds of provisos designed to meet the community protests. With this moral victor}' under its i belt, the Dale Street Block Association was in business and set about working on a clean-up campaign.
This was typical of the way in i which 27 other block groups, sparked bv Freedom House, prior to I 1959, were established. It should be pointed out that, with limited funds and staff, it was impossible for Freedom House to carry all the weight, to provide all the push, to work out meeting agenda, to oversee the formation of subcommittees, to meet with them, to keep up with requests for service. Therefore, Freedom House board members, I whose major concern was neighborhood improvement, were pressed into service as "block organizers" and began by first organizing their own streets.
An initial grant of $10,000 per year, for two years, from the Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation, in 1958, j made it possible for Freedom House to concentrate on the block program I and upon establishing the contacts j with Boston's political structure ! that would focus attention upon ; the needs of the Roxbury community.
In the meantime, at least three other over-all neighborhood groups < had come into being. Like Freedom House, they all made constant, individual appeals to the city for help. It wasn't until 1958, however, that all the groups, including Freedom House, came together to back the proposal of the former Boston planning board for a pilot urban renewal project in a 186-acre section of the Roxbury area. This Proposal was approved by the Boston city council in 1959, but no action occurred until the election of John F. Collins as mayor of Boston, 1 in 1960. The new mayor, with his bigger and bolder idea of the revital-ization of all of Boston and of the inclusion of Washington Park in the program, offered an answer to a very real question that had begun to
plague the staff of Freedom House in 1959: Can citizens of a neighborhood, earnest and dedicated though they are, actually succeed in holding the line against blight?
We had, by this time, recognized that clean-up campaigns, property improvement projects, petitions for street paving and the like had little success potential without being related to some kind of over-all planning. not only for the neighborhood, but for the city as a whole.
With the push for an urban_ renewal project in the Roxbury neighborhood and with the support of municipal officials, however, the efforts of Freedom House took their place within a larger conception. Here, at last, was a means of establishing the sought-after relationship between the citizens of a neighborhood and an over-all planning program where the success potential did seem great.
Role of Freedom House
Freedom House is the medium through which the vital lines of two-way communication between the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the local citizens were established. For a local public agency, such communication is often a difficult problem: How does an agency get to the people? Which of the existing citizen leadership groups will provide the broadest liaison?
The existence of an already established organization, like Freedom House, in a community provides the renewal program with a running start. Because Freedom House has an intimate and sensitive knowledge of Washington Park, it has been possible to bring together very diverse neighborhood elements to focus on urban renewal as a common concern.
On the other hand, as a private community group, Freedom House has had to face and overcome the suspicion aroused when it sought, and received, from the Boston Redevelopment Authority, a contract for funds to assist in meeting the tremendous demands of an intensive community organization job.
Ideally,"the money for such activities should come from . private sources; lacking this, however, the BRA-Freedom "House contract was the only way open to get the program moving. Freedom House was, at first, accused of being an arm of
BRA and of subverting its citizen-oriented responsibilities. This suspicion was overcome by frank public statements that, at no point, would Freedom House support BRA proposals that it felt might, in any way, not serve the community in the best manner.
Freedom House is now under contract, additionally, to Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), a Ford Foundation-financed organization with the human side of renewal as its focus. The contract calls for the provision, through Freedom House, of the same kind of opportunity for the citizens of Washington Park to participate in social planning as they had to participate in physical planning, as will be described below. In this case, no suspicion or opposition was expressed.
Again, ideally, physical and social planning should go hand-in-hand as part of a sound, total urban renewal process, with, if possible, social planning preceding physical planning to compensate for the inevitable time lag that makes for conflict between social and physical planners.
Planning with People
Some of the essential ingredients for what has been achieved in Washington Park so far appear to be:
1—the	personal and public commitment of the present mayor of Boston, John F. Collins, to the "planning with people" concept that Freedom House endorses;
2—the	same kind of commitment and dedication on the part of BRA; the development administrator, Edward J. Logue; and the members of his staff who are charged with the responsibility of carrying through the Washington Park program;
3—the	cooperative attitude of the citizens of the community, for which Freedom House claims a great deal of credit.
Freedom House, as the main line of communication between the public officials an<J citizens has, as its part of the achievement in Washington Park, since April 1961 organized, been involved in, or coordinated: (a) close to 120 separate meetings of homeowners and tenants, of business and professional﻿people, of clergymen, of people in early land acquisition areas; (b) a series of public hearings, crowded to capacity; (c) production and distribution of over 16,000 letters and notices inviting people in the community to attend these meetings and hearings to express their own views and opinions; (d) the distribution of thousands of newsletters, question-and-answer sheets, and bulletins dealing with various aspects of renewal, such as relocation procedures and benefits, the timing of acquisition of properties, where to go for assistance with individual problems; (e) countless professional conferences and briefing sessions required for the development of a working Washington Park "team."
BRA planners and technicians brought to the community a spirit of cooperation and an honest, sincere willingness to do whatever was necessary to give community residents a chance to share in the shaping of plans designed to improve physical living conditions. They met with citizens of Washington Park at night, because that is the best time for working people to come to meetings; they stayed on into the early morning hours, patiently and courteously answering questions and explaining knotty technical points; or they have given their time on Sunday mornings for meetings, because that, too, is one of the few convenient times for business and professional people.
Citizens and planners met week after week, month after month, hammering out the set of proposals that, eventually, became the Washington Park urban renewal plan. In these sessions, stretching over two and a half years, lay citizens bccame acquainted with the complexities of transportation and traffic flow, zoning and density, building condition and land use surveys, and the standards required for new housing and community facilities. There has been a healthy exchange of ideas, suggestions, and even drastic differences of opinion. But throughout it all—the presentations, the discussions, the explanations, the arguments—there has also been a growth of mutual understanding and respect.
At times, there was impatience on the part of citizen leaders and doubt as to whether all of the talk could ever really materialize into action. For this reason, the meeting held in Freedom House on the night of October 18, 1961 was a significant one. On that evening, planners unveiled for the community the first tangible results of the years of cooperative work. They displayed a series of maps that graphically showed the citizens the tremendous amount of work and detail involved in transferring to paper the raw data of all the surveys, studies, and planning sessions.
Out of all the planning meetings, too, came the formation of a.new
neighborhood organization, the Washington Park Citizens Urban Renewal Action Committee (CURAC), which, hopefully, will continue to work cooperatively with the redevelopment authority throughout the execution period of the renewal project and will provide for the on-going citizen concern for maintaining the renewal community over the long haul. CURAC is also addressing itself to the tremendous task of seeking out the tools needed to achieve "people renewal."
Following the significant meeting of October 18, 1961, efforts centered on refining and modifying the preliminary proposals until, finally, almost one year later, CURAC formally presented the complete Washington Park urban renewal plan to Mayor Collins, with the recommendation that it be expedited with the greatest possible speed.
In January 1963, a public hearing on the final plan was held in the community by the board of BRA. A long parade of citizens and clergymen, one after the other, expressed the community's endorsement of the plan. When a vote was taken among the 1200 persons present, only three indicated that they had some reservations about one or another particular aspect of the proposals.
Next came another public hearing, this time conducted by the city council. Again, there was almost

A Sunday morning meeting of Washington Park business and professional people in December 1961 drew the audience pictured to discuss renewal plans.﻿unanimous approval on the part of the community.
Cleared by the citizens, the mavor, BRA,' the city council, the state housing board, the plan went on to New "York and Washington for federal approval, which was announced, by Urban Renewal Administration Commissioner William L. Slayton, on April 23, 1963, at a Boston College seminar devoted to Planning with People—The Washington Park Story.
Thus, the Washington Park urban renewal plan entered the execution phase. On May 10, Housing and Home Finance Agency Administrator Robert C. Weaver came to Boston to participate in the groundbreaking ceremonies for Academy Homes, 202 units of middle-income housing that is to serve as relocation housing for families displaced as the renewal project gets moving. Academy Homes is the first new housing to go up in the Washington Park neighborhood in 50 years.
Evaluations
At every step of the way there was community involvement in bringing renewal to Washington Park, whether it was concerned with the extension of the boundaries of the renewal area from the original 186 acres to the 502 acres that finally were included within the project, or with the decision to enter upon an early land acquisition program, or with the discussion of re-
location problems, or with the nailing down of rumors, or with special meetings on proposals for new schools.
And, in all of this citizen participation, there was a calculated risk. Would this kind of' planning approach produce a great deal of anxiety among the residents of an area scheduled for renewal? Or would their involvement, from the outset, serve, instead, to allay fears and anxieties? In Washington Park, the experience to date seems to be tangible proof that, given a certain combination of factors, planning with citizens is both sound and practicable.
The real test, of course, is yet to come—that of making the renewal plan work. The cornerstone upon which the entire project rests is the sense of mutual trust between city agencies and the citizens of the neighborhood. It is a state of affairs not easily achieved and even less easily sustained. As in other communities throughout the country, the renewal program in Washington Park must now be played against the shifting backdrop and increased tempo of civil rights and be guided with alert and skillful maneuvering among the whirlpools and currents of the political stream. But for the people of Washington Park, who have been involved in the whole planning process to date, there has come a new sense of purpose and hope and direction and the
feeling that they are truly partners, not pawns, in urban renewal.
Future Plans for Freedom House
At present, Freedom House is committed, at least until June 1964, to fulfilling the terms of its contracts with the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Action for Boston Community Development, in guiding the growth and development of the Washington Park Citizens' Urban Renewal Action Committee, in organizing and coordinating area associations for even broader participation in the rehabilitation aspects of physical renewal, in the plans for social renewal, and in continuing its function as a special kind of liaison between citizen and planner.
Beyond that, its board of directors is considering and evaluating the role that Freedom House can and should play as a two-way bridge of communication in the civil rights struggle. Rooted in the Negro community, with broad contacts in greater Boston and in suburban areas, Freedom House offers a rare Jbut essential medium for honest, frank dialogue and stimulus for considered action.
The extent to which its energies can be channeled in this direction will depend, in large measure, upon how effectively CURAC can assume the major responsibility for execution of the Washington Park urban renewal plan.
On December 18, 1962, the completed Washington Park urban renewal plan was presented to Mavor Collins (seated) and to members of the board of BRA. Describing 'he elements of the model, with ruler in hand, is Boston development administrator Edward J. Logue.
At the Boston College seminar, "Planning with People—the Washington Park Story," formal federal approval of the renewal plan was announced by Urban Renewal Administration Commissioner William L. Slayton (seated, left). Next to Mr. Slayton, John F. Collins, mayor of Boston; Muriel Snowden, assistant director of Freedom House and co-author of the Journal's report, is seated on the right.

Freedom (?)
It is a great honor and a great privilege to be invited here today to share in this Annual Convocation Ceremony in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to be part of keeping alive his dream and ours.
Yet, for this occasion to be designated the "Keynote Orator" or the presenter of the "Keynote Address" carries with it a rather special burden. Dr. King was a man of such depth, such sensitivity, such awareness that there is a kind of compulsion to try to rise to the challenge with something extremely profound. Still, with all of his greatness, Dr. King was never pompous, dogmatic, or arrogant, so it would do violence to his memory if I permitted my remarks to exhibit any of those characteristics.
Before examining with you the subject of "The Dream: Education Is Freedom," let me make a few prefatory statements.
First, although I never really knew Martin Luther King, Jr., I was powerfully influenced by him,. Actually I was very familiar with the philosophy and techniques of nonviolent direct action even before he entered upon the scene. I have a brother who was—and is-a pacifist of the Ghandian persuasion. As a consequence of his beliefs, he spent almost four years during
World War II (1942-46) in the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. A bona fide, draft-board-recognized conscientious objector, his case came up in our home state of New Jersey before a visiting judge from Florida who made an interesting statement as he pronounced sentence upon Bill Sutherland. He said: "Young man, your education has been your undoing1 Four years in the federal pen." Bill was a graduate of Bates College.
In thinking about men like Dr. King and my brother, it is important to understand where they were coming from. They were strong—not weaklings given to turning the other cheek—but individuals with the courage of their convictions of opposition to war and unrestricted use of military force and their un-shakeable belief in the settling of international disputes by arbitration rather than sending men out to kill other human beings.
However, no amount of philosophical conditioning could have prepared me adequately for the tremendous emotional experience of being part of that fantastic March On Washington in 1963 when my husband, my then 18 year old daughter, and I stood with those 250,000 "Pilgrims" in front of the Lincoln Memorial. There was no
way to stop the tears which rolled down our faces as Martin Luther King's magnificent voice rang out with the passion of his dream for Black and White people in Amer::e and climaxed like a clash of cymbals with "Free at Last: Free at Last! Great God a'Mighty, We're Free at Last!" There is no way to describe that . . . you had to BE there.
And then, there were three other occasions when we had persona contact with him. During the Montgomery bus boycott, he came to Boston to raise money, and even through Freedom House was then only a poor, struggling, fledgling organization, we held a reception for him and presented him with a small purse. Later, my husband, Otto, was to join the group from Boston that flew South to march with him across the bridge at Selma. (We had a kind of bitter joke about that because I stayed at home to march in the St. F>atrick's Day Parade in South Boston and there was a question as to which one of us was safer). Then, finally, during the period when Harry Belafonte was travelling the country for the benefit of SCLC, my husband took a week off to help Dr. King and his assistants to pull off one of the most successful affairs of all here in Boston. Incidentally, that was also﻿'first contact with a wonderful man, a disciple of Dr. King, r°se name was Andy Young!

;3w that his physical presence is N, these are precious and treas-ecl rriemories for us.
'Jt memories, no matter how (Jrm, how beautiful, are not /°ugh| Paying homage to Dr. .:,nS's memory on the dates of his P1 and his death is not enough! 5ablishing a cult around Dr. King, '^ssion and dialogue about ',^ther he was a man or saint, lather he was great because of |>s or whether he influenced the >se and history of Black people, father his philosophy and tech-i^es are no longer relevant. . . I is not enough! It,
of this is enough for you and j/ewh0 have had the opportunity .j,r°Ligh a fortuitous set of circum-,3nces to cultivate our minds, if
are to be the caretakers and the Emitters of the substance of his (eams. We have to remember that
King was concerned about '^ality of opportunity and qual-
ity in all areas of life ... of living as well as making a living.
And that brings me to what I pose as a question to you rather than as a statement: The Dream: Education Is Freedom???'? As I see it, there is no simplistic answer to that question which carries within it the need to define both "Education" and "Freedom."
1 feel we need to talk about this, but I make no pretense of doing other than to share with you a few of my thoughts, reflections based upon 60 years of being Black and female in White America and upon 28 years of struggling, along with my husband, through Freedom House as a base of operations, to try to make some of those things in Dr. King's dream a reality for at least a few people in Boston.
I hope none of you missed Patricia Roberts Harris's eloquent response to Senator Proxmire's questioning of her qualifications for the office of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. His questions and her answers have a lot to say about education and freedom-namely, that education must be broadly defined in terms of academic training coupled with one's total life experience. Pat Harris did not mention her academic degrees, she simply reminded the
Senator and the millions watching the news that all of her educational background had counted for naught in her freedom to live where she chose in the District of Columbia or to eat where she pleased and that she had elected to use her knowledge and her education on behalf of the poor, the Black, the disinherited, the oppressed . . . and assured them that in her new capacity, she would continue to do so. I would be willing to wager that there is not one Black person in this country, "educated" or not, who, if honest, could not echo Pat Harris's experiences. The important thing is that her head is wrapped tightly enough to remember who she is and whence she comes. On the other side of tnat coin, however, is the inescapable fact that without her formal training she would never have even arrived at the point of being a visible. viable candidate for a cabinet post in the U.S. Government.
(Remember Dr. King's own epitaph in his "Don't tell them about the Nobel Prize; don't tell them about the honorary degrees-just say that I tried to help somebody!")
And so, education in the formal sense is not in and of itself freedom ... it is only one of the paths that hopefully leads us towards it. For the past 3 years in particular, edu-﻿cational equity for Black and other minority children has been the number one concern for us at Freedom House, and our involvement in shaking up the system has been part of that process. Despite all that you may have heard to the contrary, those of us actively waging this battle are not fighting for
Black children to share in an INADEQUATE educational system. Our objective is to bring about changes in that system so that it does what public school education is supposed to do-at least theoretically: to provide the masses of people with the basic tools of survival in a technological society-economically, psychologically, physically, and emotionally. Ana so, we work on many levels to try to'bring this within reach of the Black children in Boston whose only entree is through the public school system. It MUST become responsive to their needs, their hopes, their aspirations. For an excellent analysis of our basic posture, I refer you to an article by Dr Alvin Poussaint and Dr. Toye Brown Lewis entitled "School Desegregation A Synonym for Racial Equality" (University of Chicago, SCHOOL REVIEW, May, 1976).
In February of 1974, Freedom House established within its structure a full-time educational component known as the Freedom House
Institute on Schools and Education. Its purpose was two-fold To assist Black parents and children to understand what desegregation was all about so that they could make informed intelligent decisions about their course of action and (2) equally important, to INSIST that there be Black input into the planning, decision, and policymaking processes BEFORE they become an accomplished fact. Freedom House also joined in a Coalition, which it anchored, composed of other Black-run organizations and agencies, plus Black individuals with educational expertise and clout. In 1974 and 1975, all of us together helped to provide community back-up and safety measures for those Black parents and their children who were trying to obey a federally-mandated court order by riding a bus. Simultaneously, we were grinding out responses, critiques, analyses, and recommendations in reaard to the various desegregation plans, university and business pairings with the schools, and literature dealing with the legal rights of Black children. Most recently, for me, has been intensive involvement in the Committee for Boston's recommendations for charter change and restructuring of the Boston School Committee.
It is really somewhat ironic that we
now hear from all sides the cry fci "back to basics." Black people have known for years that it was not that our children are "unedu-cable" that they were not learninr, to read and write and count. Somebody in the Boston Public Schoo; System once had the unmitigated gall to say publicly that there was no such thing as inferior schools there were only inferior children'
The search for education is a response to the thirst for knowledge which dates a long, long way be: k-to the Garden of Eden, perhaps. Remember the drama and the pathos of what the slaves and early freedmen went through to acquire a little education and the fears of those who tried to prevent it. There is great truth in the slogan of the United Negro College Fund—"It is a terrible thing to waste a human mind." It was
brought home so forcibly to me during these last weeks since November when 247 6th and 8th grade eager youngsters—most of them Black-registered for the Freedom House Workshops to help them prepare for the Secondary School Scholastic Aptitude Tests for entry into the so-called Exam Schools—the Latin Schools and Boston Tech.
And that need, that thirst exists elsewhere. In 1974, I attended the﻿African Congress in Dar es |3rn in Tanzania, East Africa. ;real highlight of that trip was Fiance I had to share in an fs conversation with another pman—Mwalimu Julius pre, President of Tanzania. j'valimu" (Teacher) is the title Extraordinary leader prefers. Natter of fact, my brother Ped me that the note of thanks I' had addressed to him as pT Excellency" was in bad ^and would have offended r As we sat and talked with him ^ what he saw as his greatest he said, very simply: "Help educate my people." He ir,t it in the sense of the words ^V Ghanaian sister-in-law who |'e in the preface of her book j'ecl "The Roadmakers": "We in jiria must find the ways of mov-So the 20th Century without ;l0rting the 'junk' of Western Ration." If you have read (5°ts" you will understand r she and Nyerere mean about pignity, the warmth, the Nth of the African culture. Let
barter away our jewels for Nhes of material success as we Mesmerized by the television p- Which reminds me how far we go in realizing the poten-television as a teaching-[n'ng tool. It is my hope that Presentation of "Roots" cur-i!lV scheduled will fulfill the
challenge and the promise. My Ghanaian nieces visited me last summer and bemoaned the kinds of questions they were asked about Africa. "Too many Tarzan movies," they said. Sympathizing with them, I still couldn't help feeling distress that when I visited them, their major exposure was to "Hawaii 5-0! And for me personally, the last straw would be subjecting them to those TV commercials. Two in particular gall me-the oleo "king" and "ring around the collar." Doesn't change things a bit that the actors are Black. But don't let me get into that—it is a whole subject for another day and another time.
Well, I don't know whether I have been able in any way to do justice to this occasion or to meet your expectations. Nor do I know what you have HEARD as you have so politely listened. I feel the pressure of time and the sure knowledge that I do not have as many years ahead of me as I have behind and my thoughts tend to tumble over one another and probably seem somewhat less than coherent. So there is undoubtedly some glimpse of my anxiety about the "miles to go before I sleep" and a concern about the future of our people.
But perhaps, I can sum up some of the things I really wanted to say.
Basically, I think I have been talking about "values." As I was waiting tor my sister recently in the doctor's office, I came across this in a magazine article about Prince Philip. He was responding to a question about what he thought were the values people were concerned about and he said.
1
Opportunity to be self-reliant; 2
To feel responsible for the upbringing and development of their children;
3
To feel that their own efforts will enable them to provide for their health and old age;
4
The desire to live in a law-abiding, fair and decent society;
5
To make useful contributions to their community in one form or another.
I think that is an excellent list except that I would place the last one higher up in a descending order of importance.﻿And so, these are the things that ! think I have been saying:
1
That the true goals of education have to do with a difficult and delicate process of synthesizing and balancing book learning with one's life experiences in such a way that we achieve the capacity for freedom of choice, for exercising options, and doing it from a position of strength rather than weakness.
(And although it may be heresy at MIT, let me insert another quote from Prince Philip' ". . . human organizations can not be made to function as efficiently or as reliably as a machine. What is needed is not so much an understanding of machine technology, but a sympathetic and realistic understanding of human nature."!
It also occurs to me that it is very interesting that writers of science fiction are able to come up with exciting and creative technological concepts, but fail absolutely in conceptualizing new ways for human beings to relate to one another.
2
That in the process, we who are Black must remain part of the psychological community of Black people. As long as there is oppres-
sion here at home, in Southern Rhodesia, in Namibia, in South Africa, or wherever, it unites us WHATEVER Our status Or position or achievements.
3
That we must know that the battle for equality and quality in education as well as in jobs and housing, individual growth and development is far from won. It is still one of freedom from want, from fear, from ignorance, from hunger, from disease. I mentioned the fact earlier that you and I are here today through a fortuitous set of circumstances. It may be nice for our egos to believe that "we made it" on our own, but nothing is further from the truth. We have ridden on the backs and the sacrifices of so many people . . . our history is full of them and we must not forget.
I am unhappy with the story in Sunday's New York Times on "A Black Middle Class in Dixie" in which a 37 year old Black mother asked her young daughters if they remembered the Civil Rights Movement, the marches, the demonstrations, the protest, and they "grinned sheepishly and shook their heads "No." I feel that such ignorance is unforgivable. In any event, we who are here today are at the top of the list of those who owe heavy debts to those who have
gone before. We have dues to pay and i.o.u.'sto redeem and money is not the only currency in which we must pay them.
4
That like the ancient GP.iOTS of "Roots," some of us need to seel, out the facts of our past and our present, tell the story, pass it along, and hopefully, be able to add our own part in and to it.
Finally, as we pay tribute today to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I am reminded of the words of the poet, David McCord, on the death of a friend: "Many trees have fallen from my landscape, but this one had radiance."
The radiance of Dr. King is still here ... in this, the ninth year since he died. It glows, it dims, but it never fades: and those of us who are committed to the substance of his dream, draw our own warmth, our hope, our inspiration from it
Martin Luther King, Jr. drew his own strength and power from a deep spiritual wellspring, and this refrain from a hymn keeps running through my mind: "Lord, God of Hosts, be with us yet—lest we forget, lest we forget."

by Muriel Sutherland Snowden '38
Mrs. Snowden and her husband Otto founded Freedom House in Boston sixteen years ago. She received the Radcliffe Alumnae Achievement Award last June, and is now a director of the Alumnae Association. Her daughter is a Radcliffe sophomore.
It is March, 1965, as I write this, and I find myself torn bv conflicting emotions which have had an almost paralyzing effect. Along with all the others who knew him, I grieve in a personal way for the young, the gentle, the compassionate Reverend James Reeb. With the hundreds of thousands similarly affected, I recoil in shock and indignation at the shameful exhibition of unleashed brutality in Selma, Alabama.
All of this has resulted in something more ... a kind of questioning of the validity of all the things my husband and I have believed in and worked for for such a long time. Against this kind of ugliness, I asked myself, what difference can it possibly make whether or not there is a successful urban renewal program in our Washington Park section of Roxbury? How, with any kind of honesty and conviction, can we keep on saving to Negroes in our community that there is a new day a-coming . . . let's work for it, let's prepare for it?
There is something so devastating about this kind of jolt to one's relationship to one's own reality that momen-tarilv, at least, everything shifts out of focus. And this is the way it has been with Otto and me, although there is no denying that out of that first despair is coming a greater hope, a greater faith, a greater confidence in what America and her people stand for.
U/ e felt this as we and our daughter Gail joined the thou-sands who marched on Sunday, March 14, to Boston Common for the memorial to Jim Reeb and the protest
against the forces which caused his death. Otto felt it. too. on the next dav when he flew off to Selma with the Boston delegation headed bv Lieutenant Governor Elliot Richardson.
"The hate, the arrogance, the fear there were almost tangible." he told me upon his return, "but the picture you bring awav indeliblv stamped upon your mind is that of the incredible courage, the irresistible force of the love of Martin Luther King and the Negroes of Selma, combined with the determination of the wave after wave of people who came from everywhere to stand witness beside them— Negroes and whites, ministers, priests, rabbis, nuns, young and old."
I had the feeling of love and tears mvself as. two davs later, I rode in South Boston's St. Patrick's Dav Parade under the aegis of the Catholic Interracial Council. What I remember are not the isolated jeers and epithets, but rather, the wonderful priests with whom I rode and those walking beside our car; the school teacher at the open window of her classroom bending down to help her children clap their small hands as we went by; the many, manv people in the crowd who applauded and waved in approval of what the Council signifies; and most of all, the elderly woman who stepped forward to say, "God bless you all!" '
And now, si owl v, with the President's speech echoing in mv ears and the sense of a continuing swell of interest, concern, and involvement of people all over the country, it once again becomes possible to respond to the demands and pressures of the home situation and to recognize anew the imperative for finding here, in the less hostile environment of the citv of Boston and the state of Massachusetts, answers to basically the same kinds of problems plaguing the communities of the South.
"|*rving to find the answers . . . essentially, this is what
Otto and I have been about ever since that day sixteen vears ago when we decided to tie our personal future into the future of our community.
There has always been, and there still is, some confusion in people's minds about what Freedom House is. There is the natural tendency, I supppose, to assume that it is a community center, or a neighborhood house, or a settlement house, providing classes, recreation, and leisure time activities for children and adults. Apparently, it was also assumed at last November's Alumnae Council program that mv role and function in relation to Freedom House is that of a volunteer, an unpaid assistant to mv husband.
However, neither of these concepts is quite accurate. It is true that, in the beginning davs, we worked without salary in order to get the organization on its feet. Freedom House, both now and as Otto and I originally conceived it in 1949, is a civic center, a focal point, a medium, for efforts to improve the general community environment of what is currently called the Washington Park Urban Re-
Reprint from the Radcliffe Quarterly, May, 1963.﻿newal Area, and to further the extent of interracial contact and communication between this community and the rest of Boston and its suburbs.
"Therefore, Freedom House involvement in the Washing-ton Park urban renewal program is a logical outgrowth of the spadework which we did long before there was an urban renewal program to Boston. For years, our little organization struggled to hold the line against the rapid corrosion of blight. At first, we had to spend our time gaining community confidence in the enterprise, running campaigns for funds, finding a building to house the operation. Then, with the active assistance of members of our board of directors, we began to organize block improvement associations, and to call the attention of city officials and citv departments to the enormous loss in both human and physical terms resulting from the neglect of our com-munitv—the inadequate garbage, trash, and snow removal; insufficient play areas for the children; the lack of code enforcement; the deplorable condition of our schools; the inabilitv of residents to secure home improvement loans, mortgages, and fire insurance because of the "red-lining" of the neighborhood as a poor credit risk area; and above all, the increasing ghettoization.
And for ten long years, we fought a losing battle. Citizen effort alone, no matter how earnest, how dedicated, how well-organized, just could not cope with problems like these ... and we knew it. Thus, in 1959-60, Freedom House was in the vanguard of those urging the inclusion of Roxburv in Boston's overall plans for the revitalization of the city.
"Planning with people," Boston's Mayor Collins and Development Administrator Edward Logue reiterated again and again, would be the cornerstone of the Boston program, and we took them at their word. In 1961-62, Freedom House, Inc. entered into contractual arrangements with the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Action for Boston Community Development to establish a two-way channel of communication, a special kind of liaison, between the planners and technicians and the people of the Washington Park community.
The Washington Park Urban Renewal Plan, as approved bv the federal government in April 1963, represented two'vears of feverish activity bv Freedom House to involve local citizens in the planning process. In those two years, we called over 500 meetings in our auditorium and throughout the community. We sent out over 16,000 letters and notices inviting people to come to these meetings to offer their ideas, suggestions, and criticisms. Some 2000 people did come; and hours and hours of debate, discussion, and argument went into the joint hammering out of the Plan bv the people of the community and the Washington Park staff of the Boston Redevelopment Authority. As a result, nation-wide attention has been focused upon

Bottom: Mr. Snowden (top of steps) begins a chartered flight to Selma, Alabama, on March 15.﻿Washington Park as a prototype for residential renewal.
As of the moment, much of the Plan has been translated into realitv. Over 500 units of attractive, new, moderate-income housing are either already built and completely occupied or scheduled for tenancy in the very near future. Formal dedication of a magnificent new YMCA, built at a cost of over one-half million dollars, will take place in Maw A new shopping center and a new elementary school are to be under construction soon. The acquisition, relocation, and demolition required for the rest of the new communitv facilities are virtually completed. In addition, thousands and thousands of dollars are being spent bv local homeowners in the repairing and up-grading of their propertv.
Yet. the job is far from done, and there are times when we fear that the social problems of the area will engulf us. It is urgent that the pace of "people renewal"—the term coined in the planning sessions—be stepped up if we are to achieve, permanently, the goal of making this one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Boston in which to live. Basically, we have tried, through Freedom House, to marshal the very real strengths and human resources of our community in initiating and undergirding ideas and plans for sound, practicable solutions. The constantly shifting backdrop of the civil rights drama, as it is being played out both here and across the country, makes the job easier and more difficult at the same time.
^lthough I have stressed the urban renewal aspects of the Freedom House movement, the story would be incom-
plete without mention of activities such as last year's "interracial home visit" project, the on-going "Sundav at 8" Forum Series, and the recent successful attempts to bring together Boston business firms and potential Negro employees.
For Otto and me, undoubtedly the most important consequence of our commitment to Freedom House is the special dimension it gives to our lives. We have a real, an urgent, reason for being which demands all of the time, the energy, the imagination, the courage, and the perseverance which we have. Together, we founded an organization; together, we have shared the responsibility for its direction and growth; together, we have moved from volunteer service to being its paid executive and associate directors; and through it, we have become tightly welded as working partners, a husband-wife team. We have found that as long as we are anchored to this sturdy rock of a full, meaningful existence, we are able to withstand the tension and friction, the stresses and strains that can sometimes wash a marriage awav.
The onlv flaw . . . and it is a real one ... is this: although, as a woman with a great deal of drive, a restless temperament, and a mind disciplined and trained bv a Radcliffe education, I have found exciting and creative outlets in Freedom House and a multiplicity of related activities, I have not found that elusive point of balance which permits a woman to meet the demands of this kind of life and to devote herself as she would like to the needs and the enjoyment of her home.
Perhaps Gail will. ...
