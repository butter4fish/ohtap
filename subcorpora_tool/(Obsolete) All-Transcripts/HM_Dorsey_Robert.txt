Speaker 1: Good afternoon.
Speaker 2: Good afternoon.
Speaker 1: We're going to get started with the interview by slating.  My name is Regina Williams, and I'm the interviewer [for The HistoryMakers].  The videographer today is Matthew Hickey.  And we have two observers for today's interview, Karen and Helena Dorsey.  Mr. Dorsey, throughout the interview I'll continue to refer to you as Mr. Dorsey and never by your first name.  But I'd like to get started by asking you if you would please state and spell your name, including your first, middle and last name?
Speaker 2: Well, my name is Robert Sherwood Dorsey.  That's spelled R-O-B-E-R-T, S-H-E-R-W-O-O-D, and Dorsey is D-O-R-S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And Mr. Dorsey, would you please state the date of your birth and the location of your birth?
Speaker 2: I was born October the 9th, 1923 in Lafayette, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is March the 14th, 2005.
Speaker 1: And also, for the record, would you state the location of this interview with the address?
Speaker 2: This interview is, the location is Westchester, Ohio, and the street address is 8272 Coppernail.  That's spelled C-O-P-P-E-R-N-A-I-L Way, W-A-Y.  And that's Westchester, Ohio.  And the zip code is 45069.
Speaker 1: Would you please tell us what your occupation is?
Speaker 2: My occupation, at this time, I'm a retired consultant, retired from the General Electric Company, the Aircraft Engine Division, where I spent approximately thirty-eight years with the company.
Speaker 1: And at GE, General Electric, okay, in that aircraft division, what exactly did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I had various jobs in that division.  I first started out as a test engineer.  And a test engineer is sort of an engineer in training where the company assigns you to different jobs on a three-month basis, and for a period of a year.  And so the first year that I was with the company, I had had three assignments, one in Fort Wayne, Indiana and one in Schenectady, New York and then I had two at the Lynn Plant in Lynn, Massachusetts.  And then I went on, after the test engineering program was over, I took a permanent job with the company as a design engineer, designing the gear boxes and the lubrication systems for the aircraft engines.  And I spent several years in that job.  And then from that job, I moved on to a job in what we called, we started reliability engineering, which was a new branch of engineering that came about when the, when we started building rockets to send spacemen to the moon and places in space.  They were having quite a bit of difficulty with the engines failing.  And so they came up with, what they called reliability engineering which was engineering which dealt with the causes of failures and also how to retract those failures and use the information from the failures to try to correct the problems that we were having.  So I spent several years doing that.  And then I moved on to, and then the computer age came in.  And when the computer age came in, I sort of shifted over into that part of the business and started learning about computers and office automation.  And that's where I ended my career, as a manager of office automation and the application of computers to engineering and also to secretarial work.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Story_ID: 29268
Speaker 1: Now, in this next section, I need to ask a series of five "People Magazine-ish" type questions.  And the first one, asks what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, (chuckle) well, my favorite food is really spaghetti and meat sauce, is one of my favorite foods, although being on a low-carb diet, spaghetti and meat sauce doesn't go too well these days (laughter).  I have to limit my portions in order to enjoy my favorite food.
Speaker 1: All right, Mr. Dorsey, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is really in the spring and summer when I can get out on the outside and play golf and other sports that the weather will allow you to play during that time.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  How about a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite destination had been Hilton Head [South Carolina].  We own a time-sharing at Hilton Head, and we've been going down there for oh, at least twenty-five years now.  And every year we would go down for a couple of weeks and spend some time walking on the beach and wading in the water.  And Hilton Head has been our favorite vacation spot.
Speaker 1: And finally, Mr. Dorsey, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I do, and my favorite phrase is that, has to do with problems.  And it goes something like this, that, "You should change the problems that you can change and accept those that you cannot change and then have the wisdom to know the difference".
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 29269
Speaker 1: In this next section, we like to talk a little bit about your family background.  And I'd just like to get started by asking if you could please tell us about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Rita, Rita Allen.
Speaker 1: And do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lafayette, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Did she also grow up in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any stories that she told you about her growing up in that state?
Speaker 2: I didn't--
Speaker 1: Any stories that she told you about growing up in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.  We really didn't have too much time to talk to each other because she, being a single parent, she was working most of the time.  And I was going to school and would come home and have to do my homework.  So we really didn't have too much time to talk to each other.  So.
Speaker 1: So, well, basically, you've already suggested that your mother was a very hard-working person.  But is there any other word that you would use to describe her?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very caring person and she was very devoted to me, in other words, and she was very protective of me.  And she wanted to make sure that I didn't get into trouble and would be a good boy and go to school and get my education.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Never, never, never.  I think my grandparents died before I really had any time to spend with them.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk about them at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She talked about them quite a bit, but I didn't, I can't remember too much what she said about them.
Speaker 1: But you said she was born in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so both Southerners?  Both of her parents?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I'm not very cognizant of my mother's side of the family and their background.
Story_ID: 29270
Speaker 1: All right.  Mr. Dorsey, may I ask you to please tell me what you know about your father and his side of the family?
Speaker 2: The first--?
Speaker 1: Your father--
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: --and his side of the family?  Yes.
Speaker 2: My father--. The only time that I met my father was when I was in the service.  I was about eighteen years old, and I was being transferred from a station in Louisiana to Fort Huachuca [Arizona].  And my father was living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  And the train that we were on had a stop in Baton Rouge.  And we had maybe about a two-hour layover.  And so I looked up his name in the phone book and called him, and luckily enough, I was able to contact him.  And he came down to the station at that time.  And that was the only time I was ever, known my father.  I've never seen him since that time.  That was the first time and last time that I've seen him.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Willie, Willie Dorsey.
Speaker 1: And did I ask what your mother's name was?  I wanna make sure we have that on the record also.
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name was Rita, Rita Allen because she married after she and my father [Willie Dorsey] separated.  She married, well, she married twice after she and my father separated.  She first married Elbert Walters who was my stepfather most of the time during my growing ages.  And then after I graduated from high school and went to college, she and my stepfather separated.  And then she married again to the, a fellow named Allen.  I never knew him because I was away from home when she married him.  So I don't even remember what his first name is.
Story_ID: 29271
Speaker 1: All right, Mr. Dorsey, what are some of the earliest memories that you have of growing up in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: In what--, you mean some problems that I may have had, or--?
Speaker 1: Well, not necessarily problems, but maybe the streets that you lived on or the schools you attended or what pleasant memories perhaps?
Speaker 2: Oh, the pleasant memories.  Well, some of my early memories were my high school days really.  You know, we, I really did enjoy going to school for one thing.  And the activities that I participated in during my high school days cause I was always into something athletic, either playing football, basketball or softball, just to keep busy and also I was very, very much involved with my school work.  One thing I prided myself in was in being a good student.  And that pride, I think, resulted in me being the valedictorian of our class when we graduated, a class of about 300 students.  And I was the valedictorian in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what high school was it?
Speaker 2: It was Phillis Wheatley High School in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were born in Lafayette, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But graduating high school in Houston?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  My mother moved to Houston when I was about five years old.  And so I grew up in Houston from five years until I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so pretty much all of your schooling is in Texas?
Speaker 2: All of my schooling, my high school, my elementary schooling and high school was in Texas, in Houston.
Speaker 1: All right.  And when you were growing up, were there other children in the family?
Speaker 2: No, I was the only child.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you said you were valedictorian of your high school.  What's the name of the high school, please, and the year of your graduation?
Speaker 2: It's Phillis Wheatley High School.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that's spelled, P-H-I-L-L-I-S, not "y", "s".  Some people spell it "y", "s", but it's Phillis Wheatley.  The school was named after a famous lady in history, Phillis Wheatley [the first African American poet and the first African American, the first slave, and third woman to publish a book of poems in the United States] in history.  And I graduated in 1941.
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, that must have been an interesting period in your life, to say the least, coming of age in the era of the Great Depression and World War II.  Do you remember the Depression era and any especially negative impact that it had on the Houston community?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't really.  The Depression era was not a serious impact and I don't have any memories of any tragic things that did happen during that time, except that, we didn't get all that we wanted to eat.  But we got the basics.  We got the cornbread and the beans and those kind of dishes.  We didn't have the gourmet dishes, but we did have enough to, we didn't starve.  Now, I don't have any recollection of us having starved during that period of time.
Story_ID: 29272
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Dorsey, if I ask you to tell me, in addition to the cornbread and the beans, some of the smells and the sights and the sounds that remind you of growing up in Houston [Texas], what else would you add to the list?
Speaker 2: Well, really the heat was the main thing.  Houston was very hot in the summertime.  You know, hot and humid.  The temperature would be in the neighborhood of 95 and 96 degrees and humidity about 90 percent.  And that was the main thing that I can remember about Houston growing up and the fact that we never had snow, never had snow in Houston.  In fact, we did have snow one day in Houston, and we were in school at the time.  And snow was coming down in huge flakes.  I don't know, you're probably too young to know about the detergent called 'Lux Flakes'.  That detergent was probably off the market when you came into being, but anyway, this detergent was in very large, white flakes.  And this is what the snow looked like, and this is what we thought was happening, that someone was on the roof just pouring Lux Flakes off the roof.  And the teachers told us, no, that's snow.  And so, it was such an occasion that they let school out so that we could go out in the snow and experience that happening.
Story_ID: 29273
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, you mentioned that you graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas] named for a great African American writer [the first African American poet and the first African American, the first slave, and third woman to publish a book of poems in the United States].  Was that a school for students in the African American community?  Was it a segregated system or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  Houston [Texas], at that time, or all of Texas at that time was separate but equal education.  We had all--, they had no integration of the school at that time of year, at that time in Houston.
Speaker 1: Now, was it, in fact, equal?  Were there nice facilities for the African American students?
Speaker 2: No way.  No way.  It was not equal at all.  It was equal in name only, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the disparities were obvious?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And what, for example, did you notice was different--?
Speaker 2: Well, the facilities that we had.  For our schools, we had, well, one example is swimming pool.  Our schools didn't have any swimming pool at all.  We had no swim team because there was no--, the money wasn't there for it.  And even the parks that we had, we had to play in, there were no swimming pools in the park.  So consequently, most of the kids never learned to swim because we didn't have that facility available, whereas in the white schools, they had swim teams, and they had beautiful swimming pools and parks and what not for them to enjoy.  But we didn't have those facilities.  And we were also, the books and what not that we had were inferior to that of the whites.
Speaker 1: So how was that segregated system maintained?  Was that because the residential areas were segregated or were people bussed to keep the students separate in the schoolhouses?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any buses during those days.  We had to walk to school. Either walked to the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So students walked to segregated--?
Speaker 2: And the neighborhoods themselves were segregated, in large part.  The neighborhood that we lived in, there were no whites living in our neighborhood.  There was all blacks in that part of our town, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, there were, at least some parts of Ohio, in Cleveland, there was a movement as early as the 1930s to try to desegregate the schools, through the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Was there anything like that in Houston that you can recall?
Speaker 2: No, the only, the only movement to desegregate the schools that I can recall was when I came home from the service--I was in World War II, and when I came home from, when I was discharged in 1946, I was applying to, I wanted to go to college.  And I wanted to get an engineering degree.  And at that time, there was no black schools in the State of Texas that offered any engineering degrees for blacks.  The only schools were the white schools that had the engineering degree.  Well, at that time, in 1946, there was a student, I'm trying to think of his name right now.  It didn't come to me.  My memory is failing a little bit, but he applied to the University of Texas [Austin, Texas] to go into law school.  And his application was denied because he was black.  And then he brought suit against the State of Texas, and I'm trying to think of the, I know his name, but I just can't think of it.  But anyway, he brought suit against the State of Texas to allow him to enroll.  And the State of Texas said, no, that what we will do is set up, because of our separate but equal rule, we will set up a law school for you to attend.  And what they did, they set up a law school in one of our high schools with maybe about two or three rooms and maybe a couple of professors, and they considered that a separate, but equal education for him, and to get around the law, that's what they did.  But as you know now, things are quite different in the state, but back in those days, back in '46 [1946], I was not able to attend either the University of Texas or Texas A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, College Station, Texas] or any of those schools that was offering an engineering degree.
Speaker 1: Now, was that the Sweatt case [Sweatt vs Painter, 1950], the lawsuit--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's his name [Heman Marion Sweatt].
Speaker 1: All right, Sweatt.
Speaker 2: The Sweatt case, right.  I should have known that.
Speaker 1: No, that's fine. Deep in the heart of Texas, and it was hot. It was easy to make the connection.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter), and this was the Sweatt case.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 29274
Speaker 1: But before we leave the subject of your schooling, I did want to ask about your teachers in elementary school before, and if there were any of the teachers who were especially memorable or who encouraged you to go on to high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas, named after the first African American poet and the first African American, the first slave, and third woman to publish a book of poems in the United States ] or either high school teachers who encouraged you to pursue post-secondary education?  Any names that you'd like to mention for the record?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, there were several teachers that, I know one teacher in particular, was my math teacher, was Mr. Banks.  And Mr. Banks was a pusher, and he recognized that he had, we had maybe, I was friends with about three other students.  And we sort of ran together and we were competing with each other to see who could get the best grades.  And Mr. Banks realized this, and he was the one who kind of encouraged the competition.  And he was my algebra and geometry teacher and because of that, that's how I did very well in math because of Mr. Banks and the way that he sort of pushed me into being a better student.
Speaker 1: Now, you said the--, I know the student body was segregated at the high school level.  Was the faculty also segregated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At Phillis Wheatley (High School)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, we had all black teachers, yes.  And I think that--, I feel that we, even though our school was segregated and we didn't have the facilities that the white school had, we did have the teachers who were really interested in us being successful and getting a good education.  And the teachers were the ones that, I think, were responsible for the fact that we did get a very good education in spite of the hardships that we suffered due to segregation.
Story_ID: 29275
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, may I ask about your final years in high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].  I know with the war in Europe in the 1930s, well, in Africa, Ethiopia, sort of the mid-1930s, but with '39 [1939] in Poland and all that's happening there, as you were preparing to graduate from high school, did you have a sense that war was on the horizon and maybe the young men at your high school would be caught up in that?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't, we didn't, not in high school, we didn't feel that sense of being caught up in the war.  But when I went on to college, and when I graduated from high school, I enrolled in Prairie View [Agricultural and Mechanical] College [Prairie View, Texas] which was also a separate but equal school.  But Prairie View didn't have all the facilities that the other school had.  But when we, when I enrolled at Prairie View, that's when, that was in '41 [1941], 1941 and, of course, that's when Pearl Harbor occurred.  And there we felt the sense of being caught up in the war and in the draft, and at that time, Prairie View had an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program.  And the ROTC officers there at Prairie View told us that if we would join the unlisted reserve, then we would be able to avoid the draft and would be able to finish our education and not, and we would only be eligible for the draft after we graduated.  So we did.  We joined the enlisted reserve there at Prairie View.  And about a year after we joined the enlisted reserve, the reserves were activated.  And so we were in the [U.S.] Army.  Without being drafted, we were in the Army.  And the only good thing about that was, though, that they offered us the option of either going directly into the service or if we took an I.Q. test and if we passed the I.Q. test, then we would have our choice of enlisting in the Army specialized training program which was, at that time, a program where they sent the soldiers to various universities to study either medicine, dentistry or engineering, and I think history was also part of that curriculum.
Story_ID: 29276
Speaker 1: All right, Mr. Dorsey, you were talking about your experiences in World War II as a member of the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Did you wanna continue that story now?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't in the ROTC, but this was the ASTP.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what does that stand for?
Speaker 2: [U.S.] Army Specialized Training Program.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we, when we were activated, they said, we were given the option of either going into the ASTP, which is the Army Specialized Training Program or the [U.S.] Navy V-12 Program.  And I was, I did pass the IQ test and did qualify for my choice of either one of those two programs.  So my choice was the Army rather than the Navy because at that time, I didn't know how to swim.  And I didn't particularly want to (laughter) take my chances in the Navy, not knowing how to swim and plus the fact that I suffered from motion sickness too.  And being on a ship is not one of my favorite, way to go.  So I went, I, I opted for the Army Specialized Training Program.  And in the Army Specialized Training Program, we first had to complete, like three months of basic Army training.  And we did that at a camp in Texas, Camp Maxey in Texas, real hot in the summer.  This was in the summertime.  And after basic training, basic Army training, they sent us to Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  And at that time, I elected to enroll in the engineering curriculum since that was my choice.  And at Howard, we spent, oh, about six months in the Army Specialized Training Program, and at the end of that six months, they decided that they were gonna disband that program and they were not going to continue it because the plan was for us to complete four years of education and get an engineering degree.  But things happened in the, on the battlefield that interrupted those plans, like the Battle of the Bulge where the Americans were having the difficulty with the Germans in that part, and they needed more people to fight the battle.  So they decided that, to disband the STP program and sent us back into the service.  We were then sent to join the 92nd Division, and the 92nd Division was on maneuvers down in Louisiana at that time.  And we went to Howard say in the fall of 1943.  And the six months took us into the, into the spring of 1944.  And when we joined the 92nd Division in the spring of 1944, they ended their maneuvers and then were shipped back to Fort Huachuca which was their base.  And it was, in that shipment going back from the maneuvers in Louisiana that I met my father in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], but we went back to Fort Huachuca.  And at Fort Huachuca, we--I spent maybe about a couple of months and then I was transferred from the 92nd Division.  At that time, the 92nd Division was preparing to go overseas and fight in Italy.  So I left the 92nd Division just before they were shipped out to Italy, to join the war there.  And I was transferred to a combat engineering battalion which was just forming in Columbia, South Carolina at Fort Jackson.  And when I arrived at Fort Jackson, they assigned me, this new battalion, I was assigned to the Water Purification Unit and the Water Purification Unit was responsible for providing water for the troops.  And this was knowing how to treat the water when we moved into an area where there was no sanitary water.  We had to use chemicals and bags and what not to store the water, to supply the troops.  So I was sent to water purification school to become a water purification specialist.  And so at Fort Jackson, after Fort Jackson, then I was transferred to, we were assigned to join the campaign in Europe.  We were given orders to ship out in December from New York Harbor to ship over to England and join the Army that was having problems in France.
Story_ID: 29277
Speaker 1: And, Mr. Dorsey, when were you discharged from the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: I was discharged in '46, 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were still in the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor--not Pearl Harbor, Pearl Harbor started this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but Hiroshima and Nagasaki [Japan, where the atom bombs were dropped]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, when the war ended, when the war ended in Europe, our unit was in Nuremberg, Germany.  And we were given orders to go to the Pacific because most of the soldiers who had been in the Army for a while, when the war ended in Europe, they were sent back to the United States and were discharged from the Army.  But the war was still going on at that time in the Pacific.  And so those that didn't have enough service time to qualify to get shipped back to--or to be discharged, we were sent to the Philippines.  We were shipped from Nuremberg, Germany on a tube train to Marseille, France, and then we boarded a boat in Marseille, France and sailed from Marseille, headed for the Philippine Islands.  And by the time we were about maybe 300 miles off the coast of Hawaii, that's when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and the Japanese surrendered.  But our ship was still, had orders to go to the Philippines, and so there we went.  We went to the Philippines.  So we shipped from Marseille, France in July, and we arrived in the Philippines, in Manila, in September.  So we were on that boat, say like, forty-five days.  And we only got off the boat one day, and that day was the day we, the boat was processed through the Panama Canal.  They let us off the boat before the boat went in, through the canal, and we spent the night in the base there at Panama.  And then the next morning, we boarded the boat again and we were on our way to the Philippines.  That was forty-five days of motion sickness that I suffered (laughter), for forty-five days.
Speaker 1: But you survived.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I lost a lot of weight (laughter), couldn't eat, get the dry heaves and it was a miserable trip.
Story_ID: 29278
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. Dorsey, may I ask about the time that you spent in Europe because I understand just from reading some of the histories of World War II that there were some limited efforts to integrate the ground forces as the allies tried to secure victory over Germany.  Did you notice any progress in the area of race relations in the [U.S.] Army during World War II?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't see any of that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --limited integration?
Speaker 2: No, no, we saw a lot of segregation, but not much integration.
Speaker 1: Now, was that separate but equal within the Army?
Speaker 2: Separate but equal in the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just in the separateness, there was--
Speaker 2: There was separate--
Speaker 1: --true equality?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Separate but quasi equal (laughter), nothing equal about it.
Speaker 1: Any hard evidence of real inequality?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, there was friction between the two groups, quite a bit of friction between the two groups because of that.  You know, we were fighting each other rather than fighting the enemy.
Speaker 1: You mean black and white soldiers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, black and white soldiers, yes.  In many cases, there were fights among the black and white soldiers instead of concentrating on the enemy (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how were those difficulties dealt with?
Speaker 2: Well, you just had to do what you had to do.  It was something that, it wasn't very pleasant, but you had to survive in whichever way you could.
Story_ID: 29279
Speaker 1: All right, so, Mr. Dorsey, the war [World War II] is ending officially in September, 1945.  We've had almost sixty years now to reflect on the history of World War II, and its place in U.S.--
Speaker 2: That was in Europe.
Speaker 1: Pardon.
Speaker 2: That was in Europe.  It ended in Europe--
Speaker 1: In May.
Speaker 2: --in May '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Yes, and then in the Pacific, with the Japanese surrender.
Speaker 2: That's right, in September, they were signing the treaty--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --in '45 [1945].  That's when we arrived in Manila [Philippines]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when they were signing, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, can we talk for a little bit about your homecoming.  When you're discharged, you go home to Texas?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there relatives waiting there for you or friends--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --expecting you?
Speaker 2: --yes, my mother [Rita Allen] had a surprise for me when I arrived home in my--I had a sister (laughter).  My half sister was born in February when I was discharged.  And the whole while that I was away, I never knew that she was pregnant or that she was having a child.  So that was quite a surprise to me when I arrived home.  And up until that time, I was the only child in the family.  So I never really did get to know my half sister because after I was discharged, I only spent maybe about three months at home.  And those three months were spent looking for a college to attend.  And that is when the 'Sweatt' [Sweatt vs Painter] case came up, and that is when I was applying to various schools because of the small bit of engineering training that I had while I was in the [U.S.] Army, I still wanted to pursue an engineering degree.  So I was applying to the engineering schools in Texas to no avail.  And then I applied to schools outside of Texas, the schools in the Big 10 and in the Pack 10 and various other schools like MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] and Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana] and Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and what not.  I applied to all those schools.  And at first none of them accepted me.  I got no acceptance from any of them.  So after about a couple of months I decided that, really when I was in the service, I was listening to the football games being broadcast to the troops over the Armed Forces Network.  And they broadcasted a lot of Ohio State [University] football games.  So I kind of fell in love with Ohio State as a result of listening to those football games.  And so I thought that Ohio State would be a great place for me to attend and try to make the football team.  So I got a refusal from Ohio State.  They sent me--the first letter I sent to 'em, they did say that they could not accept me because at that time, the GI Bill was in force and most of the veterans who were being--a lot of the veterans who were being discharged were taking advantage of the GI Bill and going back to school.  And so the schools were crowded.  So Ohio State said that they were giving preference to their own state veterans, and so they could not accept me.  That was the first letter that I received from 'em.  And so then I said, well, let me give it another shot.  I'm gonna write a personal letter to the registrar.  And I did.  I wrote a personal letter to the registrar and explained to him that I was a veteran returning from the [military] Service and was very interested in an engineering degree or a career in engineering.  And because of the situation in Texas, where we have--there's no engineering school that I was eligible to attend because of the separate but equal rule, that I was being denied this opportunity.  And I also added to my letter the fact that I was a football player, and that I would love to--and that how much I had admired Ohio State because of my listening to them on the Armed Forces radio and that it would be great for me to have the opportunity to play football for Ohio State.  So I sent that letter off, and after a month, I didn't get any answer from them.  And after that, it was getting late in the summer, and so it was about time for, to enroll in school in the fall.  So I decided that, well, maybe I'd better go on back to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] and enroll in Howard.  And I knew they'd do my engineering degree there because Howard did have an engineering school.  So I did.  I enrolled at Howard for the fall term, and even went out for the football team and made the football team at Howard and played the first game with them.  We were, those were the road trips.  We went to Bluefield to play Bluefield [State College, Bluefield, West Virginia].  And when we came back from the Bluefield trip, there was a card in my mailbox from Ohio State saying that I had been accepted.  And the card had been delivered to my address in Houston, and my mother had had the card, and my mother just didn't send it to me.  She kept it, and she didn't want me to transfer from Howard to Ohio State because my mother was raised under this segregated society, and she just felt that she didn't want me to attend the white school because she felt that I might suffer some mistreatment as a result.  So she kept the card.  I mean she--I guess waited and it was her plan probably that it would be too late for me to transfer.  So she finally did send it, and I never did find out, never did ask her whether she did that on purpose or not.  But anyway, the card came to me about--I had about two weeks to report to Ohio State when the card came.  And so I, I was very happy to see that.  And so my--the commander of the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Howard, since he knew us--he knew me as a result of me attending Howard in the ASTP [U.S. Army Specialized Training Program].  And so I contacted him and asked him for help in getting me transferred because I had already enrolled at Howard.  And with the Army regulations and what not, getting a transfer would have meant that I would have had to go down to the headquarters down at the White House (laughter) and try to pull some strings.  But my, the Commanding Officer of the ROTC, he helped me get my transfer expedited that I could get to Ohio State.  So, I was able to make that transfer, and that's how I landed at Ohio State.
Story_ID: 29280
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Mr. Dorsey, if you don't mind, I'd just like to back track a little bit because now with this transfer to Ohio State  [University, Columbus, Ohio], it sounds like that's gonna be your first educational experience, in a formal way--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --outside of the South.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So can we go back down South for just a few minutes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because, to Houston, Texas.  You mentioned that your mother [Rita Allen] was a single mom, single parent of an only child and working full time to support the family.  But you were very studious and came straight home, did your homework (laughter).  Was there anyone else supervising that?  Did you have an extended family involved in your early educational experiences or how did that work?
Speaker 2: Well, as I heard in the background there, that I did have (laughter) another family member who was an adopted family member more or less.  A friend of mine--we grew up together.  It was, he's James Tucker who was, he and I were just like brothers.  And his aunt, she was very well educated, and she was one too that was pushing us to, to be good students.  In fact, the neighborhood that we lived in, there was a group of parents there that they were all very much concerned about us getting a good education.  And it was sort of like, what, as Hillary [Hillary Clinton] says, "It takes a village to raise a kid."  This was our little, small village that we had to raise us.  And this is what motivated us more than anything else to do that.
Speaker 1: So you said, sort of an adopted family member, Mrs. Turner?
Speaker 2: No, her name was not Turner.  Her name was--what was her name?  I know, and again, my memory is--her first name was Ruth, and we called her Aunt Ruth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never did address her by her last name.  We always called her Aunt Ruth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she was the one--
Speaker 1: So your mother is there.  Your Aunt Ruth is there, and other parents you said in the community who also encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my--and my aunt, my Aunt Frances was the other one who took care of me while my mother was at work.  She was not working, but she was the other one that made sure that I kind of stayed on the right track (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, please, what kind of work your mother did while you were in school?
Speaker 2: She was a maid, she was a housemaid.  She did housework for families.
Speaker 1: Was that day work or--
Speaker 2: Day work, day work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she didn't have to stay overnight?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.  Okay, and that was from your elementary years on?
Speaker 2: From the elementary years through the high school years, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and I know you said in high school, there was a special Math teacher who encouraged competition, friendly competition--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --among the students and also pursued--encouraged you to pursue excellence in the classroom.  But I wonder, were you involved in any institutions or organizations outside the school, like the church or the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], any other groups that might have also fostered your love for education?
Speaker 2: We, our church, we did, as part of the church, there was that drive because we did attend Sunday school quite a bit, and from the Sunday school classes, which kind of meshed in with our elementary school and high school classes too, yes.
Speaker 1: And what church was that, that the family attended?
Speaker 2: It was a Methodist, African Methodist Church, AME church.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the name?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember the name right now.  Well, I did attend two churches.  At one time, I was a--at first it was a Baptist church, and that was the church that my mother belonged to.  But then my friend, my friend, James Tucker, he belonged to the Methodist church.  So I kind of switched off and so that we could go together.  He didn't go to the Baptist church.  And so I kind of changed and went to the Methodist church with him, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this Mr. Tucker, was that his mother who you say was also very supportive?
Speaker 2: Well, his mother had--
Speaker 1: It's the same group.
Speaker 2: --his mother died when he was young, and his grandmother raised him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: But part of that supportive network--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --within the community.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29281
Speaker 1: And so, again, we get to the high school years.  And then, as you said before, World War II interrupts your plans for, immediate post-secondary education, but eventually you enroll at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], which I supposed is technically still in the South.  Would you consider that a Southern education experience?
Speaker 2: It's very much on the border (laughter) of being a Southern, Southern education.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to trace that route from the South to the North.  Now, how about these experiences in Ohio [State University, Columbus, Ohio] as a Buckeye?  And were those pleasant experiences at Ohio State University for the most part?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I had a great time at Ohio State, especially as a member of the football team and also as a member of my class, my engineering classes because being a football player, I was the only football player in engineering school.  I was sort of held up as a star.  I wasn't that big a star as far as the football player is concerned, but they viewed me as being a star.  And even the professors in my engineering class were very kind to me, and I had, I had really no difficulty at all with my education.  And, in fact, the engineering honorary fraternity which, the Tau Beta Pi, engineering honorary--not Tau Beta Pi--yeah, it was Tau Beta Pi.  I was thinking of Phi Beta Kappa, but, no, Phi Beta Kappa is the education's honorary fraternity.  But Tau Beta Pi was the engineering honorary fraternity.  And I was the first black that Ohio State had admitted to that honorary fraternity.  And also my engineering discipline was mechanical engineering.  There was an honorary fraternity in mechanical engineering school which is the Pi Tau Sigma, and I was also the first black to be accepted into that honorary fraternity.
Story_ID: 29282
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, we were talking about your experiences at Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio], your first formal education outside of the South.  And you said at the end of the last tape that pretty much those experiences were positive?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pretty much in the classroom, the experiences were positive.  There were some experiences outside the classroom that were not because there was still, even in Columbus [Ohio] at that time, there were still some areas where there was pockets of segregation very similar to what I experienced in the South.  Like the restaurants and the theaters, they were still, there were still vestiges of segregation there.  And there were times when we traveled to some, when the football team traveled to some cities outside of Columbus to play where the black players were not accepted, say in the dining areas.  They were segregated in that respect.  And most of the time though our coaches were not--did not abide by that.  They fought that situation.  But when we were out on our own, then that's when we did have those experiences.
Speaker 1: And, Mr. Dorsey, can you remind us again of what years you were at Ohio State University?
Speaker 2: I enrolled at Ohio State in the fall of 1946, and I graduated in June of 1949, yes.
Story_ID: 29283
Speaker 1: All right, now, I know that you married young.  Did you meet your wife at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] also?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, I met my wife when we--when I first got to Ohio State, there was a bus strike.  And since there was no facilities for me to live on campus, I had to live off campus.  I had to get accommodations with a private family off campus.  And in order to get to the campus--, this private family lived quite a ways from the campus.  We had to use public transportation, the buses, to get to the, get back to the campus for classes.  Well, the first week that I was at Ohio State, they had this bus strike.  And so the only way that I was able to get to campus was to hitchhike.  And so one day while I was standing on the corner, trying to thumb a ride to the campus, there were a group of girls who came up--I had been out there for about an hour or so trying to get a ride.  And this group of girls, there were about three or four of them, came up on the same corner that I was at.  And as soon as they arrived, a car stopped to pick 'em up.  And I guess they looked at me and they felt kind of sorry for me, and they asked the driver if the driver would pick me up too.  So the driver did pick me up.  And one of the young ladies in that group was my wife.  And that was my first encounter with her.  So later on, we did start dating.  So my wife was a pick-up (laughter), as a hitchhiker (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And what's your wife's name again, please?
Speaker 2: Her name is Helena.
Speaker 1: And she was also a student at Ohio State.
Speaker 2: She was also a student at Ohio State at that time, and she was also living off campus also and needed to get to class and needed that transportation.
Speaker 1: So now, why are you off campus?  Is this because of the post-war [World War II] overcrowding again?
Speaker 2: Because there were no facilities.  The, because of the overcrowding, because of the number GIs returning and that the university just didn't plan for this.  They didn't plan for this tremendous increase in the student population.  In fact, they really couldn't have planned to build a facility that fast.  So the dormitories that were men dormitories on the campus were assigned to the women, were taken from the men and assigned to the women because they felt that the women needed to be on campus more so than the men did.  So that is the reason for us living off campus is they just didn't have the facilities there to accommodate us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so again, both you and your wife are enrolled at Ohio State in the 1940s, and moving toward graduation.  Now, do you both graduate--
Speaker 2: Yes, we both graduated--
Speaker 1: --at the same time?
Speaker 2: We graduated, she graduated ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Oh, did she?
Speaker 2: She holds that against me.  Yeah, she brags about that.  She, she beat me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, was she also in engineering?
Speaker 2: No, she was in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why she beat me because education came before engineering when we received our diplomas, when we marched up to receive our diplomas.  The Education College preceded the Engineering College so she, she got her degree before I got mine, but we both graduated in the same year, in the same graduating class, yeah.
Story_ID: 29284
Speaker 1: Did you both [Dorsey and his wife, Helena Harris] decide at that point that you wanted to remain in Ohio or did you live and work in other areas?
Speaker 2: I decided that since she was from Ohio, and we had been courting for about a year or so, and we had decided that--we became engaged before we graduated and decided that we were gonna get married.  And that's the reason we stayed in Ohio--that I--I didn't really stay in Ohio after we graduated.  After we graduated, I took a job with GE [General Electric] in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  That was my first job after I graduated.
Speaker 1: So you stayed in the Midwest, but not in Ohio.
Speaker 2: I stayed in the Midwest for three months, yeah, at--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was that three-month assignment that I had on my first job.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, General Electric, were they pretty progressive in the post-war [World War II] period about hiring minorities or how did-
Speaker 2: Well, GE did, GE took, at that--at the time that I graduated in, when there were interviews for graduation, I only had two interviews whereas the other white students were having at least maybe about ten or twelve interviews, companies that interviewed them for jobs.  And when I graduated, I only had two interviews.  One was with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and the other one was with GE.  And GE at that time had established, had set up a program to increase minority engineering graduates, and their program was designed to say maybe get about a 10 percent increase in minority engineers graduating in the next ten years or so.  So GE took, was taking aggressive action to hire minority engineers.  However, though, I think it, the thing that probably influenced or made it possible for me to get the job was that in the interview, with the representative from GE that I went in to talk to, he was a football nut.  And the whole interview, we talked nothing but football.  And when I left that interview, I said, I don't know whether I gotta a job or not.  This guy didn't explain anything to me about GE or what (laughter), what kind of people they wanted to hire or anything about the job.  And so I left that interview, I was very disappointed and didn't think that I'd ever hear from GE again.  And sure enough, about two weeks later, the offer came from GE, and I had the offer from GE and also from the Air Force Academy.  So I had the two job offers there.  So I elected to go with GE when GE was--because GE was mostly engineering and Wright-Patterson [Air Force Base] was mostly just, sort of a maintenance type activity rather than creative engineering.  So I think that, I guess the thing that--well, I graduated with better than a 3.0 grade point average, and I had a pretty good record.  And the interviewer didn't question me at all about any of that stuff (laughter).  So I think that he was, he probably was more enamored with the fact that I was a football player than he was that I was an engineer (laughter) or a good engineering prospect.  But anyway, I said, so be it.  That's more power.
Story_ID: 29285
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Dorsey, you had talked just briefly about your first assignment after graduation [from Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] with General Electric [GE], and you said that was in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you say it was for about three months?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, what the test engineering program was at GE, was that the newly-hired engineers were given three-month assignments in different areas of GE.  GE was involved with making numerous products from small motors for refrigerators to these huge motors that powered the steam turbines that produced the electricity for electrical plants.  So GEs idea was that, this one-year program or three-month assignment was kind of like a probationary period where GE would, had a chance to look at me to see if I was a right fit for the company and one that they wanted to invest additional money in and also for me to get a feel for whether or not GE was a good fit for me, whether the products that they were involved with were ones that I would be interested in.  So you would take these three-months assignment for a year's, for a year's time, and then at the end of the year, then there was an evaluation period to evaluate how you performed on those three-months assignment.  And then an offer would be coming or maybe they would suggest that you may take another year or probationary assignment.  So the three-months' assignment was at the Fort Wayne [Indiana] plant, and the Fort Wayne plant at that time was making refrigerators.  And they were--, my assignment was to test them, some small motors, the small motors that were used in the refrigerators.  And then after that three-month assignment was up, then I took another three-month assignment in Schenectady [New York], in the Schenectady plant.
Speaker 1: And that's New York, right?
Speaker 2: That's Schenectady, New York, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was in the dead of winter in Schenectady, and I don't know whether you're familiar with (laughter)--
Speaker 1: New York winters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the New York winter is like Buffalo [New York] and Schenectady is very much like Buffalo as far as snow is concerned.  So that was, let's see, from July to October, I was in Fort Wayne, and then from October to May, I was in Schenectady because I took two, three-month assignments in Schenectady.  So I spent six months in Schenectady and most of it during the winter.  And that was quite a trip because we [Dorsey and his wife, Helena Harris] had just gotten married.  We, we got married in October, and that's when we left for Schenectady.  We got married October 15th, and our honeymoon was spent going from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Schenectady to this new job.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, was your wife also teaching at that time or--
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she wasn't teaching at that time.  And, in fact, not soon after that, she--our first child was conceived in Schenectady, and so she wasn't able to start teaching as a result of that.  And so from Schenectady after the six months was up in Schenectady, we moved to Boston [Massachusetts] and I took a three-month assignment at GE's, GE's plant that was in Lynn, Massachusetts which is right outside of Boston.  And so I spent about six months there also.  And that's where our first child was born, in Boston.
Speaker 1: Now, how many children do you have now?
Speaker 2: We have three children.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Three daughters.
Speaker 1: All right, and this first daughter who was born in Boston, what's her name?
Speaker 2: The first daughter is Jocelyn who was born in Boston in October of 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29286
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, you mentioned that your decision to take the assignment with GE [General Electric] was influenced by the fact that you thought might be able to be creative on the job.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So can you just help me to understand what is it that mechanical engineers do that allows for this creativity to enter into the whole process?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--the creativity that enters into it is the, the solving of problems that are associated with the mechanical parts because in any machinery that you have, there are problems that will arise.  You know, you have an automobile, and you know your automobile doesn't, it doesn't perform as it should always.  There's some problems that creep up.  Well, the creativity comes in and how do we go about researching, say the cause of those problems, and what do we do to fix 'em?  And also, the creativity comes in the design and the improvements of the parts because as you see that the automobile, say went from a Model-T Ford to now we have these big SUVs [sport utility vehicle] that we have.  And so the creativity comes in and how do you start from this humble Model-T and arrive at something like the Escalade [Cadillac SUV] or the Expedition [Ford SUV]?  So that's where the creativity comes in and all the conveniences that are associated with the controls, how you control things, the air conditioning and all of these things are a result of some creative efforts that an engineer has come up with.
Story_ID: 29287
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, you were explaining just before my last question that you're in Boston [Massachusetts] for a time now or in the greater Boston area and newly married, and now a parent, in addition to being a husband.  And it's the 1950s.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you're part of this growing body of minority engineers now working for GE [General Electric].  Did you have a sense at that point in your life that you were a part of history or making history, that the 1950s would be as revolutionary as they turned out to be as far as [American] Civil Rights and opening up new doors of opportunity, as far as those things are concerned?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't say that I really did feel as though I was part of that Movement [American Civil Rights Movement].  But I would, I could maybe just say that I got swept up in the flow of things.  I was never one to be very active in the Movement, so to speak.  I was sort of, I guess as my daughter would say (laughter), too calm about it.  My favorite saying is that, "You change the things you can change, but you accept those that you can't."  And that was basically my philosophy that, if I couldn't change the status quo--I didn't really work too hard in trying to change it.
Speaker 1: Were you aware, at least--well, you did mention the fact that there was this initiative to hire more--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --black engineers, so you're recognizing that the doors are opening--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for various reasons, okay, in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 29288
Speaker 1: Now, how long did you stay in Boston [Massachusetts] with GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: We were there just a little over a year.
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: And then we transferred to Cincinnati [Ohio] to the plant here in Cincinnati.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Though it's really not in Cincinnati.  It's in a place called Evendale, but it's in the suburb of Cincinnati.  It's right down the road a piece (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. (Laughter) Now, Mr. Dorsey--and again, that's, is that 1952 at that point, when you're coming back to Ohio?
Speaker 2: 1951.
Speaker 1: '51 [1951], okay, and still in Greater Cincinnati at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are you still on probation?  Are they still watching you or has GE committed now to keeping you as a member of their team?
Speaker 2: At that time, I was off probation.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Let's see I went off probation in Boston, in the Boston area, and I was considered a full-time engineer at that time.  And, in fact, at that time, GE was just getting into the jet engine business, making jet engines for airplanes.  They weren't in that business before.  And so they were just starting that business, and so they needed people to continue to propel the business.  And they didn't have the space or the area to expand the business in Lynn [Massachusetts].  So they bought this--Curtis Wright was in this building that we're in now.  And so they bought this--Curtis Wright was making airplanes, propeller engines at that time for the airplanes.  So they bought that building, and so they moved the headquarters for the jet engine business from Lynn to Evendale.  And most of the people who were working in the business at that time were Bostonians, were dyed-in-the-wool New Englanders, and they did not want to transfer from Boston to the Wild Wild West out here.  They had all kinds of wild tales about Indians roaming the planes here in Ohio at that time and that they (laughter) were afraid for their life, and they didn't wanna, they didn't wanna transfer.  So many of them didn't wanna transfer, but when they asked me if I wanted to go, I said, sure.  I know the area (laughter).  I'll be glad to go back to Ohio.  And so I, that's how I was able to get--it wasn't enabling me to get off probation, but that was the time that my probationary period ended at that time because I accepted the transfer to the plant here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Mr. Dorsey, at that point in time, did you have a sense that you were gonna put down some permanent roots here in Ohio, that that was gonna be perhaps one of the last transfers in your career as an engineer or did you know at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was all for putting down roots in Ohio because of my prior experience in school at Ohio and also because my wife's home in Ohio.  We were much closer to her home than we were back in Lynn.  Lynn was a pretty long ways from Ohio, and her family was here.  So it made good sense for us to settle here if we could, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you find that you enjoyed, in working in the Greater Cincinnati area with GE, still the same opportunities to be creative on the job and to advance at GE?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We still had--it was a time when the business was really growing, and it was growing fast because there was new development.  Just about every year, there was something new coming out, and it wasn't as we had one product that was gonna stay the same for year after year after year.  But there was almost a new concept or a new process just about every three or four years.
Speaker 1: Now, are you still in aeronautics at that point--
Speaker 2: We were still in--
Speaker 1: --in that area?
Speaker 2: We were still in, building jet engines, yes--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --for airplanes, for the airplanes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And eventually, the engines were adapted for ship propulsion and also for locomotives, so it was a very versatile concept that we had.  And that is the area where the creativity comes in as to how we were applying it to all these different areas, yeah.
Speaker 1: I believe you mentioned at some point earlier in our discussion that eventually GE is gonna be involved in creating the kind of technology that will fuel the Space Program.  Is that happening in the 50s [1950s] or is it more associated, more closely associated with the 1960s.
Speaker 2: That's gonna fuel the--
Speaker 1: The Space Program?  Where are they right now in the history of--I'm thinking the history of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  Is GE gonna be major player in helping to launch--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that kind of program?  No.
Speaker 2: No, they're not.  I think GE is more concerned with transportation right now, building the engines for the big airlines.  I don't know whether you've, you saw where Airbus came up with this A-380 which is supposed to carry like 555 passengers--
Speaker 1: And this is the 1950s.
Speaker 2: 1950, no, this is 19--this is 2005.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  I missed that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm getting quite an education in science and technology.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is 2005.  Yeah, well, GE is right now is concentrating on the, aircraft engine business is concentrating mainly on the airline transportation and also military transportation.  They've build the jet engines for most of the military planes too, the fighters, the bombers and the transport and the C-5A transports, the helicopters that are fighting over in Iraq.  They build engines for those too.
Speaker 1: In the twenty-first century?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 29289
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Dorsey, you were telling us about your transfer to Greater Cincinnati [Ohio] to continue your work with GE [General Electric], now as a full-time permanent employee, no longer on probation and suggested also that GE was focusing on--or at least your work with them, focusing on the building of engines for jet planes?
Speaker 2: (No audible response, nodding, yes.)
Speaker 1: Now, what's driving that?  Is that mostly for commercial purposes or for the [U.S.] Post Office or what exactly is the incentive for them to focus so much energy.
Speaker 2: On--
Speaker 1: On those engines?
Speaker 2: --those engines?
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s].  Well, they started out in the beginning as military applications.  They were primarily being developed for fighter planes, for bombers, for transport planes, and helicopters and also for submarine, from [U.S.] Marine applications.  That was the beginning of the jet engine, the application for the jet engine.  And then after the war [World War II] ended, which World War II, then they began to focus more on more commercial applications for the--because at that time, the engines that were on the commercial planes were propeller-driven engines which GE was not making.  GE was only making the jet engines.  And so they began going into the commercial end of the business, and then the commercial end of the business just seemed to explode when we started with the 707 and the 747 and the, now, it's the 777 and all those sevens, which are Boeing airplanes, but with the commercial aircraft engine business taking off, then GE started to get deep, more deeply into that.  GE is involved in a lot of other things other than jet engines, but it's just the plant that I worked at, our main focus was on the jet engines--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the different applications for the jet engines.  And there were many applications for it.
Story_ID: 29290
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. Dorsey, I'd to ask quickly, with the rapidly changing world of technology, as an engineer, is that a career where you're constantly engaged in continuing education or how do you stay abreast of all these changes in the field?
Speaker 2: Well, the continuing education is really on-the-job experience.  There's not too many engineers going back to the world of academia for their education.  They're really learning on the job, and those, that learning experience comes from the creativity they develop in solving problems, you know, because their work is dealing mainly with solving problems.  And the problems usually are those of either greater fuel economy or either ease of maintaining the vehicle and in that--that is the area there the creativity is applied.  And you don't really get that in the classroom.  You get that just through experience and being in the field and working with those problems.
Speaker 1: So were you pretty much employed as part--a member of a team or how did these creative projects come about?
Speaker 2: The--, we do form teams to work on 'em, yes.  We, and the teams are called projects.  And (chuckle), the projects are given names and numbers.  And you have the managerial structure and you've got people working on different aspects of the problem, yeah.
Story_ID: 29291
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, you said you were with GE [General Electric] for over thirty-eight years?
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight years, over thirty-eight years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About thirty-eight and a half.
Speaker 1: Is there any phase of your career with GE that you're especially proud of, any product or any project that you worked on that you're especially proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I was really proud of the last job that I did with GE, and that was when we started what is called the Office Automation which was the introduction of computers and word processors and that into the work place because before that we just had the desktop calculators and the pencil and paper that was creating all the documents that we had to create because with the new applications, the documentation became much more critical.  And also the volume of documentation that grew fantastically, and it just grew to a point where we just couldn't handle it with the old paper and pencil method.  So when the computers came in, word processors came in and what not, and the personal computer, the desktop computers came in, this was really the big breakthrough in us being able to do things in a more efficient and more creative way.  And part of my activity before I retired was the introduction and the application and the support of that system of the equipment and the work and the personnel that was necessary for, to operate that equipment.  So I was--and, you know, that was sort of outside of my field of training because my field of training was mostly mechanical, and, but now, we get into this business of information systems processing, which is an altogether different field.  And all of that was really just learned on the job.  We didn't go back--we went, we took some classes, but the classes that we took were mostly to familiarize ourselves with the software more than anything else.  But the techniques and the organization and the gathering and the storage and all that was just an on-the-job creation, yeah.
Story_ID: 29292
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds to me that you had some wonderful years with GE [General ELecrtic].  But while you're progressing at that particular corporation, I wanted to ask also about your personal life, 'cause again, I know your wife [Helena Harris] is back home in Ohio with you and at least one daughter is coming here from Boston [Massachusetts].  But since you have three (laughter), the family is also growing as you're growing in your career.  So can you tell me the names of your other two daughters and then I'd like to ask you about your family life here in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Okay, my other two daughters, my oldest daughter, the first born is Jocelyn and she's employed with WSB TV in Atlanta [Georgia], and her job is manager of community relations and public relations-community--I always get her title confused because it has to do with PR, with public relations that she handles for her station manager.  She was for a long time a news anchor.  She anchored the evening news for that station and it's an ABC station.  And in addition, she has a Sunday morning show that she does, kind of a talk show 'People-to-People', I think she calls it.  It comes on around ten o'clock on Sunday mornings where she brings in various public figures, community-type figures and conduct interviews with 'em to try to inform the audience as to what's going on in the community.
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Dorsey, did all of your daughters attend public schools in Cincinnati then?
Speaker 2: Yes, they all attended the public school in Cincinnati.  They attended the elementary school and one of the best high schools here in Cincinnati which is Walnut Hills High School, which is, Walnut Hills is a public school, but it's on the order of a private school.  It's very well recognized in the field of education, and they, Walnut Hills, their grades go from sixth to the twelfth grade.  So it's a unique high school.  It was a high school like my high school in Houston, Texas.  My high school in Houston, Texas went from the sixth grade to the eleventh grade.  But Walnut Hills here in Cincinnati combines both the junior high and the high school together, and most of the graduates from Walnut Hills attend college.  I would say maybe about 80 to 90 percent of the kids who graduate from Walnut Hills go to college, and they kind of specialize in a curriculum for advanced studies and also the college curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, is that in the City of Cincinnati proper or is that a suburb?
Speaker 2: It's in the city, it's in--this is the Cincinnati Public School District.  Yeah, it's a public school.  Yes, it's not a private school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your home was right in the City of Cincinnati at that point?
Speaker 2: Our home was in the City of Cincinnati, yeah.  In fact, it was only about four or five miles away from the school, yes, at the time that they were in school.
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, your three daughters, now, you said Jocelyn's the oldest.
Speaker 2: Jocelyn is the oldest.
Speaker 1: And who's next?
Speaker 2: And Karen is the middle daughter, and she's a veterinarian, and she went to Walnut Hills also.  And she, from Walnut Hills she went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] briefly.  And she also spent her senior year in high school as a foreign-exchange student, an AFS student.  She lived in Norway with a family in Norway for a whole year, and when she came back, she came back speaking Norwegian, and we couldn't understand a thing she was saying (laughter).  So, but she survived that, and after graduating from high school, she did attend Ohio State for a year, but that was the year after returning from Norway.  And she didn't have her head screwed on very straight at that time.  She was still all mixed up with this Norwegian culture.  And so she didn't do too well her first year at Ohio State.  And so we had to postpone the (laughter) education for a while.  And, but she did go back to school.  She went to North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And she graduated from North Carolina A and T and then went to Ohio State's veterinary medicine school and graduated from there, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your baby daughter?
Speaker 2: She also was a Walnut Hills graduate.  And she attended Ohio State, and she majored in industrial design as a graphic designer.  And when she graduated, she took a job with, oh, she took a job with a TV station in Atlanta.  She--her first job was with CNN.  And that's when CNN was just starting in Atlanta.  So she worked at CNN and then from CNN, she worked with another station there in Atlanta as a graphic designer.  I think it was the NBC station in Atlanta.  She worked as graphic designer with them, and then from there she went to Fort Myers, Florida to work with a TV station in Fort Myers.  And then from Fort Myers, she went to Naples [Florida] to work with the, to take a job as a graphic editor for the 'Naples News'.  And she's now living in Naples.  Now, she's been promoted to a new job, and I'm not quite sure what her new job is, but it's not gonna be working with the newspaper.  It's gonna be working with a magazine that the 'Naples News' is gonna be publishing.  And I think she's in line for the publisher of that magazine.  She'll be the publisher of that magazine.
Story_ID: 29293
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, I know you said your daughters attended a high school, Walnut Hills [in Cincinnati, Ohio], that was in many ways like your own high school in that there was a strong curriculum--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in preparing students if they wanted to go that route for post-secondary education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I'm wondering too, since they're coming of age in the 1960s, and maybe graduating '70s [1970s], 1970s, late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: The daughters?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Did you sense that their opportunities as educated African Americans would perhaps be greater than or at least as great as yours had been, you know, in training as an engineer and then finding rewarding employment with GE?
Speaker 2: You mean that their opportunities would be greater than the opportunities that I had when I graduated or--
Speaker 1: Or, yes, and you've done very well with your education, but in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] especially, so much history is being made.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you sense, if you didn't sense it for yourself, you know, that you were part of this great era, did you see that the change was certainly on the horizon for your daughters?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I could see that the changes were there.  And, but I didn't feel that they couldn't cope with the changes at that--I felt that they were well prepared to do that with being--well, what they were.
Speaker 1: And we're--again, since we're focusing on that era, the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], it's a different war now.  It's not the war, the World War II era because folks said that was the last great war in American history.  But now this is a war that's unpopular--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and in a lot of communities, the Vietnam War, very unpopular, especially on college campuses.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your feelings as a veteran, you know, just watching some of that in the 1960s and '70s [1970s], perhaps, the student reaction to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Well, I really didn't have too much feeling along those lines.  I didn't pay that much attention to it that--I have to be frank with you, that I wasn't that concerned about it after what I had gone through.
Story_ID: 29294
Speaker 1: All right, so, again, you said you were with GE [General Electric] for about thirty-eight years.  It's--you're retiring in 1988 or thereabouts?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, at the end of nineteen eighty--my first day of retirement was January 1, 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I worked through 1987, was the end of my term with GE, from 1949 to 1987.
Speaker 1: And you said at the beginning of your work with GE, there was a real push to hire more minorities.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were they successful in doing that, looking back over the thirty-year, thirty-plus years?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were, GE was.  They brought quite a few minority engineers in during that period of time.  In fact, at the GE plant here in Evendale [Ohio], at one time--well, I was the first one, the first engineer at the Evendale plant, black engineer at the Evendale plant.  And after, about a year after I came, then GE brought in a group of like, maybe five black engineers at that plant.  Now, I don't know what they did at other plants around the company in GE.  But I know at the Evendale plant, that was a tremendous increase in what they had before.  Before they only--they didn't have any.  In fact, I was the first black office worker at this--when we transferred here at the Evendale plant, I was the first black working in the office.  The blacks that were employed there at the plant were all working in the factory as what we called "non-exempt employees" rather than exempt employees.  Non-exempt employees were employees who punched a clock.  Exempt employees didn't and they had greater benefits than the non-exempt employees.  And most of the non-exempt employees were members of the union.
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dorsey, is that a difficult position to be in, the "first", the one and only, all eyes on you?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't what I considered difficult.  I really didn't feel the pressure.
Speaker 1: Did you find that there were--
Speaker 2: And I didn't feel the pressure because most of my college experience was that way that--
Speaker 1: You mean integrated racially?
Speaker 2: It was integrated, but in most of my college, I was one of the only ones, one of the only few.  Like in my engineering class, I was one of the only ones.  I think we only had about two blacks in the engineering class and on the football team, the same thing, that we had maybe three or four on it.  So I had been this "only" person for so long, it just didn't faze me anymore.
Speaker 1: Did you find at GE that there were senior engineers who acted as mentors to make it easier for you to get past that probationary period?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I did.  I had several of them who--and these were the white engineers too because there were no other engineer but that.  But I had several that were very helpful to me, and they made it easier for me.
Speaker 1: Any names that you can recall at this point of folks who were especially helpful during those years?
Speaker 2: Here I go again, can't remember names.  There was, one of my managers, Bert Sells and Jack Hope and Ed McMoreland are some of the few names that I can mention.
Speaker 1: And these gentlemen are all here in Greater Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: One of them has passed away, Ed McMoreland has passed away.  Jack Hope is, and Bert Sells passed away too, yeah.
Speaker 1: But they were affiliated with GE in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were affiliated, yeah, they were [coughing]--they were here at the Evendale plant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29295
Speaker 1: Well, I know I asked earlier if there was anything that you're especially proud of and you mentioned the technological innovations associated with computerization of the, the whole creative process and how creativity--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is enhanced now because engineers and other folks at GE [General Electric] have access to computers.  But I wonder if there's anything else that you'd like to add about your work as an engineers and the rewards that you reaped because of that work?
Speaker 2: Well, there was another, which is a computer application again, which I was rather proud of [coughing].  And this had to do with the computer models that we built to try to simulate in the maintenance activities that are required to keep the engines in the airplane flying without too much delay.  And that is that, the engines always, don't always work.  You have problems and the problems usually involved repairs of the engine.  And also, after so many hours of operations, things wear out.  And so the engine has to be disassembled and worn parts replaced, and then it has to be put back together again.  And so that process of what is essentially product support, that process is a very huge part of the business, and also is a part of the business that brings in a lot of money.  And that is the sale of spare parts, the spare parts to keep the engines operating without failure.  And this is where the company makes most of its money on the service and repair of the engine.  It's just like [coughing], just like the automobile.  The automobile companies do the same thing.  If you've ever taken your car in for repair, you know how much it cost you to get it serviced and back to working conditions.  And it's almost like the companies that sell razor blades too or that sell the razors.  Now, they're gonna--what they'll do, they'll give you the razor practically.  Your razor is cheap.  But what they do is they catch you on the blades that they sell.  You try to buy the blades to replace those, you find that you pay a heck of a lot more for the blades than you did for the razor.  And this is where they make their money.  And so in the aircraft engine business, where they make the money is on the repair and maintenance of the engines.  And so there is a need to be able to forecast how much of this is gonna be required.  Whenever we go into a new project, we have to set up a business plan, and in the business plan, a great chunk of it involves the spare parts and servicing of the engine.  So we built a computer model that would utilize the data that we collect from how often things have to be replaced and how many man hours it requires for it to be replaced and what facilities are required to do it.  And so we built a computer model to try to predict what those costs would be.  And we called this, what we're really doing is kind of simulating the cycle that the engine goes through or that the aircraft goes through of flying and landing, and then the problems happening, and then the problems get discovered through inspection.  And then you have to pull the engine and take it into the shop, how long it's gonna be in the shop before it gets back out.  And we collect a lot of statistics on that kind of data, and we put it into a computer model.  And we're able to simulate, say, what--and predict, what the cost is gonna be on spare parts and labor and also the availability of the engine.  And that is the one thing that I was most proud of, the simulation model that we built for that, and the [U.S.] Air Force uses it and the commercial engine people used it also to run their business.
Story_ID: 29296
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, we're coming to the end of the formal part of the interview, but we hope to talk more with you about some of the photos to illustrate those important moments in your life history.  But I wonder if there is anything that you still want to do, that you've not yet done.  And you retired formally from GE [General Electric] in 1988.  Have you worked since that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I have not been able to quit working (laughter).  I quit working for a while after I retired, and that's when my wife [Helena Harris] was still teaching.  So I had the house all to myself (laughter), but then when she retired, then the house wasn't big enough for the both of us.  So I went back to work.  And I did, at first I did some part-time work with H and R Block.  I worked with them, not as a tax preparer, but as a technical specialist in supporting the computer that they use for tax preparation and their network system and what not and troubleshooting that and also installing the equipment.  And then along with H and R Block [Tax Services], that was seasonal work.  I was only there for the tax season which spanned from like October to April.  And then after that I did some work with Belcan Engineering.  And Belcan Engineering is an engineering firm that does work for GE.  GE outsources the work to Belcan.  And so GE was outsourcing some of the work that I was doing when I was employed at GE.  And so Belcan--Belcan hires quite a few retirees from GE to do that.  And so I've done some, I'm still doing some work with Belcan Engineering.  And Belcan is doing this simulation work that I spoke about for GE.
Story_ID: 29297
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, our--this section always ends with a legacy question.  And actually, I have two questions related to legacy and your hopes for the future.  I'm wondering first, as a mechanical engineer, someone who's spent so many years working in that field, are you optimistic about the ability of engineers to help us with these problems associated with fuel efficiency or skyrocketing prices of fuel (laughter).  It's things--I'm thinking now about the headlines that we've seen of late with the price of gasoline just going through the roof.  Are we optimistic at all in the engineering community about changes that will make it affordable or more affordable for people to drive cars in the near future?
Speaker 2: I am optimistic about the engineers being able to do this, but there's so many problems that they have to confront in order to it and the problems are mostly political, political problems and social problems that engineers are not equipped to handle.  You know, we're not politicians and we're not sociologists and we (laughter) don't deal too much with human problems (laughter) and the political problems, I've never been very political in my lifetime.  But, and I find that many of the engineers are not that way.  And the politics do interfere quite a bit with progress.  And so, and I don't foresee that there'll be too much of a change in that in the future.  It might even get worst.
Speaker 1: You mean in American politics?
Speaker 2: Politics, yeah.  If, for the politician, I don't have too much respect for politicians (laughter).  I shouldn't say that.
Speaker 1: No, it's your interview.  You can say whatever you like.  And that was my first question.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: My second has to do with race relations.  I know you said that, sort of the institutionalized racism that kept the Jim Crow schools in place in the American South, certainly impacted your life, but didn't prevent you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from going on to study engineering and to practice very successfully as an engineer for over thirty years.  But are you optimistic about America's ability to solve problems related to racism in the future?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not really.  I can, I see that things, instead of getting better, they seem to be getting worse as far as the relations, race relations concerned.  And I have no insight as to how that might go.  The relations, the race relations that I grew up within, I think in some respects, kind of encouraged me to do what I did, to do better, to prove to the world that I could do it.  And I think, yeah, the high school, the atmosphere that we had in our high school was one where the teachers, our teachers were very concerned about us getting a good education.  And they worked at it, and they drove us.  They didn't let up on us, and it--I don't know whether it was because of the stigma of segregation that was the cause of this or what, but I feel that even though our school was segregated, and we didn't have all the elegant supplies that the white school had, we still were able to learn and get a good education.  And I give most of the credit to our teachers that we had that were very dedicated to us getting a good education.
Story_ID: 29298
Speaker 1: Mr. Dorsey, why did you want to tell your story to The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), at first I didn't think that it was a story worth telling (laughter), that I really didn't have anything real earth shaking in the form of what I did to improve the race relations situation.  But I just--I guess I'll have to be frank with you and say that I wanted to tell it because I was asked to tell it.  And my daughter said that I should tell it.  And my wife [Helena Harris] said that I should tell it, so that was enough for me.
Speaker 1: And now that you've told the story about your work in engineering, what do you hope that your legacy will be for future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that they might see that it can be done, that if you really try hard enough and if you really dedicate yourself to what your objects are, what the problems are, and if you really feel that, when you come up against problems, that you change those that you can change and accept those that you can't, and then have the wisdom to know the difference between the two.
Story_ID: 29299
Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell us about this, please?
Speaker 2: Well, this is a picture of me in college.  And I'm standing on the footstep of the boarding house that my, at that time, that my fiancee [Helena Harris] was living.  And this is Mrs. Newell's house in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: You were in couples' club, wasn't it, dad?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you ready?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a picture of my wife [Helena Harris] and I, and this was taken probably in the 1950s, and it was, the couples' club that we belonged to, we met on a regular basis, say about once a month.  And so this is at one of the couples' club meetings.
Speaker 1: And the previous photo was 1948?
Speaker 2: Yes, the previous photo was 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother [Rita Allen] and my half sister.  I can't focus in on the date, but that had to be, it looks like she's, the half sister, looks like she's about at least nineteen or twenty years old.
Speaker 1: '60s [1960s], it was late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, late '60s [1960s], '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, this one has to be 1949 because that's my wife and I along with her mother at the Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] graduation exercise.
Speaker 2: This is your football picture.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: And that is a picture of me in my football uniform.  It was taken for the football program, and the time on that was at least 1947 or '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a picture of me and my two daughters, with the oldest daughter.  The one on the left is Jocelyn and the one on the right is Karen, and this was taken at least in 1956 or '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: '55 [1955].  It was Christmas '55 [1955].  Look at that.  There's a Christmas tree in the back and Robin wasn't in the picture.  So she wasn't born yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, 1955.
Speaker 1: And I wasn't sitting up.
Speaker 2: Okay, this again--this is the whole gang now taken in 1962.  It's Jocelyn on the left and Karen in the middle and Robin on the right.  And Lena in the background, Lena and I in the background.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my baby picture, and I have no idea how old I was then, but it looks like I was probably only about a year old, maybe I look like--I was able to sit up anyway, but-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, ready?
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a picture of me and the oldest daughter, and that's at her wedding.  And that was in, what, 1972 or-- '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is my induction in Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, and the year of that was like 1948.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when I was in high school with my high school girlfriend.  And that picture was taken probably 1940, '41 [1941].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Ready?
Speaker 2: That's my wife, Helena, and that was taken in college, and we were at a, some ball-
Speaker 1: Kappa Ball.
Speaker 2: Kappa Ball.  It probably was taken around 1948, would be a pretty good estimate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're in California.  That's Woody and--
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a picture of Woody Hayes on the left and Jesse Owens in the middle and me on the right.  And this was taken when I was awarded the Silver Anniversary Award, the NAA [National Aeronautic Association] Anniversary Award in nineteen seventy--was that 1972?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, 1972.  '72 [1972] was a good year.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: That's a GE [General Electric] award.  I was involved with the--we had an Explorer Scout troop at GE, and we conducted Special Olympics with the Explorer Scouts, and that was an award that they gave me for conducting and planning the Explorer Olympics.
Speaker 2: Okay, that was my best friend that we grew up together.  We were almost like brothers.  That's me on the left and him on the right.  That's, his name is Jim Tucker.
