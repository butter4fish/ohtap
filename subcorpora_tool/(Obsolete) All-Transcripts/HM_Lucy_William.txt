Story_ID: 608963
Speaker 1: We're gonna find out a little bit about your family history.  Tell me a little bit about your parents, their names, and if, if you could also spell the names.
Speaker 2: I, I'm--my father was Joe Lucy--that's spelled J-O-E, L-U-C-Y [Joe Lucy, Sr.].  My mother's name was Susie B. Lucy, S-U-S-I-E, B for Belle, B-E-L-L [sic.], L-U-C-Y.  Her maiden name was Gibbs, G-I-B-B-S [Susie Gibbs Lucy].
Speaker 1: And starting with your father, do you know when he was born and where?
Speaker 2: January 6, 1906 [sic.], in Catherine, Alabama.  And my mother was born July 9th, 1909 [sic.], in Uniontown, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Not too terribly far.  We never got, at least I never got an opportunity to know grandparents or great-grandparents.  We moved to California, and then families separated.  I had an opportunity to know some of his brothers and some of his sisters.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did your father have?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, it was a mob.  (Laughter) I think there was about nine all total, and sort of scattered from Alabama to Chicago [Illinois] to Detroit [Michigan], and some remained in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Do you know your grandparents' names, paternal grandparents [Patsy Harris Lucy and James Lucy]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did your father tell you anything about what his parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, they were, they were farmers and in addition to did little work in the, in the lumber industry, in the, in the, in the early days.  My grandmother was, you know, a home, homemaker.
Speaker 1: And did your father share any early memories of his childhood in Alabama?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I mean, they were from a rural community.  There was no graduation from high school or college.  He was essentially a, a, a, a mill, mill worker, then became sort of a self-taught mechanic, auto and, and equipment, and did that for the rest of his life practically, spent a spell working for the defense department [U.S. Department of War; U.S. Department of Defense] during the war years [World War II, WWII] and then went back to mechanic duty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is your father?
Speaker 2: My father.
Story_ID: 608964
Speaker 1: And my mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] was a, a seamstress, then became an operator for a restaurant and did that pretty much all of her life.
Speaker 2: All right, so talking about your mother, how far back can you go with her family?
Speaker 1: Oh, back to the early '30s [1930s].  You know, when I was a youngster, four or five, I remember, you know, her fairly clear because she was the one who was home all the time.
Speaker 2: Do you remember her parents?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Her parents died, you know, ver- I guess in her teenage years.
Speaker 2: Did she tell you what they did for a living?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: And she also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, except that one--one worked in the mines, and I think that's probably the way her father passed away, through a mine accident.
Speaker 2: And did your mother have siblings?
Speaker 1: No.  She just had one aunt that I recall who lived for a time in Memphis, Tennessee, didn't know her that well.  We were pretty young at that time.
Speaker 2: And what did she do for a living?
Speaker 1: A homemaker, did some cooking and some sewing.
Speaker 2: Did your parents ever tell you stories passed down from generation to generation about slavery or--
Speaker 1: No, no.  I think they talked primarily about life in the, what we call in the country and the, the large family and the nature of that life.
Story_ID: 608965
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early childhood.  What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think elementary school in Memphis, Tennessee in the late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to LaRose Elementary School in Memphis.
Speaker 1: That's L-A-R-O--
Speaker 2: R-O-S-E.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory about LaRose Elementary School?
Speaker 2: Well, I think probably just, you know, the, the school itself and the makeup of the class.  It was sort of a two room schoolhouse as opposed to a one room schoolhouse.  In the late '30s [1930s], I guess I must have been six, seven years old, during the outbreak of War World II [WWII], I remember sort of the school efforts to help in the defense, you know, effort itself, and then growing up in the City of Memphis, up to eight years old thereabouts.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about the school's involvement in the defense efforts?
Speaker 2: Well, what they had, you know, was a commitment to save, save metals, you know, stamp cans, do everything you could to collect metals to ship off to the war effort itself.  And each classroom had a, sort of a chore to collect.  And I--and that was sort of a, almost a daily chore to stamp cans and collect them and send them off to the--to be collected to be turned over to the [U.S.] Army defense system.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your teachers involved in this?
Speaker 2: Not by name.  I certainly remember them in, in guiding our efforts.  I, I remember them being fairly strict.  As a matter of fact, we had two school situations.  Early years I went to Catholic school and then moved into the public school system.
Speaker 1: What Catholic school?
Speaker 2: St. Paul's [ph.] as I recall.  It was on Mississippi Avenue [sic. Mississippi Boulevard] near Walker Street [ph.] in our community.
Speaker 1: And were things different at the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Very, different in the sense of, of the management of the class, the discipline, you know, and the concentration on learning.  And I, I thought that was, was, was valuable experience.  When we transferred it was simply because we moved to another area.  To the public school system, the, the discipline issue was not as strict as it was in the, in the Catholic schools, but there was still a, you know, pretty strong commitment to learning.
Story_ID: 608966
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your friends during those years?
Speaker 2: Some, some, not as clear now as it may have been some years past.  But we had I mean a regular neighborhood crowd.  We grew up in LeMoyne Garden [LeMoyne Gardens, Memphis, Tennessee].  And it was a community of, of children who were all, you know, just all there together.  We spent our, you know, two or three years growing up together prior to our leaving Memphis, Tennessee, in the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things did you do together?  Were there certain games you played or activities after school?
Speaker 2: There was, yeah, there was softball; there was swimming or, or, or at least sprinkling; and then there was what is now skateboarding.  We had a, had defined the art back then.
Speaker 1: All right, I wanna take you back a little bit.  Tell me about your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: One brother, Joe Lucy, Jr., same spelling.  He was a year and a half older, year or two, almost two years older.  Nothing very dramatic during those years.  We just grew up as siblings, you know, just--
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories as a family?
Speaker 2: I think the, the, the growing up in LeMoyne Gardens in Memphis, Tennessee, and our schooling and just sort of hanging out with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So what's LeMoyne Garden like?
Speaker 2: LeMoyne Garden was in, in effect what we would call now a project, but it was, it was the cream of the crop.  As a matter of fact, we, we moved into the project when my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] got a steady job [with Memphis Light, Gas and Water].  And it was not an easy process because during those days, you know, the projects was, was, was, was top rate housing.  We moved in and (laughter) had to go through the investigation project that the housing authority committee puts you through, which was a committee of residents.  And, and I sometimes laugh now because people speak so harshly of project life.  I mean that was a good life then.  And you had to have a steady job.  You had to be--your, your--I mean they even investigated your, your, the manner in which you paid your bills, and, and were you current in all your obligations (laughter)?  And we didn't see this as any kind of negative thing.  I mean it was, it was, it was a, a major step up.  And we, I mean the kids who were going to school there were, were, were, were family oriented; they were well disciplined.  I mean we had our neighborhood things with folks from other places, but it was not the kind of upbringing that you look down on, so to speak.
Story_ID: 608967
Speaker 1: Take me through the earliest sights, smells, sounds of your childhood in Memphis [Tennessee].  It sounds like you moved from one community to another during your early years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we moved, we moved a lot.  I, I thought we were just traveling, 'til I realized it was about every thirty days (laughter).  But we, we, we settled in LeMoyne Garden [LeMoyne Gardens, Memphis, Tennessee].  And--
Speaker 1: So before, before you moved to LeMoyne Garden, where did you live?
Speaker 2: We lived on Neptune Avenue [sic. Neptune Street], which is about a block away.  We stayed there for about a year, as I said, until my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] got a steady job with Memphis Light, Gas and Water.  And with a steady job and, and a promising future, we moved into the projects (laughter).  And prior to that, we lived on Lauderdale [Street], on Vance [Avenue], all within sort of a larger, you know, African American community.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the early sights, smells, sounds of Neptune Street.
Speaker 2: Well, Neptune was a street that--right across the street was, was a cemetery, so you had this two to three block area where virtually everybody knew everybody.  And it was a normal day.  You go to school in the morning, get out, play softball or whatever in the afternoon, come home at a fixed time in the evening.  Maybe a little while, you know, you could go up and play in what was then a sprinkler pool, installed by the housing authority.  And it was a fairly simple life.  It wasn't, wasn't complicated and certainly not in what we would see now as a dangerous life. It was very pleasant.  People understood and enjoyed with being with each, with each other during this, during this time.
Story_ID: 608968
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the holidays in your home?
Speaker 2: All (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Christmas.
Speaker 2: Christmases was always fun.  I mean it was a, it was a time when you got what you thought you were promised.
Speaker 1: Tell me about one Christmas in particular.
Speaker 2: I think--I'm, I'm trying to think.  Six, seven years old, just the, you know, the joy and happiness of being with families and getting new things for the coming year, nothing spectacular.  I, I think the one holiday that virtually everybody remembers was a special day that you got to go to the zoo [Memphis Zoo, Memphis, Tennessee], a special day for, for the African American community in Memphis, Tennessee, and it sort of stands out.  But--
Speaker 1: Which holiday?
Speaker 2: The, the--I don't know what the name of it is now, but it was a day set aside for the African Americans to visit the city zoo.  And it wasn't like you could march in and out any time you wanted to.  It was a special day.
Speaker 1: What do you remember from that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember how odd it was (laughter) that this was a special day.
Speaker 1: And it was only African American faces you saw--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --visit that day?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and I think, as, as I grew older, we learned that there are a number of cities that had the same kinds of, of policies, that that was a day set aside for us to visit.
Speaker 1: Describe the racial situation in Memphis during these years, the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Well, Memphis was Mississippi up north, very segregated, polarized but not in the, in the way that we view polarization now.  I mean it was clearly--there were clear areas of town that was designated for, for black families.  Every department of the city had the same segregated system, whether it's fire, police, other city services, even--as I mentioned before, my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] went to work for Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and that was a way of life, and you accepted it as it was, whether it was in the retail sector of the economy or whether it was in the private construction sector.  I mean, blacks were relegated to the lowest, lowest jobs and less skilled jobs.
Speaker 1: Do you have any specific memories of racial interaction, conflict?
Speaker 2: Well, the conflict you could see every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night, I mean in terms of how laws and justice was meted out, although I wasn't young enough to understand all this.  As I grew older, I realized that what you had was a segregated system and a series of laws that, and policies that applied specifically to, to the black community, whether you were shopping retail, you shopped in a certain area, whether you were--
Speaker 1: Do you remember a specific store you went into with your family or--
Speaker 2: No, I can't say I do.
Speaker 1: --couldn't go into?
Speaker 2: But there, there were, there were situations where even if you went into a store, you could not try on or fit, you know, clothes for particular--for purchase.  I mean it, it was not a system that, that you can describe.  You just knew you didn't do certain things.  We laugh about it now, but men couldn't try on hats or couldn't try on coats or, or any of those kinds of things.  And this was the system in Memphis, Tennessee.  And there's as I said, obviously it was a system in a lot of other places.  And there were some prominent stores, but my parents never, never at least took us to them.
Story_ID: 608969
Speaker 1: Do you remember--did you have any white friends at all?  Did you know any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --white people?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Who were the prominent white leaders at church, school?
Speaker 2: Well I can't say at the church or school, but in terms of the politics of the city [Memphis, Tennessee], the city was ran by a fellow by the name of E.H. Crump, very prominent politician, and had absolute, total political control of the city, jobs, in terms of the public sector, and influence in the private sector.  I mean as, as we learned, he could refer you to a, a, a, an employer, and you were hired just like that.  Or, he could call an employer and, and tell him to fire you, and you were fired just like that, and it was politically based.  The black community, as I later learned, was, was a source of political support for Mr. Crump, who was called Boss Crump just like that.  And he had allies and friends in the community whose job was to produce, you know, political support for whatever programs or projects he was working on.  And I, I think my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] became one of those people, which was how he got his job at Memphis Light, Gas and Water.  In latter years, I, I, I, I had the opportunity to speak with the, the board of directors of Memphis Light, Gas and Water and, and just made the observation that my father had worked for them back in the '30s [1930s] as an unskilled laborer and with no future for advancement unless somebody said advance (laughter).  When the war [World War II, WWII] broke out, six weeks later he was a journeyman welder.  And my point was that the system, you know, in effect, described what you were gonna be.  But when the crisis is created, basic polity--policy can decide what you should be.  And it was interesting when the, the fellow from the human resources department at Memphis Light, Gas and Water went back and found my father's work records, his application, and his employment, you know, (laughter) documents and, and was kind enough to send them to me.
Speaker 1: How long did your father work there?
Speaker 2: I guess about six or seven years, because in 1941, the latter part of '41 [1941], when the war broke out, he left there and moved to, to California.
Story_ID: 608970
Speaker 1: Tell me about your church.  Did your family attend church in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I went to St. Paul's Catholic Church [ph.], yeah, while we were attending Catholic school, which is, as I say, a block from home.  But we didn't attend any other denominational churches.
Speaker 1: And that was a black--
Speaker 2: Black Catholic.
Speaker 1: --Catholic church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In school, after you left elementary school, where did you go?
Speaker 2: We moved--my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] moved to California first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after the outbreak of World War II [WWII].  We followed about two months, three months later to California, Northern California, small town called Richmond [California], which was sort of a major defense industry area.  Henry J. Kaiser had developed a series of shipbuilding sites there in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California].  And we moved to Richmond, and I then went to--completed elementary school at a school called Nichols Elementary [sic. Nystrom Elementary School, Richmond, California], then on to Roosevelt Junior High School [Richmond, California], which was sort of like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so even, so even before you even get to high school; so that's a big move--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going from the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all the way to Northern California.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was your first impression of Richmond, California?
Speaker 2: I, I can't say it was--other than the, the, the war effort and lots of people doing lots of things, for me it wasn't basically any different than Memphis, Tennessee.  I mean we were in school.  We went to school; we came home.
Speaker 1: Was it a black school?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.  It was a, it was a, a, a, a mixed school at that time simply because you had--it was a school that served defense industry families.  So there were whites, you know, Hispanics, African Americans all in this same area.  That part was very new.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was that like for the first time going to an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Well, I really didn't--it really didn't make any impression one way or the other.  All you notice is there's a much broader, you know, and more diverse of group of students.  But, I mean ours was to try to learn while we were there.  Played together without any, any difficulties of note that I, I, I recall.
Speaker 1: What about academics?  Were you drawn to certain disciplines?
Speaker 2: Not at, not at that level.  By the time I reached junior high school was being drawn towards what turned out to be an architectural drafting and engineering courses.
Speaker 1: When you were, when you were young were you also drawn toward math?
Speaker 2: Not so much math as, as, as it was drafting and architecture.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --but in elementary school, even before you got to architecture?
Speaker 2: Well, we did what we had to do in terms of what the curriculum called for.  It wasn't like I was drawn to it.  As a matter of fact, I was afraid of it.  (Laughter) But it became part of the, the, what we would call now middle school curriculum.  In the eighth grade in junior high school, I began to enjoy, you know, drafting, began to enjoy design things and sort of--for at least two semesters in junior high school made sure I had drafting classes.
Story_ID: 608971
Speaker 1: So you mentioned when you arrived in Richmond, California that your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] was a part of the defense industry, shipbuilding.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the company?
Speaker 2: Kaiser [Kaiser Shipyards].
Speaker 1: Oh, it was Kaiser.  And did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) K-A-I-S-E-R.
Speaker 1: --did you also live in a community that was for the workers?
Speaker 2: It, it was not a worker community, but it was a brand new area developed for defense industry families.  And in our case, it was a, a, a three block area with--let me see how best to describe it?  Well, there were a series of neighborhoods built up to service the various yards that were there.  There were four shipbuilding yards that spanned that section of the, of the bay [San Francisco Bay Area, California].  And there were different, different neighborhoods for each yard.  Ours was what it was called typically south Richmond [California], and the adjoining area was called Harbor Gate [Richmond, California]; a little bit farther down it was called Stege [Richmond, California] a little bit farther down than that--I mean each, each area had a different name.  And some were more segregated than others simply because of the nature of the work of that particular yard.
Speaker 1: And what about your neighborhood?  Take me around the block.  In your neighbor what was it like?
Speaker 2: Our neighborhood was completely African American.  And it was a, a series of streets, 23rd [Street], 4th [24th Street] and 5th [25th Street] three blocks long, one block wide.  I mean and that was our world.
Speaker 1: Any early memories on that, in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was the fact that most people there had came to that area from the South.  And whether it was as far south as Tennessee, or Alabama, or Mississippi, or Georgia, but they were all there, you know, as a part of the war effort, very committed to the work, very conscious of that being a better life than what they had moved away from.  Most of the people there were from states of the agricultural base, and they were now doing industrial work, better wages, obviously better conditions to live under.
Speaker 1: How did your father hear about this work out west?
Speaker 2: I think that, you know, when the war [World War II, WWII] broke out it was just call.  And because of the particular needs, I'm assuming that the government figured out some way to advertise for skills, just for laborers to be trained at the work site.  And so, he and some of his friends apparently were notified that there were job opportunities on the West Coast.  If you want to go, you could try out to be a pipefitter, or a la- or, or a laborer, or a shipbuilder, or a welder, you name it, all of skills needed for that industry.  And as I said, in six weeks after he left home, he was a journeyman welder and stayed with that work until the end of the war.
Speaker 1: He made pretty good money?
Speaker 2: I don't have a sense of what pretty good money would have been in those days.  But we, we had a nice apartment, and he was able to buy a car and you know, so it was a lot better than it was in Memphis [Tennessee].
Story_ID: 608972
Speaker 1: And you--did you drive or take the bus or the train across country?
Speaker 2: Train.  We took the Santa Fe [Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway] from Memphis, Tennessee, across Arkansas through the Southwest and then came north from I guess Los Angeles [California] up, and the train ended in Richmond, California.
Speaker 1: How was that journey for you?  Probably the first time you went across country.
Speaker 2: For me, I rather enjoyed it.  I thought it was one more big vacation (laughter).  I think the--for, for my brother [Joe Lucy, Jr.] and my, my mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] and myself, it was the first time we had that kind of experience.  It was a, I think it was about a three, three and a half day trip.  And, and it proved to be pretty exciting, although you saw the signs of, of discrimination along the way.  You still had to, to, to bring your food.  And I'm not--and I'm, I'm not sure the train had a, a dining car, but it was not for us, either because we couldn't afford it or because we were permitted.  I'm not sure which.  But we, like, you know, thousands and thousands of other folks, had the shoe box, you know, with the, with the, with the stuff in it.  And the--
Speaker 1: What kind of--so your mom prepared food for you.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had--
Speaker 1: --what kind of food?
Speaker 2: We had, I think we had about two and half, three days' worth of fried chicken, you know, I mean (laughter) and cakes and pies and stuff like that.  So, you know, it was, it was for us a fun time.
Story_ID: 608973
Speaker 1: So what year did you make that journey from Memphis [Tennessee] to Richmond, California?
Speaker 2: That would be 1942.  We left about April of 1942.
Speaker 1: And you were starting to tell me about the journey.  You mentioned the cars were segregated.  So tell me about--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --the black cars.
Speaker 2: --we caught the train from Memphis, heading, heading west through West Memphis [Arkansas] and Arkansas.  And, and while I didn't think a whole lot of it at the time, maybe one those inci- coincidences, but the car we were riding in, and I learned later, the car a lot of people rode in, was just far enough back from the engine (laughter) so that the, the smoke from the coal fed, you know it blew right through windows when you opened them.  And had you been either closer or further back, it might have happened that same way.  But these, as life, you know, ultimately reflects, turned out to be the black cars, you know.  So this obviously was a, a, a further indication of the segregation that existed throughout the South in those days.
Speaker 1: Can you mention you also along the way saw those signs, "Colored Only," "Whites Only" signs.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  This, this is the early '40s [1940s] in the South, and it was not unusual.  Of course, when you get out of the South you didn't, didn't see that so much.  But life in Memphis, Tennessee, was a part of the history of the South.  And we used to call Memphis the, the capital of Mississippi because, you know, twenty miles down the way you're into Mississippi.  But it was a, it's a fairly clear delineation of, of based on color.
Story_ID: 608974
Speaker 1: And before we jump all of the way to Richmond [California] and get fully into that story, were there any other memories from your experiences in Memphis [Tennessee], racial incidents that document that period?
Speaker 2: Nothing that I focused on at that time.  I really didn't, didn't, didn't have any reason to question a lot of things that, that you saw because you know our life was our neighborhood.  But later on you began to see the incredible differences that, in terms of the application of law, the application of just social systems.
Speaker 1: Was the KKK [Ku Klux Klan] quite active at that time in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge, not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you take this journey to Richmond.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you wind up in the Kaiser community [Kaiser Shipyards].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there also--you mentioned there were people from really all over the country, from the Deep South, all over the country.  Were there also immigrant populations in that area at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The, that area of the country had, prior to the war [World War II, WWII], been, you know, a regular slow agricultural area.  But the war and the industries that had to really build up very quickly brought lots and lots of people.  Plus, just the, the area itself, there were Italian immigrants, Irish immigrants, and as I said, you know, a, a real large Hispanic community, you know, scattered at least one section of town.  So as I mentioned, in the school systems you had this diversity then that reflected the makeup of those living in, in the community.  And there were at least five or six different communities with different degrees of, of integration.  The one we lived in, as I said, was just virtually totally black.  But on our, in our schooling, you were going to very diverse schools, even at that point in time.
Speaker 1: And in, in the school system, was there this racial hierarchy at all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think anybody paid any attention at time, essentially because people were coming from any number of different places.  The administration of the school system probably was, was predominantly white in the lower grades, and it probably got a little bit more integrated when you got to the higher grades of school.  I went to, as I said, Nichols, which is N-I-C-H-O-L-S [sic. Nystrom Elementary School, Richmond, California], then Roosevelt Junior High School [Richmond, California], and then briefly to Richmond High School [Richmond, California], and finally graduated from El Cerrito [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California].
Story_ID: 608975
Speaker 1: And you mentioned at Roosevelt Junior High [Roosevelt Junior High School, Richmond, California] you started gaining an interest in architecture and that--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) kind of thing.  Was there a particular teacher?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think, remember their name.  There were two teachers that really stand out in my mind: our social studies teacher, a Ms. Katherine Glafkides [Katherine Glafkides Johns], and if you ask me how to spell it (laughter), I have no idea; and Mr. Marsh [ph.] I believe his name was, who was the physical ed [physical education] teacher.
Speaker 1: And what did they do that inspired you?
Speaker 2: I think just really talked about, you know, the, the need to receive a, a foundation for a good education because in the future years, I mean that was gonna be whatever, the, the key to any kind of success you were gonna have.  And in the social studies, Ms., Ms., Ms. Glafkides was, was just a good, good teacher.  And physical ed, which was connected at that time with vocational training, you know the shop courses and what have you, and Mr. Marsh taught, taught both.  And it was just something that stuck with me.
Story_ID: 608976
Speaker 1: Were you a leader in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I (laughter), I think, you know, we had, in high school, we, we had an opportunity because of I think our preparation in junior high [Roosevelt Junior High School, Richmond, California] to take on particular projects.  And by the time I got to high school I was a pretty, pretty fair draftsman and design person and you know, looking forward to graduation, not knowing what you're gonna do.  At our school they gave us an opportunity to do a number of things, along--among which was to really look at the, the physical facility of the school itself and our class to come up with a recommended safety program in case the school was hit by an atom bomb (laughter) excuse the expression.  Where are the safety areas?  I mean where can students stand, sit, lie to minimize damage.  So others and myself had to really, you know, survey the school, take a look at the structural makeup of the schools, the hallways.  And, and that was a project that gave you lots of exposure to lots of different things in terms of, of building design construction.
Speaker 1: Were a lot of your academic projects centered around the war effort and the threat of--bomb scare?
Speaker 2: No, I can't say that.  I think it was just such a--the, the, the war [World War II, WWII] ended with the atom bomb.  So the question was, can that happen again to us?  And there was this fear of a bomb and that effort to try and determine if the ultimate happens and it's a school setting, where are the safest places to be?  And our class, which was a drafting class, was given at least an opportunity to take a look at all those things, you know, where are the columns?  Where are the beams?  Where are walls?  And if so, how safe is it within a certain distance of those.  So this became a major senior project for, for myself and some others [at El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California].
Story_ID: 608977
Speaker 1: And over the years, when you first arrived in Richmond [California], were there similar efforts related to the war [World War II, WWII]?  You mentioned in Memphis [Tennessee] there was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  In, in, in those days we were--
Speaker 1: --saving of metal.
Speaker 2: --we were fairly young, I mean, I, I think seven or eight years old.  So there wasn't--
Speaker 1: Right.  But in Memphis you mentioned the, the scrap metal, the collecting of metal and that kind of thing.  Were there any similar efforts in Richmond?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were, but it, it was not a part of our, our, our class activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you also mentioned that Richmond was quite an industrial town.  So you had the shipyards.  Also Ford Motor Company [Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant] was there?
Speaker 2: Ford Motor Company.
Speaker 1: Standard Oil [Standard Oil Company]?
Speaker 2: Standard Oil, International Harvester [International Harvester Company; Navistar International Corporation]; big chemical operations.  I think--I'm trying to think, recall--there's a big industrial plant that made porcelain bathroom facilities.  I mean it, it, it really became a big industrial and manufacturing city in, in no time at all--Standard [American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation], Standard was the name of the place, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there unions at the time forming in Richmond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  The workers at Standard Oil were unionized; workers at Ford Motor Company was unionized; American Standard was unionized.  I don't know what the degree of organization was in the shipyard itself because of the defense industry thing.  The, the, ultimately, the government was the employer.  But the chemical plant had--I think it was the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers [Oil Workers International Union; Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union].  I know that in later years.  I didn't know it then.  But I mean they, they were clearly organized.
Speaker 1: Were they making themselves visible in the city though?  Were there any protest or strikes?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.  During the war years, I mean there was sort of a mutual agreement in terms of productivity standards and no strike you know provisions.  And I think the, the, the cooperation between the government, the corporate community, and the labor force really maximized productivity.
Speaker 1: Did your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.], when he came home from work, did he tell you any stories about conditions on the job?
Speaker 2: I--well, he probably did, but it was, it was not so much a difference in conditions based on race or anything like that.  The questions was, you know, the, the, the working conditions to increase and maintain productivity levels and standards.  And he, he spoke about the, the concept of teamwork.  I mean the Kaiser [Kaiser Shipyards] commitment to the war effort was to build X number of ships in X number of days, and so there was a real focus of that workforce on producing that.  It was much more of a, a patriotic commitment to the work then than you find I suspect these days.
Story_ID: 608978
Speaker 1: All right.  And then, so you attended Richmond High School [Richmond, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then you graduated from?
Speaker 2: El Cerrito [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California].  Richmond High School, by that, by the time we got into high school, you know, it was sports bug had, had hit.  And at Richmond High School, because of the incredibly large drawing pool of, of athletes, your chances of, of playing were--I mean if you weren't exceptionally good--were, were (unclear) so limited.  Plus it was one of the early times when you saw the, the question of race as a factor in athletic opportunities.  Richmond [California] was a, was an incredibly large, you know, area to draw from.  And by the time I got to high school in the tenth grade, I mean, you know, the talent pool was so deep (laughter), you know, in particular in what I wanted to play, we started to look around.  And I had relatives who lived in another school district, which allowed me to, you know, falsify the address and attend another school.  And so we did a little bit of--I played a little football and able to play a little baseball and, and basketball but not at the varsity level but one, one, one semester until injuries at the, at--in varsity.
Speaker 1: And so you mentioned relatives.  Were there a group of your relatives that made that migration with you?
Speaker 2: No.  It's just one.  One, one uncle, after being discharged from the [U.S. military] service, moved into the same area and lived, as I said, in another school district.  He lived in, in, in Richmond, but boundaries gave us access to El Cerrito.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Alfred [ph.].  And he had been a, he had been a soldier, saw action in the European Theater [European Theater of Operations].  I don't recall the countries but was discharged and came to Richmond to live.
Speaker 1: Did you have other relatives who served in the service?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, no.
Story_ID: 608979
Speaker 1: And upon graduation from high school [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Went to work--went to school down at Contra Costa Junior College [Contra Costa Junior College, West Campus; Contra Costa College, San Pablo, California] and spent two semesters there and then went to work for the [U.S.] Navy at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California--that's spelled V-A-L-L-E-J-O.  And by this time--I graduated from high school in January of 1951.  And the big, it was a big rehabilitation of, of, of World War II [WWII] ships to more modern ships.  And I think, and I'm not positive, but I think because of the, sort of the engineering record from high school or junior college, I was hired on in the engineering section of Mare Island Naval Shipyard, after having completed about a year or so in what they called the rigging loft of where you're doing dock work essentially.  Got transferred to the engineering section.  We were working on submarines conversion from diesel to nuclear stuff and for new submarines that were equipped to chase other submarines, sort of building a sonar sub fleet at that time.
Speaker 1: How did you find that work environment?
Speaker 2: Oh, incredibly good.  I enjoyed it.  It was, you know, where you could not only learn but thought you were doing something really, terribly important.  I worked there for, from 1951 to 1953.
Speaker 1: And were there other people of color, other, other men of color working alongside you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Describe the racial/ethnic makeup.
Speaker 2: Well, in the defense industry, I mean where you could--I mean diversity was, was almost a natural way of life.  And Mare Island was a major, major naval base in Northern California, and you had just all kinds of skills and crafts that were needed for the, for the war effort and then for the reconstruction after the war had ended.  We came out of school during the Korean War, and so you still had a major commitment to defense.  And so you had--even, even schoolmates who had--they were electricians; they were ship fitters; they were welders; I mean just all of that.  And they were drawing from, you know, a pool of workers within the immediate area of, of, of Vallejo.  And after getting transferred to the engineering section, which was not as diverse as the rest of the workforce, but it provided a good opportunity for me to sort of see a different area of the work, and stayed for about two years, about two years.  And we were still doing projects on the yard, energy projects, safety projects.
Story_ID: 608980
Speaker 1: And in the early part of '53 [1953], and I'm not quite sure how it developed, but received a call from someone in the public works department of Contra Costa County [Contra Costa County Public Works Department] and was asked if I wanted to apply for a job with them.  And at that time, Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was president of the U.S. and had just initiated a massive interstate highway bill.  And I forget the numbers, but it was called the federal aid to secondary highway construction.  And so those states that were participants had to beef up their engineering, you know, capability in order to qualify as a part of the, the funding stream.  And then counties through which these, you know, interstate highways would be built, if they wanted to participate in what we called at that time farm to market roads, it had to have an engineering capacity also.  So our county was right in the midst of building up in preparation for being a part of the, of the highway construction program.  And the, the department of public works, which was sort of the key department there, was putting together this engineering department or, or, or, or testing program in order to quality for grant funds.  And I didn't realize all of this at the same time, but it looked like a job that was, it was, was, was better than the one I had.  So I went over; I applied and got hired as an engineering aide in 1953 and worked for the county for thirteen years.
Speaker 2: So you worked for Contra--
Speaker 1: Costa--
Speaker 2: --Costa County--
Speaker 1: --County.
Speaker 2: --California [Contra Costa County, California].
Speaker 1: That's C-O-N-T-R-A, C-O-S-T-A, C-O-U-N-T-Y.
Speaker 2: Now, were you still in school at this time?
Speaker 1: No.  I was out of school then.
Speaker 2: Okay, you finished the community college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got--I didn't finish, but I left Contra Costa Junior College [Contra Costa Junior College, West Campus; Contra Costa College, San Pablo, California] at that time.
Story_ID: 608981
Speaker 1: Did you also attend the University of California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  What we had was a, an arrangement with the University of California in specialized courses dealing with materials and research.  And I, when I got into this, applied, went into the university extension system for about three years of very special courses dealing with materials and testing.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: It would have been about 1955 through '7 [1957].
Speaker 1: And you were taking specialized--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had what we called a materials and research laboratory [at the Contra Costa County Public Works Department], which were all of the materials that would be used in highway construction: bridges and road and et cetera.  All those things had to meet standards established by the state government as a part of their responsibility to the federal government.  So our laboratory was set up to do that testing.  And since this was very new, all of us had to learn the types of tests and the procedures for the conduct of those tests so that that material--I mean that information and data could be supplied to the state to support, you know, the amounts--the dollars that were coming into our county for construction.
Speaker 1: What are your memories of UC Berkeley at that time?
Speaker 2: I, I thought it was cool.  I mean (laughter) it was a--I mean not having never been to a, a, a university like that.  But it was--ours was a very confined area, because we were dealing specifically with these kinds of courses.  The teachers were, were I thought great.  And I was just amazed by the kinds of things that you were learning.  I remember clearly the fellow who really gave us our stuff, a professor by the name of Carl Monismith [Carl L. Monismith], M-O-N-O-S-M-I-T-H [sic.].  Because even with the prior training, I had never done this kind of work, and so it was--you would, you would talk about all kinds of different tests to determine the quality of materials that were gonna be used.  You then had to be trained on how do you make different products from a mixture of natural stuff?  I mean, cement, asphalt.  How do you construct road systems so you get the longest use and qua- most quality construction?  So these were all kinds of new things, and they're terribly interesting.
Speaker 1: And so were there any other professors that stand out in your mind from Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one more, but I can't remember the name right now.  I, I remember Monismith because it's an unusual name, and we had courses at, at the Berkeley campus as well as an extension course down in Richmond [California] itself.
Speaker 1: Were there classmates you recall?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from both our county and from other counties, in other areas of state service.
Speaker 1: Okay, but any names that stand out?  No problem (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, not that I can remember offhand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608982
Speaker 1: All this time when you were, you know, doing this highly technical work, were you affiliated at all with unions, or when did that begin?
Speaker 2: The--I, I was affiliated but not terribly active, because I didn't really know what was really going on.  In our county we lived in a very labor intensive county and very labor oriented county.  We had the oil workers union [Oil Workers International Union; Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union].  We had steelworkers [United Steelworkers].  We had all of the unions, and that was--had tremendous impact in terms of the politics of city government--county government.  And--
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in, just in terms of, of the wages, conditions of employment, program policies, you know, construction issues, economic development of course.  I mean the labor movement was very strong.  And we were a, a, an association, not at that time a labor union as, as we know it, would, would, would designate them today.  And you know, we worked with all of the other organizations in terms of appearances before the county board of supervisors.  And some cities within it where we had membership.  I think probably as I was promoted to different levels or responsibility in our department, in our division [Contra Costa County Public Works Department], I began to see the, the fact that there were differences in the way employees were treated.
Story_ID: 608983
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me about your promotions.  What were the positions?
Speaker 2: Well, I hired in, as I said earlier, as an engineering aide, and later on became promoted to a senior engineering aide within the division [Contra Costa County Public Works Department], then to a materials tester, and then to a supervising materials tester, which wound up, in effect, putting me in charge of the, of the laboratory operation itself under the direction of the, of the materials and research engineer.  You then had, you know supervisorial responsibility over the workers in the laboratory.  You had training responsibilities for engineers who were what we called engineers in training.  And these were people who had completed their degree work and was learning the, sort of the practical side of engineering.  So they were rotated through the laboratory for work in the lab and then external work of field work.  And you know, this went on for a while.  And, and at that point, a supervising materials tester was the highest ranking member, other than the materials engineer in the laboratory section.  And in those days always competition for, for pay and benefits.  If you thought your contribution to the overall program was equal to or better than somebody else's, then you were arguing that our guys need a raise for, you know, in order for us to keep good quality of people, or somebody else makes more and don't do nearly as much.  I mean whatever the argument was, it was made on behalf of better benefits.  And I began to realize that the, the process of setting the wages of benefits was, was pretty arbitrary, you know.  And I became a little bit more active in the organization than I had been prior to that, because looking out for our guys, you know, you had to find ways and means of doing that.
Speaker 1: So you became active in the local--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --AS- AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees].
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure it was AFSCME at that time, but it was a Contra Costa County Employees Association.  It later on affiliated with AFSCME.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608984
Speaker 1: And when did you begin full involvement with, with the unions, taking on leadership positions, et cetera?
Speaker 2: I think about '56 [1956], 1956, '57 [1957], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: And what was your first move?
Speaker 2: More money for our guys (laughter).  We--it's an annual process of, of salary setting.  I became a member of the, the research committee of the, of, of the then association.  And what we would do--
Speaker 1: Which, which association?
Speaker 2: Contra Costa County Employees Association.  And what we would do is survey all of the classifications within our membership and compare them to other cities, countries, state services in order to make an argument before the city council of the need to increase wages, increase benefits, et cetera because if you're gonna keep good people and there's competition based on wages and benefits, you could have a good employee for two years, three years that leaves simply because they can get one more step someplace else.  So we, we began that process.  As I say, that's when I began to realize how arbitrary the process was.  And a, a debate really started among our membership as an independent association, even though an organization of workers as strong as a regular union, and--could we take on the same responsibilities on behalf of our members as a regular union?  And what are the benefits?  What are the pros and cons?  So we, we had this year long debate within our membership.  And the decision was we ought to be a legitimate union, and we ought to pursue a, a course of action that reflected that.
Story_ID: 608985
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me how the local AFSCME chapter was developed out of the independent.
Speaker 2: Well, as I say, we had that--we were the Contra Costa County Employees Association, which was an independent organization, not what you would call a, a, a collective bargaining agent.  Many of us, while we had participated in the civil service system, we thought was a fair system that gave employees the rights, the, the, the--for them to argue before it.  But then it began to dawn on us that the, that the system itself had gone far beyond what its mandate was.  Originally it was, its role was to simply declare a pool of, of employees or potential employees qualified based on the jobs they were applying for.  But this system was starting to decide what the wage levels are gonna be, what benefits would be, how many holidays.  And you had a chance to, to speak to that after the fact, not before the fact.  And so we were saying that, you know, fairness dictates that we sit down as representatives of the employee and discuss these matters before you make a decision.  I mean we had a right to appeal but not to argue as representatives of a large slice of the workforce.  And while we continued to do that, the debates started about, you know, you know, public sector trade unionism in our county.  And we lived in a very labor intensive county and, and, and powerful unions.  And we thought that if we were a union, then we would be allied with the rest of them, and their power would, would, would help us in our efforts, and not just in terms of wages and benefits, but also in, in quality of work and other kinds of policies that we thought were important.  So we went on for about a year with this debate of what do you wanna be.  And, and even if you could succeed in being that, what's it mean?  And ultimate, at the end of this period we had a, a, a, a vote of the entire membership, three questions: A, do you want to do this; B, if so, who with; and C, were you prepared to pay for it?  And the decision was, yeah, we ought to be a union.  The second decision, we ought to seek out another national public employee union to discuss this with.  And third, we're prepared to pay more for that than we are for this, so to speak (laughter).  And the decision was made to seek out the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and discuss this, and, and we did.  At that time, a fellow out of New York [New York] by the name of Jerry Wurf was really leading a national debate on the same question we had just wrestled with: the value of public sector trade unionism.  And we, we, we listened to it and decided that, A, this made sense to us, and we wanted to affiliate with this union, although he was not the president.  He was simply a spokesperson for this new, new concept in the public section.  We became part of AFSCME, became Local 1675 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees--
Speaker 1: So did you actually sit down with Jerry Wurf at this time, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, they say sit down.  He came to our area to discuss it, and we had an opportunity to hear him out and ask the kinds of questions that we thought were important to our decision making process.
Speaker 1: And this is 1956?
Speaker 2: It's about '56 [1956], '57 [1957], something like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 608986
Speaker 1: Who were some of your colleagues, local leaders as well?
Speaker 2: Fellow by the name of Benjamin Russell [Benjamin O. Russell], who was very instrumental in keeping the association [Contra Costa County Employees Association] together.  An Italian fellow by the name of Sal Aiello [Salvatore Aiello].  That's spelled A-I-E-L-L-O.  Those were the principal leaders of the union at that time.
Speaker 1: Describe--was, was the racial makeup similarly diverse?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because it, it--excuse me--in our department, the public works department [Contra Costa County Public Works Department], you had all kinds of classification: truck drivers, equipment operators, laborers, you know, so it was, it was diverse from the start.  We also represented other departments, the health department [Contra Costa County Health Department; Contra Costa Health Services], where you had hospitals.  And as a result, you had license vocational nurses and registered nurses, food service workers, custodians.  I mean so it was a, it was a diverse union, although there it was not a majority people of color.  It was a majority Caucasian.  But because it was county services, I mean, you, you had a different sense of, of connectivity.  I became, as I said, I worked on the, you know, the salary research committee, then got elected to something else, you know, sort of made the progression, ultimately winding up as president for a couple of two or three years.
Speaker 1: What year were you elected president?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959] or--well, let me see--in the '60s [1960s].  I don't really remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --exactly.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere in there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that election?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any particular highlights.  I think you, you know, you got to an election union meeting.  Somebody nominates you, and you don't have the wisdom to withdraw, and you wind up getting elected (laughter).  I think it was a, it was a sense of recognition for the work that you'd done.  And that--
Speaker 1: What kind of work had you done?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I had served on the salary committee and the research committee and had served as a, officer in a different, you know, office for, for a little while.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what office?
Speaker 2: A member of the executive board in the--
Speaker 1: And had you guys done some successful negotiations--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--prior to that it was successful presentations.  I mean I can say what we would do is make these, these broad surveys up for certain classifications and then compare the, the responsibilities of the--in terms of our county.  We had managed to move the engineering series into a level where, you know, their, their importance to the program of construction was, was recognized, and I think probably made a good case that if you're gonna keep quality people, you gotta, you gotta pay quality wages and, and benefits.  So we had a pretty stable department, and we were, we sort of represented other departments, civilian systems, the construction workers, and oh, we had a pretty good case.  We had a, a local of about 7500 people prior to this affiliation [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675].  We lost about a thousand folks, you know, when we affiliated because there are some employees just don't believe in unions.  And in the vote, while we receive a majority of support for the action, those who didn't choose to, to go in that direction just simply withdrew.
Story_ID: 608987
Speaker 1: Now this is the 1960s.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on in the country when it comes to civil rights.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Were you conscious of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s], yeah, yeah.  I mean, I mentioned Mr. Wurf and others who came out of that environment, who saw the public sector unionization and the ability to build as a part of both a civil rights and a worker's rights movement.  Jerry Wurf and a fellow by the name of Joseph Ames who was active--had been a part of the, the original CORE movement, the Congress on Racial Equality [sic. Congress of Racial Equality], along with James Farmer.  And so those same kinds of concepts were brought in to what the role of the union ought to be.  It, it should not be just an, an, a, an issue of nine to five [o'clock] because there are other hours that other kinds of issues that are important to you as a person.  And the union ought to be in, involved in the, in the whole human rights, workers' rights, civil rights struggle.
Speaker 1: So you, early on you met Jerry Wurf who later became the president--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for a number of years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees].  Did you also meet James Farmer?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  James Farmer had been one of our staffers, although I did not know it at the time, in New York City [New York, New York].  Jim was employed by District Council 37 many, many years before that and had been the executive director of CORE prior to that.  But I didn't, I didn't know all of this at the time.
Speaker 1: What was your first meeting with James Farmer?
Speaker 2: Probably sort of a standup meeting on one of his trips to the West Coast, in the San Francisco [California] and Oakland [California] chapters of CORE, and just in the presence.  I mean it wasn't like we were big friends or anything.  I didn't know it at the time.  We later on became friends when I became an employee of the union.  Incredible individual, I mean just tremendous.  I, I later learned from the movie 'The Great Debaters' (laughter), which is now out, that, that, that his history was just a, a, you know, a fantastic history.
Speaker 1: Anything else special about, about him that you realized at that time over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, I, as, as, as, as a matter of fact, when I saw his protest conducted at the World's Fair [New York World's Fair, New York, New York], and I forget the year, I have trouble sort of relating to what's going on here, and as, you know, time went by, began to understand these incredible, you know, problems in our society that Jim and others were really using both human rights and work--civil rights approaches to try and resolve.

Speaker 1: What about in 1963, the March on Washington?  We were you--did you go to Washington [D.C.] for that?
Speaker 2: No.  We sent some representatives from our local union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] to the march, but I didn't go.  And prior to that, there was, you know, march from--I shouldn't say prior to that, the march from Selma to Mon- [Selma to Montgomery March] you know, I mean we just tried to make sure that we had a presence in these activities.
Speaker 1: So the right for racial justice at this time, in the mid-'60s [1960s], in Northern California, it seems like maybe your racial problems were not as severe as they were in other parts of the country.
Speaker 2: They, they--well, let me just do it by city.  In San Francisco [California], which was a very heavy unionized town, you had worker discriminations that, that, that reflected itself in different pay levels, different benefit levels, not so much discrimination around race.  So the Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] was involved in economic justice issues, same would be true of Oakland [California].  And while I'm sure there was discrimination, it didn't manifest itself as much and as, as rigid as you would see in the South.  I mean there were not segregated hotels.  You, if you didn't go, you didn't go because you couldn't pay.  It wasn't like you were prohibited from participation, same is true of all the other areas of, of the West Coast.  I think because of the war effort and the experience that people had, you know, interacting with each other during those years, prevented that from being used by the authorities or anything like that.  And what you wound up with was an incredibly homogeneous movement.  When there were demonstrations, there were, it was diverse demonstrators.  You know, I mean it wasn't like it was blacks demonstrating against whites.  It was blacks and whites and Hispanics demograting--demonstrating against the system.
Story_ID: 608989
Speaker 1: So as president of the local, the si- Local 1675 of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675], were you supportive of any particular political candidates?  I mean, JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is in office in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Well, we, our local--let me, let me back up a ways to some of the big issues that we got engaged in.  And I don't, I don't remember the years, but let me just--certainly the issues.  The, the, the farm workers who probably--if there was any single group that needed a union, it was the farm workers.  And we helped to support and start, you know, Cesar Chavez, Larry Itliong, Dolores Huerta in their efforts to organize, you know, farm workers.  We got engaged in what we called fair housing issues.  Unknown to us, you know, the question of can an African American with a price to buy a house that the seller advertises, can he buy it?  And that turned into a great debate.  And our first or our earlier institutional engagements in this kind issue was around what was then called Proposition 14 [California Proposition 14], that in effect said that if I list my house, I have the right to refuse to sell, even if offered the selling price.  And we, we thought that was more, one of the more--broader discriminatory acts.  And, and not knowing who's at, at the core of this, well, it turned out to be the, the realtors reserved this right.  So we got very much engaged statewide in an effort to defeat that proposition, and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your specific battles or strategies?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I mean we went in and tested the law to see--you know, we'd, we'd have folks show up with a check for the selling price, or we'd go in and interview and see if the sellers or their agents would use any way race as a, as a criteria for making the determination.  I mean we, we tried to find out everything we could about it, and, and we fought it up and down the state.  We joined the governor's office, at that time Governor Pat Brown, in trying to say that I mean we--this is an, an unconstitutional proposition.  We got involved in the war effort.  I mean we tried to be a local union that was reflective of the concerns of our, our members in the workforce.
Speaker 1: What was your position on the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: We were opposed to it, and participated in the, in town hall meetings and debates and seminars on the war effort itself.
Speaker 1: Why were you against the war as a union?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we--that--two reasons, one, we weren't comfortable with the reason for it, and turned out we were fairly accurate.  Secondly, the, the, the cost of the war was draining resources, in our opinion, away from more positive things that could be done in a social sense: schools, hospitals, clinics, you know.  And we were never comfortable with the reason for, for being there.  And again, the, those who were selected to participate, you know, you're, you're still having you know working class people, young people being called on to fight a war that we just weren't, weren't comfortable with the reason for it.
Story_ID: 608990
Speaker 1: So you were the local president [of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] for a while.  What was next for you?  You were local president from 1965 until '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: I think it was a little bit longer--I don't--I'm not sure how--I think it was about three years, two or three years.  But we--in the, the Goldwater-Johnson [Barry Goldwater and President Lyndon Baines Johnson] years, we were certainly (unclear) with the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] years--we never institutionally identified with any particular candidate.  We tried more to find one that sort of reflected the same kinds of concerns that we did, and it was worth it to, to do that.  We had some very clear strategies and that was to build a union that spanned the areas that our people worked in and use the union as an instrument of, of raising a level of awareness about what's right and what's wrong in the political system.  Probably the first one we worked against was Goldwater.  And part of it was educational, part of it was dirty tricks, but you know, it was trying to make sure that, that that philosophy didn't, didn't stick.  I mean I think there's a campaign slogan in those days was "In Your Heart, You Know He's Right," you know, which sort of spoke to a new kind of individual right to discriminate.  You know, I mean, so we, we worked on that campaign, and we worked on the Kennedy campaign prior to that but not as an endorsed candidate.
Speaker 1: What about the role of communism in the labor rights movement?  Did you see communism--
Speaker 2: We didn't see it--
Speaker 1: --filtering in?
Speaker 2: --as, as a, we didn't, we didn't see it as an issue (unclear).  I think that that area of the country had left the center politics all along, and we didn't really get into big debates about the kind of economic system that people were living with or living under.  We didn't see our role or responsibility as advocating for government policy.  And we had--and during those days, maybe even prior to it, the House Un-American Activities Committee had gone on this series of hearings around the country where pretty much any leader with a labor card was perceived to be, you know, some sort of a Communist sympathizer.  Well, we just considered that to be silly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so McCarthyism was alive and well, but--
Speaker 2: But I mean it wasn't something that we dwelled on, and we didn't check our members', you know, bloodline to see whether or not they believed in--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this wasn't one of the principal philosophies of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --the organization.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  We, I mean I think we were very public sector, public service committed but with a sort of a streak of independence that argued that, that, that our job is to represent the interest of our members and, and our workers, not to defend the government against communism or defend communism against, against the government.
Story_ID: 608991
Speaker 1: And in Northern California at this time, of course anti-war efforts were really exaggerated, I mean more dramatic than in other parts of the country.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you, you said that you guys were involved in those efforts.  Was there any sort of partnerships with, with different universities or different--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --social groups around--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --the war [Vietnam War]?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean what we tried to do was reflect what we thought our workers' and our members' [of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] position was and their views.  The fact that, you know, the rich and well to do could get a deferment and go to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] or someplace and if you were poor you got to go to Vietnam, well, that, that seemed to be, to be a, a little bit out of the ordinary, and so we protested the unfairness of, of the process.  And I mean we had people who had different views, mind you; it wasn't like this was a monolithic thing.  But certainly, the majority of the views were that, that we should let our voices be heard in what we thought was an unfair system of selecting those to go and fight.
Story_ID: 608992
Speaker 1: When did you become active on a national scale with AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]?
Speaker 2: In 1964, as I mentioned earlier, Jerry Wurf was having this national debate about public sector trade unionism, and we became, you know, really engaged with that.  And he ran for president twice.  He ran once in 1962, I believe it was, and our local, you know, did what we could, but he didn't win in '62 [1962].  He came back in '64 [1964], and we became sort of a centerpiece of the California support system.  In that year the convention was in Denver, Colorado I believe, and we participated as a, as a Wurf ally and sort of a core group in California, and he won the election in 1964.  And part of what we had argued, you know, two things is one, that California itself was just so important to the country as a whole, that there really needed to be a restructuring of the union activity in California so that it had some, some clearer focus.  And that we believed in, in almost community unionism, for lack of a better definition, in that our union ought to be more than just sort of a nine to five [o'clock] institution, but it ought to really get engaged heavily in, in public policy questions.  And out of that discussion, you know, came the notion that--or recognition I should say--that, that AFSCME had no legislative or political presence other than maybe in some big cities: New York [New York], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And when he won the election, the question, how do we structure the union, you know, to begin to play a larger role in, in public policy questions?  I mean what we realized, that the federal government, because of its grant authority, was playing a much greater role in local government, you know, education, economic development, social services, you know, highway constru- all those kinds of things, and we needed to have a voice in that process.  So the decision was made apparently by Wurf and others at that time that we should have a department of legislation and what we called community affairs.  So after the election in '64 [1964], they set about, you know, restructuring the union.  In '65 [1965], at a time when I was still president of the local [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675], the question rai- was raised is, do we want to participate in these ideas we had before?  Do we want to participate in the restructuring of California?  Do we want to participate in the, a construction of this new department?  And you know, we said, yeah, but we didn't think that meant, you know, changing jobs or anything (laughter).  So our local union became engaged in helping to restructure California, you know, so that we could maximize our power.  The offer was then made: do you want to come to Washington [D.C.] and work on this, you know, Department of Legislation and Community Affairs with a job of setting up a national program and then developing state and local government programs as a part of that?  And this discussion went on for about a year.  And then finally I decided, okay, I would, would look at, at that, but I didn't know anything about it.  I mean if there was gonna be somebody we would work together in trying to do it, I would do it.  So a fellow by the name of Al Bilik out of Ohio, the two of us were supposed to take this program on.  And he--
Speaker 1: You said Al Bullock?
Speaker 2: Bilik, B-I-L-I-K.  So we agreed to, to start this about the middle of 1966.  And I had been with the county [Contra Costa County Public Works Department] by that time for thirteen years.  So, I decided I would come back and be his associate in the construction of this department.  Well, I came back, and he never did, at least not in that role.
Speaker 1: So you moved to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: In 1966?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was your title?
Speaker 2: Associate director of the Department of Legislation and Community Affairs.
Speaker 1: So was that a big decision making moment for you because you left your job in engineering, and you left this local power?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the, the commitment was we would do this for one year.  And since, you know, constructing the department was a goal, we figured a year we ought to be able to have that done.  It was a pretty good size decision leaving essentially a place where you'd grown up.  And it was a decision that had to be talked over with family and folks.  So the--and I'd talked it over with the wife [Dorotheria Rader Lucy], and she said, "How long you gonna do this?"  And I looked right in her face and lied.  (Laughter) I said, "One year and we'll be back home."  And it's, it's been forty-four or forty-five year- (laughter).
Story_ID: 608993
Speaker 1: What year did you get married, and tell me your wife's full name?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-three [1953].  Her name is Dorotheria Lucy, D-O-R-O-T-H-E-R-I-A, Lucy, L-U-C-Y, maiden name, Rader, R-A-D-E-R [Dorotheria Rader Lucy].
Speaker 1: And where did you meet?
Speaker 2: Junior high school [Roosevelt Junior High School, Richmond, California].  We had pretty much, you know--junior high school, high school, all those years.  And I'm trying to think.  That'd been the, the late, mid to late forty--about '40s [1940s], yeah--mid to late '50s [1950s].  What am I saying?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you have any kids?
Speaker 2: We had three kids.  Our oldest was William, Jr. [William Lucy, Jr.].
Speaker 1: What year was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in March of '54 [1954] and passed away in '76 [1976].  And our daughter was born in April--geez, I'm a get beat up--April of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Tell me her name.
Speaker 2: Benita, B-E-N-I-T-A, Lucy, married name Marsh, M-A-R-S-H [Benita Lucy Marsh].  And then our youngest daughter, Phyllis, P-H-Y-L-L-I-S, Manuel, M-A-N-U-E-L [Phyllis Lucy Manuel], born in December of '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Oh.  Wait, so Benita was born in April.
Speaker 2: What did I, what did I give you--
Speaker 1: You said April 1957.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry.  Back up--December of '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were busy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the '50s [1950s] you were busy at work and busy at home.
Story_ID: 608994
Speaker 1: So first impressions of Washington, D.C., in 1966?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, frankly, I was just overwhelmed.  While I had come back for a couple of days in 1965, but really was sort of confined to a hotel and didn't get a chance to see the city.  But in '66 [1966], when we came, I had the responsibility of looking for a place to stay and all that kind of stuff.  We really got a chance to see what I thought was history beyond belief in the city and was really impressed with the fact that, you know, here's this center of world power, you know (laughter), I mean center of government and all kinds of important discussions, debates, and decisions are made here.  And for, for me having only lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and Richmond California, this was, this was the deal.  And you know, Washington was a, was, was really just an incredible experience then, as it continues to be now.
Story_ID: 608995
Speaker 1: And what were some of your early responsibilities with AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] on a national scale?
Speaker 2: Well, initial responsibility was to try and put this department [Department of Legislation and Community Affairs] together, one that would have the ability and, and capability to, you know, represent, you know, the various interests of our union at the federal level of government.  For instance, social service policies that many of our people are social service workers, in county government, in city responsibilities.  Many of our folks worked in highway construction, as, as, as, as I did.  In the various legislative issues that related to that, you know, we wanted to make sure our voices were heard.  We had incredible numbers of people who worked in school boards, who were food service workers, who were custodians.  So all of those issues we had to become familiar with, and at the same time, try to develop a structure that could make sure our, our involvement had meaning.  And this is kind of pretty heady stuff for me, I had never really done it as needed here other than on a county, you know, basis, as I said, appeared before the board of supervisors.
Story_ID: 608996
Speaker 1: Were you active with any specific political leaders here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I was lucky enough to get to know people at all levels of, of, of government--
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: --here in the city.  You know, at that time, the, the city did not have a formal mayoral and, and members of the city council system, but here were leaders here over various departments of city government that we had a chance to know.  But I think more importantly for me, I got a real opportunity to meet the Adam Clayton Powells [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and, and the, the Kennedys and the Wayne Morses, I mean people who were really in, in political roles that really affected the direction of the country.
Speaker 1: So you're meeting--your first meeting with Adam Clayton Powell or your meetings over the years, what can you tell me?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I mean he was such, just such a dynamic figure.  We wound up, at that time, representing employees who worked in the Panama Canal Zone, who were Panamanians by ni- by, by birth--but worked for the defense department [U.S. Department of Defense] and the canal zone company [Panama Canal Company] and one of these unusual situations where workers who built the canal zone who had passed on but who had survivors left, the question of their wellbeing, the question of wages or benefits that may have been owed to them.  And then the differential--and here's one of the really discriminatory roles that our government play in different places--a, a worker working side by side with a U.S. citizen but born in the, in the Republic of Panama, differentials in pay, same job.  And the argument was that what they used to call tropical differentials.  Well, if you're born in, in, in Panama, you know, what's the differential for?  (Laughter) I mean you had two workers, same country, doing the same thing being paid differently.  So it became an, an, an issue that we wanted resolution to, and I, I, in one of my early meeting with, with Congressman Powell, talked about that issue and the issue of survivor benefits for those who were related to those who'd, who'd construct the canal, you know, social security benefits and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So what kind of guy was he?
Speaker 2: I, I mean he was just very understanding, very sympathetic to the cause, and very willing to help out.  And he turned me over to one of his aides, a fellow by the name of [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, from whom I learned how this process worked.  I mean and (laughter) Chuck made the point, you can know all these guys you want to know, but it's us who get the work done.  And I re- I sort of remember that to this day.
Story_ID: 608997
Speaker 1: But you had representatives like Congressman Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], later on, you know, Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], Shirley Chisholm.
Speaker 2: What was Shirley Chisholm like?
Speaker 1: Nothing exciting, just incredibly upfront lady.  You know, she came out of sort of a New York [New York] political environment, and she brought all of that to Washington, D.C., very people focused, very people oriented.
Speaker 2: Can you recall any specific memories with her?
Speaker 1: Nothing other than when you meet with them on an issue.  It didn't take all day to understand what the problem was.  And they--and she would tell you where she stood on it right now, either she's for it, or she's not for it, but you didn't have to wonder about it.  And if she was for it, she would put all of her time, energy, and effort trying to move the issue.  We took on the issue of minimum wage coverage for workers in Panama, you know, which may sound like a fairly simple proposition.  But there was a system where workers in some U.S. facilities were tied to workers in Panama by some law that [U.S.] Congress had passed.  So we were trying to benefit both groups by simply making this system equal.  And that's when you really run into sort of historical discriminatory policies towards workers in foreign countries, even though they're working under a U.S. territorial arrangement.  And again, Powell and, and others, once you laid it out to them where they could see what the issue was, became terribly interested.
Speaker 2: And you would meet with them in their Capitol Hill offices [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean we had a regular legislative program, I mean in, in issues that you would follow through Congress, either, in some cases, getting them introduced, or once they were introduced, getting bill in support for them.
Speaker 2: You mentioned the Kennedys.  Which Kennedys did you know?
Speaker 1: Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy], when he went to the [U.S.] Senate; never had the opportunity to met Jack Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Right.  What was Robert Kennedy like?  Tell me about your interaction.  Where was it, and when?
Speaker 1: It was on the same piece of legislation: dealing with workers in the Republic of Panama.  He was on the particular committee that this was assigned to, and was trying to build political support for it, and went to see him about it.
Speaker 2: What did he say?
Speaker 1: He recognized the problem and indicated he was willing to work with us on it.  And we, we finally, interestingly enough, under the, some particular interstate commerce clause was able to get a vote on this proposition, and we won.  And that's when we were--learned that winning does not necessarily produce a positive result (laughter).  In, in, in the Republic of Panama, at that time, that was the headquarters for the [U.S.] Southern Command, and Panama was essentially ran by the [U.S.] Army, not by the government.  So we won our issue, which was an increase in pay and benefits for the survivors and minimum wage, and the Army simply refused to implement it, you know, and, and told us how much they sympathized with us, and perhaps they would take it up one day (laughter).  But, I mean those were, were, were learning days for me, I mean how the process works.
Story_ID: 608998
Speaker 1: Well, then in 1968 you got involved with a very pivotal, important historically issue, and that is in Memphis, Tennessee, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sanitation workers strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  How did you get involved in that?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was assigned in the latter part of '67 [1967] to Detroit [Michigan] for, for a little while.  And we heard in the early part of '68 [1968]--I forget--maybe late January, early February, of the possibilities of, of this strike action in Memphis.  In, in 1966 or maybe as early as '67 [1967] there had been some effort to strike in Memphis, Tennessee.  But the court or a judge had issued an injunction against this action, and, and whatever it was was called off.  And when this came up in '68 [1968] again, it seemed like there was more momentum behind it.  And I was asked to go down and see what it was and see what could be done to resolve it.  And I was assigned to Detroit at the time.  Unknown to me at the time, two workers had gotten crushed in the back of a sanitation packing truck.
Speaker 1: Robert Walker and Echol Cole.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first name I knew; the second one I didn't know at the time.  But that was sort of the, the, the, the culmination of a long series of, of issues between the workforce and the city around health and safety issues, around sanitation questions.  The men had had sort of a loose union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733], but it wasn't recognized by the city.  The city went through a charter change from a sort of a departmental structure to a strong mayor form of government.
Speaker 1: And there was a new mayor also, right?
Speaker 2: Brand new mayor, brand new mayor with incredible authority and these--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --perceived--
Speaker 1: Mayor Loeb at the time.
Speaker 2: Henry Loeb, yeah.  And this occurred right after the election.  And the mayor had won this election with essentially no support from the black community.  So this event, you know, sort of escalates, and the workers, you know, demanded recognition of their union so they could at least have a voice at problem--on problems like this.  I'm not altogether sure they perceived collective bargaining as an end goal, but they certainly wanted to be able to talk about safety, and health, and disciplinary procedures, a grievance process.
Speaker 1: And there was a big problem with wages as well, right, for the sanitation workers?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was a problem with wages, no question, not just with the sanitation workers but with virtually all workers but unique to the sanitation department.  But this was not a strike about wages.  The, the strike was really an effort to get recognition for the union and its role to represent workers in this process.  And when, when these two men were, were killed, the fact that the city had no, there was no insurance; there was no pensions or anything like this, and, and, and in those days we found out even no burial plan--I mean folks had to collect money--and certainly nothing to take care of the family, so this became sort of a centerpiece in this confrontation with the city.  And you had a mayor and a city council who were moving into a very new political role and responsibility.
Story_ID: 608999
Speaker 1: I went down and didn't really fully understand all of the dynamics of these two deaths, but it certainly seemed simple.  I mean this is an issue that can be resolved.  Any reasonable people would sit down and say well, you know.  If you want to know how to fix something, ask the people who do it.  If you want to know how something--make something safer, ask the people who've got to work on it.  I came back to Detroit [Michigan] and reported that there was obviously, you know, some concern, but it didn't seem like it was anything that was gonna be earth shaking.  But I didn't know the, didn't know the personalities and didn't, didn't know the views of the mayor [Henry Loeb] in terms of his newfound power.  On February 12th of '68 [1968], the men, in fact, struck.  I went down the night before I think it was, because it was clear by then there was gonna be something.  Myself, a fellow by the name of Jesse Epps, a fellow by the name of Joe Paisley [Joseph Paisley], and our, at that time, the director of organization, a fellow by the name of P.J. Ciampa, and we, we went down to try and figure out what we could do to help 'cause this is not a strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] that we caused.  I mean no union in its right mind would call a strike in February, you know, (laughter) not, certainly not sanitation.  And we thought we had a fairly simple thing, you know, just sit down with whoever was in charge and, and talk about how we, you know, resolve this work stoppage.  But you know, the, the workers after all these years had just become fed up.
Speaker 2: 'Cause some of them were even on welfare because the wages were so low and--
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't know this at the time.  What, what we had was a, was a work stoppage over, you know, just the lack of responsible government for folks who want to have something to say about their job.  It wasn't until, you know, we got into the thing 'til we really recognized what the economic problems were.  We were trying to meet with the mayor to develop some procedures to get agreement on a grievance process, to talk about how men were selected for work.  Probably, you know, im- equally important with the deaths of the two men [Robert Walker and Echol Cole], was the fact that on one day, heavy rain.  Everybody went out to work and apparently had a policy that, you know, some people could, could, could be sent home, and others would stay working.  Well, they, they sent home the sanitation workers after they had showed up and gone out to start working, which was essentially an all-black workforce.  But there were other workers who remained on the job and got full pay.  And this became really a turning point in that relationship.  The strike occurred.  We had to search around for issues.  I mean we just did not fully understand what was all going place--or taking place.  And so, we tried to give leadership to the strikers based on our knowledge of these kinds of things from before.  But it turned into a major, major activity.  I mean as, as you pointed out, once we discovered what the wage levels were, I mean people were working full time and still qualified for welfare.  The promotion policies were nonexistent.  There's conditions under which men worked--in those days, policy was that garbage was in the backyard.  You had to go back and get it, and you'd dump it from whatever it was in into a big tub, and you had to bring that tub around to the street and put it in the back of the car.  I mean it was just, it just in- incredible.  (Unclear) and I suspect Memphis [Tennessee] was not much different than a lot of other cities, except you may not have had the southern, you know, emphasis and the, the, the racial injustices that could be added on top of the type of work that you were doing.
Story_ID: 609000
Speaker 1: Was Memphis [Tennessee] a different place than the Memphis you had left years before?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so; I don't think so.  It was still, you know, rigidly segregated.  And since when I left before, I really didn't understand a lot of the broader issues that were, was taking place.  What I did know when I came back is there was no sort of rational reason for this kind of confrontation between men who did important work and dirty work in a city that refused to do anything to, to straighten it out.  I had worked in Detroit [Michigan] and other places where, you know, you see a problem, and the question is now how do you fix the problem?  Not, you know, we're in charge and therefore we'll decide whenever we (unclear)--want to decide.  So Memphis struck me as odd in that way.  But again, I go back to the point this was a brand new government with a brand new set of powers for, for the mayor's office.  And the mayor was a fellow by the name of Henry Loeb, who was pretty much taken up with himself.  He was a former patrol boat, you know, naval officer, big fellow, about 6'4", 6'5", and really had, you know, sort of king outlook (laughter).  I mean, he was in charge of this place, and, and nobody was gonna, gonna tell him anything.
Speaker 1: In fact, didn't people call him King Loeb?
Speaker 2: During the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  I mean, people came up with a lot of names for him.  One of them was King Loeb (laughter).  But bull headed, I mean, it was, it was, once he made up his mind about something, no matter what the facts were, he wasn't gonna change.
Speaker 1: How many times did you meet with the mayor?
Speaker 2: About five times, maybe, maybe a few more.
Speaker 1: And did you meet with him alone or with your co-wor- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Always with someone, and you know, because he took a strange view of the strike and would, would never want to discuss it, you know.  As a matter of fact, he didn't want to discuss it at all because he declared us illegal; therefore, he would violate the law if he met and spoke with us, which, again, is a very strange perception.  And, and we thought that here was a situation that could be resolved in one day.  As a matter of fact, we did on two occasions, you know, settle what were the issues in the strike at that time.  And each time either advise or pressure or, or public pressure caused him to disavow any, any, any solution.  And the last--the second time was a total solution.  And then some of his people--we're not sure who--sort of leaked out that the mayor had conceded to these new principles.  And then the newspaper ran a headline story the following day that Loeb concedes.  And then the, the public pressure from that headline caused him to disavow the, the, the agreement, and we just went on from there.
Story_ID: 609001
Speaker 1: How did Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] get involved?
Speaker 2: This occurred at the time Dr. King was, was, was following up on two things: one, his view that labor and religion were nat- natural allies on trying to change the conditions under which a lot of, you know, working people live, and particularly the working poor.  The other was he was in the process of organizing the Poor People's Campaign, which was headed for Washington, D.C. later on in, in '68 [1968], because '68 [1968] was a year that he wanted to demonstrate that there are just hundreds of thousands of poor people here in the country from all races and ethnic groups.  So when the, when the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] occurred, he was moving through Mississippi doing his mobilizing.  And we were I don't know about halfway into the life of the strike, when fellow by the name of James Lawson really thought that, that Dr. King could, could aid in the morale of the strikers, plus, you know, bring some added publicity to what was taking place.  You know, some of the dynamics of that taking place earlier in the strike was, you know, the city and its using its authority was beating up workers and arresting people and all kinds of things.  So the strike had taken on a community struggle.  The African American community had ultimately realized that the, the struggle of the strikers were, were, in effect, their struggle also, you know, low wages, no benefits, lack of respect, no dignity.  And this was essentially what had been before this election and had been reinforced since the election.  So, you know, while people didn't rush to aid the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733], they did see a need to aid the strikers, and so pretty soon this marriage came together.  Lawson talked to Dr. King about this struggle.  This is a struggle of the working poor.  And Dr. King finally saw it as that and agreed to make a stop in Memphis [Tennessee] during his mobilizing tour.  And he, he was impressed by this struggle that was taking place and by the determination of the men to, to hold on until they could get their union, because if they didn't have a union, they, they were doomed in terms of future relationship with the city.
Speaker 1: Describe your first meeting with Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Well as, as a young fellow, I was just sort of overwhelmed, you know, by, you know, by him and his presence and his both perception of and understanding of what this struggle was about.  I mean Dr. King, while he's called a great civil rights fighter, which he was, but he also was an incredibly, you know, you know, astute workers' rights person I mean.  He had been supportive of workers' rights and unions for some time before Memphis, but was--it's easier to call him a civil rights, you know, fighter than it is to even presume that there's a broader mission that he sees.  And I remember him saying that, you know, like, here's a classic contradiction in our system, where people who live every day but still qualify for welfare.  That's, there's something wrong with that picture.  And so he was very supportive of the workers getting an instrument that would be able to help them in their dealings with, with the city, and, and the powers that be.
Story_ID: 609002
Speaker 1: Where were you when you first met him [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: At the, (makes sounds) guess at a church meeting prior to a speech at Mason Temple [Mason Temple Church of God in Christ, Memphis, Tennessee].  And this was before the April 3rd speech.  This was when he came the first time.
Speaker 1: What was he like personality wise?
Speaker 2: I think very interested in hearing all of the details, getting all of the facts, interested in what the motivation for this struggle is; how do you people see this.  By that time, you know, I, I as I said, this, the, that was, this was not an economic strike.  We had to really search for issues that could be negotiated I mean.  We were (unclear) scientist said you know, respect and dignity.  Well, that, you know, what does that mean?  We ultimately desel- developed a slogan, "I Am a Man," which sort of described the individual feelings that kept men struggling to, to win this thing.  And what they were essentially is that, that, you know, for all of my life I've been treated as, as less than a man.  And the refusal to sit down with me or who I have chose to speak for me, is a further, you know, reflection of your lack of respect for me as a person.
Speaker 1: So who created the slogan?  Because you were often given credit.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, there were two of us, a fellow by the name of Malcolm Blackburn, Reverend Malcolm Blackburn, who was the pastor at Clayborn Temple [Clayborn Temple A.M.E. Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  We, we were--we recognized that, that no matter how much they're committed, if there's no glue in this effort--I mean the day to day, you know, wearing down of, of the men was gonna take hold.  So we had to find something that we thought reflected their commitment to this thing.  So we were staying at the Peabody Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee], and there were meetings every night of the strategy for the next day.  And so we, we took the opportunity to just sit down and start playing with words to try and get signs, slogans and stuff like that, that would, would, would have an impact.  And Jim Lawson [James Lawson] earlier in a press conference or a statement had made the point that when an elected official refuses to talk to people, then tells them to do something, it's a disrespecting action and doesn't treat him like a man.  Well, we started playing with a lot of words, and we were trying to think of something that was fairly simple, I mean could be seen, have an impact, and we weren't even sure that that was it.  But we came up with these four words that says, "I Am a Man."  And the way they would be positioned, with, you know, not a straight line or anything like that but two and two, and it was, it, it was a strong statement.  And so Reverend Malcolm Blackburn and I in the (laughter), in the Peabody Hotel developed this thing, brought it back to the group, and that's what we went with.
Story_ID: 609003
Speaker 1: So Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] made at least three trips to Memphis [Tennessee] during that sixty-four day strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  You were starting to describe his first speech in March of that year.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think as, as, as Dr. King analyzed what was going on, that he became very, you know, understanding that this was sort of the classic confrontation, I mean between workers who worked every day, but yet, as I said, qualified for welfare benefits and, and that the system would not allow them to do any more than that.  And, and he felt very strongly and identified with them, with their desire to have a union.  He spoke at Mason Temple [Mason Temple Church of God in Christ, Memphis, Tennessee] and really got caught up in the, in, in the crowd commitment to this.  And I think he recommended at one point that we all just have a general strike, you know, which was, which was sort of, you know, pushing the envelope quite a ways.  But he was absolutely impressed that this was the kind of movement, and it was a movement at that time--it was beyond the strike thing--that could really alter the course of, of life for a lot of people in, in urban areas.  He had been preaching this and teaching this for about three or four years prior to this.  I mean I, I can recall while I wasn't there, his, his speaking to the FL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] itself in 1961 and then speaking to the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] in 1963 or '4 [1964], trying to get the religious community to understand the power that it and its members had.  (Background noise) So when he saw Memphis and that fact that the city by then, at least the black community by then, had come to support it, he was impressed with the solidarity that was being shown.  And so he, he, at, at the end of his first speech, he talked about coming back and having a march to reflect that solidarity.
Speaker 1: How was he received by the crowds?
Speaker 2: Oh, tremendous; it was incredible.
Speaker 1: Describe the scene.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean had a, that had a church that was just wild, I mean full.  He, his ability to interpret what was taking place may have been easy for him, but it was incredibly refreshing for us.  Because as, as strike leadership, the important thing was that not only did the men understand what they're doing, but their families understand, and the community understands.  And he was able to put that in perspective.  And raising it from just a level of Memphis, Tennessee, to a national and international question of, of people who work ought to receive a, a living wage.
Story_ID: 609004
Speaker 1: So what was the response of the crowd?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean it, it, it was just, just overwhelming.  I mean he--the--by then, as I said, the, the, the black community recognized that the struggle and the movement that was taking place was their movement also, because if the, if the sanitation workers lost, whatever lost meant to him, they were without political power in the city; they were without economic power; and even though the so called charter change held some possibility of influence and participation in government, they could see that going down the drain.  You had three black members of the city council at that time: [HistoryMaker] Fred Davis, J.O. Patterson [J.O. Patterson, Jr.], and Reverend James Netters.  So, I mean their seats were token seats if this thing went--was lost.
Speaker 1: Did you have white supporters?
Speaker 2: Not many at that time.  We had some from some of the agencies.  I can recall a fellow by the name of Baxton Bryant [Sidney Baxton Bryant] from the Tennessee commission on human relations [Tennessee Council on Human Relations], a couple of ministers, Frank McRae, (makes sounds) and some of the legal representatives, fellow by the name of David Caywood and Lucius Burch [Lucius E. Burch, Jr.].  I mean they--but they were not actively engaged in the day to day, you know, struggles, but they would certainly use their office to try and you know, bridge some gaps if we ever called them to do that.
Speaker 1: What was the role of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], specifically Roy Wilkins, and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] with Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy]?
Speaker 2: Well, Roy Wilkins had came at our invitation to speak because the, the problem of getting information out of Memphis [Tennessee] was a mess.  I mean we, we were in the middle of probably one of the largest public sector strikes [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] that had ever taken place, but nobody knew it.  And the local media wasn't about to, to play it up, and the national media was just disinterested.  And we thought that if we could ask some of the major civil rights leaders to come and see what's taking place, that media who was following them would come and get a sense of this excitement.  Bayard Rustin came; Roy Wilkins came but not enough media to make any difference.  Only when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came did we get some coverage.
Story_ID: 609005
Speaker 1: And the, this other promised march that was to occur--I forget the date, but sometime in--
Speaker 2: March 29th.
Speaker 1: March, yeah.  I mean the biggest blizzard, you know, hit town.  And, and in effect, the, the effort was to bring town to--the city to a halt.  You know, the blizzard accomplished that for us, you know.  And (laughter) so, so the march was rescheduled for another time, and we began to mobilize for that.  That ultimately was the march that got broken up.  And you know, everybody says well, you know, the young kids--well that really it was broken up by FBI provocateurs, people who did not want to see Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] have an impact on Memphis [Tennessee] and really because of the Poor People's Campaign, wanted to diminish his image prior to him moving that towards Washington, D.C.  And while some may disagree, I really think that the Federal Bureau of Investigation played a role in this that we have not clearly understood to this day.  We found out after the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] had ended in, oh, into the next year, Senator Sam Church [sic. Frank Church] held a series of hearings into a lot of activities.  And, and out of this came the role that the FBI was playing in the City of Memphis, which we did not understand at that time.  And turns out that he had inserted members of the FBI into the Memphis Police Department and into the young people's group that they accused of, you know, you know, you know, provoking and starting the violence.  These were FBI people whose mission was to damage the image of Dr. King, to prove that his nonviolence approach was, was, was more of a, of a ruse than it was a reality.
Story_ID: 609006
Speaker 1: At what point was the sixteen year old boy Larry Payne shot?
Speaker 2: During the, the, the point--when the breakup of the march started, I mean the police, which essentially was a police riot, Larry Payne was in another area of the city, nowhere near the march, nowhere near the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], and to best we could tell, totally unconnected to the strike.  And as we learned, or as we were told, his refusal to obey a police order, or something like this, resulted in a confrontation.  But it was, it was charged as a part of the disturbance of the strike activity itself and was totally unrelated.  Although the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] took on the responsibility for his funeral services and what have you, it, it was unrelated to the strike activity itself.
Speaker 1: But did that galvanize people even more?
Speaker 2: Well, people were pretty, pretty much galvanized already.  I mean there had been a series of, of police abuse issues.  This was just one more of them.
Speaker 1: Were you arrested during this time at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were arrested, but it--not on that day.  But that became a way of life.  I mean you could get arrested any time.  And the arrest--the, the police department [Memphis Police Department] was really used to try and break the morale of the strike.  They put in the process where they could arrest you and hold you without charges for a day, or some number of hours, on the theory that other strikers who saw their friends, allies, coworkers in jail and not out of jail might start to think, you know, have second thoughts about the strike.  So we had to work out a process where bail was always available in what they used to call a peace bond.  And you never knew what price you were gonna put in it, so we always had to have cash on hand to bail people out if they wanted to come out.  But it was, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have to bail out any of these national leaders?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Roy Wilkins bailed the rest of them--none of this occurred with them.  This was with people on strike.
Speaker 1: What about the local leader, T.O. Jones?  Did you have interaction with him at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, from the very start, a very amazing man.  You know, he, he was not a Harvard graduate [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but he had the capacity to keep people together and focus on sort of an agreed upon goal.  I think he and Robert Beasley and a fellow by the name of Joe Warren, all of these were, they were sanitation men, and they understood each other.  They understood the nature of the work and the camaraderie that went with that.  And I think the courage they had and, and the commitment to this struggle was essentially what won this.  It's not any brilliant strategy.  It was just the, the commitment that they had made, and they were willing to see this thing through to the end.  And I think that impressed Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] also.
Story_ID: 609007
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was planning a trip to Africa when he was I guess encouraged to come back to Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I, I--he was going somewhere.  I don't recall, but I know he, he had just came out of Marks, Mississippi, where he had seen I guess, you know, poverty in its starkest sense.  And Jim convinced him to come take a look at Memphis and what was going on, Jim Lawson [James Lawson].  And he, and he did, and he just, he was just overwhelmed with the contradictions, and agreed to speak that first time, and then saw even more of the solidarity between the community and the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733], and agreed to lead the second march.  When the first march was broken up, the, the overwhelming pressure to have a nonviolent march was on Dr. King himself, because the voices were screaming, you know, all kinds of things, and he just felt that the violence jeopardized the Poor People's Campaign.  You know, he was gonna bring thousands of people to the Mall [National Mall] in Washington, D.C., and the violence of Memphis would be used as a rationale to, to prohibit that kind of (unclear) so he had to have a peaceful march.  And you had the opinion makers and the newspapers questioning his status as a, as a leader.  And you raised the question about SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  I, I think SCLC was totally committed to the Poor People's Campaign and saw Memphis as a distraction, and, and legitimately so.  I mean there's, there's no way to predict how long this would go on, what the outcomes would be, and, and so they did not want to get bogged down in Memphis.  And, and, and, and we were totally committed to this thing.  I mean we, we did--we--on a daily basis.  Well, we never expected him to get committed to it on a daily basis.  We just thought that his personal, you know, show of participation would sort of solidify even more the support of the community.  And I think it's, it's, it's fair to say that, you know, that the way support evolved was important to the ultimate outcome I mean.  When we had the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], nobody in Memphis particularly knew about or cared about unions.  It was not a pro-union environment, and particularly one that's talked about sanitation workers.  And we had to have a strategy for mobilizing the community and taking a look at where, where was the influence and the power centers in the black community that could be brought to understand this.  And it goes back to the church.  It goes back to those individuals in the community that has been successful.
Story_ID: 609008
Speaker 1: So we did two things.  We, we knew it was important that people understand what's going on.  So the, the men who had a route, they had a numbers of houses to serve every day, so we had them take a leaflet to every house on their route so that the taxpayers would get sort of a firsthand indication of what's, what's this [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] about.  We then sent a letter from them to their church leadership.  The first two people to come our aid, so to speak, or to even inquire in person what was going on was a lady by the name of Cornelia Crenshaw and a fellow by the name of O.Z. Evers.  And they recommended that we do this letter to the preachers.  And they were community activists.  And, but they said your workers are members of these congregations.  And I'd, I'd like to be able to say that, that letter produced instant support.  That was not the case (laughter), because people thought they were getting connected with a union, and, and they didn't understand this fellow by the name of Gilbert Patterson [Gilbert E. Patterson], who was just a local pastor at that time but later became the bishop of the Church of God in Christ, passed away five, six months ago.  He was the first one who would, who opened his church [Holy Temple Church of God in Christ, Memphis, Tennessee] up to hear what the men had to say.  I sometimes use the phrase that Memphis [Tennessee] had a lot of big churches but very little room in them (laughter).  But he opened up his church and got himself involved, not in the core but on the periphery.  What really triggered I think the massive support was the fact that the police assaulted the workers on their march from city hall back to their church and really for the first time really tested mace as a crowd control weapon.  And there were lots of, of the religious community and others who came to the meeting at the city hall because they thought we had a solution.  Well, when the solution unraveled and the march started from city hall to Clayborn Temple [Clayborn Temple A.M.E. Church, Memphis, Tennessee], those religious leaders were right in the march with sanitation workers.  And among them, at the top of this was a, was a fellow by the name of Ralph, H. Ralph Jackson, who was probably one of your most upstanding African Americans in the community but he didn't see himself as a union sympathizer.  Well, him and others got maced and beat up right along with the sanitation workers, in spite of the fact that they had on suits and ties (laughter).  But you know, that galvanized in their mind what this was about.  And I overheard Dr. Jackson say that, that he became an instant convert.  Because here was one of the most successful African Americans in town, and it didn't matter whether he was wearing a new suit, a new hat.  He was in the street with other black workers and was treated fundamentally the same.  He became a convert, and, and, and the, the religious support just began to pour in.  We had developed a strategy of a rally every day and a meeting every night.
Story_ID: 609009
Speaker 1: And so tell me about that, that pivotal day, April 3rd to April 4th.
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came back for the April 3rd speech at, at Mason Temple [Mason Temple Church of God in Christ, Memphis, Tennessee].  And we had spent a good deal of time mobilizing for that, I mean every church in town, school kids.  I mean we were planning for the big march that would take place, and we set this mass meeting for April 3rd as a, as a, a, a preparation, buildup for that.  And I--it's hard to judge how many people had--just thousands of people showed up for this meeting.  And Dr. King was not feeling well, as I understand it, and actually sent Ralph over--asked Ralph to go over and speak in his stead.
Speaker 1: Ralph Abernathy?
Speaker 2: Ralph, Ralph Abernathy.  In the first march, the one that was broken up, they were staying at the Rivermont Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee], which was sort of at that time the headquarters hotel for the Holiday chain [Holiday Inn].  And when the march was broken up, Jim Lawson [James Lawson] and others took Dr. King back to the hotel.  And the, the media, and particularly I guess the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], whoever made great issue of the fact that he left the march, he ran, and was holed up in this big hotel, you know, while the workers were down in the street, dah, dah, dah.  So that had an impact.  When they came back for the second march, they were staying at the Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee], and, and except he, he asked Ralph to go over and speak to this rally for him.  And this was the ugly night.  I mean Ralph got there, there are just so many people there.  I mean, they would have listened to him, but they didn't want to hear him.  I mean (laughter), I'm no--no disrespect, but I mean they anticipated hearing from Dr. King.  So, Ralph sent word back that that he had to come, because this was just such an incredible movement that his presence was, was absolutely essential.  So Dr. King did, you know, prepare to deliver what has become known as the mountaintop speech [I've Been to the Mountaintop], and it was an incredible night.
Speaker 1: Describe the crowd's response.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just, yeah, I mean it's just overwhelming.  Just it's, it's hard to, to, to, to even define how people felt.  I mean they had got caught up so much in this movement.
Speaker 1: They were standing and cheering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, just standing and cheering and yelling and screaming.  And we had set up a relatively elaborate fundraising system to support the, the strikers.  I mean we were using fifty-five gallon garbage cans to collect money in.  You know, I mean, and, and it was just, I mean it's just hard to, to define how it was coming in.  And his speech was really without question the highlight of the, of the evening.  And, and he, in effect, was telling a story of, of struggle, and, I mean, and the people were just electrified.  And some say that he had some sort of a premonition of, of, of, of, of death.  I'm not sure that's true.  I think he was telling a story.  And those of us who were staffing this thing saw this night as being, you know, radically different than other nights that we had, because we had a, we had a rally every night.  But there was just something, really something different about this night and the, and the sermon that he chose to deliver.  And at, at the end of it, you know, people were crying and, and applauding and stand- (laughter) I mean it was, it was a ver- incredibly electrifying evening.
Story_ID: 609010
Speaker 1: The next day, when (gesture)--
Speaker 2: Did you talk to him after that speech [I've Been to the Mountaintop]?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  He spoke.  He, as a matter of fact, I think he and Jerry Wurf were sitting together.  And--
Speaker 2: And Jerry Wurf, again, president of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was very active as well?
Speaker 1: Oh, in the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], yeah, yeah, I mean virtually--I don't think he left maybe once.  He was down there a month and a half or something like that.
Speaker 2: Were you there consistently?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was there from day one to day end, and sometime beyond that.  But the, I mean the, the, the city was on a--I mean the, the black community was on an absolute high.  And the march was really not a march of confrontation; it was a march of demonstration more than anything else.  And I think the powers to be were just scared to death of, of, of the magnitude of the turnout in this thing.  And by then--
Speaker 2: How many people?
Speaker 1: --we did have a considerable amount of white support, members of the city council [Memphis City Council] who may not had been committed but was certainly interested in the issues.  I, I can remember and with, with fondness, a fellow by the name of Jared Blanchard, who was very conservative but began to understand that there's something going on here that, that we need to look at.  There was a fellow by the name of Lou Donelson [Lewis Donelson], who had been doing his best as an individual member of the council to get council people to get involved and engaged.
Story_ID: 609011
Speaker 1: So what happened on April 4th?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the preparation for the march was, was going on.  And prior to the assassination, I mean the staff [of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees], we had a meeting at sort of the headquarters down at the what we called the Minimum Salary Building [A.M.E. Minimum Salary Building, Memphis, Tennessee] and trying to get responsibilities and, and, and meted out for the march and all that kind of stuff.  Because learning from the first march, we recognized that you just couldn't have loose marches all over the place; I mean it had to be organized, you had to have marshals, you had to have some understandings with the police department.  A lot of that had to be done, so we're sort of getting square on those issues.  And we're listening to the radio, and the word comes over the radio that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been shot.  And we were less than five minutes from the Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee], I mean our office, and we had, had police passes to move around.  So in less than five minutes we were from our--from the Minimum Salary Building to the Lorraine Motel.  And for me some of the ironies was that, you know, the police was already there when we got there, and we were closer than they were.  They were keeping folks out as opposed to keeping folks in, in this area.  And apparently, Dr. King and others had been speaking with some folks down below, and it turns out Reverend Billy Kyles [HistoryMaker Reverend Samuel Billy Kyles] and, and there, a couple of musicians.  I'm trying to remember the name now.  But anyhow, they were talking from upstairs to downstairs when the shot was fired.  And that scene was still taking place when we arrived.  Yet the police were keeping folks out of the area but no medical assistance there by that time to deal with what was taking place up on the balcony.  There's a, there's a great photo--I'm trying to think of it.  There's a guy there [Joseph Louw] from I think the New York Post or The New York Times who took this photo of people pointing, because someone from down below yelled, "Where'd the shot come from?"  And everybody who was on the balcony was pointing to the, the boarding house when this shot was taken--this photo was taken.  I mean the city went into chaos, you know, once the word got further and further and further out.  And we were concerned about, you know, police behavior at that time, so we, I, we, we held a, a, a, a meeting to decide what are we gonna do in the next hour, hour and a half.  So the decision was to go to as many places in town as we could and talk to people about, stay off the street, stay out of confrontation with the police department, try and keep the city as calm as, as we could.  And you know, as things began to roll, you know, Memphis [Tennessee] stayed relatively calm compared to other cities.  And I think it was because people really got out, knowing what could possibly happen with the Memphis Police Department.  We tried to keep as many kids off the street, keep as many adults off the street as possible.  If people were gonna travel, let's travel by cars, in multiple cars, so you don't get isolated treatment.
Story_ID: 609012
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When did you learn that the shooting was in fact fatal?  Initially you heard that King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been shot.
Speaker 2: They, they took him to St. Joseph's Hospital [St. Joseph Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee]--I think it was St. Joe.  And one of our guys went down as a part of that process.  The ambulance finally came, they took him.  And we got word back from the hospital that it was, it was fatal.  And--
Speaker 1: How did you react?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I--you know, it's--I guess with disbelief is the best way to describe it.  You just cannot believe that this had occurred in relationship to a sanitation strike.  And I have since be- come to believe this had no relationship to the sanitation strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  It was a thing that was on somebody's drawing board, and the knowledge that that's where he was gonna be was given to them.  I am not one who buys into the theory that a second story burglar on his own, you know, pulled this off because, as I said before, Dr. King had previously stayed at the Rivermont Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee], but among themselves decided to check into the Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 609013
Speaker 1: You were discussing the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  What happened, what happened next, once the word did spread throughout Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, we, our staff and the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] staff, thought we really needed to meet.  When I say our staff, I mean the staff of the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] that was supporting the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  And they had become such an integral part of it that we, we thought we really had to compare notes to talk about, you know, where do we go from here, because they obviously had to make plans at that point to deal with, you know, their loss.  So we met at the Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee] as a matter of fact in, in, in his room to talk about what we consider to be our institutional responsibilities in this role.
Speaker 1: What was that like, actually meeting in his room?
Speaker 2: There was, I mean, it was an effort to talk plans.  It wa- I mean you couldn't think in the context of, of, of we're sitting where he sat.  This was, you know, what do we do for the next hours or so, and what do we do tomorrow?  And--
Speaker 1: Who was present at that meeting?
Speaker 2: Ralph Abernathy, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] (makes sounds)--
Speaker 1: Was Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, no, Jesse may have gone by then, because Jesse went back to Chicago [Illinois].  But--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] John Lewis?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I'm trying to think.  There's a couple of Dr. King's aides, guys who--there had to be two or three other people.  I can't remember the names right there, but--right now, but--
Speaker 1: So you were strategizing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean because there were things that had to be done, both to, to, to, to move down the, the, the march thing.  I mean that had to be worked on to get it pulled to a halt.  We had to think in terms of how this would be spoken to, because nobody knew a whole lot.  And, and such, these kinds of thing are so exploited, you know, so there were understandings that, you know, A, the union would not exploit this in future work that we would be doing; that we were treated with dignity and respect that it was entitled to.  That once SCLC made its decisions about the continuing work of the Poor People's Campaign, how we would relate to that, and what role they saw, if any, to play in the upcoming meetings where we'd have to continue the strike stuff.
Speaker 1: Was everyone just in a complete state of shock?
Speaker 2: I think the shock wore off after a bit, I mean shock at the fact that this could happen.  But I, I think over--the recognition that this was a struggle that had to be, had to go the rest of the way.  So we talked about the fact that as arrangements were planned for the services of Dr. King that obviously would be an Atlanta [Georgia] decision, and then would we put everything on hold pending the outcome of that.  And I think that was something sort of went without saying.  But it, it, these things had to be talked about.
Story_ID: 609014
Speaker 1: So you guys did have a nonviolent march prior to his funeral in Atlanta [Georgia], when Coretta Scott King came to Memphis [Tennessee] and walked (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I mean it, I mean the, the whole country was, was, was electrified by this.  And their decision was that we've got, we've got to have a march, but it has to be a march that has different meaning than the original march that was planned, and it had to be symbolic of a lot different things.  We were able to get Bayard Rustin to come down and, and, and sort of head up the planning around that.  And we had to move it into a much larger struggle for workers' rights so that, that not only people in Memphis but people who would see this thing would understand the courage and the conviction of these men [of the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], and that this was not just now a, a worker/employer issue, but it was a worker versus system issue.  And we had wanted to get--make sure they had the right speakers, had the right image, and that the focal point of the march was a political system of Memphis, Tennessee, and other Memphises all around the country.  And Bayard really did a magnificent job in arranging this.  One of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me about the day.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Tell me about that day.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to describe the, sort of the collective, you know, work that, that had to be done and was done in preparation.  I mean you had young people who had wanted to get involved.  We had black community leadership, white community leadership, religious community, the celebrity crowd.  I mean it was a monster undertaking.  I'll never forget and will always respect the fact that [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, who was such a supporter of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], just came in and got engaged in you know, nitty gritty--
Speaker 1: What was Harry Belafonte doing?
Speaker 2: Well, just meeting with people and trying to explain the movement and interpreting, you know, the, you know, where do we go from here, that kind of thing.  And I didn't, I didn't personally know him well between then but got to both admire and respect, you know, what he had done for the mil- movement, the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] movement and his views on many of these social, you know, issues.  And, but the march was designed to be a quiet march, you know, and the same march route that had been planned before, except that we would go this time to city hall.  And Bayard designed the platform and program and with a theory--if you know Memphis City Hall [Memphis, Tennessee], it's got this big, big emblem of a cotton bulb you know and (laughter)--.  So the theory was that we, we want to arrange a stage, so when the speaker who is at the podium is speaking, it blocks out this big cotton bulb.  Now if you ask me why Bayard thought that to be important, I don't know (laughter), but that was the intent.  So the height of the stage and the platform and the, and the camera shots and angles was designed to make sure you didn't see the cotton bulb.  And he was just so happy.  I mean, he kept saying, you know, "What is that thing?"
Speaker 1: The symbolism.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 609015
Speaker 1: One of the unusual things that took place the night of the assassination, and it's, and it's to Bayard's [Bayard Rustin] credit as to a symbol of, of movements, he was on a radio show in Westchester, New York [Westchester County, New York] when the word came that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been, had been killed.  And the question--someone called in and, and they were so, you know, out of it that they asked Bayard what could they do to help.  So he says, you know, this struggle was about, you know, respect and dignity.  But if you want to do something to help, send them a dollar or two down to give some relief to the strikers [of the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  And if--I think we collected, out of that effort alone, something like $350,000.  The money came in duffle bags, like, like, like soldier duffle bags.  And it, what it said, that's the power of, of, of the radio.  And it--and obviously the--Dr. King and the name was important, but I mean people sent money like you would not believe, to be used in support of the strikers and their home situation and et cetera.  And, and Bayard, just off the top of his head, you know, said, do this.  (Makes sound) And I think it was those kinds of things that people who had their own busy lives that they were into were able to do as a contribution to this effort.
Story_ID: 609016
Speaker 1: How was Coretta Scott King when she arrived in Memphis [Tennessee] for the march?
Speaker 2: I think Mrs. King had probably accepted this as a possibility a long time before it happened.  I, I wasn't with her when she, when she had first arrived back.  But just seeing her during the days afterwards, going through the things that she had to go through and had to accept, I, I just think that, that, that, that--and I had to use a ha- almost been a practiced processed.  And it certainly was a graceful lady.  I mean I always remember the one beautiful photograph taken at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, when I think she had one of her children across her lap, and she just, you know, was sitting there very stoic.  I, I think she had given thought to this before.
Story_ID: 609017
Speaker 1: And was that march successful?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I think we had probably thirty-five, forty thousand people march that day, and they came from all across the country, everywhere, and very quiet, very silent, very solemn.  But it demonstrated again what this strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] was all about.  It was about respect and dignity in, in relationship with the city to these workers.  And I guess the irony was that the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination didn't so much change the mind of the mayor [Henry Loeb] or the mind of the, of the power players in the City of Memphis [Tennessee].  They were more remorseful that it happened in Memphis.  The New York Times or Time magazine interviewing somebody at one time, and they called Memphis sort of a backwater on the banks of the Mississippi (laughter).  And whoever they were talking to was very regretful.  And their comment was that we are just so sorry that King was killed in Memphis, you know, with, with that being sort of the, the line.
Speaker 1: Did the workers finally get what they were asking for?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  By that time, you know, the, the issues in the strike had, had grown much larger than they were in the first place.  I mean the issues ultimately was the, the city's recognition of the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733] so that the union would be there as an institution to protect and promote their interests.  Secondly, they knew that unless they had a financial base for the union, they could be in business today and out of business tomorrow, so the question of what we call check off became an issue.  And what they wanted was their right to pay dues to their organization that would be there to help them.  And the, one of the big hang ups was, how do you do that?  How do you collect dues?  Because the city would not allow for dues check off to take place.  And this was a process that takes so much of your pay out and sends it to the union.  Well, the anti-union crowd said, well, the only thing the union is interested in is getting the workers' dues.  Really an attempt to make the issue us from out of town versus their people for in town.  Unknown to us at the time, there was a credit union for the workers of which our members held the majority of seats.  And this came up in the discussion that's perhaps a process for collecting dues.  And you know, the city was vehemently opposed to it, but it was a workers' credit union with their own rules for how to do this.  So, we developed this idea that if we made every member, or every striker, a member of the credit union, they could then make a withdrawal of their union dues to the credit union, and then direct the credit union to send that payment to the union headquarters.  And we played this card, but we played it a little too soon, and it got sort of dismissed.  But in the end, we had to come back around to it.  And so the union from its treasury paid the, the initiation fee for every single striker to become a member of the credit union.  And then the board of directors of the credit union voted to withdraw whatever the, the designated union dues was gonna be.  That's how we solved that problem (laughter).  The recognition issue was a little bit different because the mayor had taken a position that he would never recognize the union to represent city employees.  Well, there's sort of a legal argument within the rules--the personnel rules of the city, that each worker can designate either himself or someone to speak for him.  So the issue was then was defining who it was that you wanted to represent and who wanted you to represent them.  So the recognition clause recognized certain workers, and that was the way it was phrased so that each individual could then sign a card designating the workers to represent them.  And the city, by law or policy, would be required to rec- recognize the individual's choice.
Speaker 1: But ultimately, how long did it take for everyone to be recognized?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had that, we had those already, I mean (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and so--
Speaker 1: So you returned to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] after the sixty-four day strike?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sixty-seven days, it lasted sixty-seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --days.
Story_ID: 609018
Speaker 1: In D.C. [Washington, D.C.], of course, there was a very violent response to King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you witness of--
Speaker 2: Well, I, actually I went back to Detroit [Michigan] at the end of the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  We stayed to negotiate the agreement, which took a little bit longer.  I then went back to Detroit and then came to D.C. as a, as, as, as a trip end.  You know, the 14th Street corridor, other areas of the city were just, you know, going up in, absolutely in smoke.  I mean people were so outraged that here you had a, probably one of the few who was arguing a, a peaceful, nonviolent, you know, you know, way to achieve civil rights as, as opposed to, you know, some of the others who were arguing a much more violent approach.  But I think to a great degree, two folks, maybe three, that deserve an incredible amount of credit for keeping D.C. as calm as it was, Mayor Walter Washington certainly was the one.  And there was a guy on the radio here by the name of Petey Greene, who, you know, was just sort of a street person with an incredible personality, but was able to play such a role in, in calming down things.  Mayor Washington had such great respect, and you know, people who walked the streets, you know, talked about how he really was such a calming influence.  And then in a strange way James Brown, which was, was not nearly as noticed as, as it should have been.  They did a, a monster concert [in Boston, Massachusetts], arranged by, you know, the powers to be.  And Petey Greene was this, and this radio station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.], which essentially was a flagship radio station for [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes' Radio One [Lanham, Maryland], but saved I think a lot of, saved a lot of violence in town.
Story_ID: 609019
Speaker 1: But that was a long drawn out affair [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] that should never have happened to that extent.  The, the agreement that was negotiated, you know, changed, changed life for people down there, where they were like sixty-nine cents an hour, eighty-nine cents an hour.  You got wage levels thirteen, fourteen, fifteen dollars an hour, now promotional systems, safety and health systems, you know, grievance procedures.  And the beneficiary is obviously of the, of the youngsters of, of those strikers.  It's our understanding there are about thirty, thirty-five of them still alive now, and these were not young men at the time.
Story_ID: 609020
Speaker 1: You also were instrumental in starting the CBTU in the early '70s [1970s].  So how did that whole thing get started?
Speaker 2: Well, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists is really is an organization that, that really tries to bridge the, the divide between community and labor, and particularly the African American community.  And those of us who are actively engaged in labor recognize it's not a perfect institution.  It has its lumps and warts just like any other institution in society.  But its strongest ally is the African American community, both politically and otherwise.  And in 1972, some of us who had been active over a long period of time in organized labor really sort of came face to face with one of the real contradictions, in its policy and its processes.  Seventy-two [1972] was the year of the election between George McGovern and Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  And we had spent the prior four years living under the Nixon policies.  And in terms of our community, the African American community, I mean they were not devastating policies, but they were clearly policies that tilted based on race and stuff.  (Laughter) So in the '72 [1972] run up to the election, the, the American labor movement took a position of neutrality between George McGovern and Richard Nixon.  And in our community, if you're neutral, that means one ain't no better than the other or, or equal to the other.  And, and we kind of felt that that was an incredible disservice to what essentially is a loyal piece of its political apparatus.  And the fact that you could go neutral was an incredible disrespect from the role that African Americans played in the body politic, and we said that to the movement leadership.  Oh, and we in this case being a Charlie Hayes [HistoryMaker Charles Hayes], a fellow by the name of Charlie Hayes, H-A-Y-E-S, Nelson "Jack" Edwards from the United Auto Workers [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America], Cleveland Robinson, an old activist with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Horace Sheffield [Horace Sheffield, Jr.].  I mean we just thought that this was, that was really, really a reflection of, of something that we needed to talk about.  And so we voiced our concerns, but the system or the process, you know, didn't really allow anything to be different.  As a matter of fact, the action was within the policy itself.  I mean it, it was, they could legitimately take a neutral position, but the, the, the lack of understanding of the implications that as far as a large slice of the, you know, black workforce was we thought out of order.  So we decided that--and there was no CBTU at this time.  This was just five or six people who had a concern.
Speaker 1: And these were African American--
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Labor leaders from different unions.
Story_ID: 609021
Speaker 1: So in light of this, we thought we would have a meeting, you know, and talk about this.  And we thought there would be, you know, fifty, a hundred people who have the same kind of concern.  So the decision was made to let's have a meeting.  Let's review all this, and maybe we'll issue statement at the end of the meeting, you know, what we think about it.  So the meeting was set for Chicago [Illinois] I don't know the dates, but at the old LaSalle Hotel.  And what we thought would be a meeting of a, of a hundred, maybe couple of hundred people, thirteen hundred folks showed up from all over the country, I mean from everyplace.  We didn't have any mailing list, didn't have any contact sheet.  I mean it was just sort of word of mouth.  But clearly we weren't the only people who were concerned not only about this, this policy but prior kinds of issues that just sort of bubble up.  And so we talked about what it would do, and a whole lot of ideas were put forth.  Probably the most meaningful one was let's forget about the election.  I mean that's, that's an event that's taken place.  We won't worry about that.  The question is what do we do in the future?  And the suggestion was perhaps we need an organization that could argue for our involvement and inclusion in these processes that lead to these kinds of decisions, whether it's this kind, or whether it's the presence of African Americans in leadership roles, or whether it's foreign policy, a whole lot of things.  And the decision, well, let's not make a decision now.  Let's try and talk to other people because we're getting together because we're mad.  I mean if people cool off, they may not feel the same way.  So we took--we were instructed to take a next year, to talk to people in virtually every corner of the country, as many as we could lay hon- hands on who were actively engaged in their union.  And that the consensus was that we ought to build an organization.  Then the question is: A, what will it look like, and what's its goals and objectives, and how does it exist?  Which was sort of the old Contra Costa [Contra Costa County Employees Association] question.  And we took the year, and our next meeting was set for Washington, D.C.  And other people had the responsibility of regional, you know, discussions on this.
Speaker 2: So where did you meet in Washington?
Speaker 1: At the Capital Hilton hotel [Statler Hilton; Capital Hilton].  And the outcome of that year's work was yes, we need something.  We weren't altogether sure what it was, but obviously there was a need for something.
Speaker 2: This was 1973?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And it must be independent of the, the establishment.  It must be free to operate on its own issues, et cetera, which means it's got to be financed by itself, otherwise, you can't say what you think.  So that, it was, it was in convention and conference.  It came together in 1973, and we've been in business ever since.  Ours is a, a commitment to organized labor and its goals and principles, but by the same token, a responsibility to interpret our concerns as African Americans to organized labor, and be free and independent enough to, to agree or disagree with anything that's coming out of that.  That goes for foreign policy; it goes to economic policy; it goes to the whole shop.
Story_ID: 609022
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you guys--did you have a very specific conflict with the president of the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations], Mr. Meany [George Meany]?
Speaker 2: Only that he was representing the AFL-CIO.  The conflict was with the process, you know.  And our outrage was how can you say that Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and George McGovern are, are equal?  And you know, we didn't understand all the different, you know, focuses within affiliates of the AFL-CIO.  I mean we saw the AFL-CIO as one institution speaking for all of us.  And if they thought Richard Nixon was okay for us, I mean that was a kind of disrespect that had to be addressed.  And so it wasn't so much with Meany as it was with the institution that he represented.
Speaker 1: Was James Farmer active with the CBTU [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists]?
Speaker 2: No, not at that point in time, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the major issues, causes you took up over the years?  'Cause you were pre- I mean you were president for--
Speaker 2: Forever it seemed like.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: The, the issue of, of, of representation is, is one that's key.  I mean if, if you're not in a room when decisions are made, you have no idea what's coming out.  So ours is where are African Americans in the policymaking bodies of not only the AFL-CIO but all of the affiliates?  A. Philip Randolph and C.L. Dellums was probably the only two national figures at that time.  We had one or two vice presidents of organizations at that time, but the rest of it was sort, like a big void except in our union.  I mean I, I was elected in '72 [1972] as secretary-treasurer, but I mean I was in, but there was a long gap between me and somebody else.
Speaker 1: So who--so in '72 [1972] you became the president of the CBTU and also--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was elected secretary-treasurer of the, of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] in June of '72 [1972].  And then in seventy- at, at, at, at the meeting in Chicago [Illinois], I was asked to chair this thing until the next meeting, which was held here in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So you were one of the high- I mean you were the highest ranking black union leader in the country.
Speaker 2: Well, in terms of office, yeah.  But there were certainly more people who had not only greater seniority and, and, and recognition, but in terms of the office, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any specific issues you took on in that capacity as secretary-treasurer?  I mean you've hold--you've held that position for a number of years as well.
Speaker 2: Well, since '72 [1972] to now--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which is what?  Thirty-six years.  I think the issues were, were, were inclusion; issues were diversity; the issues were, you know, opportunities for others to advance--
Speaker 1: Any specific cities or companies or--
Speaker 2: No.  We're all in the public sector.  We're all in the public sector.
Speaker 1: But any specific fights you can point to?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we've had fights all over the place, I mean with New York City [New York, New York] on hospital workers; Detroit [Michigan], city workers; Los An- [Los Angeles, California] I mean--
Speaker 1: Give me an example of one of them, Detroit.
Speaker 2: Detroit, I mean we, we--in, in the AFSCME capacity.  Really took on the issues of, of fairness in government, in the sense that, you know, government is an exchange process where workers--and in Detroit, I mean a very unionized town, the question of, of, of dealing, and negotiating in good faith with the workers of that union, and in the role of the city as you had the riots in '67 [1967] I guess it was.  I mean these are all issues that are important to our union.  So, I mean we, we tried to make sure that, that they understood our ultimate viewpoint in terms of race relations in the city, in terms of the city's responsibility for dealing with their workforce and these kinds of crises.  And New York City is the whole question of, of the healthcare system and in New York State the healthcare system.  I mean and these kinds of battles take on different, you know, different policy approaches.

Speaker 2: I have a favorite food.  It's called collard greens and black eyed peas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that order.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, no favorites.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have a favorite saying.  I say it's better to be effective than right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609025
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Joe Lucy, Sr.] side.  And we'll start with your mother's side first, and then we'll try to get them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Susie B. Gibbs.  That's S-U-S-I-E, B, and Gibbs, G-I-B-B-S [Susie Gibbs Lucy].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 6, 1906.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Uniontown, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is an appropriate place for her to be born.  You know, your mother's born in Uniontown, Alabama.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Is there a history behind that name?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Often a name like that I found had something to do with the Union of the, in the Civil War.
Speaker 2: It may denote the, the workers there.  That as I understand, a good number of them were miners in the coal mines of Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I really can't go back beyond one aunt that she had.  That's the only family that we knew that she had.
Speaker 1: But generationally, do you know anything about her parents at all, your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: (Background noise) Not at all.
Speaker 1: Do you suppose they were working on a farm, in agricultural work, or?
Speaker 2: I, my, my recollection of--at least her stories, that her father was a miner and what, was killed in the mines.  But beyond that, she never shared anything else with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, that's something.  That's interesting.  So we know it's a mining town.  Her father was a miner, according to her when--and he was killed in the mines.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she raised in Uniontown?
Speaker 2: Yes, until she married my father.
Story_ID: 609026
Speaker 1: You were saying your mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] was raised in Uniontown [Alabama], or?
Speaker 2: I don't know what, at what period they married, but until she married my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.], she, she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She grew up--okay.  So she was I mean at least past puberty to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --getting married, so, so she was there most of her years growing up.
Speaker 2: Her teen years I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so it's a mining town basically, and everybody there is basically--
Speaker 2: That's my understanding.
Speaker 1: --engaged in mining or something that tended to be--to a miner--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to a miner.  And where, where is Uniontown in relationship to Montgomery [Alabama] or Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: It's, mileage wise, about two hundred miles from Birmingham [sic.].  But I've never been there, so I'm, I'm just gauging by what I see on the map.
Speaker 1: Would this be north or south you think?
Speaker 2: Would be north.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's northern Alabama, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, now is your mother able to, to go very far in school, in--
Speaker 2: I think she finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know the name of the school by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is back during segregation days, of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we never--she never talked about it, but I assume she, she had completed her high school years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did she talk at all--did she talk about growing up at all, what it was like?
Speaker 2: Not a, not a whole lot, not a whole lot.  And I'm not sure why, but she, she just didn't, didn't have any real reason to discuss a good deal of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So I just don't want you to take it for granted that something that you know is something everybody knows, 'cause this is gonna be seen hundreds of years from now, I hope, if we still have electricity.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, it's--you know, so don't assume that we, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So anything she'd say, like your father worked in the mine, that's something that we wouldn't know.  Well, okay, so are there any stories in your family that, that--about the end of slavery or emancipation, or what your people were doing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, the bulk of the knowledge I have about family is on my father's side.  It's very little on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I say, she just had the one auntie that we were aware of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And beyond that we didn't know much about her family at all.
Speaker 1: All right so both her parents were, were passed by the time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you came around.  Okay.  All right, then she had no, no brothers and sisters or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --just--okay.  So, well, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a seamstress, and she ran a cafe or a restaurant from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now was this a family business, the cafe or the restaurant?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 609027
Speaker 1: Well, let me go to your father's side, then we'll get them together.  Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Joseph Lucy--that's J-O-E-S-E-P-H [sic.], L-U-C-Y [Joe Lucy, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was 9/23/1909 [September 23, 1909].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Thomasville, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: His father [James Lucy] was born in September of 1886, so he went back quite a few years.  And his mother [Patsy Harris Lucy], I'm not sure of her maiden name, but she was born in December of 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And while I don't know the city that she was born in, but they, they lived in Thomasville.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, now, are there any stories on your father's side of the family about the end of slavery or Reconstruction or what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Not on my father's side, but I would assume it would have been some on my grandfather's side.  They were I guess what we would call, you know, rural--lived in rural Alabama, and more than likely, segregation was alive and well as they were growing up.  There were no specific stories that, that I'm aware of except that they, like many other folks in the South, simply they could not participate fully in the process; they couldn't--were not registered to vote and could not therefore vote.  But there was one individual in the family who had really done quite well.  I'm not sure whether it was just farming or farming and animals or what have you, but there was one uncle who had done very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this uncle is--so what did he, what did he have?  What did he (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had a farm, a rather large farm.
Speaker 1: This is your father's brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He had a fairly large farm?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what would you think in terms of acreage?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) I wouldn't hazard to guess, but it appeared to be more than fifty.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But there's no, no talk or any record about how he acquired it?
Speaker 2: None that I have seen.  I'm sure there, there are records, you know, in the county or the state offices of his holdings, but none that I have seen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so did, did he hold onto it a long time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, quite a while, quite a while.  And I'm not sure whether it's, it's still in his extended family or not, but it was certainly there when I first, you know, became aware of the fact that, that he owned a large farm.  I mean we visited from Memphis [Tennessee] at least on one occasion, perhaps, perhaps more.  But it was a large, large holding that he, that he owned.
Story_ID: 609028
Speaker 1: As far as you know, was, was Thomasville [Alabama] the, the place that your father's family was originally from, or is there another place they were at before Thomasville, or?
Speaker 2: I think that's, that's was hometown.  There's another little small city close to it where they had sort of spread out to, a little place called Flatwood [Alabama], which is sort of a next door neighbor to Thomasville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] say about growing up in Thomasville?
Speaker 2: Just like any other rural community, they were, they dealt with lumber or timber.  He ultimately wound up being quite a mechanic, self taught.  But, but timber work and, and, and mine work were the essential industries there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did--so your father was--did, did he have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Not too far.  I think he may have gone to what we would call middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about sixth, seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Seven through nine.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, all right, so, now, now did he eventually move to Uniontown [Alabama], or?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] moved to Thomasville.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right, all right.
Story_ID: 609029
Speaker 1: I guess it's time to get them together, I guess.  So--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Nods head) All right.
Speaker 1: Is there a, is there a story that they tell about how they got together?
Speaker 2: No, not, no, I'm not, I'm not aware of any special story.  I think just like anything else, you know, where, where people meet at some kind of affair or something like that, and they begin talking, and begin courting, and ultimately become, you know, candidates for marriage.  And that was about all I ever heard them talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they never had a story about, "When I first met you, you were doing this," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Or, "My sister told me about you," or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Although that may have happened, it just wasn't a discussion that we had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your, your mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] came from a real small--she was--was she the only person in her family?
Speaker 2: I never knew her to have any sisters or brothers.  I on- we only were aware of this one auntie, and her mother and father had passed at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.]?  Did he have siblings?
Speaker 2: Lots, lots, lots of them, and I'm not sure I've ever met all of them even at this point in time.  Brothers, he had about six, maybe seven; a very large family.
Speaker 1: What about sisters?
Speaker 2: Two, maybe three sisters, some who still live in, in Alabama, in the Mobile, Montgomery, Selma area.
Speaker 1: That's a big (laughter)--that's kind of spread out (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, very spread out, very spread out.
Speaker 1: Mobile into Selma to Montgomery.  That's--okay.  So, all right, so, at--all right, so your, your parents meet, and at some point they get married.  Now your, your father's a little younger than your mother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by three years.  And so, so what year did they get married?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--you know what brought your mother to Thomasville [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No, I'm, I'm, I'm not aware of any particular reason, but I--that's, that's where they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609030
Speaker 1: You said they had a cafe, a restaurant?
Speaker 2: She, my mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] ran the cafe.  I'm not sure whether she ran it immediately after marriage.  But when I became aware of the fact that she worked, that's what she did.  She was a seamstress, and she ran a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was somebody else's restaurant then?  It wasn't hers?  Wasn't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As far as I knew it was hers.  That's all I could tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she had a restaurant, but nobody--there's no story about how she got it or anything or--
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: --what, what happened to--okay.  All right, so she--when she wasn't running it, who was, who was running it?
Speaker 2: I mean, this is, this is like before my time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so this is before you.
Speaker 2: And I guess like a lot of, you know, those small southern restaurants, it may be, you know, a, a large one roomer.  It was not what you'd call a major business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it's, it's significant, anybody that owned something, you know--
Speaker 2: It may have been leased; it may have been--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --owned.  I just--
Speaker 1: Running it, I mean that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she ran it, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  'Cause not everybody was running something, you know, so that's a good--it's something of note.  So she had a cafe, but it was, it was out of existence by the time you came around?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was in Alabama.  I was born in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: And these were early years.  I'm trying to think.  I've never heard them talk, although I'm sure there's a record of when they were married.  So it's obviously--I was born in '33 [1933], so they must have been married at least five to six years prior to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1928 or so?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609031
Speaker 1: So they were married in say 19--we'll just say around 1928.  And so they were--they started off in Alabama--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they moved to Memphis [Tennessee], 'cause you were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --born in Memphis.  So, is there--did they, did--was there any reason that you could come up with as to why they moved to Memphis, or was there any?
Speaker 2: I think it was more for better opportunities for, for my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] to work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did he do in Memphis?
Speaker 2: He worked at one point for Memphis Light, Gas and Water.  He was a laborer for them.  And this would have been in about '34 [1934] or '35 [1935].  And he also made--began to do, you know, auto mechanic work, and as I--self taught.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you were born in 1933--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Memphis, but--so your early years were spent in Memphis, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did, now, did you all live in a specific part of town in, in Memphis, or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) South side, I guess what you would call--
Speaker 1: South side, okay.
Speaker 2: --south side.  I used to think we traveled a lot.  And as I grew older, it seemed like we were moving every thirty days thereabout (laughter), which was about the time the rent becomes due.  We lived in a number of places in Memphis, but essentially all in the south side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you moved a lot, okay.  Now, let me ask you this: now the family moved some when you were--in 1942 you were saying, right?
Speaker 2: Right, we--my father moved to California in 1941, December, shortly after war [World War II, WWII] broke out.  My mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] and brother [Joe Lucy, Jr.], we moved about April or May of 1942, and this essentially was joining my father in, in California.
Story_ID: 609032
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their interests, their hobbies, their skills, and their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] without some of the skills that he had, but I think more mannerisms, more outlook.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are those mannerisms and, what's that, what's the outlook?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean he tended not to worry a whole lot about a lot of stuff.  You know, if it wasn't gonna, gonna block out the sun or stop the earth, I mean it didn't (laughter), just didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't bother him.  And I think they say that about Sagittarians.  I, I mean I think more about how to fix it than worrying about the fact that it needs fixing, you know, if you understand what I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was self taught, really sort of accepted his lot in life, and, and worked at trying to, you know, just trying to improve himself.  My mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] was much more of a, I guess a stable quantity.  I mean she worried about today and tomorrow to, trying to make sure that, that the, you know, the family, you know, operated right.  He tended not to worry a whole lot about that.
Story_ID: 609033
Speaker 1: You've got one brother, or is there, or is there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, one brother.  And is he older or younger?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's passed away, but he was older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in '31 [1931].
Speaker 1: All right, so he's two years older than you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what is his name?
Speaker 2: Joseph Lucy, Jr. [Joe Lucy, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think it was the fact that we, we, as I said, we traveled a good deal in Memphis [Tennessee], so the early memories are the fact we were moving from place to place and remember elementary school, at least beginning elementary school in, in Memphis.  I remember the, the beginning of World War II [WWII] and how that affected school life and ultimately moving to California.
Story_ID: 609034
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, Memphis [Tennessee], you know, was, was, was, was as segregated a city as you could find, both then and I suspect probably now.  And school was almost like an outlet, I mean the, the fact that, you know, education was, was, you know, really focused on by our teachers and even in elementary school.  I remember the, the, the war effort that even in elementary school we were, we were participating in, you know, save the cans, save the metal, and all that kind of stuff.  When we moved to California and picked up schooling once again, it was different in the sense that California appeared to be so close to the war effort, and it reflected itself in our school and everything else.  And I mean for, for me at that age and that level of schooling, it was somewhat different.  I mean it was like, you know, you know, the country or we collectively got an enemy somewhere, and we gotta do our part to, to deal with that, which was quite, quite different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Richmond [California], there's a, Richmond is a port city--I mean it's got a dock, right?  It's a--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --port of entry?
Speaker 2: It has a port of entry, San Francisco Bay.  It was the site for four shipyards, put together by Henry Kaiser [Henry J. Kaiser] for the war effort.  And our, our family was like a lot of families, moving from the South, and I guess some from, even from the Midwest, to that area for the shipbuilding industry, and the defense industry because Oakland [California] was also a part of the defense system.  And San Francisco [California] was a major part of it because of the, the, the debarkation.  You know, sites in San Francisco were appointed and Richmond.
Speaker 1: I think I remember being in San Francisco in--
Speaker 2: Hunters Point [Bayview Hunters Point, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Black's Battery [Black Point Battery] or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The guns, big guns aimed at the ocean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In case so, you know, enemy ships came across.  And the Presidio [Presidio of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] I guess was another ocean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Presidio was a [U.S.] Army base, or at least a, a, a, a, a combination of Army and Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] I think it was.  Then Oakland was an Army base in the same general area, had Pittsburg, California, which was an Army base, and it was sort of shipping out points.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609035
Speaker 1: Let me just go back maybe a little bit further before California to Memphis [Tennessee].  Now you, you were a little kid growing up in Memphis, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you started--did you all move around a lot in Memphis too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean--okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what you were talk--yeah, Memphis, yeah, you moved around a lot.  Now, did you--but you started school in Memphis, right?
Speaker 2: Started school in Memphis and completed elementary school in, in California.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember the name of the schools you went to in Memphis?
Speaker 2: In Memphis it was LaRose Elementary School, which was on then--Danny Thomas Boulevard.
Speaker 1: I guess it had another name then I guess, but--right?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: It must have had another name then?
Speaker 2: Oh, back then--
Speaker 1: I know what you're talking about.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I can't recall what it was then, but it's Danny Thomas now.  And then when I began school in California I went to Nystrom, N-Y-S-T-R-O-M [Nystrom Elementary School, Richmond, California].
Speaker 1: N-Y-S-T--
Speaker 2: R-O-M.
Speaker 1: --R-O-M, okay.
Speaker 2: And Nystrom was, you know, instantly built wartime schooling.  And it was on Cutting Boulevard and 14th Street [sic. Harbour Way], sort of an intersection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609036
Speaker 1: Now did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really enjoyed it.  Yeah.  In Memphis [Tennessee] you really couldn't, you know couldn't tell what you liked because it, everything was taught in one room.  But by the time we got to California, as I said early, I mean the whole war effort seemed like it just was a part of the total environment.  So I en- I enjoyed the study.  By the time I moved from elementary school to junior high school, began to focus on social studies and history and rather, rather enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, all right, so what did you like to do as a little kid growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we played.  I mean once, once school was out it was, it was my time.  You know, we, we--I think that whole period, you know, kids, even as small as we were, were quite athletic.  We played softball, basketball, kickball.  You name it, we played some of it.  And you know, school for a lot of us was really a rather exciting, you know, you know, act, activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when--thinking about when you were a little kid growing up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, this is 1942 and '3 [1943], so everything was, was focused on the war effort.  And Richmond [California] was a city that had grown up around the war effort.  And there was nothing other than, for us, other than schooling and athletics, nothing outstanding about the period other than just meeting new and different people and simply trying to, as we used to say, get through your schooling, through your studies, and do well at it.  We didn't have any--this was not a place where, you know, different things were happening every day.  It was really the same day in, day out effort.  And like most of us, our effort was to get out of school, get through school and get out of school.  And from the elementary school, Nystrom [Nystrom Elementary School, Richmond, California], it was junior high school, which was Roosevelt Junior High School [Richmond, California], and that was the system.  I completed Nystrom, Roosevelt, and then went on to high school.
Story_ID: 609037
Speaker 1: So, yeah, back to the sights and sounds and smells of growing.  What was going on around you?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in Richmond [California] there were, there were two major employers: Standard Oil [Standard Oil Company] was one on the east side of town, Stauffer Chemical [Stauffer Chemical Company] on the west side of town.  So you smelled the, the, the, the, you smelled those two operations, one chemical, and the other's--was just oil refining.  The, the sounds was simp- it was essentially the sounds of the shipbuilding industry.  There were four shipyards along the Richmond coast.  And you got the, the, these, this, the ship fitters; you got the welders; you got those folks who were banging iron and putting it together.  So you heard that all day long.  It was a three shift--a four shift operation just about, and so that was, that was a constant, you know, a constant reminder that it, that the shipbuilding industry was, was at that time the major piece of, of, of, of activity, hiring--I shouldn't say hiring, but employing this thousands and thousands of workers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is like, you moved there in the height of the war effort, and people are trying to get these ships built as fast as they can, so they're working like day and night?
Speaker 2: Right.  It was a four shift, as I say, you know, day shift, swing shift, night shift, graveyard shift; I mean it was four shift thing.
Speaker 1: Now did you live close to the Kaiser Shipyards?
Speaker 2: Very close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One block.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was all wartime housing.  It was built, you know, to house the workers for the shipyards.
Speaker 1: Now were the ships very big--I mean could you see, would you see these huge ships?  Or did--what kind of ships were they building?
Speaker 2: They were building what they called Victory ships.  They were primarily a troop transport and cargo transport.  And the--because this is like six months after beginning of the war [World War II, WWII], so they're going full, full force in ship construction.
Story_ID: 609038
Speaker 1: And your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] and other men that went out there were--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Now, now your father was born in 1906, so he was between the wars I guess.  He's too young for World War I [WWI] and too old for War World II [WWII].
Speaker 2: I don't know if he was too old, but they, they, they had a recruitment process for the defense industry where recruiters would go south and find, you know, men to bring back and, and, and train.  As I said before, my father at the time was working for Memphis Light, Gas and Water as a laborer but was recruited for the war, the war effort.  By the time we reached California he was a s- a journeyman welder, by virtue of the, of the intense training program that they put people through.  And he, I suspect, was like, you know, hundreds and thousands of others who had just been given a skill based on the need at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, I guess we can say that if it, it were not for the war he wouldn't have had that opportunity.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.  And he said from time to time that, you know, the, the, the war effort is what made him important, in the sense that he was trainable, got a skill that was absolutely necessary at the time, and made the best of out of it.  And many workers in the shipyards during those days had come from rural backgrounds, had not been accustomed to making the kind of income that they made then.  And many of them became entrepreneurs and all kinds of things, a result of the skills that they run--gained in preparation for the war effort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It is a time that women could get employed in the defense industry.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Young guys could get a job, you know.  It was very little--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --teenage unemployment because--
Speaker 2: Probably the workforce was I would guess 25, 30 percent female, if not higher in, in the shipyards in those days.  And there were other areas of the war industry that women just dominated, aircraft, you know, all kinds of, of, of new jobs which required new skills.

Speaker 1: As you're a young fellow becoming more politically aware of what's going on, did, did things change after the war [World War II, WWII] was over in 1946?  Were--did people maintain those jobs, or did the returning veterans--
Speaker 2: At the end of the, at, at the end of the war, in Richmond [California], and it may have been the same in other cities around there, you know, the auto industry and the postwar industries that were sort of gearing up for consumer goods and what have you just sort of exploded.  There were lots of good jobs.  And the people who had came to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area], let's say, Oakland [California], Richmond, San Francisco [California], the assumption was that they would go back home after the war was over.  Well, that was really an erroneous assumption; they stayed right where they were.  And with new skills and even new jobs requiring additional training, many of those workers, certainly including my father [Joe Lucy, Sr.], you know, did very well at the end of the, the war in 1945 and what have you.  Some opened up businesses, including himself, and people tended to have a pretty decent life.  As industries started to move outside of the initial, you know, core area where defense industries were, jobs went with them.  So you had the city being sort of thinned out, or it wasn't--I wouldn't call it deskilling, but you know, workers were leaving to follow jobs.  And those who remained had, had a pretty good opportunity to broaden their businesses, had an opportunity to look at new, new activities.  The auto industry came in.  Ford Motor Company [Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant] was a major employer.  International Harvester [International Harvester Company; Navistar International Corporation] was a major employer.  Stauffer Chemical [Stauffer Chemical Company] got even larger than what it had been before, so you know, you know former defense workers did very well.
Story_ID: 609040
Speaker 1: Now did you, as a young fellow, notice a difference in the schools in California as opposed to in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, the on- the only experience I had in Memphis was elementary [at LaRose Elementary School], so I couldn't make a judgment about that.  The city and the area had good schools.  The, the, the high schools, we had three, three high schools in the immediate area.  There was Richmond High School [Richmond, California], El Cerrito High School [El Cerrito, California], and Lincoln High School [Abraham Lincoln High School, San Francisco, California].  And then, everybody went to the same schools.  It was not like it was segregated.  Because you have, had a--while the city as a whole may have been segregated, the, the flow into the school system just sort of took everybody in.
Speaker 1: So there are no districts or anything--there wasn't--
Speaker 2: No, there was one district.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was Richmond Unified School District [West Contra Costa Unified School District], so everybody ultimately went to that school.  The Lincoln and El Cerrito took sort of the fringes out, out the core, but everybody still went to those three schools.  Later, as--after I, I, I finished at El Cerrito, you could see housing patterns beginning to affect the makeup of the sch- of the student body.  And people started to then think through where do you send people?  As opposed to everybody going to the same school; you know, how do you make the load a little bit lighter?  So it's begin to concentrate on taking the east side of the town and sending them to El Cerrito.  The north side of town went to Richmond.  South side of town went to Lincoln.  And they ultimately created another, another high school called Harry Ells [Harry Ells High School, Richmond, California], which took up south and east.  But the school system were pretty good.
Speaker 1: What was the percentage of the black population in Richmond [California]?
Speaker 2: Pro- I would say probably somewhere around 30, 35 percent.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty decent presence.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And all--a lot of that is left over--I mean there was no major black presence prior to the war [World War II, WWII].  And the war brought all of it.  And there was a major Hispanic presence.  And those folks tended to stay there.  My guess is over time it probably got to maybe 55 or 60 percent, in terms of this composition.  As people did better financially, they moved--some moved out, others moved in.  And I think ultimately we did some work on the school system.  I think it was about 55 or 60 percent African American, maybe 10 percent, you know, Spanish speaking.  And you could then begin to see the schooling change, not because, you know, you had African Americans in the school, it's simply because the political reality of, of the support for the schools started to change and ultimately had to really, really undertake a program to deal with it.
Story_ID: 609041
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Joe Lucy, Sr.] in a union?
Speaker 2: No, no, unless he was there during the shipyard work [at Kaiser Shipyards].  At the close of the war [World War II, WWII] he went into his own business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he began to do auto repairs and things like that, and did that for many, many years, and then went into the agricultural business and became a ranch foreman down in the center of the state, Fresno [California], to be specific.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did that happen?  I mean (unclear)?
Speaker 2: As I say, he was a self-taught mechanic.  And how he met the ranch owner, I don't know, but he was offered a job as, as ranch foreman.  And I, I don't think anybody could quite figure that out other than he, he could repair the equipment, and he did that until he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's interesting.  So is your mother [Susie Gibbs Lucy] working as a seamstress during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Both a seamstress and running the cafe.
Speaker 1: I mean and was she, did she have a cafe in Ri- in Richmond [California]?
Speaker 2: Richmond too, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she had, she continued to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --have a cafe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And when she was a seamstress she was in the union [International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union].  But when she ran the cafe, you know, she was, she was employed, and she may have had one other employee.
Story_ID: 609042
Speaker 1: Now were you and your brother [Joe Lucy, Jr.] close?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we were close.
Speaker 1: Okay.  With just the two of you, you know it's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I mean we, we didn't, didn't hang together or anything like that I mean, because his, his crowd was a little different than mine, although as, as siblings we were close.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so how would you describe yourself growing up?  Well, what were you like, and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I think, I, I think I probably grew a little more serious in my last couple of years in high school [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California].  I was studying architecture in high school, studying some engineering in high school, trying to figure out, you know, what could I do after, after graduation as opposed to what I wanted to do.  I mean because the opportunities at that point in time--this is in the late '50s [1950s]--we just didn't quite know what was gonna be available to us.  Industries were starting to leave town.  And if you were gonna find a job, you know, you, you had to start thinking about that early.  And so I was trying to figure out how is all this gonna work when you start really having to earn a living, and tended to be a little bit more focused on, on that, and went to work for the [U.S.] Navy [at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California] right out of high school and stayed with the, stayed with them until 1953, and I went to work for county government [Contra Costa County Public Works Department].  And so I, I may have just stumbled into work that I had sort of prepared a little bit for before.
Story_ID: 609043
Speaker 1: When you were in high school, were there any particular teachers that were mentors or, or people that were interested in, in you?
Speaker 2: Well, if I probably go back to junior high school [Roosevelt Junior High School, Richmond, California], I have two teachers who I thought took a pretty good interest in me, a fellow by the name of John Davies [sic.] and become sort of a, sort of a mentor in the sense I liked his class.  And then there was a lady by the name of Katherine Glafkides [Katherine Glafkides Johns].  And that's not a name you forget (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's the rest of it?  Katherine--
Speaker 2: Kath- Glaf- Katherine Glafkides.
Speaker 1: Glaf- ?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: C-L-A-F--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: K-I-D-D-I-E-S [sic.].  It was Greek.
Speaker 1: K-I-D-D-I-E-S, Glafkides.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the piece of irony is the two of them got married.  So (laughter) he was a coach and taught the vocational class.  And she taught social studies and American history, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Now did he coach you in sports?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, in junior high, I mean, you know, we, we--it, it's more physical ed [physical education] than it is, you know, organized sports activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We tend to get it in the last--in the ninth grade.  And then in high school, you know, it's really organized for teams and et cetera.  But, but he was the coach.
Story_ID: 609044
Speaker 1: What was the name of your junior high school again?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Roosevelt [Roosevelt Junior High School, Richmond, California].
Speaker 1: Roosevelt?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you went to El Cerrito--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --High School [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California].  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to El Cerrito because I wanted to play baseball and football.  And Richmond High School [Richmond, California] had such an incredible draw that the chances of, of getting in there was, you know, slim to, to none for me.  So I went to El Cerrito where the, you know, the talent pool wasn't quite as large and wasn't quite as good (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you had a better chance to play?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did you play in football?
Speaker 2: I played wide receiver.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And what did you play in baseball?
Speaker 2: Third base.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did--were you a prospect in baseball, you think?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I mean they had so many good, good players, they--I was fairly decent player, but I mean they just had so many good ones in, in front of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We played with--as a matter of fact, the first African American hired by the Boston Red Sox was in our class.
Speaker 1: Pumpsie Green?
Speaker 2: Pumpsie Green, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: He was in your class in school, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school.  And then his brother, who wasn't worth a quarter in those days, Cornell Green wound up being an outstanding player for the Dallas Cowboys.
Speaker 1: Right.  I remember Cornell Green.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Big time football player.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize he--that was Pumpsie Green's brother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he had a, he had a, he had another brother, Credell Green, who held the rushing record as a running back for years out of Washington State [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he's at Washington State [sic.].  Now, for those watching this who don't understand who Pumpsie Green was, he was not just the first black player on the Boston team, but the, the last black player on an all-white team in Major League Baseball, 'cause, 'cause they say Tom Yawkey or what his name, in Boston [Massachusetts], the owner, was the last owner to bring in a black player.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?  I wasn't aware of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Pumpsie Green was the, you know, the last of the ballplayers to integrate a ba- a baseball team--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --in the, in the, in the national--in, in the Major Leagues, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, Pum- we were a part of the, what is called the ACAL, Alameda County Athletic League, so it, it, it, it had an incredible pool of athletes, I mean Bill Russell and I mean (laughter) that, that whole crowd of people.
Speaker 1: Isn't, isn't Frank Robinson--
Speaker 2: Vada Pinson.
Speaker 1: --in the same--
Speaker 2: Frank, Frank Robinson.  A guy we used--we, all we called him was Steamboat, I mean, but, but tremendous players, Jack Reed [ph.], Willie Reed [ph.].  The St. Louis Browns [Baltimore Orioles] picked up a guy--I can't recall his name right now--but as one of these early African American signees.  I mean just, just, just lots and lots of good players came out of--both basketball, basketball, and football, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I, I read about that years ago and couldn't believe all the ones that came out of that area--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So did--okay, so was Robinson and Pinson be- was--
Speaker 2: They went to--Frank Robinson went to I think McClymonds [McClymonds High School, Oakland, California].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Vada Pinson I think was at Berkeley [sic.].  And the, oh, the other fellow who broke the, the rule thing up--geez, why am I blanking on his name?
Speaker 1: Oh, Curt Flood?
Speaker 2: Curt Flood was a player in there.  They had several different leagues of semi-pro players and what have you, so.  They just had a, had a lot, a lot of good athletes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, I think Joe DiMaggio played in the Bay Area too, didn't he on (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His brother played in the Bay Area.  He may have played in there too, but what was his name?  Vince DiMaggio--
Speaker 1: Oh, Vince DiMaggio, okay.
Speaker 2: --played, played there also, Suitcase Simpson [Harry Simpson] and--
Speaker 1: Suitcase Simpson (laughter).
Speaker 2: --Luke Easter.  I mean it was a, it was a (laughter)--.  I'm trying to think of their, their other players who went on to Major League teams.  As a matter of fact, Luke Es- Luke Easter went on to Cleveland [Cleveland Indians], and Simpson went to San Diego [San Diego Padres], if memory serves me right, but.
Speaker 1: Suitcase Simpson, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I, if I--I apologize for not knowing a first name, but that was, that was (laughter)--
Story_ID: 609045
Speaker 1: Now that area is also--and I don't know what's going on during the time you were coming along, but it's--I've been told that the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] was full of musicians too--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --lots of musicians who were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a few.  I mean, like every city, there's an area that you go to, and 7th [Street] and Wood [Street] in Oakland [California] was the area.  Then there was the California Hotel [Oakland, California], which was down on San Pablo [Avenue], where all the jazz musicians just floated through.  And the place, Slim Jenkins' [Slim Jenkins' Place] was a place on--down in, in West Oakland [Oakland, California].  And then James Brown really got a, his big start in north Richmond [California] as a matter of fact, had a little joint called Minnie Lou's, you know, Charles Brown, Amos Milburn, I mean just an historical--
Speaker 1: Charles Brown of the--
Speaker 2: Of 'Merry Christmas Baby.'
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And James Brown, as I say, was playing at Minnie Lou's as The Famous Flames (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's his, was his, his band was called The--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Famous Flames, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, okay, so, any rate, so, when you were growing up, were these all--I mean what kind of music was popular when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Well, they got so many different names for it now.  It was just, you know, R and B is all we knew.  I mean it was a place to go, you listen, you dance, and, and have fun.  I mean it's, it's starting getting different names and stuff.  They all sound the same to us.  On the north side of Richmond, which was out in the unincorporated part of the city, they had a place called Tappers Inn [Richmond, California] and Minnie Lou's, and those, those were the places.  And on the, on the weekends and certainly on the summer and, and fall, I mean these were part of the circuits that all the bands would make.  And Oakland was on the--was a part of this, you know, system.  And unlike San Francisco [California], which had the Orpheum Theatres and what have you, I mean they, they tend to take on Lionel Hampton and the, the larger bands.  But, you know, we, we were listening to James Brown long before he became a big name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's something.  You know, it's hard.  I don't imagine him being in California in those days, but I listen to you, I hear what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think most people think he was touring around the South and that's all, but--
Speaker 2: No, he, he was a, he was a mainstay there in Richmond.
Story_ID: 609046
Speaker 1: Okay, so I was asking you about high school, and you said your grades are pretty good.  Now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did, did you, now did you--they have you on tracks then, like a business track, a college prep, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --general course?
Speaker 2: No.  We, I mean we were on track to get out (laughter)--.  In, in those--as I can recall, in those days was--you could take courses and some classes that would just give you a better shot at finding a job once you got out.  The, the, the tracking thing that we found out later on was obviously alive and well, but you know, we were not exposed to it.  We didn't have any real knowledge of it.  And the, the kids who got out and went to college were basically on athletic scholarships or something like that, but they--I don't recall any of us being prepared to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you recall what your counselor told you in high school, or did you have one?
Speaker 2: Really didn't have a counselor other than if you were really not doing well.  They would just counsel you to get out of that particular subject (laughter).  And I think, I think if anything, you were just trying to prepare yourself for the kinds of jobs that were there in town, and they were manufacturing or industrial jobs.
Speaker 1: So it's a lot of shop classes and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --things like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you were saying you got interested in political science around the time you were a junior and senior.
Speaker 2: Well, I--just, just interested in it from point of view of wanting to understand government a, a little bit better.  When I really got hooked, I had been out of school for some time, and had been, you know, I had gone through my work with--at--with the [U.S.] Navy, and had gone to work in county government [Contra Costa County Public Works Department] and got involved with the union [Contra County Employees Association; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675], and as a result, became--almost necessary to understand the politics of county government and city government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, all right, so in, but in high school, though, when you were on your way towards, looking towards graduation, you saw yourself just getting a job and then go--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and getting a job and then--
Speaker 1: --being able to make some money and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, was, was there anything special about high school graduation from El Cerrito [El Cerrito High School, El Cerrito, California]?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I, I graduated early.  I graduated in January, if I recall, of '51 [1951], and I'm not altogether sure why.  And I didn't, I don't recall being moved ahead or moved too fast.  And I really couldn't understand it, but I was glad to get out, so I didn't question (laughter) the process.  But when I did get out, spent just a, a few months, you know, sort of jerking around.  I got an opportunity to go to work for Mare Island Naval Shipyard [Vallejo, California], first as a, what they call a dock rigger in the rigging loft and then got transferred to the engineering section on the yard once I had been in there for a while.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this called the what, what shipyard?  The--
Speaker 1: Mare Island Naval Shipyard.
Speaker 2: Oh, Mare Island, okay.
Story_ID: 609047
Speaker 1: I know I didn't ask you this, but I, I didn't wanna get too far away from it before I ask you, but I didn't ask you anything about going to church or anything like that.  Was your family big--was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--on, on Sunday was church day.  We started in the morning with bible studies, and then you went to eleven o'clock service.  You came back for BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America] and evening service, so it was a, it was a full day (laughter) of, of church service.  It was a big part of our lives I mean, not just mine but all the kids who grew up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that time.
Speaker 1: Did you remember the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Zion Hill Missionary Baptist [Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church, Richmond, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems like there's one of those in every city.
Speaker 2: Every place.  And our pastor was Reverend G.W. Dowthard.
Speaker 1: G.W.--
Speaker 2: Dowthard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's D-O-W-T-H-A-R-D.
Story_ID: 609048
Speaker 1: You worked at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard [Vallejo, California].  And now did you, were you trying to go to school or anything while you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --working there?
Speaker 2: No.  I worked out of the rigging loft for about a year and a half, maybe a little bit longer.  And a request came from the engineering department on the yard looking for folks who were interested in transferring into the, into the engineering section.  And whether they asked specifically for me, I'm not sure, but my foreman asked if I was interested in doing it.  And it seemed like a, a good opportunity, and so I, I indicated I was interested, and went over, did the interview with the leadership of that department, and was lucky enough to get, you know, offered a transfer, and so I transferred into that department.  And what they'd--what we did there was all of the infrastructure stuff on the yard, you know, streets, railroad tracks, water service, electricity, those things that kept the yard working.
Story_ID: 609049
Speaker 1: And I worked in that section until--and I'm not sure how it came about, but there was a request that came home from Contra Costa County [Contra Costa County Public Works Department].  This was 1953 and the--had passed this massive highway program, the federal aid to secondary highway construction program [Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956] passed by President Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  In California in order to get into this program, the county governments, through which highways would be constructed, had to have certain quality control institutions.  And our county had applied for it and apparently received consideration.  And they had to put together a materials and testing laboratory in order to do quality control work on materials that was gonna go into the highway program: you know, soils, asphalt, concrete, cement.  And to, to, to qualify, they had to have the laboratory and pull together the personnel to perform the kind of studies that needed--studies and tests that was necessary for them to qualify for federal funds through the state highway program.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they offered this job, and it looked like again, a pretty good opportunity, so I applied for it and was successful in getting it.  And I went to work for the county government (unclear)--position called an engineering aide.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is nineteen fifty--?
Speaker 1: Three [1953].
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is for Costa County.
Speaker 1: Contra Costa County [California].
Speaker 2: Okay, Contra Costa County, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.  Yeah, it sounds, it sounds like a pretty good job, and---
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was, it was a--it had got me off the docks, and it got me out of the engineering section on the yard [Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California].  And it was a, just a, a perfect start on the ground floor opportunity because the, everything was so new then.  While there were national standards, we were, were in a position to develop our own standards for county government that had to be approved by the state government, who was, it was a, was a sort of the partner agency with the federal government.  So we were doing, you know, sometimes creating quality control tests, you know, to measure the abilities of certain kinds of things, of, to serve well in highway construction.
Story_ID: 609050
Speaker 1: Was there any union activity involved in this job at all?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't what you'd call union activity at that time.  We belonged to an association, the county employees association [Contra Costa County Employees Association], which was a mixture of all employees who worked for the county.  We had, you know, public works, engineering, social workers, hospital workers; all of the various classifications that were employed by the county were a part of this in one--some numbers.  But we began to find out later on that the system itself was not necessarily fair.  And, and what struck me and I think others was the fact that--it's a civil service system, in some places, some types of merit system mixtures.  But the, the unfairness of it was that civil service systems, which are responsible for supplying the names of people who have passed some examination and qualified for a position; that's advertised.  And then in my estimation, and I think others too, you know, the system had become involved and decided on what kind of discipline you would get for assumed violation of some process, or decide what it--what level of salary you would get, which was not their, their original function, or would decide how many vacation days you got.  You know, my view was that some of the people ought to sit down across a table and talk about it, but we didn't have collective bargaining in those days or any other thing that gave workers a voice in this process.  And even if we had had it, the association was not necessarily committed to the idea that workers had the right to talk about these things.  And when the civil service systems were designed, they were really designed to protect workers from, you know, political abuse.  Well, they had gone far beyond that, and now they were judge and jury.  And there are other folks felt the same way, that, that we were entitled to a voice in this process.  And so a, a debate started in the association itself, you know, what do we want to be?  And ultimately, it was put to a vote of all of the members to decide whether you want to continue to be an association or whether you want to really be a union.  I mean we really--lived in a very heavily unionized county, and we thought that our lot would be better off if we were a union as opposed to an independent association.  And we enjoyed, we enjoyed both because we came to Contra Costa County Employees Association, Local 1675 [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675].  So, at the end of a year's period, our membership decided we want to be a union, enjoy the privileges of pursuing collective bargaining, and at the same time, be able to present workers' issues and cases before the civil service employees commission.  And we did, we, we, we did that, and I became involved in that, in that movement.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you really just become involved from the inside out because of necessity, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now--
Speaker 2: Well, even, even more, just that I mean I, I had, at a, at a point in this, in this process became responsible for the administrative affairs of our materials and testing laboratory [of the Contra Costa County Public Works Department], so I had staff employees who reported to me.  And I was a part of this other process, determine what would happen to them.  Well, this seemed a little, little odd to me because I considered myself a worker just like them.  And to be told, here is what we're gonna do to them, (laughter) didn't quite strike me as, as right, so I, I really--I got heavily engaged in trying to form a strong union and to have a place where, you know, employees had a voice.
Story_ID: 609051
Speaker 1: You started that job [Contra Costa County Public Works Department] in '53 [1953], and you went to--
Speaker 2: I worked there until '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now during that time, at some point, like--I th- we have a note that it was 1956 that you went to study engineering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University of California.
Speaker 1: --University of California at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were trying to get credentials for being a civil engineer?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yep.  I was doing ICS [ph.] and going to school and trying to get out.  Now what needs clarification there, I did not get a degree from University of California.  At some point in time somebody decided to puff up the paper.  And my involvement was at the UC in the study of strength and materials, soil mechanics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, the same year, I guess you--same year in '56 [1956] you joined AFSCME.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's Local 1675 [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675].  And so, you know, you really kind of get I guess seasoned with AFSCME before you really take a leadership role in there, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We--I think we were an association [Contra Costa County Employees Association] until the election of either '55 [1955] or '56 [1956], somewhere in there, when we affiliated with AFSCME.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah so it says here '56 [1956], so I guess that's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in about 1956.  Okay, now, this is a time when a lot of unions around the country were growing, you know, and getting, gaining strength and their bargaining rights beg- you know, they're bargaining from a position of strength, auto unions and everybody.  So was it, was, you know, was it, I mean was it tough to organize it out there in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, primarily because the, the California civil service system, it was a good system.  I mean it was really a, a good system, decent benefits, decent wages.  The only problem was that it had the ability to make decisions from which you could only appeal.  I mean you had no rights before they made a decision.  So our effort to organize and unionize was to have a, have a say before something happened to you, or to have the absolute right to grieve anything that did happen to you, which you do not have in the civil service system.  You can appeal it, but there's a difference between appealing and, and, and, and, and having the absolute right to grieve.  So our argument was we need to have trading and status, and have a grievance system, a grievance process, access to a bargaining relationship with your employer.
Story_ID: 609052
Speaker 1: Now was the union involved in civil rights at all in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean once we decided to affiliate with AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] and to be a full fledged union, we saw our role broader than just dealing with the employees', you know, nine to five [o'clock] issues, because there were, there were, you know, social justice questions.  There were certainly civil rights issues, the, the, the validity of the hiring process itself.  I mean are, are, are civil service exams biased, you know, from jump street?  Do they--this issue of choosing one of the top three, is that a legitimate process that does not work against the interest of some individuals?  So we began to debate all of these kinds of questions.  We took on the issue of where is our pension fund invested and why?  Is, are they invested in companies whose practices, you know, are, are discriminatory in terms of their impact on people in general, minorities in particular?  So those, those became a part of our overall, you know, sort of agenda.  And we were a little new and a little different.  And because we were a little new and a little different, it made it a little bit hard when you're trying to convince folks that they're not being treated fairly, when they're saying, well, our wages and our benefits are as competitive as anybody's.  And while we did not argue that, I mean, we're gonna give you the world, we, our argument was you ought to be a part of the process.  And we made the case, and our, our local and our union became noted for being, you know, sort of cutting edge.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now around 19--as we approach like--so what--when were you able to, to get some concessions from the, the--
Speaker 2: Well, we had to--
Speaker 1: --county association?
Speaker 2: In our county, and most counties in California, if not all, there had to be enabling laws passed at the state level, so we fought for laws that would give us full collective bargaining rights.  They ultimately planned something that gave us what they called meet and confer rights.  Meanwhile, as I mentioned a moment ago, we enjoyed the benefits of being a major employees association, so we were this dual group.  And we began to argue across the state that employee associations ought to come together, you know, under an umbrella that would give us more political strength in dealing with state legislatures, and dealing with our county commissions.  And in that process, an agreement to chip away at anything that prevented us from moving forward towards full collective bargaining rights.  And of course, I was gone--they ultimately got much more than we started with.  Then they bargain outright now; whereas, before it was, as I say, meet and confer.  I mean you could put all your stuff on the table, but ultimately there's a political body somewhere that decides, you know, how much of it is gonna, is gonna, gonna be taken up.
Speaker 1: So you all had to just deal with it one bite at a time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one bit at a time, take on certain issues that would have the impact of forcing it from a state level down to a county level, where the county commissioners will have authority to make these decisions.  Whereas prior to that, the state, would have the right to determine whether or not this is a, a legal activity that you're engaging in.
Story_ID: 609053
Speaker 1: Now did AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] give you some kind of a training, you know, as a union leader--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --on how to--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean we just, just sort of went day by day in doing things that worked or didn't work.  I mean if it, if it don't work, why doesn't it, and what do we have to do to, to, to make it more effective?  What we did believe is that if we had a strong local union and committed members, I mean, out of that comes a political, you know, you know, revision or reform.  It was our feeling that because you get elected as a, a, a county couns- county commissioner, that gave you any particular knowledge about what the jobs are.  And the theory then, and it still holds now, is that county commissioners want to have brackets.  They want to have salaries that, that have some relationship with the next class above it, or a job has to be tied to some other job below it.  Well, if you're a chemist, I mean how--why you get tied to a truck driver?  You know, I mean the, the, the two (laughter), I mean they're, they're, they're just not the same kinds of, of skill needs; they're not the same kind of educational needs; they don't have the same--.  While they're all important to the overall operations of, of, of county government, it, it requires different preparation, different training, different education.  And so we're saying that let's measure this job based on its value, not to diminish the other, but let's, let's, let's pay this chemist or this assistant civil engineer or this tractor operator based on the importance of their job.  And you, you can't make that decision without knowing what the job is.  And if the county commissioner is, comes from a law firm or comes out of a real estate firm, what do they know about the safety needs, the skill needs, and all of these kinds of things.  And that was the basis of our argument, that we need to be in the room making our case when decisions are made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense to me, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it didn't, it didn't make a whole lot--.  There's, there's a political judgment, you know, based on what they think make sense for the county's budget.  Well, if, if we're, if we're losing engineers by the handful because somebody else is paying them what they're worth, it's incumbent upon us to, to make the value of judgment to keep them.  I mean you invest a lot of resources in a person, then when they get to a certain level you decide you're not gonna pay them any more than what they're getting.  But Alameda County [California], which is, you know, right next door [to Contra Costa County, California], are making these judgments based on their needs.  And, and so our argument was that, that you can't elect people to office and then they make a pol- political decision about my salary or my benefits.  What we do is, is sit down, and let us explain what we do and its value, and then, then the, the bargaining process will, will, will work it all out.
Story_ID: 609054
Speaker 1: Was there any major breakthrough at some point between the time that you--or did--or, or am I getting--I know you were elected the president in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was that, was that like--I mean what was the significance of that other than the fact that you're the president, but what was the, the significance in terms of the political direction of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]?
Speaker 2: For our local [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675], I'd served on any number of committees and what have you and had served as chair of the bargaining committee and those kinds of things.  And I, and I don't know if it's a work your way up kind of thing, but I, I was elected president, which sort of, you know, gives your responsibility over all of the activities of the local union.  And I saw it as just one more step beyond.  I think what may have been significant in the eyes of some folks is that we have an organization of about 5,500 to 6,000, essentially the majority white collar employees.  There had never been, to my knowledge, an African American who stepped into that position, with the responsibility for the overall operations of the union.
Speaker 1: Now what position were you in before you were elected president?
Speaker 2: I was just a member of--I think my last year I was chair of the negotiations committee--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is a, a research, preparation for bargaining, presentation of the issues to a committee of the county board of supervisors, first to the, the, the staff of the civil service system and then ultimately to the, the, the, the bargaining committee of the county board of supervisors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew how to, as they say, cut the issue or--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: 'Cause not everybody can cut an issue.  There can be something wrong, but unless you have somebody who can cut the issue where people can understand it, it's not--
Speaker 2: Well, you're looking at all of the classifications that work for the county.  And you're trying to make the decisions, okay, if out of the county budget, you know, what percentage of this is gonna go to salaries and benefits, and how is that gonna be distributed among all of these different classes, and how do you, you make a proposal that is equitable for the high pays, the low pays, and in the middle of, of that?  I mean what are workers entitled to in this budget year?  Do you ask for an across the board increase percentage wise, where you know that the lower paid employees are gonna suffer in that process?  And, and then, you know, once you figure out how to bring all this together, then you first got to get agreement from the representatives of the union that this is a fair proposal to put forward.  And the, the, the members of the board of supervisors ultimately is a political body, and their considerations have got to be: do I raise taxes?  Don't I raise taxes?  If I don't raise them, how do we recut what's there now?  If we got to raise it, how much do we raise, and where do we get it from?  And so the job of the, the, the union's negotiating committee is to consider all of these things and, and have a, an argument that considers their political concerns and consider the, the, the employees' equity needs.  And so I, I--we had been doing that for some time, and so that's--it's sort of a natural progression almost.
Story_ID: 609055
Speaker 1: But just before you were elected you were the spokesman.  You, you were, you were the--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: --you were the person negotiating--
Speaker 2: --I was head of the negotiating committee [of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So you were able to, to cut the issue for, for the, for the members (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Before the county board.  I mean--and, and I think part of what you have to be mindful of is that if, if you don't have a political base that, that holds something for or, or something against a committee of the, of the commissioners, I mean goodwill has absolutely no impact on their view of how to get elected (laughter) I mean, I mean--
Speaker 1: This is shocking.  You're, you're telling me that (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I mean--and you'd like to think that fairness and all that plays into it, but it, it, it really don't.  I think it's a, it's a, it's a recognition that, that these groups got to live together, and they gotta do the public's--you know, they gotta do the, the, the function that serves the public.  And it, it makes no sense to cause them to turn against you or, or make them walk a plank.  I mean, you know, what is fair, given what we got to do?
Speaker 1: Okay, so the management's power is the capital and the ownership, or the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your power is the--
Speaker 2: Is workers who perform a, a public service or a public good that must, you know, adjust to the cost of living as it affects them.  And--
Speaker 1: Well what gives them power though is their, their ability to act together, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And say, I'm not coming to work, or I am coming to work (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean it's, it's--I mean that's the ultimate, you--(unclear) because the only thing that workers have to sell is their service.  And if, if they are not being treated fairly or believe they're not being treated fairly, then the only thing that'll balance this is a political pressure from one side and the logic from the other.  And workers do not instantly want to strike.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean it doesn't benefit them to, to strike.  They only strike when they run out of, out of opportunities and, and alternatives.
Speaker 1: So you're walking kind of a fine line there between the--trying to get people to recognize they could have more without scaring them into getting rid of you as a negotiator right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I, I don't think, I think any employee seeks a confrontation just because they'd like to have more.  I mean the question is, is it, is it justified?  Does the, does the facts support the argument.  And if, if they do, then there's, there's a, an appeal can, that you can make to any, you know, employer.  Bad employers cause strikes I mean just simply because they, they don't listen for the employees to make their case based on what the facts are.  And we never had--well, that's not true.  I was gonna say we never had a strike.  We did have a strike, but it was, it came out of, you know, new employers not familiar with their responsibility or our responsibility.  And people run out of alternatives, and they're ultimately gonna strike.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in your case, did--when you became the president, did you all get your, what you wanted, or did you get enough of what you wanted from the?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I--the bargaining process is give and take.  You know, we, we may not get a dollar, but we'll get a rule changed.  And, and, and, and so often it's, it's, it's rules that, that, that cause the problem, or cause a problem.  I mean we were competitive in, into, in, in salaries and benefits and never got to a point where we either bankrupt the county [Contra Costa County, California] or, or caused a politician to walk the plank.
Story_ID: 609056
Speaker 1: During all this negotiation, when you were spokesman for the organization [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] in, in negotiations, were, was, was AS- you said civil--AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] was involved in civil rights on some level, 'cause I think the civil rights movement and labor kind of parallel each other in a lot of the same kind of--
Speaker 2: When we affiliated, I mean the national level, our union was already working with national civil rights organizations: CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was one; Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] organization--
Speaker 1: SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 2: --SCLC was one.  And these are working on different kinds of civil rights issues.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], they were working with--and which was for us, as a local union in, in, in Contra Costa County [California], fit in quite well because there were social justice issues in the county that it needed a voice from the public sector unions to work on.  You know public employee unionizing was quite new then.  There was just a small group of folks who would argue that public employees are fundamentally no different than private sector employees.
Story_ID: 609057
Speaker 1: I was asking you off camera about the March on Washington.  Now this is in '63 [1963].  This is before you became the president--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675]--were you impressed by that, or did you--what, what'd you think about the march?
Speaker 2: I, I thought it was a thing that, that obviously big time, new focusing on, you know, the social, you know social justice issues, I mean the plight of minority groups in general, African Americans in particular, the absence of the, the southern extension of democratic process, the inability to register to vote.  California, I mean that was just so weird.  I mean it was just never occurred that this large segment of, of the population were excluded from those, from those kind of issues that we just simply took for granted in California.  In spite of the fact we had lived in the South, it just didn't register that, that the South, particularly African Americans, couldn't participate in these processes, or even Washington, D.C., could not, you know, vote on a president, vice president or congressional representation.  And it was sort of eye opening.  So we, we just believe that, that, that, that we ought to be participating and supporting that kind of activity.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Just for the record, though there was--it was highly segregated, black folks could vote in Memphis [Tennessee] and some of the other larger cities in the South--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Atlanta [Georgia] and--
Speaker 2: And you know--
Speaker 1: --other places.
Speaker 2: --Alabama, Mississippi, the Carolinas, Georgia, where, where, where discrimination and racism had gone all the way down to sort of the core of our, you know, institutional government so to speak.  So as we sent people, you know, to the march, some as an, as an organizational thing to do.  I mean and we were an association with an association mentality, but we also saw the solidarity that comes from being a union.
Story_ID: 609058
Speaker 1: You were elected to president of AFSCME Local 1675 [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1675] in '65 [1965].  But by 1966 you left your job at Contra Costa County [Contra Costa County Public Works Department] to work full time for AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees].  Like, what, what, what happened in this year--
Speaker 2: Well, as I said before, very few people were prepared to argue that public employees were entitled to the same kind of rights as private sector workers, and the key to that was the right to collective bargaining.  The then leadership of the national union was not warm to that idea.  The national leadership under the presidency of President Arnold Zander in our opinion appeared to be comfortable with either the merit system or the civil service system, or some combination of the two.  But it was not strongly supportive of public employees' right to bargain collectively on the theory that, that collective bargaining was at odds with either one of those other systems.  And our local, I mean we had been having this discussion for some time because, as I said before, we were in a heavily unionized county.  In Contra Costa County [California] you had the oil refinery industry; you had the auto industry; you had all of these things where unions were really making great strides, not just in wages, but in, in terms of arguing for social change.  And our leadership was, was not fully there.  And then out of New York [New York] came a, a fellow who was with that idea, a fellow by the name of Jerry Wurf, W-U-R-F.  And while we could make, you know, the street corner argument, we didn't really fully realize how, how, how broad a role collective bargaining could play.  And we began to talk to him and those who were a part of his team.  And we thought he'd made a lot more sense than the current leadership of the national union, although we were comfortable inside, you know, the, the movement to be able to politically take on state and local government about our rights, seemed like something that, that, that we, we, we saw as a positive sign.  So in 1964, we were a part of the, the new effort on the, in the public sector to fight for collective bargaining rights, and our leadership changed hands.  Jerry Wurf defeated Arnold Zander, and it set out on a course to bring collective bargaining to the public sector.
Story_ID: 609059
Speaker 1: And in sixty--tail end of '65 [1965], early '66 [1966], because public employees didn't have much of a presence in, in state legislatures and at the congressional and senatorial level here, the talk was about creating a department that would lobby state legislatures, or county governments, or city governments, or even federal government--lobby, lobby them on behalf of public employees.  Because the federal government had become so involved in funding support for county programs, state programs that were essentially federal priorities.  And if the federal government is gonna be putting the money in to do this, it was gonna also send some rules and regulations with it.  And we were interested in and concerned about what those regulations would mean.  Example: in social services, were--which became an, a federal priority.  So many of our folks were social workers, eligibility workers, probation off- you name it, we had some of them, not that we thought the federal government was gonna do much, much wrong.  The question is they're gonna decide what these rules are.  Well, we want to have a voice in that.  And secondly, is what they are gonna be demanding beyond our ability to do without training, without additional resources, without additional, you know, personnel?  So we wanted to be a part of that discussion.  So the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] proposed that we have this department of legislation and what they call community affairs [Department of Legislation and Community Affairs].  Which was really sort of a, a, a cover up for political action.  And they asked if I was interested in joining, you know, the union at that time to, to take on a part of this responsibility.  And it sounded like something we had been talking about for a long time, so I wanted to think about it.  And that was the tail end of '65 [1965].  Early '64 [1964] it was discussed again.  And I said, well, let me go home and--
Speaker 2: You mean early '66 [1966]?
Speaker 1: Early '66 [1966].  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was gonna say, wait a minute now (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Is this something we want to do, and do you want to help be a part of this?  So I thought, well, it's something we can help do.  Do I want to upset family and what have you to do this?  And it, it sounded better and better, so I said, yeah.  And so I told him, let me just talk to my wife [Dorotheria Rader Lucy] one more time.  And so I came back to sell her the proposition, and she--
Speaker 2: So would it mean moving to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: And so she said, "Well, how long are we gonna be gone?"  So I looked her right in the face and lied.  I said (laughter), "We're gonna be gone a year."  (Laughter) And we've been here ever since.
Speaker 2: Now did you have children--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How many?
Speaker 1: We had three at the time [William Lucy, Jr., Benita Lucy Marsh and Phyllis Lucy Manuel].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was, it was the kind of excitement that, you know, for us was new and different.  I'd never done anything like this before, but certainly the justification for it was there.
Speaker 2: So where were you gonna re- relocate to?
Speaker 1: Here in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We actually moved into Silver Spring [Maryland].  We first were gonna make sure we liked this, and this was gonna work.  So I was commuting from San Francisco [California] to D.C. on Friday evenings, and Friday evening from D.C. to San Francisco; Sunday night, San Francisco to D.C.  And that went on for, for a while, and, and this kind of got kind of old, and so we decided, okay, we're gonna move back to D.C.  If we move back here--and I promptly got transferred back to California, so I was commu- commuting the other way, so.  But it worked out fine for us.
Story_ID: 609060
Speaker 1: The issue began to be understood very clear about a lot of public sector employees that they, they were in effect second class citizens.  And only in a few places that their benefit, their salary, their input matched that of private sector workers.  I mean we used to raise the question: in New York City [New York, New York] you've got public transportation on the buses from downtown to Midtown [Midtown Manhattan].  Got private, you know, buses from Midtown to Uptown [Upper Manhattan].  They make different salaries, different benefits; same system.  Public sector employees were earning substantially less, had substantially different rules.  So you know, why is this?  And it's that way because the political powers that be want it that way.  Well, you know, and our argument is no difference in qualifications required, and we're fundamentally no different than the private sector worker.  And when you say they were--their organization was growing, it was growing because of the contradictions that existed for public sector workers.  I mean sanitation worker in New York City does a lot better than a sanitation worker in Memphis, Tennessee, same garbage.  You know, I mean, and, and once we got into it, we could see these differences much clearer.  And they had a lot of social implications.  You know, sanitation workers in New York City, all white, better wages, better benefits; sanitation in Memphis, Tennessee, all black, no wages, no benefits.  And it's not because the workers who choose to discriminate; it's because the system, you know, forces you into that kind of a situation.  Same, equally true in hospitals, and you know, private hospitals, one set of benefits, one set of wages; public hospitals, another.  Schools.  So, when, when we start, start to think about what's our legislative agenda gonna be, how do we fix these things, we began to think that well, the first thing we need to think about is how to bring public employees under a set of rules and guidelines that at least treated them as if they were private employees, you know, schools, clinics, private hospital versus public hospital.  You know, what's the difference?  And so we set out to get public employees covered under the FCC--not FCC, but under the interstate commerce clause.  We had, you know workers and members in Panama tied to the District of Columbia, but they get a different salary, different benefits.  You know, you could have an employee who graduated from University of Wisconsin who lived in Panama but can't teach the children of U.S. workers.  I mean there's something, you know, fundamentally wrong with that system, which it had been no effort to look at until, you know, we began to argue that we can't have two or three different systems and they all impact particularly minority workers differently.
Story_ID: 609061
Speaker 1: Now you were actually jailed and beaten several times it says here.  Is this true?
Speaker 2: Well, not beaten too badly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean roughed up.
Speaker 1: All right, so you're kind of roughed up but not, not really beaten.  I just wondered, 'cause, because what he had here.  What--can you give us an example of a time that, that you had to go to jail?
Speaker 2: Oh, in Memphis [Tennessee], I mean you, you just can't talk to a Memphis police any way (laughter), any way you want to.
Speaker 1: Now this is in Memphis then this happens?
Speaker 2: In Memphis, Baltimore [Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Topeka, Kansas.  You name--we had a shot at it.
Speaker 1: Well, well, maybe I should ask you then what drew you to Memphis?  And before you tell the Memphis story about it, what--
Speaker 2: The, the--I was, I was stationed in, in, in Detroit [Michigan] at the time the Memphis sanitation strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] began.  And because I was from Memphis, we found out about the strike from a reporter from The Washington Post who had been, you know, with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and happened to come back through Memphis and saw what he thought was unrest.  So he stopped by our office, we were then located on 15th Street downtown at the Madison Building [James Madison Memorial Building, Washington, D.C.] and asked us what were we doing in Memphis.  Well, we didn't have any idea what was going on in Memphis (laughter).   We, we didn't know, although we had had a staff person who had came through there sometime back.  But he says it look like there's gonna be a confrontation of some kind.  And the president then, President Wurf [Jerry Wurf], asked if I knew anything about it, which I didn't.  I mean that was in Detroit.  He says, "Well, if it gets any worse, maybe you can take a run down there and see what's going on."  "Oh, sure."  And he was right.  There was--I mean the, the workers in the public works department in Memphis [Memphis Public Works Division] had really become weary of this double standard, you know, safety and health issues that never got taken care of; salary issues that nobody would listen to them on; assignment issues based on color as opposed to function.  If you--if it rains one day, some people can come to work and get paid; others can't.  I mean all of those, those issues that were so blatantly, you know, based on race.  And it was not a strike that the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] called.  It was just that the workers themselves had, had grown weary of this.
Speaker 1: Now were the--who were the, the spokesmen for the Memphis garbage workers?
Speaker 2: Initially, it was a rank and file leadership itself.  This was prior to the strike.  When the strike began, it became very clear that the city was not gonna deal with local folks, and didn't want to deal with us.  And the local leadership was just weary.  There was no plan.
Speaker 1: Now is there a name of somebody or some people--
Speaker 2: Oh, T- T- a fellow by the name of T.O. Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay, T.O. Jones.
Speaker 2: Robert Beasley, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's important that these guys' names--I don't think I've ever heard the names before.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?  Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: Yeah, never heard of them--
Speaker 2: --they were just recently invect- inducted into the labor hall of fame [U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Honor] this year--last year, I'm sorry.  But the rank and file leadership were, were their own spokespersons.
Story_ID: 609062
Speaker 1: They didn't have--at least in our experience, you don't strike because you're mad.  You know, the only time you strike is when you can win.  You don't punish your workforce you know to get even with some boss you don't like.  That makes no sense.
Speaker 2: Now when do you know that you're ready to--when do you know you can win?
Speaker 1: When you have done all the preliminary things that need doing.  You've got a plan for injunctions; you've got a plan for arrests; you've got a plan to make sure that people don't begin to lose their properties and what have you; you got a plan for making sure that people don't get starved out of striking; you've got an idea of how your--their daily needs are gonna be met.  And you've conditioned the, the workforce for what's gonna happen.  And then you've got an, an alternative plan that's, if something else happens that you haven't thought about.  And the, and the best way to do this is for the workers themselves to make this decision, after being given all of the information that--least you can think about.  And they got to be committed to it.  You can't have the husband striking and the wife not sure this is what he ought to be doing.  So, the two of them got to talk about that so that he knows that he has support of, of, of, of family, in particular the wife.  And this is ultimately what we had to do in Memphis [Tennessee] to get this thing straight, because there were no demands.  You know, "Why are you on strike?"  "'Cause I want justice."  What does that mean?   (Laughter) You know, so, so I mean it's, it's, it's a process.  And if you've got--you know, as I say, workers have only their services to sell, and if they're convinced that they're being treated unfairly, and they have concluded that they ought to withhold their services, then you, you, you're in a position to talk about striking.
Story_ID: 609063
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me also say this.  Nobody in their right mind has a sanitation strike in February.  I mean in, in, in the winter nobody cares.  I mean (laughter), I mean, so--
Speaker 2: You're saying the garbage doesn't stink as bad as in February?
Speaker 1: It doesn't stink as bad.  Think about June or July, if you're gonna have a, a, a garbage strike, that's when you want to have it.
Speaker 2: The hottest part of the year.
Speaker 1: Hottest part of the year.  And you want to make sure that the density of, of population is such that it's gonna accumulate fast.  And then, then you want to make sure that the part of the community that feels the impact of the strike is that part who's got political influence to cause people to want to bring this thing to an, a halt as quickly as you can.  And these were the things that had not been thought about.  And, and there's no reason to think that, that rank and file workers think about those kinds of things.  And most workers, particularly low wage workers, they live from paycheck to paycheck.  So they might miss one, but when you get up to two and three, they got a different set of problems.  I mean where is the house note gonna come from, the car note, all these other kinds of things?  And, and people got to resolve that in their mind before they are faced with the issue, because it's been our experience that, that, that employers have all kinds of ways to put economic pressure on workers, to put social pressure on workers.  The employers are politically, generally politically connected.  They relate to the banks.  They relate to the savings and loans.  They relate to the grocery stores.  So they can gin up pressure on a group of workers to just break their spirit.  And so we had to make a decision on Memphis [Tennessee]: since they had not thought of these things before, had not prepared for these things, we had to on a crash basis bring everybody up to speed in terms of what we got to deal with.
Speaker 2: How long did it take?  How--I mean, when, once you arrived in Memphis, how long did it take to bring them up to where they were ready?
Speaker 1: About, about two weeks.  But we--I found other substitute things to do.  I'd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now I'm, I'm surprised though that it's only two weeks, 'cause that sound like a lot of things you had to do.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the, the men there had sort of a, a, a spirit among themselves.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were so mad they didn't, they didn't think about or care about these other things.  But we had to say, look, first thing, what we want you to do is to the people who you serve every day, they gotta know what this is about.  So we want you to take this leaflet, and take it to the door that you pick up the garbage from every day, every other day, however often you do it so that, so that the general public understands why you're angry.  Secondly, we want you to go home and talk to your wife, and tell her the decision you just made.  And maybe you didn't make it 'cause you believe; maybe you made it because of peer pressure, you know, so that we're all--so that everybody's clear.  And if she says, you know, I'm supporting you, then we'll see you back tomorrow morning.  If she says she's not supporting you, then chances are you probably ought to not do this, you know, because the last thing you want--be fighting the boss and fighting the wife.  And to their credit, you know, they did both of these things in short order.  And, and we didn't tell them, "You got to strike."  I mean you, you, if you decided to do this, here is what we've got to do.  And I've, I have not seen as, as loyal a group of workers, as committed a group of, of men as was in that strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], and these were not young men.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so what you're saying is--I guess what I'm trying to understand is that they were agitated enough to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --carry this through.  They had been fed up--
Speaker 1: Fed up.
Speaker 2: --completely up--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --pretty much where, where it only took two weeks to get them ready.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean they, they--I mean we, we started action the day of the strike; we started doing things.  They may not have known or understood why they were doing it, but they were willing to do it.
Story_ID: 609064
Speaker 1: On the morning that the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] started, we had gone down to city hall [Memphis City Hall, Memphis, Tennessee] to talk to the mayor, who was a real throwback.  This occurred--
Speaker 2: Now is this Mayor Loeb [Henry Loeb] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Loeb.
Speaker 2: Loeb, yeah.
Speaker 1: This occurred maybe a month after the city had gone through a, a brand new election, a change in government, both structure and, and focus.  I mean they had gone from a departmental type structure to a strong mayor type structure.  He had won the mayor's office with virtually no support from the black community, so he didn't owe anybody anything.  The prior department leadership had--they had changed, and so the mayor had all the power, both real and imaginary.  I mean he took--everything that somebody else wouldn't fight for became his, his power base.  So when it, when it was clear the strike was gonna start, we went downtown to try and, and think through this thing with the mayor.  We figured nobody wants to strike.  He didn't care.  I mean his position was this is not New York City [New York, New York], and that--whatever that meant to him.  And--
Speaker 2: So he would actually say that, "This is not--," (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.  And the men had been complaining about safety and health issues and equipment issues for some time, and nobody would pay any attention to them.  And I think the catalyst was, you know, when, when, when, when it rained, you know, they would send some workers home, some would, would stay.  Well, black workers in the public works department [Memphis Public Works Division] had showed up for work and told to go home and would not be paid.  White workers in the other side of public works was allowed to work and got paid for a full day.  I mean weird rules.  Coupled with that, and I'm not sure of the sequence--I'd have to do some more, have to do a little of reading back--two men [Robert Walker and Echol Cole] in the rain got in the back of the truck, back of one of these packers, to get out of the rain.  And what, what at least the facts suggested that maybe lightning or something struck the mechanism and triggered it action, and both of them were crushed to death in the back of the truck.  And that's what--
Speaker 2: That sounds, sounds kind of unlikely then--unlikely, doesn't it, that lightning would strike it and--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the stuff was so old, the equipment was so know--who knows what, what did it.  But anyhow, the mechanism kicked in.  Both of them--
Speaker 2: The two men were, were--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --injured in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They had no insurance.  The city had no responsibility or felt no responsibility to give them any kind of a decent burial, and which is not necessarily unusual for public works and sanitation yards.  I mean this is a, a, a, a unique kind of work.  And so passing the hat and collecting money is not new.  So they had to pass the hat, collect money for the services and all that.  And all these thing are boiling.  And the strike became this series of issues that they could not get a hearing on.  So we thought that given all these things had happened, any mayor who's just elected, I mean, you can't be so insensitive that you don't want to hear this.  So we went down to, to (laughter), to the city hall to talk to the mayor.  And this guy was a typical John Wayne type, you know: I'm, I'm right, and therefore there's nothing else to discuss.  You're striking.  You're illegal.  I will not speak to people who are illegal.  And so we tried to make the case that how do you solve problems unless the, the one with the power understands what's motivating the other?  Well, he didn't want to hear any of that.  And he said besides, I mean, you outsiders, you know, who, who come here disturbing the peace and all this kind of stuff.  I, if I talk to anybody, I'll talk to the men.  Fair enough, so we said we'll go back and get the men.  So we went back and got about a thousand of them (laughter) and brought them down to his office, and whereupon he just went berserk, I mean because garbage men are dressed to collect garbage, you know, and not what you're gonna run into in your normal, you know, noonday tea.  So he got all upset about the fact that he was being required to talk to these men.  And Mr. Jones [T.O. Jones], you know, had had his series of run ins with Mayor Loeb.  So we brought them all down.  And it was good for the men to be able to talk to somebody like the mayor because they got a chance to see how disrespectful he could be.
Story_ID: 609065
Speaker 1: All right, so this is, we're in 1968, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: We're at February.
Speaker 1: February.  It's not time to have a strike yet 'cause the garbage is not gonna smell as bad now.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's, it's clear it's a strike already [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  It may not have been called that--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --but that's what it was.  Anyhow, we, we, the, the men themselves, were able to see how disrespectful the city was.  And you had the mayor [Henry Loeb], his office was clearly too small for the size of the crowd we brought [to Memphis City Hall, Memphis, Tennessee].  So the suggestion was that we (laughter), we go to the municipal auditorium for this meeting, and he agreed to come over to it.  So we, we had a full house, and he just totally misread what was taking place, and to a degree, so did we.  And he proceeded to give them the 1920 logic of, you know, I, I know every one of y'all.  I know your daddy.  And you can always come to me, and you could come to me now, and that, that kind of silly stuff, and that, you, you know I'd, I'd, I'd give you the shirt off my back.  And I said to myself as I sat there, I said, this got to be the dumbest guy I have ever ran into.  And somebody in the audience stood up and said, "Well, I, I don't want the shirt off your back.  Give me a decent wage, and I'll buy my own shirt."  You know, whereupon he just, you know, like, had no idea that a, a new thing was, was taking place.  Some of these--they, they, now they had not been home yet, so they had come straight from the public works yard to this meeting.  We had not given them the instructions I spoke about earlier, but they had enough courage to, to talk back at him.  And he just went berserk.  (Laughter) So I kept saying now he's gonna tell these guys that they don't know what they are doing, and they have probably just made the biggest decision they have ever made in their lives, and they're not gonna be told like your, your, your children.  So the meeting ended at the mu- munic- at the city municipal center, and we marched back to the union hall [of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733].  And when we got back, the question was--oh, this is like day one--yeah, what do we want to do?  Because we are getting ready to get into a major confrontation.  And they said that they were gonna stick it out.  So we said if that's the decision you're making, then here are the things we gotta do.  And we went through the litany of things I spoke about earlier, but I said we also have, will have to not just alert our customers to the service, but they gotta know who we are.  And that requires us to do some things that maybe we've never done before.
Story_ID: 609066
Speaker 1: In a southern city, church, like I suspect in a lot of other places, but particularly southern cities, church is the cornerstone.  So our decision was, you know, come Sunday morning we want you to go and talk to your minister about what's going on.  And you know, the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] was not the instant drawing card for the church.  I mean the churches, they don't know a whole lot about unions, and what they did know was not necessarily good across the South.  So we said, we want you to ask the minister for time to explain to the congregation what's going on.  And the South, like a lot of other places, everybody is darn near related to everybody in some way; cousin, uncle, you know, nephew.  We want people in the next two or three days to know what is going on in the City of Memphis [Tennessee].  And unlike the, the history books suggest, every church did not come to their aid right away, because they were not clear what the union was, who it was, and some resented (laughter) the workforce challenging the mayor [Henry Loeb] in this new political time.  "Why didn't you come to us before you did this?"  Which is always a dodge.  But, but anyhow (laughter) after a while, you know, the churches began to open up.  The first minister who allowed folks to speak at his church was Bishop Gilbert Patterson [Gilbert E. Patterson] of the A.M.E.s [African Methodist Episcopal].  And you know, the--you know, on down the line, the Baptists came in, and, and, and people started to respond to their congregation.  Then some of the more activist pastors, fellow by the name of Jim Lawson who identified with the strike early on because he saw the nature of this function just being flagrantly discriminatory on its face.
Speaker 2: Now this is the great James Lawson from Nashville [Tennessee], minister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --of the--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --that organized the--
Speaker 1: CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] days, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] days.
Speaker 2: --the Freedom Rides.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In 1961.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  He was a pastor of Centenary Methodist Church [Centenary United Methodist Church] there in Memphis, and he, he identified very quickly.  There's a fellow by the name of Ezekiel Bell, black minister, white church [Parkway Gardens Presbyterian Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  Then there was--
Speaker 2: I've never heard him.  Now this is a, he's a--you said he was the--
Speaker 1: He was a pastor of, of, I think it was C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal]--no, either--A.M.E., C.M.E.s--U.M.E., United Methodist [United Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: Okay, so this a black United Methodist pastor--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah [sic.].
Speaker 2: --of a white church?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In Memphis?
Speaker 1: In Memphis and--
Speaker 2: This is something that nobody would ever have--
Speaker 1: Well, the U.M.E.s had a very progressive social program.  And, and he--I don't know whether he was the first one, but he was, he was, he was a pastor then.
Speaker 2: Now that's very unusual in any part of the country--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a black pastor of a white church.
Speaker 1: We then had a white pastor of a black church [Clayborn Temple A.M.E. Church, Memphis, Tennessee] (laughter), which is, is a, a fellow by the name of Malcolm Blackburn, who was the--who was just sort of caught up in this, and he saw the unfairness of it, so he identified very early.
Speaker 2: Now what, what denomination was he?
Speaker 1: A.M.E.
Speaker 2: He was a white pastor--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of an A.M.E. church?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now that's un- that's, all this stuff is knocking me for a loop.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've never heard of this.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And one of the, one of the early on ministers who came but did not come committed, a fellow by the name of Ralph Jackson [H. Ralph Jackson], who was the head of the A.M.E.'s minimum salary department of the church.  And, and he was the upper middle class, you know, black, who really very clear that, that he wasn't like the rest of town.  And, and while they let members speak, they didn't necessarily instantly rush in to declare support.
Story_ID: 609067
Speaker 1: We had worked our way through three or four days, maybe a few more to the point where we had got an agreement from the city council [Memphis City Council] that they would have a hearing on these issues.  A fellow you mentioned earlier, [HistoryMaker] Jerry Fanion, was instrumental in, in helping that happen.  He at that time worked for the human relations commission--he and a fellow by the name of Baxton Bryant [Sidney Baxton Bryant], who worked for the state human relations commission [Tennessee Human Relations Commission].  Anyhow, we, we, we got this understanding.  We thought we had a settlement of the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  And we were told to come to the city council meeting the following morning, and, and these things will begin to be put in place.  Well, we got down there, and the fellow who was chairing the city council, a fellow by the name of [HistoryMaker] Fred Davis, had, had given us a commitment the night before, got down there the following morning and it's like we never met the night before.
Speaker 2: Now, now just to put it in perspective, were there any black city council members (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, this was fellow was black.  Yeah, Fred Davis--
Speaker 2: Fred Davis.  Who, who else was--?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Fellow by the name of Netters [James Netters].  I can't recall his first name.  And then there was another fellow on there, J.L.--J.O., J.O. Patterson [J.O. Patterson, Jr.].  There were at least three and maybe even more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just make that point because a lot of people, they think of the Civil Rights Movement, they don't know the difference between Memphis [Tennessee] and Selma [Alabama] or Memphis and s- any place else.  And they would not expect black city councilmen to be on the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were, there were at least three, may have been one more.  I can't remember the name, but J.O. Patterson, Netters, and Fred Davis.
Speaker 2: Now would there have been any--I mean I don't know if you know 'cause you didn't live there, but I, I doubt if there'd have been any ten years ahead of that, right?  In '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: I wouldn't think so.
Speaker 2: There probably would have been none.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that, in that ten year span--
Speaker 1: This is probably about mid-'66 [1966] or '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So thi- during this ten year span between Montgomery Bus Boycott and Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] agitation there in '68 [1968], there'd been some progress in terms of black people getting on city councils and voting in the South and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in major cities.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, and I suspect it's because of the way districts' wards or, or precincts were organized.  You had heavy, heavy concentration of African Americans on the south side, so they're gonna elect somebody.  But the mayoral race was an at large race, and that changes the dynamics.  So, even though the black community had not supported Loeb [Henry Loeb], there were enough votes out there for him to get elected without their support.  And so he therefore felt he didn't owe anybody anything.  But the, the three that were on there had no knowledge of how to deal with a labor confrontation, had no experience whatsoever the issues and the procedures for settling a strike, no, no knowledge of the power that they had as members of the city council to move a settlement.
Story_ID: 609068
Speaker 1: So when [HistoryMaker] Fred Davis says come in tomorrow when the council [Memphis City Council] would do such and such, the mayor [Henry Loeb] just shot that down.  So when we showed up the next day, I mean the council had been, been really worked over.  So I mean they just backed up off of their prior commitment instantly.  And here we are with a, a thousand or more workers [from the Memphis Public Works Division] in the city council chambers, community leaders who'd come down to be a part of the resolution but had no understanding--.  And people went berserk.  I mean they, they opened up the city council like you would do in one of these old British things, you know, hear ye, hear ye, all that kind of silly stuff.  And then they just went right on with the agenda as if we had not ever had this prior discussion that night before.  So the men were absolutely upset because they had made A, a major decision to strike; B, gone through the first or second day, and they're back now for a solution, and they're not getting any.  So, we had to figure out something to do with all these workers because the city had a double dose of police, you know, on the site.  And we probably should have known something or suspected something from that.  So we said we want a permit to march from city hall [Memphis City Hall, Memphis, Tennessee] back to the church [Clayborn Temple A.M.E. Church, Memphis Tennessee].  And you know, our inability to find somebody in charge, you know, sort of contributed to what was the first confrontation with the police.  When we left city hall and started to march down Main Street, the police clearly was looking for a fight.  And we took half the street.  And as we marched, they used their cars to press us closer and closer to the curb line, and then ultimately onto the sidewalk.  And as something like that is bound to, you know, create a problem, and it did.  And for the first time the, the police department [Memphis Police Department] used mace as a test for cop--crowd control.  And people were beaten, were maced, were, you know, just really mis- misused, including this pastor who I told you about, Ralph Jackson [H. Ralph Jackson], who had been lukewarm in his support.  And he thought he was (gesture) that much above the rest of blacks in Memphis [Tennessee].  He got maced right along with everybody else.  And it was clear to him it didn't matter what you were wearing, how dressed up you were, blah, blah, blah.  If you were in the street that day, you're just one more black who are a part of this rowdy crowd.  So he got maced and, and became an instant convert (laughter) I mean--.  And he, and he told large crowds that he didn't know anything about labor, didn't know nothing about no union.  But he realized that he wasn't any different than anybody else in Memphis when it came to the police department.  So he became, along with Jim Lawson [James Lawson], the most ardent supporter of the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], I mean right, right up until his absolute last day.  To us, it was clear that this thing ain't gonna be settled until we build enough pressure to force the mayor to look at this as an employer.  Don't look at it with race notions.  Don't look at it as a violation of the law.  None of that stuff mattered once you get to the point we thought we were at.  All we figured, we've got to mobilize the community in order for A, boycott pressure if we need to do that, in order for people to start feeling some pain themselves.  And that's what we did.  I mean we mobilized the entire city.  And different strengths came from different places.  But the black community was absolutely solid after the macing.  They didn't know whether the workers were right or wrong, nor did they care.  They just figured this was no way you treat people in general.
Story_ID: 609069
Speaker 1: So people--we didn't have to put up any picket lines or anything like that because nobody would pick up the garbage.  They wouldn't let anybody pick up the garbage.  The city tried to hire, you know, folks to replace them.  They'd get, you know, a handful or so, but they could no more deal with the size and volume of, of, of, of rubbish that was, that was accumulating.  But this thing went on for (background noise)--it went on for sixty plus days.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Speed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So folks in the community, they just refused to allow anybody to pick up the garbage.  Plus, the mayor [Henry Loeb] announced he was gonna start hiring people, and if they didn't come back to work their jobs would be gone.  So the first thing that people did, said nobody is gonna come in my backyard and pick up my garbage.  So, so we instituted a, a daily march, a, a nightly rally, and you know, on just around the clock basis, just trying to build support for the strikers because nobody had seen anything like this, you know, before.  And you know, we got reaction from city, the state, ultimately from the federal level.  You know, people concluded that this is an effort to take over the country, starting in the Memphis public works department [Memphis Public Works Division].  I mean that was Hoover's [J. Edgar Hoover] view of what was taking place.  And had he known that we no more wanted to strike in February like we, you know, wanted open heart surgery.  So somebody in, in, I have to assume it was the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], proceeded to make sure that the news did not get outside of Memphis [Tennessee].  You know, AP [Associated Press], UP [United Press International], all that kind of stuff was, the news was, was shut off.  And we found ourselves with a major strike that nobody knew anything about.  And our effort was to get at least recognition to what was going on, so we started thinking who, who would draw the kind of media that would get this story outside of Memphis.  So we called Roy Wilkins and asked if he would come down, told him what was going on, and you know, come down and see if you can have a press conference, or something like that, and he did.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in the process of working on the Poor People's Campaign, which was coming to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  So we thought that would get some recognition.  So Jim Lawson [James Lawson] called Dr. King and asked if he would come through and take a look at what was going on.  I'm not sure what day in the strike this is.  But anyhow, Dr. King said he would come and ultimately came.  And when he saw what was going on in Memphis, he says, I mean this is, you know, the problem of America: you know, people who work every day and are still poor, cannot get themselves out of poverty, and they're willing to do whatever is called upon them to do.  And he says, this, this is, is, is a story, so he decided to identify with the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  The story got out.  People went berserk.  You know, Dr. King is a civil rights leader, not a labor leader, and yet Dr. King had been talking about the coalition of labor and civil rights, you know, for, for years.  And he spoke the first time there and really excited people.  I mean they, they, they saw this as a major challenge that could conceivably could turn stuff around.  Then he said we got to have a major, major march and bring this city to a halt, yeah, which was a great idea; it just wasn't gonna happen (laughter).  But the date that was set for the second march had the biggest blizzard in the history of Memphis, which achieved two things.  First of all, it, it achieved our goal.  It stopped the city.  But it threw us off schedule in terms of our effort to force them to negotiate, and Dr. King's effort to sort of dramatize, you know, the economic issues involved to--.  So we had to have, you know, another date.
Story_ID: 609070
Speaker 1: In meantime, you know, we're meeting with the city, and the city is just not understanding yet what they had on their hands.  And we're doing all we can to keep this as a labor issue and out of the sort of the civil rights track.  And by that I mean we thought it would be extremely difficult to win a strike in the South based on doing right by black workers.  You know, we just didn't see any political institution down there who would settle a strike on that basis.  And it's at this point that the Invaders become a story and an issue.
Speaker 2: Now who are the Invaders?
Speaker 1: These were--I'm not sure I ever met them all.  But the ones I met were students at Memphis State University [University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee].  Some had been [U.S.] military for a while.  There were others who were just sort of activists concerned about, you know, social issues, social justice issues in the community.
Speaker 2: Well, some of, you mean some of the guys had been Vietnam [Vietnam War] vets that have come back--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --war.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I don't think they were terrorists or anything like that.  They just wanted to make a name for themselves, and this was an opportunity to do it.
Speaker 2: Now, now just to put it in context, the Black Panther Party had already started up in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], where you just left in '66 [1966] I believe it was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --under Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton].
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the, the, the, the Panthers and the Invaders had, in my opinion, two totally different approaches to the problems of the community.  I mean the Panthers were about, they are educating the community to its own need to empower itself, about a special focus on young people, feeding programs, educational programs, and if necessary, confronting authority; not instigating anything, but responding to it.  And the Invaders really was about making statements about what's wrong, you know, which, you know, that don't take a whole lot of skill to do that.  But they were looking for something to, to I think help positively, but something to hook onto.  And they ultimately began to think that the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] was not being handled right.  And for somebody who'd never handled a strike, I'm not altogether sure what they had in mind.  But we made it very clear that this, this is not some ex- social experience that, that we're doing with, and we're dealing with people's lives and their livelihoods.  And if you got a, a desire to help the strike, then help it with the program that we are putting in place.  We don't need any alternative programs that in our experience we've never seen work.  And they thought they could organize the community better than we could.  And you know, that's a matter of judgment.  I mean by that point in time, we had this various slices of the, of the black community organized, the religious community was on board.  The small businesspeople were on board.  And theirs were because they just saw what was happening to the community as a whole.  We were beginning to make inroads into the, the white community, you know, people of goodwill, folks who was concerned about the image of Memphis [Tennessee] and how all that would play itself out.  But nobody could move the mayor [Henry Loeb].  I mean he was just locked into a position.  And every time he spoke, he painted himself into a smaller corner, even as we tried to help him.  I mean the last thing we want is somebody who has no political space at all.  And that's, that's where he continued to paint himself.
Story_ID: 609071
Speaker 1: The date for the second march was set by Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and clearly being involved in Memphis [Tennessee] was affecting his schedule for the Poor People's Campaign in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  So we had gotten the implications that he may not come back to Memphis, after having announced, you know, what he wanted to do.  So the date of the second march--I for- I forget the exact date, but he came.  We had totally mobilized the, the, the, the African American community, some of the broader white community.  And somebody had made a decision on the police side, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] side, or whoever, is to really instigate violence, you know, in, in, at, during the course of the march.  We have never had, nor would we ever had--have a strike situation where violence is a part of the strategy.  So the Invaders began to indicate that they were, were concerned about the strategy around this strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], and they thought that people only respond to violence, blah, blah, blah.  And those people who had been inserted into their ranks, you know, apparently had strong voices.  When the violence started, it did not start from the, the strikers.  It started from people outside of the march and the striking--the marchers, workers.  And at first we tried to minimize it by dragging them inside the march.  Wherever we found somebody with a stick with a sign on it who was taking the sign off to use the stick, we'd drag him out the march.  Not until later during the hearings conducted by Senator Sam Church [sic. Frank Church] did we find out that these were instigators.  I mean these were FBI staff people who had been assigned to instigate violence.  Not every single piece of violence may not have been them, but the, the, the, the instigation of people to do these things started from their actions.  And this was after Dr. King had left Memphis and, and had gone on.  So, we didn't--became really concerned.  I mean we got something on our hands that we have not normally experienced.  We've never had violence before.  We've got a group of men who are beyond middle age.  I mean they, they don't have--I mean their lives are not organized for this kind of stuff.  So Dr. King had to, had to have a peaceful march, otherwise his national reputation was called into question.  Who would follow him to Washington, D.C. to throw bricks?  And I mean it was just, it was just really a real challenge.  And our meetings with him and his staff, you know, we wanted desperately for this to be a labor management confrontation, that now has taken on, you know, serious implications of, of rioting and, and added police.  The city had called in the National Guard, and the state had sent down reservists.  I mean just the city was in a, in a crazy situation.  But Dr. King felt very strongly that he had to come back to Memphis to do this, this, this, this march.  We were concerned about how do we get this man to sit down at the negotiating table and sort of publicly put out what we thought were the simple issues involved so that people of Mem- Memphis with strong feelings would put some pressure on him to let's resolve this thing.  We could never get it done.  We just could not get it done.  So fast forward to when Dr. King came back for the march of April four- 5th, I guess it was.  He spoke on April 3rd at Mason Temple [Mason Temple Church of God in Christ, Memphis, Tennessee], tremendous speech.  It was now come to be known as the mountaintop speech [I've Been to the Mountaintop].  Well, A, Dr. King did not want to speak 'cause he was just tired.  He was just worn out.  But he came over to deliver the address after Ralph Abernathy had spoken and people were still sitting there waiting, you know, where is Dr. King?  (Laughter) We, we heard you, Ralph, think that's cool, but where is Dr. King?  So finally he came over.  And they were talking about, you know, following his speech, preparation for the march that following Saturday I think it was.  And the evening of the 4th was when the, when he was, when the assassination took place.  And you know, the city just went into chaos, I mean all across the country was chaotic.  Added pressure was generated to settle this thing.
Story_ID: 609072
Speaker 1: Now did you have a occasion to sit down with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and with, with your group [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] and, and discuss things?  And what was your impression of Dr. King?  Is this the first time you had, you had like, you know--
Speaker 2: This is the--
Speaker 1: --have had a lot--
Speaker 2: --first time--
Speaker 1: --of contact with him?
Speaker 2: --that he had experienced the kind of violence, you know, associated with any march that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, that he had that came partly from the march, partly, you know, against the march.
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm interested in what your impression of Dr. King is, 'cause--and I mean your personal impression of him, and what's, what's the context that you first meet Dr. King, and what he was telling you all behind the scenes, 'cause we all know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, his, his, his primary concern was the violence associated with the march.
Speaker 1: I mean did he--I mean is this--just kind of set the stages.  Did, did you all meet like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, and where did you meet, and what was--
Speaker 2: At the--
Speaker 1: --discussed?
Speaker 2: We met at the, at the Rivermont Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is prior to him coming back for the last march.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, he was staying there.  We met in his room when the march was broken up by all this crazy stuff on, on the, you know, the, the, the instigators.  And he talked about the fact that nationally, you just really could not have violence as a part of the strategy.  And we assured him that this was not violence that came from the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] or the strikers.  I mean wherever it came from, it was from outside of, of, of this grouping.  And the question became, were the Invaders responsible for the, for the violence?  Well, we know they were upset because they didn't have a major role in the organization of the march or the strategy for what we were doing, trying to negotiate.  But we did not see them as, as a group that will just go out and deal with property damage and, and that kind of thing.  And he just--we just couldn't figure it out.  And his point was that he, he, he has to have a nonviolent march in order to pursue his broader agenda.  And the thing that goes un- un- unnoticed, at least not discussed, is the fact that there were people, one or two people, who were killed that day by the Memphis Police Department, totally unconnected to the strike, had nothing to do with the strike.  Larry Turner [sic. Larry Payne] I think was the name of young--one young kid, who was killed way away from the strike, had nothing to do with it.  And then there was a s- a, a marcher--I'm not sure where the event took place, but I mean just never reported on, never discussed.  And the police department just simply said that they were strikers who refused to obey police orders, and it just sort of dropped off the front page, or dropped off any page.  But in our discussions with Dr. King, he made it very clear that that's what had to happen.  And the pressure he was getting was from the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] staff about the schedule for the Poor People's Campaign and that these two things were starting to, to conflict.  But we believed that Dr. King really, just really knew he had to come back to Memphis [Tennessee].  Well, all, all of that sort of plays into the, the effort to begin to monitor Dr. King's activities and actions and while he was being monitored, phones, blah, blah, blah--but the predictability of him coming back to Memphis was beginning to take, take shape.
Story_ID: 609073
Speaker 1: And finally, the discussion got so strong that someone had to go over to Atlanta [Georgia] to speak to the SCLC operation [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] about the need to come back to Memphis [Tennessee].  So one of our staff [of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] was a fellow by the name of Jesse Epps.  While, while Jim [James Lawson] made the call, you know, give us an opportunity to discuss this with you before you make a decision, because he thought the staff was gonna, gonna take the, take Dr. King out of Memphis.  And you know, you know, we'd, we'd be, we'd be okay, but it would be tough.  So Jesse went over and, and, and the end result was the decision was made to come back to Memphis.  And by then, enough of his schedule had been put out there that, you know, anybody could, could, could keep up with him.  So when he gave the spi- speech on the 3rd [I've Been to the Mountaintop], they were getting ready to go to dinner on the, evening on the 4th.  And the claim is that James Earl Ray shot him from the rooming house.  There are those who believe that.  There are others who don't believe that, and I'm in that crowd.
Speaker 2: Okay, what's your theory?
Speaker 1: Well, I think there are too many, too many odd facts.  I think there, there, I think there are FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] fingerprints on this thing in funny kinds of ways.  There was a lady [Grace Walden Stephens]--I'm dealing with after the shooting--there was a lady who claims to have came out of the rooming house and ran into James Earl Ray on the street coming out of the building.  She had a story to tell, but she never told it.  She got committed to a mental institution called Bolivar [Western State Psychiatric Hospital; Western Mental Health Institute, Bolivar, Tennessee], and she stayed there until she died.  The security for Dr. King, who had been with him every time he came to Memphis, was withdrawn from the assignment.  The fire station, which faced the Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee], sort of angled off to the left from Dr. King's room.  The security people who were there were withdrawn from the assignment.  And there are all kinds of stories about what took place at a little cafe [Jim's Grill, Memphis, Tennessee] on one of the side streets there.  The traffic lights on Main Street were all synchronized.  When the call went out that there had been a shooting, the folks who saw the car said it went one way.  The fact of the matter is it went the other way.  And I mean there are just too many things that argue that point.
Story_ID: 609074
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: I just think that there are just too many odd issues.  James Earl Ray, who initially confessed to the shooting [of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], then after a couple of days of finding out what he was confronted with, recanted his story but wasn't allowed to do that, nor was he given a trial.  You know, you--and people, at least many people thought that was kind of strange.  I mean even if he initially confessed and withdrew that confession and wanted a trial by jury, to deny him that is kind of strange.  So I mean I'm, I'm one of the nonbelievers.  I think there was something else going on.  But the, the whole series of, of events put incredible pressure on the city to find a solution to this, this, this strike thing [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike]. The mayor [Henry Loeb] was locked in his position.  He would never spend a nickel to settle the strike, and he kept that position.  I mean the--to, to settle the strike, which had not been about money--I mean it really had been about dignity and that kind of thing--you had to create now some issues that can be negotiated to a conclusion.  I mean you gotta put some money on the table, and there gotta be some system changes and all that kind of stuff.  So the community was so organized and so supportive that we had wound up in a position that the community will decide whether the settlement is sufficient.  So we had to develop a strategy around that, because the last thing we want to do is negotiate a deal and, and go out to the ratification meeting and it get rejected.  So, I mean, and where do we go from there?  So one of the real strong supporters who the community initially asked to serve on the negotiating committee--we were, we were gonna get a set of negotiations after that.  Johnson, President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], called down and said he want this thing ended.  He called the governor [Buford Ellington], (laughter) and he called the mayor.  The governor said he would do all he could to help.  The mayor told Johnson that "You run the country; I'll run Memphis [Tennessee]."  And Johnson threatened to take out every nickel that was going into the State of Tennessee, you know which got the governor's interest.  He sent down a fellow by the name of James Reynolds, who was with the [U.S.] Department of Labor.  And there was a fellow by the name of Frank Miles who had some mediation skills.  So between the two of them, I mean they had to put together an agenda to move this thing along, you know, hard negotiations, little street theater.  You know, they had to create the climate where you can settle.  And unknown to a lot of people, we found a, an industrialist, a guy by the name of Edward Plough [sic. Abe Plough] who was prepared to put up some money to help this process move.  And two or three members of the city council [Memphis City Council] were brave enough to--you know, said that they would serve on the negotiating committee.  One fellow, fellow by the name of Lou Donelson [Lewis Donelson], had been working all along to get enough city council votes to override the mayor, and he was always one vote short.
Story_ID: 609075
Speaker 1: So we've negotiated a settlement agreement, and the only thing that was left out of it was, was the money, because there had to be some, some, some money put on the table.  And the fir- this company Plough [Schering Plough Corporation] put up (cough) forget how much it was but put up enough to at least settle the thing [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They'd all cover the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --demands of the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(unclear).
Speaker 1: We negotiated a grievance procedure so that anybody who had a problem had a guaranteed right to grieve the matter.  Put together a promotion process, because those days all of the folks who carried the garbage were black, all of them who drove the truck were white.  There was no way to get from carrying garbage to truck driver.  So we negotiated a promotion process, and along with that a training process so that the work could be divided into different functions.  So how do you get from just being a, a strong back to a, sort of a crew chief to a--what are these--a, a sit out guy.  Before, workers had to go into the backyard, dump the garbage from the homeowner's can into one big can, and then take the big can around to the front and put it in a truck.  So we argued for a change in the system, you know, let the homeowners bring their can out to the curb, and let our guy, you know, you know, put the garbage in a larger can, depending upon where his truck was, and, and do it like that.   Because so these are not young men; these are old men at the time of the strike, and they weren't gonna get a lot younger carrying those heavy, you know, cans.  We then negotiated into it some, some sort of seniority principles that you were eligible to compete for a new job if you had X number of years on the job and, and things that they had never, never been given an opportunity to argue for.  The, the contract was--well, this, this other, this oth- one other dynamic, let me just put this in.  The fellow who had nominated to the negotiating committee by the community, we, we took the position that if he's a part of the nominating committee, and we go back to the community with this agreement that we have just negotiated, first of all, no union wants to give over to the community its right to approve a, a, a negotiated settlement.  I mean that would be just incredibly new for a union to take the rights of the workers and give them to the community, you know, because it's the workers who gotta work under this deal.  (Laughter) So, what we came up with was that this fellow would just explode one day and yell, and scream, and jump up and down, and withdraw from the committee, so that the, the, the dynamic is that he becomes the spokesperson for the community, and he's off the committee.  And therefore, when the, when the, when the final thing is put together, and he's in agreement with it, then he can settle the community.  And we can settle the workers, or the workers settle themselves, and we can get this thing put to bed as opposed to winding up in a mass citywide meeting and having some whacko in the corner yelling and screaming that they want more.  Well, you've lost control of the process then, and you're not gonna get three bites at this apple.  So that, that was the, some of the strategy we employed.  And it was the best strategy.  It wasn't like we were fooling anybody.  We just wanted to make sure that the political dynamics of settling this thing were in order.  And the workers got just about everything they wanted.  And, and we relied on them to tell us what you think you need.  And we just sort of put all these things together, and--the White House pressure, the skills of Jim Reynolds [James Reynolds], and, and Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was, was not to be fooled with.  (Laughter) I mean he was, he was serious when he wanted something done.
Story_ID: 609076
Speaker 1: You are credited with coming up with one of the strategic slogans of the late '60s [1960s] and stuff the, the "I Am a Man."  The, the garbage workers [of the Memphis Public Works Division] carried those signs, wore the placards, and it's, it has a historical--now I know you're credited with coming up with it, but I think you even agree it has a historical origin.  And tell, tell us about how you, how you did that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the, that--somewhere during the early days of the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], the mayor [Henry Loeb] had made some comment that, that, you know, about the workers and so and so forth.  And Jim Lawson [James Lawson] at a community meeting you know, one night says--and there's a video out there says that when the mayor or some person tells you what you're gonna do, and you must do it, that's not treating you like a man; that's treating you like a child, or something like that.  And the essence of racism is when you treat a man if he's not a ma- as if he's not a man.  And we didn't--I didn't think a whole lot of it, but we knew that we had to have something to glue this thing together.  So this white pastor I was telling you about, Malcolm Blackburn, he and I were tasked with trying to find a slogan that would do that.  So we spent one evening at the Rivermont Hotel [Memphis, Tennessee] playing with words to see as few a number of words that we could find that would have glue that everybody could relate to as to why they are doing what they're doing.  And finally we came up with four words.  And the reason we, we didn't want a lot of words because we, we couldn't pay to get a lot of signs printed (laughter), and the church had committed a print and a sign for us if we get it worked out.  So we came up with that, those four words, "I Am a Man."  And while it means different things I'm sure to different people, to this whole effort, it, it meant that I'm--I want--I'm standing up for my rights; I will speak out; I am speaking back to someone who I have historically held fear of; and I'm, I'm confronting the system.  And I'm, I'm not asking for a whole lot, just to be treated with respect and dignity.  And we didn't have any idea that this thing would hit like it hit.  And like you say, I mean the--everybody wanted a sign.  I mean that was their statement.  That was their challenge to the system to treat them right, to treat them with fairness.  And to this day, it has, it has hung on.  I mean I'd, I'd like to credit one of the strikers with coming up with it, I mean, you know, but after about two and a half, maybe three hours of fiddling around, that's what we came up with.  And we took it over to the, the A.M.E. church [Clayborn Temple A.M.E. Church, Memphis, Tennessee], and they, they printed the first batch of signs for it (laughter).  And it sent a statement to the broad community, you know.  And, and it was, it was their sort of fight back statement, you know, to all of the problems they've ever had for the all the years they'd ever lived there, worked there, or grew up in the South.  Then as someone was saying, and I think it's, there's a lot of truth, that in the South, you could go from boy to uncle to grandpa without ever passing the position of man.  And man, you know, but these guys I mean, (makes sound) that was it.  We didn't have to say nothing else.  I mean their commitment to this thing was locked in.
Story_ID: 609077
Speaker 1: Not a single striker--well, I take that back, there was one.  One striker worked during this whole confrontation [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  We didn't have to put up a picket line; we didn't have to do none of that 'cause they just weren't gonna go back to work until they got to them what they called fairness.  And we didn't put stuff in writing until the last week or week and a half because there was no way to define what it was you were talking about.
Speaker 2: Now when was that last week and a half in time frame?
Speaker 1: Well, it start--
Speaker 2: It started in, started in February.
Speaker 1: It started in February--
Speaker 2: Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in April, and then (unclear)--
Speaker 1: April, so it's about the last part of April, last week or so in April, first part of May.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because when Dr.--after the, after Dr. King was killed, there was about a lull of about a week I guess.
Speaker 2: Do you think that the, that the assassination of Dr. King I guess dramatized the seriousness of what was going on there, or, or did it distract from it, you think?
Speaker 1: I think both, both, to the sort of well to do slice of Memphis [Tennessee] who had not seen fit to get engaged anyway.  You know the workers, they, they're entitled to what they get.  Why should you do anything spec- ?  I mean that crowd had sat on the sidelines, you know, while we boycotted stores downtown, while we changed buying habits and buying patterns.  They went forward with a normal life as if nothing was going on in the city.  And there were those who stood up to talk to Loeb [Henry Loeb], the mayor, who really got dealt with harshly, and nobody raised a finger to help.  I mean there was a Jewish rabbi who got ran out of town [James Wax] because he stood up and spoke for, for strikers.  There were people who saw that example and decided that, that, that they didn't want to, they didn't want to cross that line.  They didn't want to risk their social standing to join this, this thing, and that's black and white.  I mean some folks had pretended nothing was going on.  And Dr. King's assassination--as a matter of fact, there was a, a Time magazine story just a few days after the assassination, where a local resident was quoted as saying that they were sorry that Dr. King got, got killed in Memphis.  You know with the important piece, being in Memphis.  And so people, you know, started taking stock that Memphis' image is tarnished as it is.  I mean where else does it go?  And there was a, there an auto dealer there--I'm trying to think of his name now---aside from this guy Plough [Abe Plough], Plough industries [Schering Plough Corporation], who decided no, we've, we've got to do something now.  We just gotta pull some people together and, and, and, and take this on.
Story_ID: 609078
Speaker 1: There was a member of the city council [Memphis City Council] whose name I can't recall right now, but who had been sort of an--he, he sympathized with the workers [of the Memphis Public Works Division] but not to the point where he was gonna do something.  We were walking together in the, in the first march, and first together and then a distance apart.  And when he saw what was going on, he just went through some sort of a mind change.  And his view was, no matter what this issue is, it require--it needs solving.  And you can't solve it by saying, you know, I won't talk to people who are violating some law.  And he managed to think through that if, if a worker have no alternatives, you practically force them to confront you.  Why can't we--why do we have to just live with that position?  Geez, I can't remember the guy's name now, but it was a major, major change for him.  And I think he was instrumental in talking to people who he had influenced, with him saying, look, we gotta come together and find a solution to this thing.  And the mayor [Henry Loeb] is way over there.  Let's leave him over there, and let's figure out how we settle thing.  And I wouldn't be a bit surprised, although I don't know it as a fact, that he rounded up some other influential people to talk about, you know, how do we do this?  You know, all this is very new to all of us, but we can't go on a, a year, two years, three years with, with this around our neck.  You know, Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] been assassinated.  Ultimately, Memphis [Tennessee] will always be remembered for that.  And (cough) the mayor never came to the negotiating sessions, never approved an expenditure to settle the strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].  You know, it all came from this guy Plough [Abe Plough].  And, and then afterwards, you know, any number of people talk about what we should have done, you know.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Plough's name?
Speaker 1: P-L-O-U-G-H.
Speaker 2: Okay, just like--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, and he never, never came to the surface.  I mean he never sought recognition for it or anything; just, it was his contribution to trying to get this thing settled.  Probably when you, when you think about people who made a contribution to--you know--this guy Jim Reynolds [James Reynolds] from the labor department [U.S. Department of Labor]--I think he was the undersecretary of labor--his skills with dealing with people--.  I mean once everybody took a position, principle was we, we can't--we gotta support the mayor.  Well, the mayor's position was crazy.  You know, and, and, and you know, as we would say to him: look, it, the City of Memphis may be a lot of things, but it's an employer, and therefore your responsibility is to settle issues with your employees, not pretend the issue don't exist.  And I think some folks started to say that after a while, and more certainly said it after the, after the assassination.  You know, there'd be social events in town, and while nobody would say it, you know, parts of the room would be supportive of the workers; the other part supportive of the mayor.  And these are people who are obviously had known each other for a long, long time, so they were being--their relationships were being tested.  Do you think those people are entitled to something?  We had to, we had the strike, I'm convinced, settled, you know, prior to the assassination.  We had sat down with the mayor's folks.  You know, they had put some language on the table; we had put some language on the table.  We sort of massaged it a little bit, and it was clear that for us we thought this was within striking distance of a settlement.  And apparently the newspaper got it from somewhere, and the next morning headline--there used to be two newspapers in Memphis.  There was the Press-Scimitar [Memphis Press-Scimitar] and The Commercial Appeal.  And the Press-Scimitar if you can visualize it being more conservative, (laughter) was the more conservative of the two, had this banner headline: "Mayor Capitulates."  And I mean we could've, we could've dropped dead when we saw that, because it did nothing to help, and it, it was designed to, to keep him from reaching a settlement.
Story_ID: 609079
Speaker 1: Let me move on past that to 1972.  Now in '72 [1972], you were secretary-treasurer of AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees], and you were the highest ranking African American in the labor movement.  Also, that year you became president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists.  Tell us about that coalition and tell about your, tell us about your position in AFSCME too.
Speaker 2: Oh, in, in '72 [1972], the then-secretary-treasurer, a fellow by the name of Joe Ames [Joseph Ames], just decided he didn't want to run again.  Now that's an elected position.  When we came out of Memphis [Tennessee] and, and finished all of that up, I was promoted as, to this position of assistant to the president.  And this was in '69 [1969], I guess, yeah, '69 [1969].  Shortly after that the, the then secretary-treasurer decided, you know, it was a little bit more running around than he wanted to do, and he was really thinking of doing something different.  And the opportunity to run for his position was, was on the table.  Both he and the president and I guess some others, you know, thought anybody could run, but you know, would you want to consider doing that?  And I, you know, like anybody else would, said well, I'll, I'll consider it, but you know, I don't--the running nationwide in the union for such a position was really, you know, calls, calls for some thinking.  And it was not likely that if I ran for it and didn't make it I'd be out of a job.  And they said, well, we'd, we'd like to help.  And this is a, was a major, you know, decision for a union such as ours, which at that time was maybe 20 percent black, you know, 5, 8 percent Hispanic.  So you were gonna run in an election that the overwhelming majority of votes cast are gonna be from white members.  And I'm not sure whether they had thought about it, but you know, the question for me is, do you have, you know, the, the skills and, and capacity to do what folks think need doing?  And I really wanted, wanted to test that out.  And the, the, the president [Jerry Wurf] was saying well, we'll, we'll do the downfield blocking.  I'm not sure that's what I want.  What I'd like to do is, you know, see whether or not what I have done, you know, meets the test, and if it does, you know, then I got a basis for running.  And I--on the theory that, you know, getting the votes does not mean (laughter) that you, that you, you got a, a job that, that you can do.  So I wanted awhile to go around the country and talk to some folks to see whether or not, not that the whole union was ready for it, but were some key people ready for that?  And it got pretty positive response.  And so I took the position that I would run, because the convention was six to eight months away (cough) and there was a lot of time to do a lot of stuff.  So I indicated that I, I would run.  And that didn't mean that nobody else would run.  It was just that I was prepared to do it.  Our convention was in the tail end of May or first part of June.  I forget which, and we were in Houston [Texas].  So in the convention, I got one of the most conservative guys I could think of to nominate me, and he did.  And you know, you, you wait to see whether there's gonna be another nomination.  Is there anybody else gonna run in this thing?  Well, after there's three calls, nobody else was nominated, and I figured that's the best way to run, with no opposition (laughter).  So it was, it was, it was very good of the, the fellow from Washington State to nominate me.  And nobody else, you know, wanted to do, and that was in 1972, as you say.  So it, it, it, it went through like that.  And I, you know, just was very lucky that people would help you learn the job, you know, because I certainly hadn't, hadn't done it before and didn't know.  But I, I'd certainly also knew I wasn't a bookkeeper, you know, so we had to have a staff with the capacity to handle all that, and that wasn't anything new.
Story_ID: 609080
Speaker 1: So we, we, we, we went off on that.  And that same year--I think it was the same year--the, the, the national contest between McGovern [George McGovern] and Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] ultimately took place between the two parties.  And the--you know, for a lot of us, we had spent the prior four years talking about Nixon's record, you know, the country as a whole, labor as a whole, and the African American community specifically, and he had been, he had been dreadful.  I mean his, his campaign went up and started in Philadelphia, Mississippi.  I mean he was instituting the, the southern strategy.  And when we got to the, the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] convention, or the, the endorsement meeting for presidential candidates, the AFL-CIO took the position of neutrality between McGovern and Nixon.  (Laughter) So, for some us--I mean, come on, man.  I mean in, in our community neutral means one ain't no better or worse than the other.  So how could we, as, as, as representatives of workers in general, and, and, and workers of color in particular--I mean we can't go back, at least I can't go back home and talk about there ain't no difference.  (Laughter) So, so we took issue with the AFL-CIO, not that it was not their right to be neutral, but what it demonstrated is that, in the rooms where decisions are made, we ain't in the room, and not that if we had been in the room our position would have carried, but at least somebody would have heard it.  And so part of our thinking was there's a real need to talk about the makeup of the room, and who's in it when decisions like this are made, and who's outside of it.  And we didn't have any, any power with the AFL-CIO, although we did have the power to be for whoever we wanted to be for, even if it was violating the rules.  So, four or five of us came together, and without arguing for McGovern, what we argued for is a process so that our, our concerns don't get ignored.  And we talked to a lot of folks, and without condemning organized labor, we just talked about there's something wrong with the system, and we need to get together and talk about that.  So, we didn't have no list, didn't have no fax machine, certainly wasn't no emails in those days (laughter).  So we just said we ought to come together; we ought to come together in Chicago [Illinois] and talk about this.  So about thirteen, fourteen hundred black labor types, I assume they agreed with us because they showed up.  And a lot of people thought it was an endorsement meeting for McGovern.  It was not that.  It was a meeting to discuss what do we do when this kind of a decision is made?  And that, that's when the decision was made as to whether or not we ought to talk about people forming such an organization that will not be a labor union because we don't have the right to represent, in negotiation, anybody.  What we got to do it a right to argue a point of view.  So the Chicago meeting says, yes, we think we need such an instrument.  First, let's go out beyond this meeting and see what other people think.  So we took a year to go around the country, talk to labor leaders, talk to community leaders, and report back at a subsequent meeting a year later here in Washington, D.C.  Well, the decision was: yeah, we need an organization [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists]; B, we ought to create it, submit a structure for it, a constitution for it, and go into business, and that's what we did.  That was 1973 I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The initial group here now--correct me if I'm wrong here was you, Nelson Edwards [Nelson "Jack" Edwards], William Simmons--
Speaker 1: Bill Simons [William Simons], right.
Speaker 2: --Simons, rather, [HistoryMaker] Charles Hayes, and--
Speaker 1: Cleveland Robinson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cleveland Robinson.  And then later on it seemed like it's all, all women to get together pretty--you know, it's a, it's a whole lot of women--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --including Addie Wyatt [HistoryMaker Reverend Addie Wyatt] and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Alzada Clark and--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we wanted to make sure we didn't become guilty of the same thing we're accusing other folks of.  And there were more activist focused women who were interested in what we were doing than, than there were leadership among men.
Story_ID: 609081
Speaker 1: All right, we're talking about the women involved, and there's a lot of them, so many, Alzada Clark, Addie Wyatt, Ola Kennedy, Agnes Willis, Lillian Roberts, [HistoryMaker] Geraldine Johnson, and--yeah, so, so they, the wis- the women's committee chair was [HistoryMaker] Reverend Addie Wyatt.
Speaker 2: Addie Wyatt, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, and just to put this in an historical perspective, during the same time period, black professionals are organizing everything, from the black police officers [National Black Police Association] to the black social workers [National Association of Black Social Workers], black psychologists [Association of Black Psychologists], you know, the African Heritage Studies Association, organizers out of the African Studies Association, all these different groups are spread off to black nurses organizing [National Black Nurses Association], and everybody's organizing to--
Speaker 2: I, I think when, when we sort of really objected to the federation's [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] process, and we did not die, (laughter) I mean folks said well, wait a second.  I mean if, if, if they can say this and survive, I mean we can go a bit further.  Because as you mentioned, the social workers and blah, blah, blah, these are--
Speaker 1: Schoolteachers [National Alliance of Black School Educators], yeah--
Speaker 2: --these are like groups, I mean, who, who, who don't have this differences of function like we did in the CBTU [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists].  I mean, black social workers got a clearly defined set of issues and set of problems, probation officers, nurses, I mean all kinds of groups who have a common, you know, function.  People just said, hey, I mean, we can organize and, and, and put our issues forward, which was good for us, because in, in, in the, in the case of, of CBTU and the five or six folks you mentioned there, I mean their careers was put on the line, I mean flat out.  One fellow was told--matter of fact, he wrote me a letter: "How dare you invite my person to a meeting such as this?"  (Laughter) I mean so, and, and, and Bill Simon [William Simons] tells that story to this day.  I mean his president said, you're not going to no, no meeting with these folks, talking, talking about their right to speak up.  And Bill told him that he was grown (laughter).  He wasn't no child.  And Cleveland Robinson was an old warrior from, you know, what we called District 65 [Distributive Workers of America], which was a left focus group in the retail/wholesale industries.  Nelson "Jack" Edwards was a sitting board member of the United Auto Workers [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America].  Horace Sheffield [Horace Sheffield, Jr.] was a person who everybody thought should have had the seat that Jack Edwards was sitting at.  And Charlie Hayes [HistoryMaker Charles Hayes] was a member of the Packinghouse Workers [United Packinghouse Workers of America], so he came with the Chicago [Illinois] experience.  And you know, when we all said we gotta talk about this, this was--these were the folks who stepped forward and said this.  And in effect, people put their careers in each other's hands.  And that was a serious, you know, decision that, that was made.  And we became a, a group of folks who'd never had an argument.  And why we never agreed, because these were some strong minded and strong willed folks.  And, and we just sort of talked about issues until we found some, some approach.  But people resented our very existence.  I'm talking about as individuals.  And in, in a lot of years, folks talked about how they were treated by the leadership of their union.
Story_ID: 609082
Speaker 1: This is once again, these are black union agitators forming a group [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists] to agitate the very unions that they're--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They're a part of.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And organizing groups are always jealous of, of their members getting involved in anything other than what their group is, so.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean but, but even with that, it was you can't, you, you must not complain (laughter) I mean which is the ultimate irony.  I mean we gonna do this to you, but don't irritate us by complaining about it.  And, and we were saying, well, wait a minute.  You gonna ask us to go into our communities and to our union and preach a neutrality line between McGovern [George McGovern] and Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon]?  You know, and, and that became a defining difference between us and some other organizations that existed, one of which was, was presided over by Mr. Randolph [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters].  And he certainly was a, a ground breaker in terms of minority presence in organized labor.  But at ground level, his folks could not complain about what, what happened to them.  And Mr. Meany at that time certainly did not like Mr. Randolph [A. Philip Randolph].
Speaker 1: That's George Meany, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we were looked upon like, you know, you're defying the house and making life uncomfortable for a lot of us.  And, and we didn't fully understand it then. And, and I guess, you know, if, if people, like Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] says, a lot of stuff is acceptable until you decide you don't want to accept it.  And I'm talking about we, we lost a lot of friends.  People said, well you, why you making it hard on us?  Well, I mean if, if you don't want to object to something bad happening to you, and then you get mad at me because I object (laughter), there's something wrong with this picture (laughter).  And oddly enough, we collectively got along well with Mr. Meany.  It was the palace guard who was the problem.
Speaker 1: The other black people that did not want--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean and, and, and, and, and, and white staffers too in high positions that are--it's like, you know, you got upstarts and whatever.  We kept saying, all our argument is, is that this McGovern/Nixon is one example of how decisions are made that affect our interests, and we don't have any opportunity to discuss it.  And, and you know, you, you tell us how to do that.  And, and nobody was willing to step up, so we said we want to be able to speak for ourselves.  And if we speak publicly about some of these, these twisted policies, sooner or later you're gonna get the notion that maybe it's better to have us in the room as opposed to outside talking about these things.  And it took a long time to change that.  This was '73 [1973].  In 1995 was when they opened up, you know, the, the room.  And I think that the system's been better ever since.  On the women's thing, there were so many active women back then who had skills and talent and, and stuff to share, but they never had anywhere to do it.  So by starting this thing and giving them a, a real strong role in it, they were able to not only demonstrate their capacity, but, but also mobilize more women, both to come into labor and to achieve the higher role in labor.  In, in those days, you did not have a single--I don't want to be so absolute, but you didn't have hardly any black vice presidents of national unions.  They had one here, one there.  You didn't have any high level black administrative staff, women here and there because it's easier to promote a black woman than it is a black man.  You had some of--so this started a whole movement out there.  Now, and folks consider to be positive the--you have a mixture of everything on the governing bodies of unions.  And folks now realize that, that African Americans will join a union five times quicker than white males, because it's, it's not just the money.  It's the value of the union in terms of dealing with the social justice questions, and it's like an insurance policy.
Story_ID: 609083
Speaker 1: Let me jump to 1974, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists called for an economic boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa.  And then in '84 [1984], ten years later, you founded the Free South Africa Movement.  You wanna talk about that?  Now this is, that was--a white union newsletter editor told me this in the '90s [1990s].  He said you know, the, the Free South Africa Movement was really achieved by the unions worldwide.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in '74 [1974], what they had in, in operation was something they used, they called the Sullivan principles.  Dr. Leon Sullivan had reached all these deals that allowed corporations to participate in South Africa.  And their cover was we follow local laws or local guidelines, which meant that, that anything is acceptable to you as long as it doesn't interfere with your ability to make a profit, you know, so (laughter).  We, we, I mean we looked this as just fundamentally wrong.  You, you, you, you, you take jobs out of the U.S.  You take them to South Africa.  South African blacks was at the--if there's a low end of the totem pole, they was below that.  The basic social practices of South Africa, and particularly under apartheid, was just atrocious, I mean, and you know, the, the passed laws, the--all of that kind of stuff we just thought made no sense at all and that there should be a movement to demonstrate our opposition to that.  The boycott issue was really the only way you could put any heat into people, and that is to cause somebody a loss of money.  If you ask me, did we have any knowledge of what the outcome was gonna be, we, we didn't.  We just knew we had to do something.  So the boycott of goods, et cetera was, could be made effective because everything's gotta come in either by plane or by boat.  And within our ranks was the international longshoremen's union [International Longshore and Warehouse Union] and the longshoremen's association [International Longshoremen's Association]; one is the West Coast, the other is East Coast.  And they on their own decided that one way they could help was refuse to unload ships from South Africa, and on occasion that's what they did.  So the, the, the, the economic boycott issues took a life of its own.  We then began to think about pension funds.  Most of the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] if not all relatively speaking had massive pension funds that were invested in different places.  We started to talk about if any pension funds are invested in corporations doing business in South Africa, that irres- irrespective of the Sullivan principles, they ought to have a conscious and a social conscious enough to talk about, you know, withdrawing.  And if they would not withdraw, then we will withdraw our pension funds, which was sort of a, a big time threat to some corporations who operated on a small margin.  We then put together called--something called the Council of Institutional Investors, which brought in public sector pension funds.  And our argument there was that, you know, as public employees, we don't want our pension funds used in ways that we object to, which, you know, takes away from the pure profit for the fund motivation.  And this whole thing set off a chain of activities.  People started thinking about what is responsible investment?  You know, what corporations should be approved, should not approve--be approved?  And people began to think about this, you know.  And a mil- there's about $6 trillion in public employee pension funds out there somewhere.  When you start thinking about moving that or pension boards, which are much more (unclear) to the workers, that they start having concerns other than making a profit.  So that went on for a good while.
Story_ID: 609084
Speaker 1: In '84 [1984], when, I guess in November or December sometime I don't know--they had--when the Free South Africa Movement was started, it came as a result of Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] view that it was okay to do business with South Africa around something they called constructive engagement, meaning you don't necessarily have to lock--like them, but you know, keep making money with them.  And so we're saying (laughter), what, what kind of thing is this?  So the, a group here or TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica]--I mean you've probably heard of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's [HistoryMaker] Randall Robinson.
Speaker 1: Randall Robinson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A, a decision was made to ask for a meeting with the South African ambassador [Bernardus Gerhardus Fourie].  And at the close of meeting, people would refuse to leave the embassy unless he advocated one person, one vote.  And all these things were, I mean this, these, all of these wheels were turning.  And when that demonstration at the embassy took place, the, South African ambassador thought people were crazy, so he called the police.  So you're in the District of Columbia with an African American mayor, an African American member of [U.S.] Congress (unclear) vote, and you got this all prestigious people being hauled off to jail by the South Af- at that, at the behest of the South African embassy (laughter).  I mean it was, it was, it was pure street theater (laughter) I mean, it was just so--.  And, and people totally lost track of what it looked like.  So I think Eleanor Holmes Norton, Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], [HistoryMaker] Roger Wilkins, Randall, and maybe one or two other people, you know, were herded off to jail.  And of course, the mayor was [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, you know.  So as a public deal, I mean he had committed the worst crime.  He, the South African ambassador, had no idea what he had triggered.  The following day, or a couple days later, I was off to Japan for a, a, a global meeting of public sector countries, I mean (laughter).  And so I described to them the inhumane treatment that folks had received at the hands of the South African embassy.  So this meeting voted to condemn South Africa (laughter)--this is a meeting, took place in Tokyo [Japan]--and a, and announced it globally.  And, and this chain reaction took place inside of a week.  I mean country after country after country was condemning South Africa.  So Great Britain, you know, took the position that, that, that the South--that--what--I forget what, what they called it, the, their territories, but they were barring travel to some of their places from South African diplomats.  It was a--it, it just went--it exploded.  And we tried to work through a, a lot of different entities, but I think Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums]--either Ron or, or, or former congressman from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], who was chair of the budget--
Speaker 2: William Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III]?
Speaker 1: Bill Gray, Bill Gray.  So we started, you know, political and legislative stuff to deal with the South African embassy.
Story_ID: 609085
Speaker 1: Ultimately, they had to come forward with a piece of legislation that went before the president, who signed it.  And we set out to override--wait a minute, let me get it straight.  Oh, oh, no, Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] vetoed the legislation that came down, so the job was to override his veto, which is, you know, I mean that's a major undertaking.  So to, to support that action, we decided to, to, to jack the city up every day.  So we were gonna have people get arrested at the South African embassy every day for a year.  And the idea was to clog up the courts with people who would violate one law for the better good of a, of a broader law.  And nobody thought this was gonna happen.  And every single day, you know, we'd have fifty or a hundred people get arrested at the embassy, sometimes more.  And the idea was to demand a, a jury trial on the issues.  And the politics of it became such that going to jail became the social event of the season (laughter), you know, I mean.  And we, we set up a, a, a, a going to jail commission, and their job was to decide who could go to jail on a given day, and who they would go with.  You know, so people started calling making reservations (laughter), and part of their question would be, who am I going with?  You know, maybe the last thing a, you know, a big time movie star wants to do is go to jail with Ike Brown.   You know, I mean they, they want to be with with somebody (laughter).  So all of this pressure was mounting, and the South Africans back home were doing what we assumed they would do.  They were killing people left and right.  And, and ultimately, the administration put together a commission to deal with the issues around South Africa, and a lot of handpicked people and one labor guy.  The guy from labor was a guy by the name of Owen Bie- Owen Bieber, who was the president of the United Auto Workers [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America].  And Owen did a minority report to the presidential report, which was a brave thing to do.  But anyhow, all this pressure was building.  They were losing at every turn.  Our folks were occupying all kinds of places, the Krugerrand became, you know, sort of the focal point of our efforts.  And some of our folks went down on one evening and refused to leave the, the store that sold Krugerrands.  They were gonna stay in all night and forever, and the last thing they were gonna have is a bunch of folks roaming around their store.  (Laughter) So they, they decided they would no longer sell the South African Krugerrand.  And I mean we were just harassing them.  I mean we, we, we--Shell Oil [Shell Oil Company] had an office unlabeled downtown [Washington, D.C.].  Nobody knew they were there except us, and so we sort of swung in through the doors at quitting time, got inside, occupied the place, and told them we were staying all night.  We had portable johns, and they just went bananas.  (Laughter) So, so they sent out the only black employee they got in the place for him to talk to us and explain what their position was.  So this guy, with about six or seven of us in, in the, in the offices of, of, of Shell Oil--that he's been informed to tell us that Shell Oil has an excellent affirmative action plan.  (Laughter) So (unclear)--I mean he was serious.  He said, "We have been hiring blacks for years."  Oh, please (laughter).  I mean so, so we shipped it from Shell to Royal Dutch Shell [Royal Dutch Shell Group].  And all these things were connected.  It was, it was, I have to confess, it was strictly street theater, but it was having its impact.
Story_ID: 609086
Speaker 1: And unknown to us at that time, you know, the South African government says--had decided it's time to get Mandela [Nelson Mandela] out of jail.  I mean we had gotta get rid of this thing.
Speaker 2: So, so this agitation, this all takes place between '84 [1984] and ninety--ninety (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, '84 [1984], and he came out in--
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991]--
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991], '92 [1992], something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No, no, before that. He came out in eight- the late, latter part of '89 [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because he had a tour here in '90 [1990].  Yeah, but I mean all of these things are taking place at the same time, people inside the country, people outside the--
Speaker 2: This is, we're talking about six, about five, six years of agitation--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --intense agitation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And ultimately, I mean it, it had an impact.  The IMF [International Monetary Fund] refused to roll over the South African loans that they had, and this must have been about '87 [1987], '88 [1988], I mean, and that triggered, I mean, the instant slide in the, in the rand.  It, it went from one hundred to thirty-five or thirty-eight, or somewhere in there, and people were beginning to talk about apartheid is just too expensive to continue, you know, maintaining.  And, but it was strictly almost a grassroots thing.  Coupled with that, was the young people in South Africa who were ready--they were boycotting the schools, refusing to take Afrikaans as a subject matter, and just really just generally destabilizing the country.  And the good thing about that approach is that they did not destroy the infrastructure in the country.  The railroads worked; the water system worked; the electricity worked.  You know, it was almost a political, you know, you know, takeover.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is tremendous.  And I think that very few people actually understand the story of how this happened.  And the, the sad thing is that many people think that Nelson Mandela was freed during to--due to the largesse of the South African regime.
Speaker 1: (Makes sound) Not hardly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not hardly, but they were afraid of two things.  They were afraid that he would die in jail.  That's, that was a major, major issue.  And they could not predict what was gonna happen to the economy with the, the turmoil continuing.  And as I said when the IMF--I think it was the IMF--or one of them refused to roll over the major loans that were out to the South African government, that's when a lot of people in South Africa started saying, oh, wait a minute.  I mean this is, you know, this is--I mean apartheid is becoming an inconvenience now as--it got nothing to do with whether we're better than.  As a matter of fact, one of the pictures over there I was showing was a, a picture with P.W. Botha.  We had this session in South Africa with a lot of prominent African Americans, said look, you know, I mean, nobody's gonna eat you.  I mean Mandela and Bishop Tutu [Desmond Tutu], folks are talking about reconciliation.  I mean that ought to be, you know, the, the focal point of the South African government, 'cause you can't win a war.  So therefore, what's the way out of this thing?  And they, they put together a lot of commissions, and at the same time, the, the South African labor movement was putting incredible pressure on the economy of South Africa.  And the mines and all those places were very, very sensitive places.  I mean folks were having strikes.  They were having confrontations of all kind, not violently instigated.  In some way in that cycle, they put together something called Umkhonto we Sizwe, which was sort of the military arm of the ANC [African National Congress], which raised the whole 'nother series of issues for the South Africa government to deal with.
Speaker 2: Yes, Spear of the Nation I think.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 609087
Speaker 1: During all this, did you get a chance to meet Nelson Mandela?  I'm, I'm sure you did, but I'm just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  What was that like?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: I mean just, I mean just beyond belief.  I mean it's, it's hard to visualize someone with the aura that he had.  I mean it was just, I, I mean it was, you're just overwhelmed just by his presence.  And while we had been in sort of meetings before since his release in the first unban- the unbanning of the ANC [African National Congress], Cleveland Robinson, the fellow we spoke of before, we had met with him in Durban [South Africa] as he prepared to, you know, put the ANC back in business.  But you know, I mean you were just in awe, and it was like--I'm sure there had to be a, a string of bitterness somewhere, but you just could not detect it.  I mean he was just so positive about the kind of country that they wanted to try and build.  They had put together something called the Freedom Budget.  And what they were talking about is how you begin to employ people and the kinds of things you need to do to make life better, you know, rural electrification, roads, housing, et cetera.  And you, you listen to him.  It's clear, here's a guy been in jail twenty-six or twenty-seven years and, and don't have a bone to pick.  He's thinking about how to move the country forward.  And you know, we--it'll be an understatement to say you was impressed.  I mean he was just, just such an aura.  He came here for a couple of reasons, one of which, we had done such an effective job of the boycott that people had moved their money from South Africa to other places around the globe, and he wanted to talk to them about coming back to South Africa.  Because while he had won in the election, he didn't--there was no money to do the kinds of things that they wanted to do.  So he visited New York [New York], Atlanta [Georgia], D.C. [Washington, D.C.], Florida, Detroit [Michigan], and Oakland [California].  And, and that, that was a, there's a, there's a, a story of that trip that would, would blow folks' mind (laughter).  I mean it's great to have this, this, this world known figure, but it's a real challenge, you know, to, to try and deal with the dynamics of that, you know, because there were people outside the country, you know, involved in the struggle and people inside the country involved in the struggle.  The two of them [Mandela and F.W. de Klerk] did not necessarily like each other.  You've now got your Mr. Mandela, who is free, who's got his own set of people, and, and it was a real challenge.  I mean he we hosted the, the trip you know with TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] with all its affiliates, and it, it was a challenge from the moment they landed until they took off--that (unclear) (laughter)--
Story_ID: 609088
Speaker 1: Also in the early '90s [1990s], in '94 [1994] you became president of the Public Services International, the world's largest union federation, overseeing 10 million members from over a hundred nations.  That's, it just sounds like it's too much (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, Public Service International, or as we call it PSI, was the aftermath in the public sector of World War II [WWII].  It was sort of an effort to create a, a, a global dependency between workers' organizations that would impede or slow down or prevent war between countries over rinky dink stuff.  We believe--I believe anyhow--that, that public services, you know, the ability of people to receive quality public services is an extension of democracy.  And if countries have workforces responsible for services to the people, then those workers have access to and the right to bargain collectively out of everybody's mutual interest.  You know, you're, you're improving the quality of life for folks and creating mechanisms that prevent war from breaking out, because everybody becomes dependent on each other.  And, and that's maybe the long way around, but if people's quality of life is being met by their governments or their, their countries, no matter what party you're talking about, if their needs are being met, there's less reason for them to go to war with each other.  And there's a flip side to that in the private sector.  So our effort was to help build public sector unions, with a focus on quality of service, democracy internally, efficient service, and all, all of that, with workers having a voice.  And the, you know, these--my--I think I served for six years or something like that, and the, the same ideas that we had in Contra Costa County, California was introduced into this sort of global thing, and to a degree, you know, succeed, and continues to succeed.  You know, there are countries who have real, real troubles, underdeveloped, exploited.  We have a seat in what is called the ILO [International Labour Organization], and so PSI spoke for public sector workers.  We have a seat, had a seat, on a thing called the ICFTU, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, where we sort of extol the ideas of that--if the elected officials, whoever they are, gave space for workers through their organization to make a case for quality services, efficient services, you know, oppose corruption, all of those kinds of things, then you know, life is better for people across the globe.  And that, to a degree, is, is true.
Story_ID: 609089
Speaker 1: So the lady who had--how I got to be president--lady who was the president [Monika Wulf Mathies] doubled as the president of a major, major German union in the public sector [Offentliche Dienste, Transport und Verkehr].  And through PSI [Public Services International], we argued for the integration of East and West Germany, along the same lines we're talking about here.  I mean you had West German workers up here (gesture), East German workers down here (gesture), and if you're gonna bring these together, it's gotta be harmonized.  Now it was a great idea when we were talking about it.  We didn't realize what the ultimate impact would be of bringing all of these workers up to here, but it was done.  It was done peacefully, without warfare.  And when, you know, Europe went to the common market thing, the East German experience, you know, laid the foundation for an argument that you don't harmonize downward.  You know, you, (laughter) you try, try and bring people up to a, a, a, a reasonable standard of living.  Then we--it worked good for a while, and it started to show, show cracks, you know, Greece, Spain, and some other places where, you know, the, the economies did not respond rightly to the new thing, and now they're paying a price for it.  Well, what's happening is it will scare you to death.  They're taking it out of the hides of workers.  You know, and, and, and, and our, our fight back is, you know let's, let's, let's bite the bullet; let's, let's do what needs to be done, but let's--you can't cut your way out of this situation, which is the same argument we're talking about here, you know, before Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] took office, and maybe even some since then, you just cannot cut these states into good health.  You know, Wisconsin being a prime example and, and others.  So PSI's role is to try and, and, and work with all of these countries, Af- all over the continent, you know.  We got African countries who workers haven't been paid in two years, and yet the country is rich in natural resources.  So, anyhow, she went to the EU.  She left the presidency at PSI, and on behalf of her country went to the European Union, and that created this vacancy.  And I had been first vice president up until then.  And so I sort of stepped into that opportunity, and like I said, served for six years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 609090
Speaker 1: Now, in 1995 you actually became a member of the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Council of Industrial Organizations].  So this is something that you all were agitating for--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --ten years before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what was that like finally?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was, it was eye opening.  And you know, our constant arguing and presenting the issues to the leadership of the federal along with argument, if you want to organize workers, they want to see somebody who looked like them, you know, and to a degree, think like them, and have experienced many of the things that, that they are confronting.  And study after study has shown that African Americans and workers of color join the union five times quicker than un- no college et cetera white male workers.  Women join quicker.  And I'm not sure what the phenomenon is on white male workers.  They all agree that life is better; you get more money; you get more benefits, blah, blah, blah, but they just don't, don't instantly join.  The growth inside of organized labor is taking place among workers of color, women, young, young workers, and immigrants.  And our argument was why spend a truckload of money organizing somebody who don't want to be organized?  I mean organize those who are beating on the door to say let me in.  So in '95 [1995], for the very first time, at least in my memory, a contest took place for the leadership of the AFL-CIO.  I'm trying to think who was the--Lane Kirkland was the president and who had stepped down, or stepped down during this debate.  And Tom Donahue [Thomas R. Donahue], who had formerly been the secretary-treasurer became the president.  So we, we being the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, went to both of them and said, look, it doesn't matter which one of you want--win.  You're gonna have to confront these kinds of issues in order for organized labor to be relevant to the concerns of workers of color.  I mean they gotta see something.  I mean, what are you doing to say that la- labor opens its arms to immigrant workers, young workers, blacks, women, you know, all of that?  We want you to think about that.  You also want to think about who you invest membership money with, you know.  Are any African Americans' or Hispanics' banks, loan companies into that arena?  Where do we put our pension funds?  I mean, how do we share in all of that?  And there was about twelve items that we put before both of these candidates, and you know, A, can you do this?  Can you do that?  Will you do this?  Blah, blah, blah.  And the two candidates had different answers.  You know, one said, well, you know, tradition won't let us do this.  We'd have a problem with this.  This will be tough.  That was said by one of the candidates.  The other one says I can do this, and I will do this.  I will do this.  If we work on it together, we can get this done; much more positive.  And so the fellow who wound up winning the race was John Sweeney.  And to his credit, the first thing he did was expanded the Executive Council.  And I think there were twelve of us that went on in '95 [1995].  Some didn't last a long time, but at least they went on.
Story_ID: 609091
Speaker 1: And to his credit, probably 90 percent of what he [John Sweeney] committed to doing, he did.  And I think it, it brought a new dynamic to the council [Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] because we still gotta be twice as good, if not three times.  And we discovered that there were people who sat there, who, if you picked up a hammer, the earth would come to a halt (laughter), no longer spin, because you have created a cardinal sin.  You have--you are not a carpenter, therefore you can't pick up this saw, you know (laughter).  So, so we sort of made light of this.  I mean, because in the auto industry and all of these industries where there's, you know, African Americans are concentrated, I mean attention has gotta be given to that in policy, you know, and policy by the unions, policy by the government.  And so we brought those arguments to the table.  And you know, the apprenticeship programs are good programs.  They, they, they obviously made better workers, but they also protect the industries and protect the jobs from folks who ain't born into them.  And we talked about the need to really take a look at training programs.  And for the first time in a long time they had people of color talking about trade and trade policies, and what is it?  You know, I mean, you know, Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], you know, even though it sells cheaper goods, it kills us.  And you know, some folks are comfortable with that, but people got to speak out and speak up against it.  And I don't think they had thought about a lot of these kinds of policies.  For the building trades, and I'm--this is not a knock--but as long as they're building stuff, you know, bridges, roads, houses, shopping centers, they're okay.  But how about the overwhelming majority of workers who are not in that building trades but in the retail service sector, medical?  That's why economic policy gotta reflect some of those concerns also.  And we brought people into that meeting that was well versed on a broad sector of things.  Some people were chair of key committees.  Right now I chair the international affairs committee, which is, gotta be heartburn for a lot, a lot of people (laughter).  And we, we talk about, you know, relationships between other nations, other countries, and what our position ought to be on stuff.
Story_ID: 609092
Speaker 1: Now, in 2003, you, you led demonstrations against the Iraq War.  And can you just tell us why you were against the Iraq War?
Speaker 2: Well, well, first of all, you know, (pause) Iraq was our buddy, you know what I mean (laughter).  You know, Hussein [Saddam Hussein] was our ally when we were fighting the Iranians, and you know, he could do no wrong.  And then the workers who worked for the Iranian government, if, if, if he did bad by them, and we his friend, we ignore their plight.  And, and our view was, 'cause you fall out with, with Hussein, you know, what's your position on, on the workers?  You know, why should they suffer because you and your friend fell out?  And is that the kind of friend we want?  I mean you complain about the guy who, who put you know chemical stuff against his friend.  Well, who sold him the chemicals?  You know, I mean, so, I mean there are a lot of these contradictions that we thought just needed to be put on the table that workers ought to have a right--no matter how dreadful their government is, they ought to have a right to, to speak up to them, and they take their chances.  But if you're gonna protect your enemy from workers because you and your enemy agree on a couple of things, but you, you both agree on beat up on the workers, that, that we ought to have something to say about that (laughter).  And so we made this argument with AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations], because the AFL-CIO, in some cases, raised the question: is that our business?  So our business is to protect and promote the interests of workers.  And this was the first time a sitting president [President George Walker Bush] had been confronted on a foreign affairs issue, or a foreign policy issue.  We, we took the position that the, the Iraq government was not good, but he was our friend.  When we took over from the Iraq government, we ran the place, and we were no better than they were.  So, how did, how did the workers who, if they had a decent living, would not be for these policies that, you know, provoked war with Kuwait and stuff like that?  They just want to make a living and raise their families.  What's, what's wrong with that?  So we argued that, okay, we done took over.  Let's change the law so workers got a right to form a union and bargain collectively, and earn better wages, and have more job security.  Well, wasn't nobody for that, except us and the (laughter), and the Iraqi workers.  I mean they didn't care any more about us than they did Hussein.  But you know, they're in bad shape.  So that's why we started that.  And it turned I think we were right, that if workers are allowed to work and have a sense of democracy in the workplace, you'd be surprised the kinds of things that happen.  They themselves will take on dictatorships.  They themselves will confront bad foreign policy.  And you know, it, it was not a surprise that, that Hussein invaded Kuwait.  He said he was gonna do it, and told our ambassador [April Glaspie] he was gonna do it, and asked to be told what's our position.  And folks, as I understand it, said we don't have a position.  (Laughter) Well, I mean there's something wrong with that.  What you come down to is that war is business, and who--and if you do a little research, you'll find out that some businesses through Iraq, Iran, et cetera, worked every day.  I mean Halliburton [Halliburton Company] was a, was okay with all of that.  And who ran Halliburton?  Cheney.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I mean there, there's a--
Speaker 1: Dick Cheney, the vice president.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But anyhow, that, that was why that came about and how it came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 609093
Speaker 1: Now 2004, you were ready to retire from AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees].  You announced your retirement at the 2004 international convention.  But the conventioneers refused to accept your resignation.  Now what was that like, and what--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --this is--it sounds like conscripted labor, I mean.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there was interesting thing taking place inside the leadership of, of the, of the union.  And I mean, membership, first, second, third level had always been very, very kind to me in terms of political support, in terms of accepting (unclear)--blah, blah, blah, blah.  So I just really felt like that I had a, a, a right to disagree when I thought something was going on that was not in their best interest.  And I had no desire to injure the union, so my--I could have retired in 2000.  And I said, well, maybe now the time has come, since me and only a few others feel this way.  Maybe nature will take its course.  And there was an issue that was supported by the other half of the leadership that I was just in disagreement with, and decided that 2004 at the convention was the time to step aside.  And there had not been a lot of discussion about this because the, the policy, you know, was put into a form that the average person would not understand.  I mean the national organization wants to do this.  They've created a justification for it, so we'll just vote for it.  Well, in my opinion that was not right.  So I, I, I declined the nomination, and the place went crazy.  And we decided to take some time to think about it.  And between the nomination process and the next morning, we sort of found some accommodation.  We changed the constitution a little bit and changed some of the policy formulation processes so that people had a chance to understand clearer what was taking place before they had to vote on it.  And on that basis, I said okay, I will, I will run again, and we'll see how this works.  So between 2004 and 2008, I didn't see the level of change that I felt ought to have been there.  So some of my colleagues, we had a further discussion, said okay, we'll, we'll try this a little bit longer, and by 2010 I was convinced that it wasn't gonna happen.  And the, the opposite side had enough political strength to make sure it didn't happen.  And so I just decided to step down in 2010 at the convention and give the convention the opportunity of selecting a successor because I didn't want the opposition side to appoint a successor.  And you know, I, I think I was right.  Although the outcome, you know, was a little bit different, I think I was right in making the case.
Speaker 1: Did--was someone selected by the body that--
Speaker 2: I--the, the, the, the election was incredibly flawed, you know, and which was a result of the opposition's political strength.  And the convention, we cast about a million two hundred thousand votes in the convention, and my side lost by four thousand votes.  And we, we know that, you know, it was, it was seriously flawed.  And a, a rerun--no, not a, not a rerun but the election that is taking place this year is for the top position in the union.  And I, I think people learned an incredible lesson two years ago, and I think they'll do something differently this time.
Story_ID: 609094
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about the recent attack on public service employees in Wisconsin, in Ohio, and other places.  And you know, we're, we're about a, a month away from a recall election of the governor of Wisconsin because he tried to destroy the public service union in Wisconsin.  What, what, what are your thoughts about this?  Have, have we--I mean we've gotten to a--it's almost like it's open battle.  It's open battle now between labor and--
Speaker 2: Well, the, the--well, it's, it's, it's, it's an effort to destroy trade unions across the spectrum.  We, we're just easier to get in the public sector.  It relates more to the Republican Party's effort to just destroy the coalition [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists].  It has aided Democratic victories forever.  And they're starting where they have the political tra- control to, to implement Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania.  There are thirty-two, thirty-three states that have some form of anti-union legislation on the books, where the governor or the ruling coalition can just simply do away with it.  Walker [Scott Walker] in Wisconsin could have done any number of things other than what he did.  I mean, you've had collective bargaining in Wisconsin for sixty years, if not longer.  I mean Wisconsin is the home of our union.  The choice to go after collective bargaining and to go after the financing ability of the union is within his power.  The mistake that he made was that, that it, it became an issue of fairness.  And it was not the union succeeding in the battle in Wisconsin.  It was the students.  It was the people who saw the, the fairness question just being hijacked.  And when we looked at it, clearly this is a part of a broad Republican agenda, Tea Party in most places, basic Republican in others.  Our union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] is probably one of the most politically active unions in the federation [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations].  You im- you, you, you impact the public sector union so that they cannot participate, or if they can participate, they can barely afford it, a la Citizens United.  You take away what we call check off, which means that you cannot sustain the union based on cash flow.  You, you minimize their ability to organize members.  So you have now put the public sector unions in a no play position.
Story_ID: 609095
Speaker 1: There are about six, seven, maybe eight states that are always in play in a national presidential campaign.  You have mis- Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, probably New York.  But I mean, where they took control in the 2010 elections and had the power either through the state legislature or through the governor's office to make it impossible that's what they did, had nothing to do with the state budgets, had nothing to do with any of that stuff, had to do with just a, a raw power grab to take the unions out.  I mean the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision that said corporations are individuals and entitled to have a right to speak [Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 2010], I mean that gave unlimited access to money, from Cook Brothers, at Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], you name it.  They can spend as much money as they need to spend to advocate their point of view, which means from the president all the way down to the dog catcher.  This thing called ALEC, which is an amalgamation of corporate rich folks, folks who hate unions, to put as much money as they can into this ALEC pot.  ALEC is this American Legislative Exchange Council, which is much more politically powerful than any caucus you can think of.  They are the stand your ground crowd.  The vice chair of this thing is Walmart, a few other firms in there too, but Walmart is a principal player.  And they can, with the makeup they've got now as state legislators, they can move any piece of legislation they want.  And the unions are the only ones who have the capacity to fight back.  And that's, that's what happened in Wisconsin.
Story_ID: 609096
Speaker 1: Okay, we're rolling (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in Wisconsin, it was painted as budget reform.  In order to reduce the cost of government, lower taxes, you gotta deal with these public sector workers.  And the way you deal with them is eliminate their ability to bargain.  And the fact is, it had nothing to do, because folks said, okay, you want to reform the budget, let's talk about what it is you need.  They weren't interested in that.  What they want is the, is the public sector workers with no rights whatsoever.  New Jersey was the other state I was trying to think of.  But the, the larger issue that we're dealing with now is the voter suppression component of their plans.  I mean what they're doing is pushing laws that minimize one's ability to stay on the roll.  And all they got to do is, is chisel 3 percent, 4 percent, 6 percent off of different states to reduce the impact of, of consolidated voting, and what you got is a Republican victory.  And had they touched anything other than collective bargaining, they may have got away with this thing unnoticed.  I mean they could have gone after check off.  It says that the state will no longer deduct union dues, which would have produced a different kind of argument.  They could have gone after recognition instead of saying that the bargaining unit is gonna be this size (gesture); the bargaining unit is gonna be this size (gesture), which puts a lot more people in there with diverse interests.  Anyway they went after collective bargaining because they thought they had the political strength to make that happen.  Well, the students all of sudden said, well, this, this, this affects my interests, and so they started to fight and occupying the capital and what have you.  I was out there, and farmers--well generally conservative for--I mean farmers had taken up this battle.  And on the (laughter) (unclear) on the day I was there some three hundred of them had driven their tractors from the farm down to Madison, Wisconsin (laughter).  I mean that's a serious statement.  They're gonna defeat Walker [Scott Walker].  I mean I was looking at an article, and he raised $13 million in two weeks I think it was.  That ain't coming from Wisconsin.  That's coming from people in other places.  And, and their effort is clear.  They do not want public sector collective bargaining.  They don't want any collective bargaining.  But where they have the immediate control is in the public sector.
Story_ID: 609097
Speaker 1: So do you think this, this kind of activity kind, kind of heightens the, I guess the, the issues that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it for us, I mean we're always in, in a battle with somebody somewhere, you know, so, we, we may be doing more of the, you know, the fight, but we're--it's not a new fight for us.  And you know, the bargaining itself is harder because there's some legitimate problem at states, I mean with budget stuff, because of the downturn in the economy.  They just don't have the, ta- the, the taxes coming in to support all levels of government.  If the state's doing good, counties may not be doing so good.  And any time the state's fortunes get bad, and the federal government's fortunes are bad, it's gonna be hell at city level, because so much of their, their budget comes from state supplied firms--funds.  But you know, we are a million five or six [in the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees], so it takes a while for us to feel big time loss.  I'm, I'm talking about it as if I'm still working.  I'm not (laughter)--.  But it, it takes a while before you feel that kind of loss in, in membership numbers, but you see it in, in declining services.  Michigan, I mean, you know, with the downturn preceding, you know, this re- this, this situation we got now, the people in charge have created a situation where they can appoint a manager to manage the affairs of government.  They don't have to be--they don't have to have manager skills.  They don't have to do anything other than be in the right political party.  So you got the City of Detroit [Michigan], which is already reeling from the auto downturn.  The house or the state legislature simply refused to give it help, and it gets to a point where it starts to eat, eat itself up.  You know, if no fire service, limited police service--
Speaker 1: Libraries closing.
Speaker 2: --libraries closing, schools go unrepaired, the highways, you know, I mean you can lose a Volkswagen in a pothole.  You know, I mean, all of those things start to play on the, on the, on the, on the jurisdiction.  That's fine with them, because they can say well, you know, it's, it's the president's fault.  You know, the, what the, the stimulus didn't work.  Well, you got guys who turned back--you know Walker [Scott Walker] turned back $80 million for a fast rail, or was it 80 million--some astronomical number, because he said well, I don't know what I'll do once it gets built.  We'll have to pay for it.  Well, you know, the, the car--the company that was gonna build the cars was gonna set up in a depressed area of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], create jobs to build the cars.  He didn't want that because Milwaukee is fairly isolated in the political process.  So the company moves to Chicago [Illinois], or moved to Illinois, and they're gonna build high speed rail cars for the high speed system that Illinois is gonna put in.  Meanwhile, Walker's concentrated high employment area remains the same.  And, but you got that going on all over the country.  You know, guy says, "We don't want the money," but he shows up for the photo op, so (laughter).  And I think that's what the president's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] been dealing with.  This--I think like any political--you don't know how bad it is until you get in, and then you'll see all the stuff that people have swept under the rug.  And, and the ironic thing is that private sector jobs are picking up.  The economy is slow, but it's moving.  And I think county government is almost destined to take on a bigger load--bigger role than it has now or had in the past.

Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, and you addressed a lot of it already.  But what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I think two things and, and maybe more, need to happen.  There has to be a self-recognized sense of empowerment.  Meaning, we gotta stop worrying about how weak we are.  I mean, you know, the African American economy is bigger than most countries.  The question is, how, how is it used, and what do we see as a way to maximize our, our social power and our political strength?  And that requires sort of a reassessment of ourselves, I mean.  Was it Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], foreign economist from, from St. Louis [Missouri] used to always say that "No permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interest."  I think that's very true.  And we've gotta figure out how to identify that and, and come politically together to advance it.  The, the second area would wind up being having an agenda that, that people understood.  I mean by the time the, the president leaves the inaugural stand, I mean everybody who's got a stake in this thing got their stuff on the table.  We're in the process of just starting to think what do we want to (laughter), want to ask about?  It's too late then.  I mean this, this, this, this pie been cut up, you know (laughter).  And, and, and it's not a surprise to, to the elected leadership.  I mean they expect people to advocate around their, their issues.  And I think we've been either late coming to the table or hope we're part of somebody else's agenda.  And I don't, I don't mean on the context of color but on economic interest.  I mean our issue is jobs.  And the question becomes what kinds of jobs?  Our young folks, or a lot of them, not all of them certainly, but a lot of them are in college now getting ready for the high tech jobs of the future.  All them jobs spoke for.  I mean we got a, a, a, a immigration policy that takes care of all of that, you know, the computer stuff and all that.  We, we have what is called the H-1B visa program.  And where do those immigrants come from?  They come from Pakistan.  They come from India.  They come from all over where this type of work is what has been taught already in school.  We're just not teaching it.  We let--what's the guy from Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation]?  Gates [Bill Gates], Gates goes before [U.S.] Congress and, and argues for an unlimited cap on H-1B visas.  And he provides the jobs for everybody who can--who's warm.  Of course he does.  I mean because they're immigrant jobs.  Folks are thankful to have a job at that level of pay from Pakistan.  They get here.  They give up their passport.  They give up their--they got to get a work permit.  He's got a permanent built-in workforce that ain't gonna argue with him about anything.  Meantime, young African American kids who are graduating from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], they walk in and want a job; they want to get a decent salary.  I mean the two go together (laughter), except that here's a guy here who if he makes a peep he's going back to Pakistan.  So Gates may be the big benefactor, but he's also the big recipient of government largesse.  That's, that's, that's one item.  We, we, we've got to bring back manufacturing jobs.  I mean the big growth area is gonna be healthcare and health delivery.  You got people living o- longer, little help, can live better.  And I think, you know, Marion may be--[HistoryMaker] Marion Barry may have even stepped in his, in his stuff.  But I mean he was saying we should be preparing our nurses from communities within the U.S; that's true, and you're still gonna need nurses from outside the U.S., the Philippines particularly.  But our schools ought to be refocusing their stuff to jobs of the future.  I mean we ought to get off of this thing, I think.  Well, everybody's got to go to college.  Everybody don't need to go to college.  I mean, if you got, if you got a college mentality, you gonna find your way there.  But if you're trying to train some guy who, his best shot is gonna be driving a nail or sawing a board, I mean you need to guarantee that he's the best nail driver or, or board sawer you ever saw, so at least when he goes out, he's got a marketable skill.  There was a time when, you know, people could tune up a car by ear, not no more, you know (laughter).  That's gone.  So I mean we, we need to be a part of that thinking.
Story_ID: 609099
Speaker 1: Some years ago, Pres- I think it was President Carter [sic. President George Herbert Walker Bush] had a commission called the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce.  And on that thing, what, what we discovered is our system of organizing work works to the disadvantage of a lot of people and unique groups.  And, and by that I mean our theory is that a few people tell a lot of people what to do, and so we wind up in that lot of people category, as opposed to reversing the pyramid and having a lot of people participate in the decision about not only what to do but how to do it.  And you know, on that score, everybody becomes relatively equal in terms of skill needs and the ability to do.  We just do not want to pay folks for what we need.  (Laughter) I mean, after World War II [WWII], and it's ironic, you know, I mean.  MacArthur's [Douglas MacArthur] mission in life was to create a labor movement in Japan.  Why?  So they could make more money, so they can buy the products we gonna make on the new consumer goods that's gonna come out of wartime effort and knowledge, equally true in Europe.  Folks want workers to earn a good salary so they can buy stuff they wanna sell.  I mean Germany, France, and other countries, I mean they've started competing with us for machines (unclear)--and machine goods and autos, what, four years after the war's over, five years?  And Japan now has got market share like you wouldn't believe, not because their workers are paid less or more, because workers get a chance to talk about what they want to do.  There was this guy name, what, Denning [Steve Denning], who is this big advisor on how you organize and mobilize the workplace.  And, and his view was you know, give workers a chance to participate and blah, blah, blah, and quality comes out of it.  Well, we, whoever it is who thinks about the workplace for us, we agreed with everything other than the unilateral right to fire folks.  You know, Romney [Mitt Romney] said it: "I like to fire people," 'cause you think the threat and intimidation is what make people work hard.  I mean, that ain't.  I mean, what that do is piss folks off and make them put a lug nut in your hubcap.  (Laughter) So you gonna--I mean, we just cannot buy into paying a, a, a higher wage.  You know, if, if we were arguing for a high wage economy, let workers negotiate the best salary for the best quality of product.  We wanna argue for a low wage economy.  We wanna pay folks minimum wage if we can get away with it.  Well, you, you don't have, you don't have people who can buy what you wanna make, so we work against ourselves.  You know, the, the, the, the, the White House at a point was arguing that we want to create a million jobs.  That's a great idea, except they're minimum wage jobs.  Well, who wants, or who needs, or who will fight for a minimum wage job?  I'm gonna out and beat my brains out to get a minimum wage job?  When the opposition is gonna fight you just as hard to keep you from getting a minimum wage job as they would for a high wage job.  And what do you want, a, a, a, a, a nation that's making minimum wages?  And you know, so I stopped getting invited to meetings (laughter) because I mean the, the logic is that workers, even it's nothing but pure politics, they would support somebody who's trying to get them a high wage a lot harder than they will somebody who's getting a minimum wage.  And so, I mean I, I just think that one of the things that as a, as a community we ought to be doing is either becoming--having a bigger role in these economic discussions, have a large role in policy discussions around trade and trade policy; we ought to sort of figure out how we play a role in these global things that talk about, you know, quality of work and, and, and so forth.  We've always left those to the employers, you know, to participate in.  Yet, the end results of that is that it's a sort of diminution in our status as workers.  There's a thing called the WTO [World Trade Organization].  Well, you're familiar--WTO.  The only people sit on that are people who ain't never been elected to nothing; they've just been appointed.  And they make decisions that affect us globally.  And, and none of that has any worker concerns.  It's all the investor concerns.  And we need to understand that.
Story_ID: 609100
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, I, I hope it's been to sort of in all these different movements and things is to make folks think a little bit about the fact that, you know, no revolution ever started with majority support.  I mean it just don't happen.  (Laughter) I mean if it, if it's change you want, folks don't like change, and those who are affected by change or need change, got to be in, in, in the game.  I mean they, they gotta be advocating for what they need, and quite often, those are un- un- are not popular positions.  If we've managed to do anything, is to make folks think and believe that you can change things with a few committed folks.  We used to say a long time ago that, give me a, the, the, the Gestetner and five reams of paper, and, and we gonna take over something (laughter) you know, we, we not know what it is, but, but something is gonna change.  I think we're seeing some of that kind of thing now with social media.  You're seeing folks, you know, advancing all kinds of ideas.  I, I'd like to think that we have convinced a, enough of our community--and, and when I say community in this case, I don't mean African American; I mean just communities that need to be empowered--that it can be done.  And if there's--when folks think about what we've done, I would like to think that they convinced us that we could fight for ourselves, and we'd win some; we'd lose some.  But it's guaranteed we won't mean any--won't win anything if we don't get engaged and get involved.
Story_ID: 609101
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  Now you're married, and you have two daughters, right?
Speaker 2: Two daughters.  We're not married.  My wife [Dorotheria Rader Lucy] passed away in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were married for forty-seven and a half years, give or take a little bit.  My one daughter [Benita Lucy Marsh] works for EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].  I guess she got about (makes sound) eighteen, twenty years there, something like that.  My other daughter [Phyllis Lucy Manuel] is a schoolteacher.  She teaches chemistry and physics in the Atlanta school system, one of them counties.  My youngest daughter is the schoolteacher, and my oldest daughter is the, is the--some sort of a project analysis for EEOC.  We had one son [William Lucy, Jr.], who passed away in '77 [1977].  They have--I have four grandkids, and my youngest daughter has three, and the oldest has one.  She's got two in school, in college now.  My grandson finished college I guess about eight years ago, nine years ago.  And my oldest daughter is married.  She lives in Temple Hills [Maryland].  My youngest daughter is divorced, and she lives in DeKalb County in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you any relation at all to Autherine Lucy?
Speaker 2: Cousins.
Speaker 1: Cousins, okay.  I thought so--
Speaker 2: Cousins I'm told, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I needed to ask that, even though I had no idea.
Story_ID: 609102
Speaker 1: Well, is there anything we need to discuss that we have not discussed before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.  I've--maybe have given you a long, a lot of long, windy answers.  No, I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would say and, and hope that folks would think that, one, was a pretty good trade unionist and brought some ideas to the table that the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] could use to, to give its members something other than just a nickel more an hour.  There are few, if any, instruments or institutions other than the church that can have such an impact on the lives of people as organized labor or unions, because when you change a situation, you change it for a lot of people.  And you're changing it in ways that affect, you know, the quality of life.  And if we've been able to make the case that, A, you've got to be involved; you've got to strengthen the union, and you got to be a part of setting the agenda, I, I would think that's a pretty fair contribution.  And we've seen from economic projects to social justice to the creation of movements.
Story_ID: 609103
Speaker 1: There is one, one other issue that we're working on now.  We're looking at countries across the globe who were formerly owned by somebody else.  And with the changes that have taken place, you know, those owners have come back to their home borders, so to speak.  But the systems that they left in place still contribute to the diminution in life quality for people, example: Brazil, which has probably the largest Afro-Brazilian, Afro population, outside of Nigeria.  Yet, in Brazil, folks have real difficulty recognizing that discrimination and racism exist.  Folks just don't, don't, don't want to talk about it.  And we've been working with a program now that, that makes folks address and look at this issue.  I mean you can go from black to white, same families.  So, racism doesn't--and discrimination doesn't take on the same meaning.  But we did a study in Brazil that demonstrated in every industry you want to look at, the darker you got, the worse off you were.  And, and you go down the various grouping, black women are the worst off of all the different groupings.  And we were able to put this on the table.  We were able to make it a part of a presidential campaign to the point where the president acknowledged the reality of this situation and created a cabinet position to deal with it.  We have since made the argument that other institutions ought to look at these same kinds of things, and somebody ought to take responsibility for raising these questions in other countries, in particular in this hemisphere.  Dominican Republic, problems, you know, lot--beyond belief.  Why is Haiti so poor?  And you can't say, well because they don't speak English, or they don't--that's just silly.  It's, it's because there's almost an, an, an aggressive agenda to keep Haiti poor or to punish them for get out of line way back when.  You got all of the other down islands.  You've got Grenada; you've Guyana; you've got Belize, all of these countries where the, the, the, the, the, the community of color is worse off, and I mean there's got to be a reason other than bad luck, you know, for that.  So, we're trying to, to raise that in the minds of people to say, okay, let's just organize ourselves and take a look at what's going on and, and not just pointing the finger and hoping somebody will, will, will, will, will help you.  The question is what are you prepared to do for yourself in these situations.  And we are making some headway on that issue, Colombia falling into that category.  I mean, President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] goes to Colombia three weeks ago, signs a trade deal.  (Makes sound) Everything's fine; yet, people are getting killed by the truckload.  'Cause--where and who is to speak out on, on that issue?  And it doesn't--you know, you, you say well, okay, I can understand a, a pragmatic deal, but what's the plus, you know, for people in Colombia?  I mean, just like NAFTA, you know.  I mean President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] signed the North American Free Trade Agreement.  He thought that Mexican workers were gonna be better off, and U.S. workers would be better off.  None of them are better off (laughter).  And it's the money crowd.  I mean it's about money.  It's not about improving the quality of life for people.  So if we're remembered for anything, it's for the fact that we wanted, wanted to try and make folks think about those kinds of questions.
