Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum] on the campus of Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and the date is October 18th, the year 2006.  Mr. HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: I'd be delighted.  My name is Dr. Julian E. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], J-U-L-I-A-N, E-. White, W-H-I-T-E.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Dr. White, when were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born on March 3rd, 1941 in Jacksonville, Florida.

Speaker 1: Before we move into the interview, we have a few warm-up questions.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: We call them People magazine type questions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: It'll give the viewers of your interview over time another slant on your personality.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: So, I want to ask you, Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food would be--there're two, fried fish and steaks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I think--I like the summer, even though it's very hot.  Swimming and scuba diving are my hobbies, so I can spend quite a bit of time in the water, more so in the summer than in the winter.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is red.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My favorite vacation destination is Panama City, Florida.  Again because of its proximity to Tallahassee [Florida] and the fact that the Gulf of Mexico offers great waters for scuba diving and for just spending the day on the beach.
Speaker 1: Last warm-up question.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you like to use from time to time?  A bit of wisdom?  Something philosophical with your friends or relatives?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, and it's, it's one that I, I picked up from my father [George White].  He always said, "Julian, you must always be very careful because there are consequences to every action that you engage in."
Story_ID: 351860
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], how do you describe your profession and your occupation?  What do you do and what are your present positions and titles in your field?
Speaker 2: Yes, my present position is director of bands here at Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and chairman of the department of music.  In the latter, I serve as the chief administrator for the department of music.  I, I supervise a faculty of about twenty-five, and about one hundred and thirty music majors.  My other capacity is as director of bands where I have the awesome task of serving as the leader for the world-famous Marching 100.
Speaker 1: How long have you been the director of the Marching 100?
Speaker 2: I have been the director of the Marching 100 for five years--or actually six years.  However, I have been on the band staff for the past thirty-three years.  I served as the associate director of bands with Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] for twenty-five years before he retired, and then I was elevated to position of director of bands.

Speaker 1: We start our interviews by looking at your roots, looking at your grandparents, your parents so that as your life unfolds in front of us and as you describe, we know what the antecedents were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Certainly.
Speaker 1: We know what the influences were and how you got to be the person you are--
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: --and how you got to where you are in the music world today.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: So, we're going to start with your mother, and I'd like to ask you her name, when she was born and where?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Victoria Eva Richo [Victoria Richo White].  She was born in 1912 in St. Augustine, Florida and she was a very positive role model in my life.  I had--I have two brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] and one sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] who is deceased, and my mother was a housewife.  She was never away from the home.  She was quite sickly throughout our lives, but she always took care of the family.  She always made sure that we had three meals a day.  We were somewhat spoiled.  She cooked for us.  She made up our beds, and just made sure that we did our homework.  She was a musician, too.  She played the piano and I think that that sort of gave us some roots as far as music was concerned in our family.  All of us participated in music.  My sister was probably the best of all of us.  She had a perfect pitch and she influenced me to become a musician.  My youngest brother was also a musician and band director just as myself, and my oldest brother attempted to be a musician.  He was drum major here at the Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] band with the Florida A&M band [Marching 100] just as I was, but he was more inclined toward athletics.  So, he was a star baseball player and I wanted to be an athlete, too.  Being a musician was not my goal.  I wanted to be an athlete like my brother, but when I entered high school at New Stanton Senior High School [Stanton College Preparatory School] in Jacksonville, Florida, I went to the coach and said, "I want to try out for the football team."  He knew of the athletic ability in my family.  My uncle was a star on the football team.  My father [George White] played football, et cetera, and so he looked at me and he says, "Son, you'd better try out for the band.  I don't think you're going to make it in football."  And I was somewhat discouraged, but I took his advice and I told my parents I wanted to play in the band.  Well, they said, "What do you want to play?" and I said, "A trombone."  That, that would have meant purchasing an instrument.  My sister played the flute, and they said that, "Well, you can play your sister's flute."  I didn't want to play a flute because flute at that time was an instrument that all girls played.  But I did.  I, I started playing the flute and played it very well, and that kind of kindled my interest in music.

Speaker 1: Your mother [Victoria Richo White] was born in St. Augustine, Florida?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Where was she raised?  Where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She was raised--in her early years in Jack- St. Augustine, Florida, but then as a teenager, they moved to Jacksonville, Florida.  And so she was there for the remainder of her life (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.  Did she talk with you about her growing up years as a child before she came to Jacksonville?  Did she share stories with you about her, her early childhood years?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She would always tell me what a positive role model her father [John Richo] was.  I'd never met him because he was deceased before I was born and how that they had strong family values and strong family ties.  They emphasized eating together.  They went to church together.  My grandmother was a great vocal singer--a vocalist and I did know her quite well.  She was influentially in, in my life on, on my mother's side.  She was--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Florence Richo, and she was soprano.  She was a soprano, and I would say with the proper connections and being in the right place, she probably could have been a Marian Anderson.  She, she just had that kind of strong soprano voice, but she influenced all of us.  She was quite a strict disciplinarian and, and my mother talked quite a bit about her and about her father and her growing up.  The kind of thing that we needed to do in order to be successful in life, and even though she did not graduate from high school, she most certainly made sure that all of us did our homework, as I mentioned earlier, and that we were on task as far as having values to go to college.  All of us attended college.  In fact, all of us attended Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  All of us graduated from here, and three of us were music majors.  My brother [Alvin White] was a physical, physical education major, but on--just on the side note, I was inducted this pass weekend into the athletic hall of fame [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University Sports Hall of Fame] as a supporter of athletics.  So, that was quite an honor for me because I am now in the hall of fame along with my brother who is an athlete here.
Speaker 1: Well, congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's your grandmother in the picture that we have here?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is my grandmother, and, and myself when I was about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Okay.  We'll, we'll look at it later on.
Speaker 2: --three or four years old.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Your mother has passed on.
Speaker 2: Yes, she has.
Speaker 1: But how do you remember her in terms of her personality?  What was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: My mother always had a smile on her face, but she was strict, too.  She was a disciplinarian and she did not spare the rod, but she always had a smile.  She was always just a loving, a kind mother who cared so much for her children and even though she was sick and many times she could not attend performances that I would have or my brothers and sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] would have, we always knew that she was there in spirit, and I would never forget she was quite sick when I graduated from college, but she came to Tallahassee [Florida] and endured it all to be there for my graduations and my graduation ceremony.  And I--that's what I remember about her, just being a very kind, but strict disciplinarian.
Story_ID: 351863
Speaker 1: Tell me about you father, his name, when he was born and where.
Speaker 2: My father's name was George Washington White [George White].  He was born in Allendale, South Carolina in 1911.  And he again instilled values in us.  There was one other thing that--they made us go to church.  I said that when I graduated--whenever I got away from home, I would not go to church so much because in our family we went to church three times a day on Sunday.  We went to Sunday school, we went to church, and then we went to BTU, Baptist Training Union, and then at night to night services because we were either in the choir or on the usher board, and my father--he insisted that you went to church.  And later on when I was in college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and, and doing the Saturday night partying even then, he would drag me out of the bed and say, "Okay, you partied last night, now let's get up and go to Sunday school.  Let's get up and go to church."  But you know ironically after I moved away from home, I continued the same habit and I still go to church every Sunday.  If I'm out of town, of course, I can't with the band [Marching 100], but whenever I'm in town, I always go to church.  And that was the kind of, of father that I had.  He worked hard.  There were times when he probably was not in the home as much as he would have liked to be, but only because he was working two jobs (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His occupation was?
Speaker 2: His occupation now, he worked at the naval air station [Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida] as a metal smith and he worked at the Railway Express [Railway Express Agency], and that was just loading box cars for, for transportation and but--
Speaker 1: He did those at the same time?
Speaker 2: At the same time.  What he would--his schedule was he'd get up about five or six o'clock in the morning and go to the naval air station.  He'd work there until I'd say three or four o'clock.  Then we would meet him.  We all had that duty--all of my brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] we'd ride the bicycle about three or four miles from home to take him his dinner, and so he would leave that job and go to the Railway Express.  We would give him his dinner and take him the bicycle because he rode a bicycle.  Now in our early years, we didn't have a car.  We all rode bicycles and we would take him the bicycle.  He would work that job until about say midnight, one o'clock in the morning, then he'd come home and get a few hours sleep and repeat that process.  Just a hard worker, and I think that the work ethic that I have now and all of us--and my, my brothers and sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] had and that I have now is a result of that kind of effort that my father put forth.  I am a confessed workaholic.  I, I--you know, I work and, and my joy is in my work.  Unfortunately, I don't come to work everyday.  I, I come to a place of pleasure and at night when I'm sleeping, I can't wait to wake up so I can come to work.  Just going off on a tangent a little bit, my wife [Dennine Mathis White] says, "You can't get up now.  You got to stay in the bed until six o'clock.  Get back."  That happened this morning because I knew you were coming, too, and so I had to get up early.  I run in the morning, so I had to get up earlier to do that.  But, but any way, getting back to my father, that was the kind of thing he worked hard.  We were not extravagant, but we--I don't ever remember not having everything that I needed.  Maybe not everything that I wanted, but everything that I needed.  We grew up in the earlier years in a government project--housing project like many of us did, and then they bought a house in Jacksonville [Florida].  They'd bought a house on--in another neighborhood and we--I lived there until I graduated from college.  In fact, even after I graduated and started teaching before I got married, I still lived there and my mother [Victoria Richo White] continued to cook my food and I didn't pay any rent, but that was great.  But my father just--he worked so hard and he wanted to make sure that we all had an education, the financial aspects of it.  And so, I, I, I appreciated the hard work and the sternness that he had toward us.
Speaker 1: Did he grow up in Allendale?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They moved early and that was somewhat historical too, because they lived in Allendale and I'm, I'm assuming that my grandmother [Marie White] must have been a sharecropper or something like that, and she got the family together and they got the train and somehow they migrated to Jacksonville, Florida, and, and he came from a large family.  I think there were about six brothers and sisters, and she brought all of them to Jacksonville, Florida.  They lived in the project and then subsequently bought a nice home in a very, very nice neighborhood in Jacksonville (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he grew up in Jacksonville basically?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Jacksonville, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 351864
Speaker 1: Did he [White's father, George White] ever share with you stories about his growing up years as a child or early teenager?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, that is what he--the, the bit that I just gave you regarding them migrating to Jacksonville [Florida].  He told me about that and then in his childhood, because there, there were so many brothers and sisters and he was the oldest.  So, he had to work quite a bit in order to help his mother [Marie White] to take care of the family.  Education was a priority on his side also.  He didn't go to college.  He was a very good mathematician and probably would have been a good math or college professor.  He also was a, a coach and played football, this kind of thing.  But he did put great values on education and, and he taught us those things and told us stories about him growing up, how he had work and to make sure that his brother and his sisters went to college.  He didn't go, but he helped his mother to send them to college.  And, and so that, that work ethic he instilled in us and he told us the consequences that I told you earlier that, "Julian [HistoryMaker Julian White], and Alvin [Alvin White] and Ernest [Ernest White], Willoughby [Willoughby White (ph.)] be very careful of your actions because there are always consequences.  Sometimes they are positive and sometimes they are negative," and the negative consequences if we did anything wrong, were truly memorable in terms of the kind of punishment that we received because it always was commensurate with the infraction.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father's father?  Your paternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: I--my paternal grandfather I didn't know very much about him.  His name was somewhat taboo.  During the migration process, I don't recall them saying that he was a part of that process, but he was in Jacksonville, also.  And I was very young when he passed away, but I didn't attend the funeral, and it was just--it was my grandmother--my Grandmother White whom I'm in the picture with.  She was stern also, and if there was taboo or something you didn't talk about, you just didn't talk about it and you did not talk about our grandfather in that house.  So even now, there's research that we're probably going to do in order to find out more about that side.
Story_ID: 351865
Speaker 1: How far back can you remember in your life?  What is your earliest memory or earliest memories?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Interesting you would ask that because I, I tell my brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] and sisters [sic. sister, Willoughby White (ph.)] this but they don't believe me that I--in 1941, December 7, 1941, a day that would go down in infamy because that's when the Japs [Japanese]--when they bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], and I say that I remember that.  Now, I probably don't, but we were living in the proj-, we were living in Durkeeville [Jacksonville, Florida] and I do remember something about a war, about, about some bombing and I--they said that it was in Pearl Harbor and we lived in the project and, and beyond the trees, beyond the, the, the, the tall buildings in the project, I thought that was--I thought that's where the war was.  Now, I say I remember 1941.  Maybe I don't remember that, but that's, that's--I, I, I do remember recall living in the project and I do recall discussing those kind of things.  I, I recall sitting on the porch with my mother [Victoria Richo White] and having all kind of weird ideas of what a casket is.  I thought a casket was a stretcher that you put people on in the ambulance.  And these are--these are childhood memories, you know, that I, I have some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were born in '41 [1941].
Speaker 2: I was born in '41 [1941], so it's--yeah, it's virtually impossible for me to have remembered that, but I do remember events and I must've been very small at the time to remember because when I lived in Durkeeville, there was a project.  I lived there from the time that I was--I was born there, of course and not in the project, but in Jacksonville [Florida] during that time and until I was in--starting first grade.  So, it had to be some early years.
Speaker 1: I remember the end of World War II [WWII], and there were these celebrations of firecrackers going off (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And people celebrating in the streets.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's one of my early memories.  I was about five.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Actually, I was probably seven or eight.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, maybe you also remember the end of the war, maybe, maybe that's all fed into--
Speaker 2: Those kind of things.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other very early memories of--
Speaker 2: I remember--
Speaker 1: Before you started kindergarten or grade one?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I do remember the kindergarten that I--that I attended.  Simpson A.M.E. Church [Simpson Memorial United Methodist Church] on the corner of Cleveland Road [sic. Cleveland Street] and Kings Road in, in Jacksonville, Florida.  That church is still there and I remember going to that, that, that building for kindergarten.  My grandmother would take me there, and I lived with my grandmother for, my Grandmother White [Marie White], for or maybe sometime--you know, if, if--I don't want to say my favorite grandmother, but she was the available grandmother because my other grandmother worked and my Grandmother Richo [Florence Richo] worked.  My Grandmother White didn't so, I spent some time over there and, I, I recall being in the project in Blodgett Homes [Jacksonville, Florida].  I recall living in the project in Durkeeville and I remember when my grandmother purchased the house in--on Durket Drive [ph.], and Durket Drive was kind of the Sugar Hill of Tallahassee--of Jacksonville, and I recall--I do remember that.  I, I remember I loved my grandmother's lemon cheese--lemon meringue pies and lemon cheese cakes and ice cream that they would bake and just very pleasant family memories.
Story_ID: 351866
Speaker 1: Talking about family, what are some of the special holidays or events that you remember celebrating with your family?  Do any, any of them stand out more than others?
Speaker 2: They do.  Christmas probably stood out more than anything else, even though we celebrated all.  We celebrated Easter.  We celebrated New Year's.  We didn't do a lot of Halloween.  Mother's Day, Father's Day we did and, and Easter.  Our Christmas, before we could do anything, we would always gather and we'd have prayer.  We would, we would have to get together and we'd have to pray before we could play with our toys, before we could do anything.  And our father [George White] led us in prayer and I recall sometimes that I would be--I was chosen to lead us in prayer because my father was working, and my older brother [Alvin White] was away either in college or in the [U.S.] military, so I was the oldest male there and I was designated to do--to do the family prayers.  But Christmas stood out because, you know, I believed in Santa Claus for a long time.  I, I believed in Santa Claus even when I knew that there wasn't because, you know, you could--you could see them hiding the presents and, and then we'd wait until they hide--hid the presents 'til they go to sleep, then we'd get up and we go out under the Christmas tree and get all the toys out.  And again, they always--we didn't get everything, but we, we were fortunate in that we got a lot.  The food was always good on, on Christmas.  The Christmas Eve and the nights before, my mother [Victoria Richo White] and my sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] would be busy in the kitchen cooking cakes and pies, and then we would always have the, the Christmas dinner.  So, that stood out and then we would do the same thing on Thanksgiving.  There was always a Thanksgiving feast and a Christmas dinner.  The same thing would be true with Easter and Mother's Day and Father's Day, and all of our birthdays.  And those kind of--those memories of my family during those times really stand out at the holidays, and, and even now during Christmas, it's rather nostalgic because when they start to play the Christmas carols--you know the main ones, the 'Silent Nights' and 'Jingle Bells' and 'The First Noels,' they don't change, and when I hear those, I can--I can recall us singing around the Christmas tree and leading up to Christmas morning.
Story_ID: 351867
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Victoria Richo White] played the piano?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Tell me about her piano playing and what are your memories of her, her musical interests?
Speaker 2: She was a--she took piano lessons, but she was not a virtuoso pianist.  She could play hymns and she could play favorite songs and, you know, she could sit, sit at the piano and just play anything by ear even though she had, I would say primary piano lessons, and she would sing.  She didn't sing as well as my grandmother [Florence Richo] and sometimes when we would be bad or she would get disgusted, or she may be feeling not well because of her illness and she would sing.  And especially when we were bad, and that singing would sometime penetrate.  She'd sing 'Jesus, Keep Me Near The Cross,' and 'Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior,' and she would sing those songs and they were just like they were just gnaw at me and I'd take the pillow and put it over my head, and my bedroom was right next to the kitchen where she'd be working.  And she'd say, "You know, you're gonna, one day you're gonna wish you could hear this voice," and she knew what she was saying because if today now if I could hear that voice again, oh, it would be so glorious.  But, but she was--she was a good musician and I think the musicality, her musicality rubbed off on my sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] because my sister was a virtuoso pianist.  She was a virtuoso musician and she played the flute.  She played the piano and she inspired--she taught me music.  Taught me to play the flute which I, I played before I started on the other instruments, and so that the background I think extended from my grandmother who was a great vocalist to my mother who played piano.  Not a virtuoso pianist, but nevertheless did play piano, and then my sister picked up the music and she was just a fantastic musician (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  What was the first instrument that you picked up?
Speaker 2: The first instrument I picked up was the trombone.  I sounded horrible on it.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was about nine years old.  My brother played the trombone and he sounded horrible, too.  So, I imitated the sound then I put it down and didn't, didn't try it anymore because I was really keenly interested in playing sports.  I did--I was captain of the swimming team, so I did do sports some.  I was a very good swimmer and, I still swim.  I, I do a mile a day in the family's pool and, and in my pool in the summertime.  But--so, I, I--that side of, of the--of being an athlete did materialize, but that's basically it.
Story_ID: 351868
Speaker 1: You described to me how you and your brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] would ride your bicycles to meet your father [George White] and provide him with his dinner before he went to work.  What other kinds of things did you and your two brothers and sister [Willoughby White (ph.)] do together?  You talked about the holidays, Christmas and birthdays, but what other kind of things did you and your siblings do together?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what, we had--we worked because we had to cut the wood.  Now, I don't know if you know about cutting wood.  You see, we didn't have any electric--in the early days--we didn't have any electrical gas heater.  We had a wood stove and the wood man came by once a week.  He dropped the wood in front of the house and then it was our job to take the wood in the back, to put it in the wood tier, and then to cut it because you had these logs and you had a hatchet--you had a hatchet, and you had an ax and you had to cut the wood so that you made splinters.  You used splinters to start the fire, and then you use the logs to keep the fire going.  And so, that was me and my brothers' job.  We had to keep the yard cut.  We had to alternate.  My sister worked in the house washing dishes, but we had, had to wash the dishes, too.  And, but keeping that yard clean and cutting that wood, that was, that was quite a job.  And, and it amazes me, too, my mother [Victoria Richo White] was a good cook.  With no electric stove how they could maintain temperatures and, and, and bake in an oven that was furnished by wood.  They could fry chicken.  They could fry anything.  They could bake and it was all done by wood.  We had a fireplace and we had a rub board for clothes and, you know, mother washed by hand.  But in later years, we did have a washing machine.  We did have a car.  We did have an electric stove.  We did have air conditioning and that kind of thing, but it was just amazing the kind of things that they could do and, we didn't have air conditioning, but it was also so interesting that you had this hot stove that could get red hot.  So actually, it was heating the entire house in the summertime, but I don't remember just sweltering.  But you know, I guess you just worked.  Yes.
Story_ID: 352083
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], would you give me the names of your siblings?  Your brothers and sister and the year they were born, and I know your sister is deceased, but where your brothers are today and what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well first of all, my sister [Willoughby White (ph.)], deceased, was born in about 1938 in Jacksonville, Florida, and she was a musician.  My oldest brother, Alvin, Dr. Alvin White, is retired.  He retired as the CEO, chief executive officer for the Duval County school system [Duval County Public Schools], and then later on he served as--on the faculty at Jacksonville University [Jacksonville, Florida] as dean of the college of education, and presently he's retired and living the good life.  Served as a consultant for SACS, that is Southern Association of College and Schools, accreditations visits.  He lives in Jacksonville, Florida.  And my youngest brother [Ernest White] is also retired, band director at William Raines High School [William Marion Raines Senior High School] in Jacksonville, Florida.  He was the youngest of us and a very good musician.  A person who helped me out a lot because we shared so many ideas as band directors, and so it gave me a chance to corroborate with him to further many of the ideas that we had.
Story_ID: 352084
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the streets that you lived on and, and you mentioned the public housing, but the neighborhood that you grew up in.  Who were the neighbors?  How do you remember the street?
Speaker 2: I, I lived on the corner of Starr [Street] and Fairfax [Street] in Jacksonville, Florida.  It was one block off of New Kings Road [Kings Road] and about two blocks from Edward Waters College [Jacksonville, Florida], which is also--you know which is a college in Jacksonville, of course.  And it was interesting being--living near the campus, almost on the campus because I had a chance to see college professors and, and college students.  But my immediate neighborhood--all of them again values were--our parents in that neighborhood all taught values.  I can still see the houses.  My house is torn down now.  All of the houses on the street that I lived on had been demolished for--you know, for business, business developments, but in every household the, the kids went to college.  The parents were not professional people, just hard workers and all of them instilled values in us.  I can still see my neighbors across the street, my next door neighbors.  We were friends.  We grew up together, and we still see each other occasionally.  But the neighborhood itself was at that time I would say middle class.  It wasn't the--you know these were wooden homes, very neat, very clean.  The streets weren't paved in the early years, but the main thing about that neighborhood was I think the parental structure because they--the neighborhood--if you did something wrong in the neighborhood, your parents found out about it.  You were subject to get a spanking from your neighbor then go home and get a spanking.  The things that you hear about get a spanking from your parents are, are values, high values and character and integrity building was significantly present in those--in that neighborhood.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of your growing up years in Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 2: The sounds first of all are because we lived--it wasn't a heavily-traveled street, but it went to New Kings Road [Kings Road], so we did get a significant amount of traffic.  And so we could--in the morning when the traffic started to pick up, you could hear that.  And where I live now, even though it's, it's in a nice neighborhood, but it's in the heart of Tallahassee [Florida] and I'm nestled in trees, but if I come out of the trees, I'm right on Magnolia [Drive] which is a major thoroughfare.  And in the morning, I could hear the traffic, and when I hear the traffic, it reminds--it reminds me somewhat of Jacksonville.  Now, smells and fragrances in the spring time when the azaleas come out, the azaleas and the dogwoods, there's a certain fragrance that they have and in our neighborhood in Jacksonville, my mother [Victoria Richo White] loved azaleas and, and, and dogwoods.  So, I--whenever I smell those, then I think about my neighborhood.  I think about my yard that was just covered with azaleas and, and roses and this kind of thing.  So, the, the smell of fow-, flowers remind me of my childhood.

Speaker 1: Any other memories of--you've been very detailed and quite expansive, but any other details about memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember very well my elementary school days.  I went to Pearce Street, College Park Elementary School [Jacksonville, Florida] and that was on the campus of Edward Waters College [Jacksonville, Florida].  It was a, a lab school that eventually became a public school, and I, I've garnered quite a few friendships there that even today we still communicate with each other.  But significant things about, about Pearce Street Elementary School, I can remember my first grade--first grade class, my first grade teacher, Mrs. Vance [ph.], who taught me a lot and really got me started on educational then.  My second grade class room teacher, Mrs. Levitt [ph.].  My third grade class room teacher, Ms. Perry [ph.].  My fourth grade, Ms. Roberts [ph.].  My fifth grade, Ms. Ellis [ph.].  My sixth grade, Ms. Lucas [ph.].  And, and I can still--I just remember them because at the time, I, I was a kind of momma's boy.  Went to school, came home and played in the neighborhood and didn't do very much else, and those teachers really helped to mold my life.  I was a member of the school board patrol and one of my teachers--the advisor for the school board patrol, Ms. Tarva [ph.], and she worked--we worked to raise money to go to Washington, D.C. and I did that for about six years from elementary school to high--to junior high school.  And it was the first time that I've been anywhere significantly away from home, and that those trips to Washington, D.C. were very significant, having the chance to walk up the George Washington Monument [Washington Monument, Washington, D.C.] to see the Statue of Iwo Jima [Marine Corps War Memorial, Washington, D.C.], to visit Mount Vernon [Fairfax County, Virginia], George Washington's [President George Washington] birthplace, the White House [Washington, D.C.], the Capitol [United States Capitol, Washington, D.C.].  Those things were quite impressive and also that was the first time that I rode a train and we'd ride the train.  It'd take about--you know, about eighteen hours to get--to get from Jacksonville [Florida] to Washington, D.C., and that was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: You remembered all the names of your teachers?  Wow.  Would you spell the name of the elementary school for the records?
Speaker 2: P-E-A-R-C-E, Pearce Street, College Park Elementary School.  The, the street was Pearce.  It was Pearce Street and then it was college, so they called it College Park and then the elementary school.
Story_ID: 352087
Speaker 1: Going through the early, early grades through grades five and six, what kind of a student were you as you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can--I was a good student.  I made good grades.  I wasn't a genius.  I was always on the honor roll.  In elementary school [College Park Elementary School, Jacksonville, Florida], I was in the--as I mentioned the school board patrol and that was my major activity, but I always made good grades in elementary school.  And then when I went to college--when I went to junior high school, I remained on the school board patrol.  I'd wanted to play football, but I just--you know, I just wasn't good enough.  Played some intramural sports and I wanted to join the band but at that particular time, I just--I didn't get around to doing it.  My parents [Victoria Richo White and George White] said they weren't going to buy any instrument, et cetera.  So, I didn't join the band but again, I always made good grades.  I received awards, the Daughters of the American Revolution citizenship award [Good Citizens Award], and I can always remember being the president of something or the captain of something.  And then when I went to high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], I continued as an honor student.  Basically, I was one of those kind of three point--three-threers [grade point average], never a full point or three-five--you know, not in that--in that really, really smart category, but always made good grades (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Solid, solid work.
Speaker 2: Good, good, solid student, and then I joined the band and I became the section leader of the piccolos, flutes and then the section leader of the saxophones, and eventually captain of the band and, and, and then the captain of the swimming team.  When I came to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], again I made good grades.  I graduated with honors.  Not with greatest honors, but I had a star by my name, and that was--that was the goal that I wanted to have when I graduated.  I wanted to have a star by my name and I did have that.
Story_ID: 352088
Speaker 1: Backing up to the middle school grades or junior high school and entering high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], did you have any inkling or ideas at that stage in life what you wanted to be?  What you wanted to do?  Did you have aspirations?
Speaker 2: I did have aspirations.  At first, I wanted to be a doctor like everybody else or a lawyer like everybody.  And then after watching my brother [Alvin White], I'd decided I wanted to be a physical education teacher, and as I mentioned earlier that, that when I got to high school, they said, "No, you better try music," and I tried music.  And I didn't plan on doing that as a--as a vocation, but it worked out that way.  But I was always focused on what I wanted to be just in early life.  I'd, I'd--music wasn't one of things I was considering, but I always wanted to be something and be somebody.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the junior high years.  What were they like?  Any people who influenced you along (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The junior high years were fun.  It was fun.  As I mentioned being on the school board patrol and playing intramural sports and just meeting people, starting to date, and, and the people who influenced me during that time, my physical ed--physical education teachers and my home, my homeroom teachers, Ms. Hill--Ms. Edith Hill [ph.], Mr. George Kelly [ph.], Coach Johnson [ph.], Coach Lawson [ph.], Coach Walker [ph.].  Those individuals really had an influence because they made sure again that the discipline was there.  And during that time, corporal punishment was a way of life.  You know, you, you did something wrong, you got the board and you didn't think--you know, there was no second thoughts about it.  And--but there was never--it wasn't dangerous or anything.  Nothing really physical to harm you.  But juni-, I think that in, in junior high school those were the formative years, education-wise, for me.  I can remember my English teachers, and I can remember my math teachers that they were--they were good.  They were good teachers that they started to instill those parts of speech and those math formulas and those, those conjugational verbs and all those kinds of things.  And, and that carried on I think to--on to high school, college and even today.  I think that the abil-, the math ability, the, the English, the ability to speak and communicate, I can trace that back to those middle school--those junior high school days.  They didn't call it middle school then.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject in high school would have been history and band.  Yeah, history and band.  I, I took all the advanced courses, all the advanced math, the science, the chemistry, the phys-, the physics, the geometry and all those, but I, I didn't like them a whole lot.  I didn't excel in them.  I got Bs.  I passed all of them, but it was a struggle for me.  That was not my bag.
Speaker 1: You are a HistoryMaker and this is a HistoryMaker interview, why do you think you liked history at that early age (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because--
Speaker 1: --'cause most--'cause most students didn't like history?
Speaker 2: I liked history.
Speaker 1: Why did you like history?
Speaker 2: I liked history because I, I, I was always interested in facts and events of the past.  Even, you know, my family history, band history, athletic history.  Histories of the City of Jacksonville [Florida], the great fire and those kind of things.  For some--for some reason that fascinated me and even in college I, I, I enjoyed history.  The founder of this black archive [Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum; Carrie Meek-James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum, Tallahassee, Florida] that we are in now, Dr. James Eaton [HistoryMaker James N. Eaton, Sr.], was my high--was my college professor in history and he could bring it to life.  He could bring it to life, and I could remember sitting in the hall in my dormitory at Sampson Hall [George M. Sampson Hall, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] reading history books because I was so fascinated about it.  He was a great teacher.
Speaker 1: He was a HistoryMaker, too.  He's been interviewed.
Speaker 2: Yes, most definitely.
Speaker 1: I think Mr. Stearns [Scott Stearns] interviewed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, great.
Speaker 1: Did the video on that.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: See all these things come together.
Speaker 2: They certainly do (laughter).
Story_ID: 352089
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].  What'd you do that summer?  Do you recall between that and coming to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I went to summer band at my high school with my band director, Mr. Kirnady McFarland [ph.], and I would help him with the band.  I also did quite a bit of practicing on the flute and on the saxophone because I was coming to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and I wanted to play in this band [Marching 100] and you had to be ready.  You had to be a good solid musician.  You had to know your scales.  You had to know your music.  You had to be in good physical condition, so I can remember vividly the running, running around the track to get in good shape physically.  I can remember days of practicing on the music that I knew we were going to play when we came to Florida A&M.  So that summer of 1959 was really devoted to preparation for membership in the Florida A&M band.
Speaker 1: And so you came and arrived in September of 1959?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].  Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: How'd you remember that freshman year?  The band activity, but even that first year here, what was it like?
Speaker 2: The first year was exciting, traumatic.  Traumatic in that I'm a home person.  I just loved being home, being home with mother [Victoria Richo White].  Even though now I travel a lot, I don't like traveling.  I like to be home.  So that first year--that first year in school, I was devoted to adjusting.  Happy that I was selected to be a member of the Florida A&M band, but having to adjust to the rigorous rehearsal schedule and to be able to juggle the rehearsal schedule with the academic requirements, and then the fact that I played saxophone in the marching band and flute in concert.  So, I had to do quite a bit of extra practicing on the flute outside of rehearsal.  But it was--the first year was very exciting.  Demanding as I mentioned earlier, but definitely exciting and learned quite a bit.  Met quite a few people--you know, my roommates.  I remember them very well.  And just being--the camaraderieship with the new members--the new friends from all over the United States was very exciting.
Speaker 1: Getting back to the saxophone and the flute, then you had been taking lessons during high school?
Speaker 2: From my high school band director and from my sister [Willoughby White (ph.)], yes.
Speaker 1: From your sister and through the school program (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: That was your instruction?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 352090
Speaker 1: As a freshman and in the band [Marching 100], what are the most memorable performances that year or early years when you were in the band?  Do you recall some of your trips?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  There were two--there are two that stands out.  Well, actually I have to say three.  The first performance in Bragg Stadium [Bragg Memorial Stadium, Tallahassee, Florida], the first time I put on the band uniform for that particular football game.  I remember very well because all of us that night, the freshman, you know, we put on our uniform.  We walked down the hall.  We were so proud that we were now members of the Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] band.  And so that first football game that we had I never will forget. It was with Benedict College from South Carolina--from Orangeburg, South Carolina [sic. Columbia, South Carolina], and the performance that we gave was electrifying just to be a part of that.  The, the crowd response really caused the adrenaline to flow and then after that performance, we performed in Jacksonville [Florida] and, of course, that was my hometown and to go home to return as a hometown hero--well, there were a lot of us hometown heroes to Jacksonville.  The high school band that I played in [at New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] was quite good and we sent--quite a few of us came to Florida A&M.  But to go home and march in the parade with my high school band behind us to march in the Gator Bowl--it wasn't all state then at the Gator Bowl--and to march there before the hometown crowd was quite a thrill.  And then the next was the Orange Blossom Classic in Miami, Florida.  They are--during that time you had forty, fifty thousand people attending the football game and that was quite significant, those kind of numbers in that day.  There were--we had on one side of the field would be all black, and then you'd do an about-face and on the other side of the field would be all white.  You see, that was the day before the University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] was prominent.  They were the Miami Dolphins.  So that Orange Blossom Classic was the game in Miami and that performance itself was truly exhilarating.
Story_ID: 352091
Speaker 1: Tell me about practicing with the band [Marching 100] in those early years.  What was the practice schedule like?  How many hours did you devote to, to practicing and organizing with your other instrumentalists?
Speaker 2: Practiced--the rehearsal schedule was quite extensive.  We would rehearse from four o'clock until six every day.  And then during pre-drill we call it, we'd practiced from seven to nine--that was two weeks before school started.  We'd practice from seven to nine.  We'd have breakfast.  We'd practice from ten thirty to one.  Twelve-thirty we'd have lunch.  We'd practice from two to four.  We'd have dinner and we'd come back and we'd practice from six until we finished, and that went on for two weeks.  Very extensive and demanding, both musically and physically.  Then once school started, we'd practice from four o'clock to six o'clock.  We didn't practice at night because there were no lights.  You see, we didn't have any lights on the field.  Right now, we have a luxurious band drill field.  We have lights.  We have restrooms.  We have cold water.  We have--you know, so we have--really it's a--it's an ideal practice field.  But during that time, we had no water, we had no restrooms, and we had no lights.  We had no females either, so you didn't really need restrooms.
Speaker 1: How many members were there in the early bands that you participated in, in those early college years?  How many members in the band?
Speaker 2: One hundred thirty-two.
Speaker 1: One hundred thirty-two.
Speaker 2: One hundred thirty-two.
Speaker 1: Where does the 100 come from?
Speaker 2: The 100 emanated from Dr. Foster's [HistoryMaker William Foster] desire to have a 100-piece black college band.  When he arrived here, there were about sixteen band members who made a play for the line of march to chapel, to convocation on Sundays, and he took those numbers and worked very hard and developed a 100-piece marching band.  And by the time I got here in 1959--he started that in 1946.  When I got here [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in '59 [1959], he--we were up to 132.
Speaker 1: So he was the band director when you--when you arrived?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was my band director.
Speaker 1: His full name?
Speaker 2: William Patrick Foster.
Speaker 1: The band was founded in what year?  You're interested in history and I am interested in facts, too, and history.  So when did the band first become established here?
Speaker 2: I would say about 1865 [sic.] and the first band director, I believe, was Dr. Colonel Kerry [sic. P.A. Van Weller], and then that lineage extended up to Dr. Foster, who came here in 1946 and he stayed here for fifty-two years.  And then after Dr. Foster, I assumed leadership.
Story_ID: 352092
Speaker 1: Let's move to your academic program.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your, your major field of study as an undergraduate here?
Speaker 2: My major field of study was music education which meant that I had to study music theory, piano, music history, woodwind techniques, brasswind techniques, percussion techniques, form and analysis, counterpoint, in addition to applied music, that is your major instrument.  In my case, that was the flute.  And then the general studies courses such as English, math, history, phys-, health and physical education, introduction to the education, psychology and those courses--those type of courses.
Speaker 1: So you were prepared to be a music teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Any other, before we move from your four years here as an undergraduate, any other things you want to add or memories about your undergraduate days here?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one other thing was that I was quite active in the university in addition to the band [Marching 100].  Well in the band after two years, I became the head drum major, so that was quite--that was an awesome responsibility because that meant that I was in charge of the band whenever the band directors--as far as the chain of command was concerned, I was the connecting link between the band staff and the band.  So, that was quite an honor and quite an awesome responsibility, too.  I was quite active in other aspects--
Speaker 1: What roles did you have to play as the drum major (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As the drum major, I was responsible for all the field conducting, all the commands for starting the band, stopping the band during the show, and I was--I was the field general.  I was the quarterback for the band.
Speaker 1: Dance--
Speaker 2: Dance.
Speaker 1: Was introduced in this band when?  Is it more relatively a recent addition or is it--?  I understand there was a point in time when dance was added to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: That would have occurred--let's see, '59 [1959].  That would have occurred in about 1961, '62 [1962] even though the band did dance routines even in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  They were--you know, like the 'Darktown Strutters' Ball,' just--and not complicated like these dances are today.  But then for that particular time, it was quite exciting.  If they were doing the 'Darktown Strutters' Ball,' they would do a cross-step, a backward march, or move the instruments up and down.  Quite exciting.  Then in 1962--'61 [1961], '62 [1962], we had a choreographer, Dr. Beverly Hillsman.  Dr. Beverly Hilsman Barber and she helped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: Beverly, B-E-V-E-R-L-Y, Hillsman, H-I-L-S-M-A-N [sic.] Barber, B-A-R-B-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she served--she was choreographer.  She was the dance instructor for what they call Orchesis [Orchesis Contemporary Dance Theatre] here.  She founded that particular dance troupe and, and she got together with us and we made--I was in the band at that time and we constructed a formalized, stylized dance routine and that was quite innovative, quite extensive.  She serves as the choreographer probably for about two or three years and then we started using students.  We started to have students to bring us the dance routines because they know the dances, they know what's on the dance floor, and they'd bring them--and they would bring them to us or bring them to the staff.  I was not on the staff then.  And then they would take them and adapt them for the marching band and we still--that's a practice that we still employ.  The students bring the dances to us and then we help them adapt them so they fit the marching band, and it's gotten to the point of perfection now that the students actually know what to bring to us and how to adapt them themselves.
Speaker 1: So this innovation, this turning point, took place during your four years here [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: During my four years here.  Yes, indeed.  And the dances then I could do.  The dances that they do now are so complicated, I wouldn't make the band.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I couldn't do the dances.  But I, I guess you know--
Speaker 1: You're in good shape.  You swim and you run (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They have some body movements that the body goes in separate ways.  But you know, I guess it's a part of the generation because none of them have a problem doing those routines.
Story_ID: 352093
Speaker 1: You graduated from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in what, 19--?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].  What came next in your life?
Speaker 2: After I graduated, I moved back to Jacksonville [Florida], and my plans at the time--and I became band director at Northwestern [Northwestern Junior-Senior High School, Jacksonville, Florida].  Now that was interesting because when I left here, I, I graduated early.  I graduated in three and a half years, and that was an accomplishment I'm realizing now.  I didn't think very much of it at the time, I just did it.  But I graduated in three and a half years, and so I had a semester that I was just not doing anything.  I wasn't a student.  I didn't have a job and it was, was quite--it was bewildering because I was almost in purgatory.  I just--what was going to happen to [HistoryMaker] Julian White?  All of his friends were still in school.  He's back home with momma [Victoria Richo White] and rather bored.  So, I decided I would go to graduate school.  I wanted to go to the Eastman School of Music [Rochester, New York] and my parents said, "We gave you three and a half--we gave you four years of school.  If you want to go to graduate school, you'll have to go on your own."  So, I got a--I was accepted to the American Conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois] and in order to--during the summer before I was to go to the American Conservatory, I got a job in Cape May, New Jersey just at a resort.  Just waiting tables and just--you know, working in the hotel.  I went there and I worked for--and they had some quarters where you worked where the help lived, and I, I stayed there.  I worked two weeks.  I worked a week and we had some controversy about the pay so that he said, "Well, you know, you've been living here and you've been eating, so you're only going to get this amount of money," and I told him, "Well, I would have preferred if I'd known that in advance.  I would have preferred to pay because I would like to have all of my money."  So we didn't agree and, and some of the students that were there were--they were stuck.  They had to stay, but I was not inclined to accept those kind of conditions.  So, I packed my things and went back to Jacksonville and as I came back, this job opened up at a new high school, Northwestern Junior-Senior High School, and I was hired for that position.  So, I stayed there.  I worked at that particular school for two years and then another high school opened up, William Raines High School [William Marion Raines Senior High School, Jacksonville, Florida] and I became the band director there.  So--
Speaker 1: At the first high school, were you directing the band, or were you just a music teacher?
Speaker 2: I was--I was the band director.  And that was a rarity because I was just out of college.  But I was pretty good.  I had some pretty good what I called band sense, and didn't have any problem with it.  So after I graduated, that was it.  I, I, I started being a band director and I alluded to that--to that because that was not really what I wanted to do.  I wanted to be a professional flautist.  I wanted to go into graduate school, but after I got that particular job, I said, "Well, I like it.  I think I'll do it for a while."  And then I fell in love with it and, and I did that.  It was successful for ten years between the two schools, and then Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] called me up a year in advance and said, "You know, Mr. White, I'd like to bring you back to Florida A&M to work on the band staff," and that was an honor.
Story_ID: 352094
Speaker 1: As you were saying, Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], you were the band director at two high schools, Northwestern High School [Northwestern Junior-Senior High School] and Raines High School [William Marion Raines Senior High School] in Jacksonville [Florida].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Following your graduation from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Tell me a little bit about those years as your first work as a band director before you were called back here by Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster].
Speaker 2: Those were ten fascinating years.  Our first two years at Northwestern Junior-Senior High School and then they built, we made a transfer from Northwestern to William Raines High School.  But at Northwestern, that was my first job as a high school band director and it was an advanced band program, both with marching and with symphonic.  So, I had to write drills.  I had to get a superior rated--previous year, superior rated symphonic band ready for evaluation, and then I was also following a legend.  The band director was Mr. Lionel "Billy" Moore.  I knew him.  He was friends with my brother and I knew him.  He played in the Florida A&M band [Marching 100], a professional musician.  Played on 'Lady Sings the Blues' and just a legend.  And so this college student coming behind him was really something.  Well, I think one thing that I had in my favor was that I was young and I was only maybe two years--two or threes years older than high school seniors, so we could relate and I was pretty up on current music and band steps.  So, it worked out very well and, and, I, I--the band survived.  I shouldn't say, say they--survived, they, they actually flourished, and maintained the musical marching standards.  Then we moved to North-, to William Raines High School--William Marion Raines High School which was a multi-million dollar school.  At that time, two or three million dollars was a lot of money for a school.  Good band room.  Good facilities and I was able to develop a very fine band there, probably one of the finest in the state.  We performed at the Mexican invitation, the band festival, and it was interesting while we were performing the lights went out and we continued to play.  That happened because before we went to Mexico, we had gone to state band competition and made superior and I said, "Now what am I going to do with the rest of this music?"  So, I said, "Memorize it," and they had to memorize.  Now, it was one thing to memorize marching music, but to memorize concert music was quite different--quite a challenge, but they did.  They memorized the music and the lights went out and they put a flash light on me, and the band continued to play in the dark and they just--we got a standing ovation.  They just couldn't believe that these black musicians from Jacksonville, Florida could play like that and could play in the dark.  So, that was really a high point.  We performed for President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson].  We performed in governor's inaugural parades.  As I mentioned, we had a superior-rated band.  In fact, one year we went to the band festival and I, I told--it was a tough competition, and I told them that if they made superior that they could throw me in the swimming pool in my band uniform.
Speaker 1: That's how you learned to swim, huh?
Speaker 2: That's how I learned to swim.  (Laughter) So, we made superior and when we got back to the hotel, they picked me up and threw me in the swimming pool and I started to take my uniform off.  I'm also a water safe instructor and life guard, so.  I, I took my clothes off and they said, "Oh, my gosh.  He's undressing in the pool," and in the deep water and I got out and I had on my swimming trunks.  And they said, "Oh, he knew we were going to make superior.  He knew."  Well, I was pretty confident.  It was a good band.  But the main thing about those years was that I was actually grooming myself, I didn't know it, to be a college band director, both in terms of administration of a, a large band program, dealing with parents, dealing with administrative aspects of the band program, the musical aspects, designing drills, getting concert bands ready, solos and assembles.  It gave me a background to really--that really facilitated my transition to being a college band director.  I, I don't think that I would've been as successful if I had not had those tens years.  In fact, ironically also when I graduated from Florida A&M, Dr. Foster offered a position right after I graduated, but he had to change the plans because of budgetary.  Some things happened and I was not able to get the position.  I was disappointed, but had I gotten the position, I would not have had the kind of extensive knowledge to bring to the program as I did after having those ten years in high school.

Speaker 1: With the high schools, were they quote, desegregated at the time or not?  Were they mixed black and white?  Were they were still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no.  No, they, they were segregated.
Speaker 1: Even in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Even in the '60s [1960s].  I remember very well us having meetings with the band directors and, and, and the white band director would be over here, and the black bands would be over there, and there was no interaction between the two.  I think my last year as a high school band director, integration start to set in and 'til we were mixing together, we started to play the white high schools.  We had a good football team and we won championships.  We had a good band and we won championships.  When we integrated, it didn't have any negative affect on our program because our band was probably the best in Jacksonville [Florida], and we had a large band [at William Marion Raines Senior High School].  I had three hundred and fifty people in the high school band which was quite impressive.
Story_ID: 352096
Speaker 1: You received a master's degree in music.  Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: When did you do that work?
Speaker 2: I did that during summers while I was teaching at William Raines High [William Marion Raines Senior High School, Jacksonville, Florida]--at Northwestern [Northwestern Junior-Senior High School, Jacksonville, Florida] and William Raines.  I would work and then I would go to summer school at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and that was good because I could take the practical experiences of what I was doing in high school and utilized those during my classes in the summertime.  So, I had a good time.  It was quite successful in graduate school because of the experiences that I was engaging at the time at that level (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  So, your master's degree studies were in what particular area of music?
Speaker 2: In music education and specifically on how to be a band director.
Speaker 1: So, that was summer.  Okay.  Well, let's just keep going.  You also have a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: I have a Ph.D.  And so after I, I had--I was band director at William Raines High School and Northwestern for ten years.  Then Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] a year in advance said, "I want to bring you to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] next year."  Well, I've actually had mixed emotions about leaving my high school because I enjoyed teaching.  I enjoyed working with the kids and to see the kind of growth they made under my leadership, and, and I was somewhat reluctant.  Not reluctant to come to Florida A&M.  I had had offers to be band director at basically the major black colleges.  South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], Jackson State [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], and a few others, but I always declined because I just enjoyed what I was doing.  But at the time when Dr. Foster called, I said, "Well, if you're going to make a move--if you're going to go to any school, this would be the place for you to go, to return home."  One reason why I never went to any other university was because I had a good high school band, and I did not want to go through the trouble for lack of a better term of changing them to what I would want them to be.  You know, each school has their tradition and if I would come in, some of those traditions--traditional things that they did, I would not have done and I probably would've had trouble with alumni and this kind of thing.  But then coming to Florida A&M, I would be enhancing, continuing the legacy and the tradition, so.  And also too, I had done just about everything there was to do as a high school band director.  I'd been to Mexico.  We made superiors every year.  I had a great marching band, a great concert band, and it was time to look in other directions.  I could've gone into administration and been an assistant principal, a principal, but that was not what I wanted to do.  Or, I guess as I think back on it, I could've just remained a high school band director and enjoyed it.  But the call to come to Florida A&M was more than I could resist, and so I came to Florida A&M.  And one encouraging factor about coming here was the fact that I could go to Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] and work on my, on my doctorate degree, so which is what I did and I gotten a doctorate degree while working full time here at Florida A&M University.  I never took a leave of absence.  It was quite difficult, quite a challenge.  I paid quite a few parking tickets because I had to run across the street, teach a class, come back over here, take a class, teach a class, take a class, and I did that for five years.
Story_ID: 352097
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you get a doctorate degree, you have to do quote, a thesis or special project.  What was your thesis or special area of interests that you were--
Speaker 2: My dissertation was on contemporary marching band concepts as applied by selected colleges and universities in America.
Speaker 1: Say that again?
Speaker 2: Contemporary marching band concepts as applied by selected colleges and universities in the United States, which meant that I had a chance to study the major universities and that's what I wanted to do anyway, so it really wasn't a task for me.  But, what I had planned to take time off and visit all these universities.  I did UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and Minnesota [University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  I did all the Big Tens [Big Ten Conference]--all the big schools, and my college professor [at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida], Dr. Cliff Madsen [Clifford Madsen] said, "Julian [HistoryMaker Julian White], you're never finish.  It'll take too long."  So he said, "Here's a three-quarter track recorder--video recorder.  Hook it up to your television and record all the football games and do an analysis there.  Then contact the band directors and get information from them," which I did.  It was quite fascinating.  So, I, I studied the bands and again, it was about the marching band is what I was mainly interested in.  So, my dissertation, contemporary marching band concepts, is what I actually did.  I wrote a book on contemporary marching band concepts, and then I selected colleges that utilized those concepts.  And so, I have the book written.  The only thing I need to do is extract the, the college bands out and I have the text done.  I'm going to take the time to do it at some point.  I'm so busy now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give me an example of a marching band concept.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Give me a couple of examples.
Speaker 2: A concept would be dance routines.  That's a concept.  Picture formations when you see them make bolts and airplanes and all these things, that's concept picture formations.  Circle drills, you see bearers do circles.  That's a concept.  You see them doing diagonals and beautiful hexagons and those kinds of things.  That's a concept.  Squad drills, you see them interacting with each other to make formations and to make crosses and squares.  Those are concepts.  So, those are the concepts that I'd studied and certain bands utilize concepts.  The University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] utilizes circles a lot.  USC does picture formations.  Michigan, Indiana does picture formations.  Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] does dance routines.  So, it was quite an interesting study.
Speaker 1: Well, when you came to Florida A&M as the associate band director under Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster], what were the major concepts that the band at that time were using?
Speaker 2: Picture formations.  In fact really, we were doing it all and we still do it all.  I--we call it the multi-drills because we integrate all the concepts.  We do picture formations, we do circles, we do diagonals, we do squares, we do dance routines.  And that is one of the interesting things about the Florida A&M band [Marching 100], the diversity of our formations.  The diversity of our shows.  They are not boring because we'll do it all and we don't repeat shows, you know.  We, we can't do a show this week in Bragg Stadium [Bragg Memorial Stadium, Tallahassee, Florida] and then do that show next week.  Our fans, our fans won't allow it.  But the diversity of our shows--of our halftime shows apply in the different concepts and when I came here, they were--that's what they were doing.  Now what we also do is go in cycles.  Bands tend to follow us and so in recent years, I'd say over the past fifteen, twenty years, we were doing precision drills.  That is circles, squares, diamonds, crosses and those kinds of things and then everybody started to follow us.  So we said, "Let's get away from that.  Let's go all the way back to the beginning.  Let's go back to picture formations, to animated formations."  And so, that's what we do.  I just keep our, our performances quite diverse.

Speaker 1: FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] has used the band program for a lot of things.  You've raised money, of course, but tell me about how you use it to recruit students.  A lot of your recruitment strategy--I know that Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries] yesterday talked about his recruitment strategies particularly to get students into science and math (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And engineering.  Talk about the recruitment of the young people that--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Recruitment is the heart of our band program.  It is that particular function that allows us to exist, so everything that we do is directed toward recruitment.  When we play a football game--when we--let's say we go to Detroit, Michigan, we go to Atlanta [Georgia] or Miami [Florida], wherever, we have a recruitment team in the band and usually there are high school students there.  We will get their names.  We'll have the recruitment team will go into the band, take the cards, have them to fill them out.  We bring them back and put them in a database, and we start to recruit students as early as seventh, eighth, ninth grade.  Many of our band members now attended our summer band camp.  We have about five or six hundred students who come to band camp, and the grade level is grades nine through twelve.  Some students because of their interests, because of their level of maturity and physical, physical development have come to band camp as early as seventh grade.  And by the time they come to band camp six years later, they know everything that we do.  And so we have this database of about two or three thousand students that we communicate with constantly and the closer they get to graduation, the more we intensify it.  We do that.  We do visitations.  Last week, I went to Miami, Florida and visited all the high schools and auditioned students.  Next week, I'll go to West Palm Beach [Florida] and Fort Lauderdale [Florida] to recruit.  You see, recruitment is also extremely important now because there's so much competition to get the best students.  When I was in high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], there was no doubt as to where I was going to school, Florida A&M and same thing was true with athletics.  We had great football teams because they were all coach Jake Gaither's boys.  They were all William P. Foster's boys [HistoryMaker William Foster].  So they automatically came here and we--the whole time I was in college, we lost two football games and never lost a, a, a football game in our home stadium the entire time I was there.  We beat schools ninety-eight to nothing.  And so, and, and the band just got everything, but now there's competition.  There's academic competition and there's mus-, musical competition.  So, we have to recruit quite extensively and to answer your question, everything that we do is directed toward a continuation of the band.  That is the lifeblood, recruitment.
Story_ID: 352099
Speaker 1: When you responded positively to Dr. Foster's [HistoryMaker William Foster] invitation to come back and to be part of the band program [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], how had things changed over the ten years?  Were things different when you came back ten years later from the time that you graduated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did things change with the band in any way?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They had changed and that's one positive aspect of our band [Marching 100] is that we changed.  We changed with the times and by that--I mean, the, the music, the steps had changed to conform with the times, with the day, the dance steps of the day.  The music of today, even though we continued to maintain our tradition of playing the standard marches and the university standard tunes, but just the overall--the overall selection of music had changed and changes every year.  And since we are--we're always in the vanguard of, of, of selecting tunes and, and being right up front and, and being the innovator of show designs.
Speaker 1: I was reading some background material before the interview and it talked about dance as a mass activity.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'd never thought about it in those terms before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so that's what you really have in your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in your band.  You have a mass activity.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I have studied African art and culture.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And of course, African visual arts is integrated with music and dance.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, I see all that here in the band.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The African and the African American culture and values all coming together in, in the band.  And would you comment on that?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yes.  Yes, it is because we take--we take the elements of dance that actually, actually emanated from Africa, too.  There's a book that in a study was done on the band, 'Stepping the Blues' ['Steppin' on the Blues: The Visible Rhythms of African American Dance,' Jacqui Malone] and it was a--we had some individuals who actually traced the dance movement development from Africa to what we do.  And so the antecedents of our movements are all based and deeply rooted in the historical aspects of the African dance.  And so we capitalize on that.  It's, it's a--it's a massive body movement.  It's a--it's a unison body movement combined with precise instrument angles.  We don't just dance but we--if we have trumpets, they're all on the same line.  They're all turned together.  They're all at the same angle, and that gives you a precise look.  When you stop to think about the antecedent--the African dances--and as you look at a dance troupe--you know, they may have on their costume, but the spears and they're all--they're all perfectly choreographed.  There's precision in what they do and we capitalize on that same thing.  Now, many people imitate us, but they don't really know exactly what we do and how we achieve it.  So, we're not just out there dancing, we are actually employing those techniques from the African dance that has passed down from generation to generation.  And if you look at our band and look at other bands, you'll see that difference.  The precision in what we do.  The execution, the exactness of the instrument angle.  The exactness of the feet.  The exactness of the hands, and that is a distinguishing factor that can be contributed to the antecedent movements from Africa.
Story_ID: 352100
Speaker 1: How many different types of instruments are currently being used in your band [Marching 100] today?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I hadn't thought about it, but we use woodwinds, brass and percussion.  In the percussion section, we have snare drums, cymbals, base drums.  We use about twelve base drums.  They're tonal base drums.  So we use twelve base drums and we use tom-toms.  In the brass wind section, we use trumpets, horns, baritones, trombones and sousaphones.  And then in the woodwind section, we use clarinets, piccolos, and saxophones.  A distinguishing thing about our woodwind section is that we use twenty piccolos.  Normally, most bands use, uses one or two and because they are difficult to play in tune and they--that, that high pitch level can sometime be damaging.  But over the years, our band members have--our piccolo players have dev-, have developed that ability to play in tune, so they add a, a--an excellent sense of resonance to the band's tone quality.
Story_ID: 352101
Speaker 1: You've been interested in multiculturalism.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have some tenets or things that you follow to develop multiculturalism.  Would you explain all that to me and tell me your interest and how that works?
Speaker 2: I'd be happy to.  Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] is a traditional black university [HBCU].  Over the years, we have become quite integrated with white, Hispanic, and other cultures.  So we have an obligation, as is the State of Florida and the nation, so we perform for a variety of audiences, different cultures.  We may perform at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] for their Gator Growl.  We may do a performance for a Hispanic community in Miami [Florida], and here--even here in Tallahassee [Florida], even with among our students and our faculty.  So we, out of necessity and, of course, the desire to entertain our entire population, we make sure that we include music of all cultures.  We'll play Hispanic music.  We'll play music that crosses over on the Billboard charts and the top forty charts.  We will play Jewish music.  We'll play--in other words, we touch on--at some point during the year, we touch on all cultures, and we make that--that's not by accident.  We, we make it a point to do that.  We had some students to even come and ask that why--you know, some time ago, why is it that we don't play any music with Hispanic flavor and we listen to our audiences because if there's no audience, there's no need for the band.
Story_ID: 352102
Speaker 1: Some people have said that the band, not just your band [Marching 100], but other bands, too, sometimes are bigger than football.
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Yes. Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That it's the band that, that, that, that draws people and certainly the halftime performances that I see, I enjoy very much.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I enjoy it very, very much.  If they weren't on, I'd probably walk away during halftime, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that true or not?  I mean, what, to what extent do you--
Speaker 2: I, I think to the extent it is true and that's not taking anything away from the football game because without a football game, there would be no need for a band or a halftime show.  But at HBCUs, historical black college and universities, the football game is somewhat different, say from the SEC [Southeastern Conference] or the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] or the Pac 8 [Pacific-8 Conference; Pac-12 Conference].  It's a social event.  It is a fashion show.  You will find it's a big tailgate party.  There's a big--you'll find thousands of people outside the stadium, tailgating that never comes in.  And then in the football game itself, there are the fashions.  The ladies dress.  The men even dress now, and then there's the halftime show and the music.  I have heard that--no, this is a fact.  At the concessions stands at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], they don't sell very much during halftime.  They sell during the third quarter because even the concession people want to come up to see the band at halftime.  So, it's a big social event and the, the football game is the center of it, but it's everything else.  So they have a Bayou Classic in, in New Orleans [Louisiana] and they have what, seventy, eighty thousand people--seventy thousand people at that game, and it's a big--it's a big social event.
Speaker 1: I was in Atlanta [Georgia] about four weeks ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] was playing I think Delaware State [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware].
Speaker 2: Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Tennessee State?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that it?  Okay.  And on the hotels and on the subways and so on.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the party thing was going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It amazes me how people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it is amazing.
Speaker 1: --come from all over to be there for that weekend.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Several things that were going on.  So, I felt that--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --about four weeks ago.
Speaker 2: It, it is quite impressive to see all of that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was your band there that day?  Did you play in that--?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  Yes, yes.  And again it was--it was an exciting event because the fans come to see the halftime shows.  And, and they also even have a jam-, we had a jamboree the Friday night before and had thousands of people that just came to see the two bands perform.
Story_ID: 352103
Speaker 1: What was it like working under Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster]?  You came and you accepted that position.  That's why you're where you are today?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what was it like working under Dr. Foster?
Speaker 2: It was quite an honor, a distinction and a definite learning period.  Dr. Foster is a tremendous musician, administrator and organizer.  And to further (cough) my education with him, I think prepared me for everything that I do now.  He was--he was and is meticulous in his organization of the administrative aspects of the band program [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  His rehearsal techniques and the development of the marching band [Marching 100] and the concert band employs concepts that ensure success as far as fundamentals are concerned.  Marching fundamentals, musical fundamentals, tonal quality, intonation, articulation, phrase and balance, all the performance fundamentals.  He was meticulous in that.  And then his interpersonal relationships in dealing with his staff--in dealing with the students.  He served as an inspiration in terms of the music, the marching, the academics, the character building, the integrity.  All were just personified by him, so that was truly an awesome experience.  I worked with him.  I worked as his associate for twenty-five years and he retired and as far as I'm concerned, he could have sti-, he could still be here and I could still be associate because it was just a pleasure working with him.  And I also had the freedom to develop myself and to develop the band along with.  So, it was just a great experience.
Speaker 1: Well, the transition from his tenure to your present position took place in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998].
Story_ID: 351890
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], you described earlier in the interview how you prepared for your performances when you were a student [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]--when you were a member of the Marching 100 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. (Cough) Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the preparation sessions and the training now.  What, what--how do you run the preparation and the training program for the band members?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  You know, it has an adage to, if it's not broken, don't fix it. And the band is not broken, so I don't fix it, I simply continue the legacy.  So, what we do in our rehearsals we have what we call the rehearsal sequence of a band pageant, and we start off with the first is--the birth of a band pageant it starts off with ideas.  This past Sunday--well Saturday night, we had a performance at Bragg Stadium [Bragg Memorial Stadium, Tallahassee, Florida], and so that show's behind us and we're getting ready for homecoming.  So Sunday, we had a meeting with the band staff and the show planner committee, and we present ideas to each other.  We talk about the kinds of shows we want to do, the drills, the dance routine and I'd got some chicken.  We had dinner and we had a good time.  So, we get all the ideas together and then once we get the ideas, Mr. Lindsey Sarjeant, who is our arranger, starts to write the music.  He has to write the music for a concert selection, a drill, and a dance routine.  So, he has written the music for the drill, for the dance routine.  He's written the music for the concert selection.  We started on the dance routine music yesterday, and today we'll start on the concert selection music.  In the meantime, I am writing the drill, so I'll get on the computer and I'll do everything that--whatever we're going to do, circles, stars, spiral formations, and then I would give that a chart to Mr. Sarjeant and he will write the music.  So, the drill--the music is exactly coordinated to the drill, and it's all of--the drill sheets are computerized, and the music is done on computer.  So, that's the birth of, of the band pageant.  Now the rehearsal sequence of a band pageant, we start off working on the music, we get the music down, then we teach the dance routine without the music, then we add the music to it.  Then we teach the drill without the music, and then we add the music to it and we put all that together.  This is--we're now to about Wednesday.  In fact, today is Wednesday.  We're--the pace is a little bit slower now because we don't have a game this weekend, so we can go a little bit slower and can-, it won't be as intense.  But we will start working on the concert selection music today and tomorrow we'll start to work on the drill.  So as such by Friday, we will have the drill, the concert selection, dance routine all in place.  Then on Friday night, we'll have a rehearsal to pull it all together.  On Saturday morning, we'll have rehearsal to pull it all together, and then Saturday at three o'clock we meet in full-dressed uniform to warm up, tune up, and line up at what we call the rattler formation and move over to the stadium to repeat the performance again.
Speaker 1: The students put in a lot of hours--a lot of hours (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They do--they do, but actually you now, it's not as much as people think.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like it's--
Speaker 2: We do the pre-drill that's continuous nonstop practice and then once, now we practice from three--the time frame has changed over the years.  We'll practice from 3:35 to 5:40, Monday through Friday.  We still have a Friday night rehearsal and we still have a Saturday morning rehearsal.  Now, the Sunday thing that we did, that was--that's planning.  That's not the whole band.  Those are just the officers, leaders, and show plan committee along with the band staff.  So they put a lot of time in, but not as much as say we used to because see, the academic demands are more so now than before.  You got to pass a teacher's certification exam.  You got to pass a pharmacy license.  You've got to pass in architecture.  You've got to pass a class.  There are exams in every academic discipline, so we have to be very organized in what we do.  When we come to that rehearsal, everything has to be precise to the second to the minute, to the minute to the second.  The music, the drill, the dance routine because we can't--we can't waste their time and we've got to get right there.  So, even though they put a lot of mental time on it, but physically we have to limit ourselves.  We don't practice enough as far as students are concerned.  They want to practice more, but we won't let them because the emphasis has to be on the academics.

Speaker 1: Where are some of the places that the band [Marching 100] has performed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --in the last six or seven years outside the university [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and outside the football field?  Where have you taken them?  What other venues have you--have you performed in?
Speaker 2: Everywhere.  Let's see, last year we had a group that performed for the Grammys [Grammy Awards] in Los Angeles [California] with Kanye West and Jamie Foxx.  We also performed for our Super Bowl XXIX.  We do half-time shows for the Dolphins [Miami Dolphins], the Jaguars [Jacksonville Jaguars], the Falcons [Atlanta Falcons], anybody who happens to be close to Florida, we'll do--we'll do a half-time show for them.  We also do professional basketball games, basketball games.  We've done the Miami Heat, the opening for the Miami Heat, the Orlando Magic.  We've done presidential inauguration parades.  We represent the United States at the French bicentennial.  So with our marching band, we mainly decline invitations because we get so many and we just can't travel so much.  We've participated in the Honda Battle of the Bands in Atlanta, Georgia for the past four years.  We were among the inaugural bands and this is a gathering.  It's not a competition even though they call it the battle of bands.  Each band gets ten thousand dollars.  Each band gets a trophy, a huge trophy for participation.  But they are selected by popular vote by presidents, athletic directors and band directors, and we have been the flagship band for that event for the past four years.  It's a tremendous honor.  In fact, you have sixty, seventy thousand people attending the event and there's no football game, just bands.  We fill the Georgia Dome [Atlanta, Georgia].

Speaker 1: Beyond (cough) the Marching 100, you have been involved with McDonald's All American High School Band.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is that and how does that happen and what's your role there?
Speaker 2: The McDonald's All American High School Band doesn't exist anymore, but it was a tremendous honor for high school students and I believe it was--we-, from about 1979 to '89 [sic. 1980 to 1992] for ten years.  We would select the band.  They would submit tapes.  It was sponsored by McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] of course, but they would submit the tapes to us and we would evaluate them, and we would develop a marching band that represented a specific instrumentation with two students from each state in the union, the [U.S.] Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  The bands performed in Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], in Orchestra Hall [Symphony Center] in Chicago [Illinois], the New England Conservatory [Boston, Massachusetts], the Macy's Day Parade [Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade], the Fiesta Bowl parade, and the great Tournament of Roses Parade [Rose Parade] in California [Pasadena, California].  A great honor and I had the responsibility of writing the shows--of writing the drills shows for the band for ten years.  It was a distinct honor because you have this band with--these were the best musicians in the United States of America, and we would work with them for Thanksgiving for the Macy's Parade.  They'd come up say the Monday before Thanksgiving and, and work until Thanks-, until the Macy's Day Parade, and then they would come back just before the Tournament of Roses and march in that parade along with the Fiesta Bowl.

Speaker 1: The Rattlers [Florida A&M Rattlers], that is--where does that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's our symbol.
Speaker 1: Where do the Rattlers come from?
Speaker 2: The Rattlers, that is the symbol for our university.  That's our fighting symbol, and Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] is located on the highest of seven hills in Tallahassee [Florida].  Legend has it that when the campus was being built that there were quite a few rattlesnakes around, and so they adopted the name the Rattlers and it has been with us all this time.  And you know they say the Rattlers will strike, and they strike and strike again.  So, that's what we do now.  We're very proud.  It's an--it's an awesome mascot.  You know, different from say maybe a bulldog or a human being or any whatever.  You know, this snake--snakes can be treacherous and they're illusive and they are powerful, and that's what we think engenders from a name the Florida A&M University Rattlers.

Speaker 1: As a professional band leader, musician, you certainly have professional organizations that you've been a member of over the years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Would you tell us some of your professional organizational work that you've field cross the country and the world?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  Certainly.  Locally, I'm a member of the Leon County band directors.  On the state level, I'm a member of the Florida Music Educators' Association.  That is the state organization for all music teachers.  In that organization, I serve as the chairperson of the black caucus as the leader for our concerns and, and programs and historical aspects of black music educators in Florida.  I also am a member of the College Band Directors National Association.  The FCMEA which is the Florida College Music Educators Association, and the American Bandmasters Association which is really a prestigious honor because there are only about maybe three hundred band directors in the nation selected to be in that organization.  It was founded by John Philip Sousa, and so that lineage continues even to today.  I am one of three black members of the organization, and it consists of the top band directors in the nation, top composers, arrangers and teachers.  So, it's quite an honor to be a part of that organization.
Speaker 1: Who are the other black members?  You said there were three?
Speaker 2: Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] is a member and Alfred Watkins [Alfred L. Watkins], who is one of our students.  Dr. Foster was my teacher.  I was there for Watkins' teacher, and all three of us are in the American Bandmasters Association.  I'm sorry, there's one more.  Emory Fears who is retired band director of Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia].  Those are the four.
Speaker 1: But the third one, where is he a band director?
Speaker 2: He's a band director of Lassiter High School in Marietta, Georgia, which is right outside of Atlanta [Georgia].  Has the best band program in the nation--high school band program in the nation.  This past year, they performed in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and then the Tournament of Roses Parade [Rose Parade] in the same year.  Quite an honor.  Very fine--very fine band director and band program.
Story_ID: 351895
Speaker 1: Are there any college university bands today either in historically black colleges or in the predominately white colleges that try to compete with the Rattlers [Marching 100]?
Speaker 2: All of the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] do.  Last week, we had South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] to come and bring their band.  We had Winston-Salem [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] to come the week before.  Next week, we'll have--week after next we'll have Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] who will bring their band, and it's something.  You know, you're going against the champion and it's something to just get in the same ring with a champion and hope that you knock them out.  And, and in your mind, you may feel that you've got in the ring with a champion and did knock them out, but the audiences know that Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] just has a record of artistic excellence over the years.  And then--but I, I also give credit that the HBCU bands have improved tremendously over the years.  So they are competitive and, and we recognize that fact and, of course, we are in the same city with Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] and they also have a great band program over there, too.  So, it keeps us on our toes.
Story_ID: 351896
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], I think we're probably coming down to some wrap-up questions.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I want to give you an opportunity to add anything more that you'll like to add to this interview (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --that I haven't asked you about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What would you like to--things I haven't asked you that you might want to--would like to put on the interview?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Sure.  One thing about being the band director at Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] as well as the chairman of department of music is that I have a chance to interact quite a bit with faculty and staff.  And so I'm a hands-on person.  I believe in rolling up the sleeves and really getting down to the work.  I also have a tremendous staff.  I have a person who serves as the director of the piccolos, the clarinets, a separate person.  Piccolos section director, clarinet, saxophones, trumpets, horns, trombones, percussion.  I have an arranger.  I have two property managers and two secretaries, and I probably shouldn't say that too loud--too loudly because I'm probably the only band in the United States that has that kind of staff.  The facilities here at Florida A&M University almost second to none in that we have our own band drill field.  We have a band room that seats five hundred people with uniforms, instrument property, and that kind of thing.  On our band drill field, we have an auxiliary.  It's a form of bond, but we can use it on the field whenever it rains.  We have benches that we can sit on the outside.  We have music stands.  We have two forty-foot towers.  We have drinking water, cold water.  We have faucet water.  We have restrooms.  And it is an ideal rehearsal facility, and I say almost second to none because I--my daughter [Phaedra White Abbott] worked at the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas] and I saw their band drill field and it's inside a bubble with artificial turf, and so you have to say almost second to none.  But, but just the kind of support that we receive from the administration, from the university for our band program is tremendous, and the fact that no matter what, I, I write the shows and even at my age, I am still active with the band [Marching 100].  I, I like to--and I've been fortunate.  My health--I'm in pretty good health, shape physically.  I run, I either run a mile or swim a mile every day.  I ride the bicycle to work in the summertime.  So, it gives me, it gives me that opportunity to physically be there with the students.
Story_ID: 351897
Speaker 1: And then too, the family aspect of being a band director is quite demanding, and I have a three-year-old son.  He'll be three on November 7th, so that takes up some time and I have to balance my time with my family and with my work.  I enjoy so much.  I enjoy my work.  I enjoy my family, and I enjoy my work with the band [Marching 100].  And then finally, I, I don't--I never ignore the religious aspects.  I never ignore the fact that none of this would be possible without the help of God.  And so, I'm still as I said, my mother [Victoria Richo White] and my daddy [George White] made me go to church and I said I'll never going to do this anymore, but I'm still in church every Sunday.
Speaker 2: Your son's name?
Speaker 1: My son is Julian.  Julian Earl White II [Julian White II].
Speaker 2: Has he picked up an instrument yet?
Speaker 1: Yes, he has.  He's three years old, but he's quite rhythmic.  He marches with a trumpet, a toy trumpet.  We have what we call hat boys and he is a hat boy.  That is, after the band comes off the field, sometimes hats drop off and plumes drop off and we have a little crew of fellows that, that goes out there to pick them up.  And he's a hat boy along with my grandson [John Bert (ph.)].  So, my grandson actually is--my, my son is my grandson's uncle.  (Laughter) But, but yes, he is musical.  He's going to be if he decides.  He has good musical talent.  I, I can see that in him already.
Speaker 2: And your wife's name?
Speaker 1: My wife is Dennine [Dennine Mathis White], and she is also a tremendous musician.  She's a professional flautist.  She directs our flute section with the marching band.
Speaker 2: She's a flautist?
Speaker 1: She's a flautist, yes.  And she's a professional.  So, and if he picked up a little bit from her and a little bit from me and then my brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] and sisters [sic. sister Willoughby White (ph.)], he should have a pretty good musical entree to the world.
Speaker 2: All right.  And you have two daughters also?
Speaker 1: I have two daughters--
Speaker 2: Give me their names.
Speaker 1: From my first marriage, Tonja, T-O-N-J-A, Bert White [Tonja White Mathews], and she is the--she is an attorney with the department of juvenile justice here in Tallahassee [Florida], and I have a daughter, Phaedra [Phaedra White Abbott], who lives in Texas--in Austin, Texas.  She is working on her doctorate in high administration.  So they--I'm in contact with them constantly.  They check on me every minute.
Speaker 2: Anything else you want to add?
Speaker 1: I think that's it.
Speaker 2: That's it?  Okay.
Story_ID: 351898
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you have led your life?
Speaker 2: I feel great.  In fact, I would say if I passed on now, the thing that I would leave with my friends is don't shed any tears if you can help it because I was extremely happy.  I've been extremely happy, and I have been lucky in my life.  I, I have not experienced some of the difficulties.  Of course, everybody has difficulty, but I have not experienced some of the difficulties that many people--I've been very successful in my work--you know, no obstacles there in my life.  I've just--I think I've just been blessed with successes, and so I have no regrets about anything that I've done.  You know, I mentioned to you as I reflect on my life and element, I've always been a leader.  For whatever reason, I've always been a leader.  I've always achieved well academically and musically, and I think that's just fortunate because I, I--you know, I've--I have friends who for various reasons had tremendous difficulties in life and, and I've been blessed and fortunate that I've not had any of those, those kinds of difficulties.
Story_ID: 351899
Speaker 1: For young people today, high school students, college students who want to move into your field as a music educator, band director, what advice do you have to the young people?  For example, in the band today, who may want to be a band director?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What advice do you have?
Speaker 2: My advice to them would be to develop what I call three Ms.  Mentally if you want to be musicians, you're going to have to really develop a mental capacity, the drive, the tenancy to succeed.  Meaning, you're going to have to practice on whatever your major performing area is, and you're going to have to have yourself mentally prepared.  The discipline, the mental discipline to attend classes, to get assignments, excuse me, to be your own person, and then the musical aspects of it.  You're going to have to prepare yourself musically.  You've got to study.  Music is an art.  It is also a science as much as being an engineer or a doctor, and you've got to learn all the scientific facts related to music.  You've, you've got to be a scholar of the, of, of what I, you gotta be a musical scholar of a game in order to be successful in the music field.  And then the next aspect, I, I say mentoring.  You got to study with--and you got to pay attention and observe role models.  If I can be a role model to anybody, Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster] was my role model, and you've got to look at individuals and, and have a chance to study with them.  When I was in graduate school [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] as a youngster--as a young college--young band director, you would see me in a rehearsal watching the giants, the prolific composers, the prolific band directors, watching what they did.  And then it is an honor now for those individuals who I've watched to be a member of the American Bandmasters Association and be associated with them.  My first meeting with the ABA, American Bandmasters Association, was just awesome because here are these giants.  I'll say John Philip Sousa.  He wasn't there, but the likes of John Philip Sousa, and here I am among them.  So, that kind of mentoring and they didn't know--I tell some of them now, "You didn't know there was a little black guy over there watching what you were doing and picked up everything he could from you."  So, you get yourselves mentally prepared, musically prepared and mentor.  Those three Ms I pass on. I, I, I, I admonish those individuals interested in entering this profession to follow through with.
Story_ID: 351900
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: I want to write books.  I want to record.  It's what we're doing now.  I want to record what I'm doing for future generations because if there's one thing I didn't do that I haven't done, I have not--I have preserved it, but I have not made it available.  And so if God gives me some more time, that's what I would like to do.  After I retire, and even I, I actually need to start doing that now.  I need to just--I need to gather the materials and, and, and make sure that is available.  I need to--I want to do more clinics.  I want to do more lectures and that kind of thing rather than continuing in the battlefield forever.  I want to sort of come from the outer fringes and do more teaching and passing that--passing that knowl- knowledge on.
Speaker 1: You have done clinics.  Have you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I do clinics extensively.
Speaker 1: You still do?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: What is the nature of your clinics?
Speaker 2: I do clinics on rehearsal techniques, on marching and concert band rehearsal techniques.  On the marching aspects, how do you go about putting a show together?  What are the elements that you have to consider in order to have an effective halftime show?  What are the musical aspects that must be emphasized and integrated into the rehearsal of a marching band and then with concert bands?  What do you--how do you obtain good tone quality, good intonation, the ability to play in tune, good ensemble blend, and balance and precision of execution?  How do you go about selecting literature for your band that will be appropriate to, with what the level of musicians that you have?  How do you organize the band program in terms of the structure itself, the rehearsal sequences?  Those kind of things because they can be quite difficult for our youngsters, as well as those who've been in the field for quite some time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The clinics are for who?  Who are the audience?
Speaker 2: The, the clinics are for--they go both ways--for band directors to teach them how to be better band directors, and also to high school students and middle school students to teach them how to be better musicians and how to better prepare themselves for our performances.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You do those across the country or primarily (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: You do.
Speaker 2: Across the country.
Story_ID: 351901
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?  Because you talked about wanting to do some writing and why is history important?
Speaker 2: I think history is so important because in order for you to shape the future, you need to have direct knowledge of your roots.  You need to have direct knowledge of what happens in the past, and many times individuals take history for granted.  It's so easy to lose artifacts.  Even families don't realize how important it is to keep a Bible, to record births, deaths, significant events.  Institutions sometimes don't realize just how important it is to do what we're doing now just to preserve the historical artifacts of a particular institution, a family, an event, because those things can disappear so fast.  And not just in fires, but as time evolves, death.  When you lose loved ones, they take away a certain amount of history with them.  And we mentioned family reunions.  We have family reunions, with, with, with us and our family constellation has changed so much over the past, let's say, ten years that all the grands--the grandparents and grandaunts and granduncles are gone and we have moved into now, we are the uncles and the granduncles and the grandparents.  I am and my brothers [Alvin White and Ernest White] and all--and all of us.  We are those and then our kids are in places that--in positions in the constellation where we were and their kids.  So it, it perpetuates the life cycle but if you don't preserve it, before you know it, it's gone.
Story_ID: 351902
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Julian White], how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as an individual who loved the profession of music enough to share it with his colleagues and even more significantly, with his students.  I would like to be remembered as a caring individual, as a knowledgeable individual who had some impact on the lives of the students who I taught.  I would like to also be remembered as an individual who had an impact on the band movement in America.  We're blessed and we're fortunate in that we have--the band movement in America is more significant than anywhere else on the planet earth.  And I do hope that some of the concepts that I have been able to inculcate with my students and with the bands that I have directed will go down in history and, and that we will see other--that others will remember the fact that Julian White did this, or Julian White created this particular concept, or Julian White furthered this.  I'm not so much interested in the glorious aspects of what Julian White did, but more so in the fact that he had an impact on the musical world, and he had an impact on individuals and that they will pass that legacy down for generations to come.
Story_ID: 351903
Speaker 1: Now that is a picture of my [paternal] grandmother, Mrs. Florence Marie White--no, not--Mrs. Marie White, and myself at age three.  It was taken at Wings photo studio [ph.] in Jacksonville, Florida on Beaver Street across from the Old Stanton High School [Jacksonville, Florida].  I remember that.  I remember putting on that white suit vividly and going with my grandmother to take that picture.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my grandson, John Julian Bert [ph.].  He is now nine years old.  He's one--he is one of the hat boys with the Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] marching band [Marching 100].  He goes out on the field and picks up hats at the end of the halftime show, and he's a good academian as well as a good athlete and a good musician.
Speaker 2: That one's going to need to come out of the frame. Okay. We got it. Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my daughters, Tonja White [Tonja White Mathews] in the background, and Phaedra White [Phaedra White Abbott] in the front.  The picture was taken I would say, in approximately 1989.  They--Tonja is an attorney in Jack-, in Tallahassee, Florida with the department of juvenile justice, and Phaedra is a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Next photo, please.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my family.  Dennine White [Dennine Mathis White], my wife, and my son, Julian Earl White II [Julian White II], and, of course, myself.  The picture was taken at about 2005.  He was a year old when that picture was made.
Speaker 2: We're getting glare on the glass on that one also. Big improvement. Okay.
Speaker 1: It's ironic I have on the same outfit there that I have on now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, next. Let's look back 'cause I want to do each one individually.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Where do you want me to go?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): What'd you want me to do?
Speaker 2: Rotate it 90 degrees and I'll do each one individually so the widest part would be that way.  Okay. And we're doing to bottom one first.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a picture of myself as the head drum major with the Florida A&M band and it was taken in 1961 in Bragg Memorial Stadium [Tallahassee, Florida].  The next picture is--okay.  This is a picture again of myself leading the clarinets off the field at the end of the half-time show.  This was made in 1961, also at the Florida A&M University, Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] football game.  The clarinet player that's following me is James Bowman [ph.] from New Orleans, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Good.  That's it? This is the last one.
Speaker 1: Okay. This is a picture of the Grammy band.  These students performed this past January at the Grammy Awards and were featured with Jamie Foxx and Kanye West, a proud moment of Florida A&M band.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen- I'm sorry, 2005.
Speaker 2: Very good. Talk about the uniform or whatever you want to say.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is one of three uniforms that the Florida A&M University drum majors wear.  In addition to this orange uniform, they have a green--basically green uniform, and then they have an all white trimmed in orange and green.  All of them are trimmed in orange, green and white.  The major feature of the uniform, if you notice, is the proximity, proximity of the rattlers.  How they're all in striking position and on the trousers they're there and on the sleeves, so with the marching style that they have, anytime they move, you can see those rattlers and it's a--it's as if they're striking.  When they lift their legs, you have all those little rattlers that are in a striking position and then when they're conducting and moving the left hand, you see those larger rattlers in the striking position.
Speaker 2: What's the age of this?
Speaker 1: This uniform here is about twenty years old, but we still maintain that, that particular color scheme on the three uniforms.  It's exact duplication.
