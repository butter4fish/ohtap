Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: George Bernard Davis, G-E-O-R-G-E B-E-R-N-A-R-D Davis, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Now I have to ask you, is there a story behind the name George Bernard Davis?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  My mom was not literary so it's not George Bernard Shaw but it could have been.  It could have been, I don't know.  When I grew older I read George Bernard Shaw because of that and found that I liked him because he broke tradition, he thought for himself and so it was a good role model when I entered journalism, literature and education to think about but I had no idea whether that--it could have been.  Could have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the combination though would have been something that she may have heard even though she (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Now my dad could have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my dad went to Garrett Seminary in Chicago out of Northwestern [Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois] and so he was an educated man and he knew about such things.  So he could have come up with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Shaw is somebody that would be read by seminarians too because of his--
Speaker 2: Oh that--
Speaker 1: --he deals with the concept of God and all that.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  So you helped me discover something about my past.  Because yeah, he was--he entered the seminary during the depression.  And here was a poor guy from Baltimore who went out there and though everything was in uproar during the depression, he still got into seminary and he finished.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He had gone to Morgan Academy and Morgan College over in Baltimore [Maryland].  Most people don't know, Morgan Academy, there used to be a high school there also.  And he went there, then he went out there and that's where he met my mom and they got married in Chicago [Illinois].  And so that is part of you know the background that I came from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now I'm going to get to all that but I'm just trying to introduce you right now.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, but I just wanted to kind--ask you about a story about your name and I think yeah, it may--it's a good chance it is (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't think of the George Bernard Shaw connection for my dad having gone to seminary.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 11/29/39 [November 29, 1939], and its Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: Let's say.  I'd say I'm a professor emeritus, an author.  Title and occupation and I'm--those would be the two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?  It's the 19th of May, 2014.
Speaker 1: Malcolm X's birthday [May 19, 1925].
Speaker 2: Is it?  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You are a historian.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C., not too far from the White House.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's only a couple of blocks over.
Story_ID: 106159
Speaker 1: All right.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow, I have a lot of them.  I'm kind of a foodie.  If I were going to pick a favorite, well collard greens when they're done right.  Not when I do them.  (Laughter).  I do them fairly well, but well-cooked collard greens are hard to beat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would say blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have loads of those.  There's an African proverb that says, "You are not in the world, the world is in you, in your consciousness."  And so since my explorations are in spirituality, I like that one because it does say to me that anything that is in the world that is not blessed is something that is in you that is not blessed.  And so if you carry around all this stuff in the world, you're actually part of it or it's part of you.  There are all sorts of things that came out of my study of anthropology and African spirituality that would contribute to my favorite phrase.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there are some old things that came out of African American history because I'm a phrase master.  I like phrases because they help you to get through your day.  They're something to say to keep your mind off of things you don't want your mind on.  So I would say that ones that come from African and African-American history kind of guide me.  They keep my mind refreshed.
Story_ID: 106160
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  We're going to talk about your mother's side first and then your father's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Her name is Winnie.  Her maiden name is Ross, R-O-S-S, then of course Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1912, in rural Georgia.  There's a little town called Flovilla, not far from Jackson, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Flovilla, how do you spell--?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, like F-L-O, and it's a Villa, V-I-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's south of Atlanta.  She was born in the country down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: But her folks, a lot of them came from the Sea Islands and so by--
Speaker 1: These islands like, well like Sea Island, St. Simon [sic, these are the Golden Isles of Georgia]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, off of the coast there--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --where Gullah and Geechee live because you know there are ways in which my mom look kind of like a Gullah or Geechee.  And I--
Speaker 1: Now what would--since you said that, how would you describe that look?
Speaker 2: The people out there mixed a lot with Native Americans.  She is very dark but she has straight hair and it was not only the look.  When I was younger, I tried to understand why she was so stoic and many, many African Americans are very verbal.  And my father was very--and she didn't say much at all and so I kind of attributed that to the fact that she may have been a mixture of Native American.  However, when she was dying, she asked me in a very strange way, George, where are my people?  They're way over in the Sudan.  Now she didn't know a great deal about the Africans who came from this region, that region or the other region and so I thought it was one of those statements that just came to her, because her features were not like my father's.  My father was definitely West African in features.  But my mom could very well have been in the Sudan, you know further up.  People who look more like Hausa or Fulani or those people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, so your family has a tradition of being--from her side from the Sea Islands.  Was she born in the Sea Islands?
Speaker 2: No, she was born in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --rural Georgia, south of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, she was born in Flovilla or near Flovilla.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But the tradition is her people came from (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah that's where I hear that they came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about when they came?  Did they come during slavery or after or what?
Speaker 2: The stories that I know is that they moved back and forth for a while from Georgia because the Sea Islands would be oh, sixty, seventy miles the other way.  But I know that at the turn of the century they had a--the family had a small store in Flovilla.  And the family Ross had accumulated a lot of land and so when I was growing up my Uncle Archie was about the largest landowner, black or white, in the county.  My mother was not living there at the time.  We'd come down from Maryland, West Virginia or Virginia to stay with Uncle Archie and he had all this land.  He was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your mother--are there any stories about the Islands that are passed down to family?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any stories about that.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: My mother didn't say much, stern, strict.  My father did all the talking.
Story_ID: 106161
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask you this, it seems like a terrible thing to ask now after you said that.  But what did your mother say about growing up?  I know it wasn't much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  My mother was a disciplinarian, no foolishness, very seldom said much.  You know the only time she was really, really animated was when we would sit on the porch and she would begin talking about how my father courted her in Chicago [Illinois].  And she would get up from the swing on the porch and show us how much father used to dance and of course his being a preacher and we being little boys, we thought that was very funny because the only dancing my father did that we saw was you know holy dance in church.  And she would say, Reverend Davis used to get way down low and come across the floor at you.  And that used to tickle us like crazy because we used to imagine what the courtship was in Chicago because there was no way else to imagine it.  So she did become animated you know, she would get up and show how my father danced.  That was the only time she demonstrated like he was an animated man who talked a lot and was very demonstrative, but she wasn't.  She watched and guided and she was really the center of the family.  When I learned anthropology and it tried to ascribe matrilineal to African families, they're not.  They're matrifocal which is a very different thing.  There was no doubt that my father was the father of the family and that sort of thing, but I have four brothers so there were five of us in the house, plus him and this one woman, my mother.  And so she was the center of the family and she ran the house.  Like, there were domains.  She ran the house.  For example, my father would say, you boys stuff scuffling in your mother's house or we're all going to be put out doors.  Or, back in those days there were always a room or two in the house where nobody could go in, they were only for company.  And he would always warn us about going into one of those rooms.  It was her domain and he gave up the dominance.  That's not the right word.  I could think of another word if I tried real hard, but that will give you an idea of what I mean.
Speaker 1: Authority over the--
Speaker 2: That--authority over that, yeah.  I always thought she had more authority over us than he did because she spanked and he didn't.  And she would always warn us that, wait till your father comes home.  And sometimes we'd be glad when he did come home because he wouldn't hit.  But my mom, she would put something on you and what would happen is our dad, he would talk and talk and talk and talk.  And so sometimes you would rather get your lick and get on out and play.  So I guess she knew what she was doing when she punished you by letting him come home, talk to you about spirituality, talk to you about a lot of things, talk to you about stuff you didn't really want to hear.  You wanted to go out and play.  And so you'd sit there and so it was punishment enough even though he never hit anybody.
Story_ID: 106162
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So we're getting way ahead and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --in some ways.  But I was trying to get a sense for what it was like for your mother growing up, what her aspirations were, what was going on in the society around her when she was growing--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, I don't want to get ahead again.  Parents in those days protected their children from a lot of bitterness.  I knew that my mom, I learned that my mom left Georgia because she was slapped on an elevator when she was very young, but she never told any of us.
Speaker 1: Mom, so--
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: I would assume that she was slapped by a white person?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a white person on an elevator and she never told any of us and I just figured out later that she didn't want us to be bitter.  But it made her unwilling to go back to Georgia.  She would send us down to stay with her brother but she wouldn't go and I didn't learn about this from her.  I learned it from my wife, she told my wife.  So in--she provided for us an atmosphere in which we felt very safe.  I have no memories of ever being poor even though we were because you know we always had plenty to eat.  And you know, make one piece of meat, put some gravy on it, potatoes, collard greens and all of that, you have a good meal.  So she was mysterious in a lot of ways, much less open than my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she moved from Georgia to where?
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Chicago.
Speaker 2: When--my wife told me when this white man struck her on the elevator, slap, slapped her on the elevator, she left right away.  And if--
Speaker 1: How old was she?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: She was early teens.  And if you knew how proud and disdainful she was, you could imagine how it must have been for a woman like that to be slapped.  But I knew she had some sort of anger but it never came out, never.  But it was always channeled in a way that we never knew exactly what it was until she told my wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she comes up as a teen and did she join some other family members in Chicago, who were already (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had a sister out there and so she went out there and stayed, not far from Michigan Avenue and--because when my brother did some research on the family we have the house where she stayed.  And then my father was over in Evanston with--at Garrett [Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois]] and they met.  And obviously they did some clubbing which we, you know--I found hard to imagine.
Speaker 1: At the time that your parents met what was your mother doing?  Was she in school or was she working or--?
Speaker 2: She was working as a domestic.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So--
Speaker 2: And then I had heard something about doing some work at Marshall Field's [Marshall Field & Company]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because that was like the dominant department store in Chicago at the time.
Speaker 1: Right, that's the flagship store, that's the one.  So let me ask you this, did your mother ever share with you or did anybody else talk about what her ambitions were, I mean what her dreams were, what she wanted to do with her life?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't speak about that.  But she could communicate things to you and if you were pretty sharp, and I was a pretty sharp little kid and I could pick things up.  For example, you got out of chores if you were reading a book. And so of course if you don't want to chop wood or do that, you'd pick up a book.  Now my brothers used to claim that I wasn't actually reading but I was actually getting out of work and perhaps some of that is true because to taunt them, sometimes I'd put the book upside down, you know hold the book like that.  And then they would try to get me to, momma to give me some work to do and she would say, leave him alone, he's reading.  But she was ambivalent about going over into the integrated world, I know that.  But my father was an integrationist, she was not that much of an integrationist.  But she wanted--I interpreted that she wanted me to learn and she silently prepared me for whatever it is I was going to do.
Story_ID: 106163
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I want to leave that right here for now and go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Clarence Davis, Sr.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eighteen Ninety Six [1896], June 17th.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: See, I'm not exactly sure of that date but that's about--I know it was 1896.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family? How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: My father was the grandson of an escaped slave named Henry Davis who escaped from North Carolina in the 1850s, came to Baltimore and became a preacher among free blacks in Baltimore [Maryland].  Baltimore was called the Port of Hope because a lot of slaves escaped to Baltimore.  And Baltimore's population, black population was actually ten times more free blacks than it was slaves.  There were about 25,000, at the time of the Civil War, about 25,000 free blacks in Baltimore and only about 2,100 slaves.  And so he became a preacher among the--a lot of these free blacks in Baltimore were dock workers and so he became a preacher among those.  And then he had a son named George Davis who obviously I was named for and he was a preacher.  And he pastured in various churches in Baltimore.  Now see with George Davis it was all after slavery.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination, were they in the same denomination?
Speaker 2: Methodist.
Speaker 1: The Methodist, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Just straight up Methodist or AME or--?
Speaker 2: They were straight up Methodists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So they were in the Methodist church, okay.
Speaker 2: And then of course Reverend George Davis, my grandfather had sons and my father was his eldest son.  And he had oh about five or six girls and two boys and nearly all, well all of them grew up in Baltimore until he went away to Garrett.  Now he was the only one who went to Morgan Academy which was a high school and then he went to Morgan College.
Speaker 1: Now, that's what's now Morgan State University, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then it was Morgan College and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For a long time it was Morgan College.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Morgan Academy and then Morgan College.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now this is--a lot of the black colleges when they started off had a high school component, some still do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, well Morgan had one.  And it was not out there where it is now.  It was Downtown Baltimore and I think the academy might have been in the basement of Sharp Street Church, which was one of the prominent churches in Baltimore at the time.  I'm not sure about that but that's what my feeling is.
Speaker 1: Hmm, Sharp Street Church.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 106164
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your father-- father was a minister.  So I take it he was fairly--he's the third generation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's third generation.
Speaker 1: Of ministers.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I used to say that I have more ministers in my family than anybody in America.  My brother is a minister, oldest brother, I married a minister's daughter, her mother was an evangelist in the Church of God and Christ, I have two cousins who are ministers and I'm just, I've been surrounded by them.  I was when I was coming up, there was some aspiration that I would be a minister but I didn't follow ministry in the church itself.  But sometimes I think of my professional life as a ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now your father, did he have a--any stories about his upbringing or his aspirations and goals and, or conflicts coming up?
Speaker 2: My father had a very, very easy disposition.  He's a very, what you might call a good man, a lot of kindness in his heart.  And we used to have a little group, me and my two oldest brothers.  I played the clarinet, my next oldest brother played the trumpet and my oldest brother played the trombone.  And my father used to take us around to all of these churches and we were not that good.  In fact, we, all except my oldest brother were kind of bad.  But my father was so proud of us you know and my mom would say, Reverend Davis really loves his boys because he would take the boys to these churches and I'm sure the people in the churches didn't want to hear anything more of what we had because we weren't good at all.  But he would say, "If the lord is willing, we'll have the boys give us another selection." And I'll bet people said, "Oh my god we got to listen through (laughter) another."  Because me and my next oldest brother, the one with the trumpet and me with the clarinet, we could never master those instruments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you did go around and it was part of the--?
Speaker 2: It was part of his ritual because in those days a church community was kind of like a tribal existence.  Everything revolved around the church.  And my father used to preach one place, rural place in the morning and then have another rural place to preach at three o'clock and then sometimes another service at night at another church.  And so we used to go around, we had to spend all day in church on Sunday which of course you know as young boys we really didn't like.  But my mom was kind of strict on that.  We did have to stay indoors when sometimes the other kids were out in the churchyard playing.  But--and we had already heard the sermon the morning they--because sometimes he would use the same you know services.  But the reason why they thought I was going to be a preacher and I've heard some people who claim to have the calling, they can do this.  I could do it when I was very young.  I can recite scripture without any consciousness of memorizing it.  It just flows through.  I could hear my father say it and then where I'd be in the back of the car sitting between my two brothers and I could say, "I would lift up mine eyes unto the Lord from whence cometh my help, my help cometh from who made the heaven and earth," [Psalm 121:1] right?  And then I'd see my mom nudge my father so I know that it was pleasing them I say.  And so I would just recite these verses and I don't have consciousness of memory.  And in storytelling I don't have consciousness of memory.  In writing I don't have consciousness of memory.  What I have--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --consciousness of is a flow through that when I came to the Washington Post for example--
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute, we don't want to get too far--
Speaker 2: Yeah, don't get--
Speaker 1: --you know out there, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 106165
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I want to, we want to save those other points--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for a little bit later but I want to take you back to when your parents met.  Now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Just in Chicago [Illinois], those little things that my mom used to say about how my father used to dance and--
Speaker 1: Did she meet him in church or what?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure exactly where she met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only detail that sticks with me is the idea that they used to go clubbing in Chicago because you know, Cottage Grove [Avenue] at that time they had all sorts of clubs along there.  And so when I learned more about Chicago night life, I used to imagine my mom, this very austere, stern woman and my father, I could imagine him easier than I could her.  But when she wanted to have some fun, she would get up and she would imitate him dancing.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And that was one of the big joys of our life.
Speaker 1: So they would have met then in the '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: The '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: The 1920s, okay.
Speaker 2: They would have met in the 1920s, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So she would have, 1920s, she would have been a teenager I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little more than a teenager, yeah.
Speaker 1: A little yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Not much more. Yeah, and your father would have been a little bit older than her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was older.
Speaker 1: And what, about how many years?
Speaker 2: About oh, thirteen, fourteen years something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And so I didn't know much about their life in Chicago.  I knew something about Marshall Field's [Marshall Field & Company] and I know she used to work there.  I know she used to work for a white family as a domestic.  What else?  Not much else.
Story_ID: 106166
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were any of your--now how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have four brothers.
Speaker 1: Were any of them born in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  After my parents, after my dad graduated, they moved back to Baltimore [Maryland] and my oldest brother, Clarence, Jr., was born in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father was at, in seminary in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, in Evanston [Illinois] out in--
Speaker 1: Garrett [Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois], you said.
Speaker 2: Garrett which was part of Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right okay, all right.  So, all right, so they--he gets his degree there and then they go back?
Speaker 2: Go back to Baltimore and my--
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about Garrett, about what's going on there and--?
Speaker 2: Except when he used to bore us to death by talking, he used to speak Greek and Hebrew and all of those languages that you had to learn in analyzing things.  He would analyze, and from the Greek we have this and from the Hebrew we have this and you're sitting there, you want to go play ball.  And you're sitting there and so you really wished maybe if your mom had whacked you, you'd be out of here by now.  But that was the punishment.  He was a very learned man and he just enjoyed his boys even when they didn't enjoy him because he used to talk when you wanted to do something else.
Story_ID: 106167
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, their talents, their interests, the way they walk, they way they talk, what they look like, who you do think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I look kind of like my father, my personality is like my father, but was--my personality and ambitions and things are most influenced by my mother.  My mother had a bigger influence, but her influence was kind of like the influence I guess she had on her husband.  She kind of toned things down and made them practical.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was the stabilizing (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh very much so, very much so.  And so I'm not much like her at all.  But she influenced me greatly.
Story_ID: 106168
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now can you name your siblings, beginning with the oldest and--
Speaker 2: Clarence--
Speaker 1: --put yourself in order.
Speaker 2: Clarence, Jr. is three years older than I am.  He was born in '36 [1936].  He's a preacher now.  Vernon is two years older than I am [1937] and he's retired.  Then I was born in '39 [1939], and then there is Burton who was born in '42 [1942], and he was born in a town called Waynesboro, Virginia.  And then there is my youngest brother Earl who was born in '45 [1945].  He was also born in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is--now Clarence is a minister?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, he's a minister.
Speaker 1: Junior.  What about Vernon, Burton and Earl?
Speaker 2: Vernon was to start with, an IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] executive.  When I did some oral history back in the '60s [1960s], I was doing something called First and I was interviewing the first black to do this and the first black to do that.  And Vernon was one of the first blacks to go into IBM.  And, but then he start--came out and did some other things, started businesses, got into sales and so he's probably the most business-oriented of us.  And then Burton just below me, he was one of the first scientists at Bell Laboratories back when Bell Laboratories was owned by AT&T.
Speaker 1: Now that's significant.  There were not that many black scientists at Bell then.
Speaker 2: Not that many when he came there and he was a--
Speaker 1: Bell was the top of the--
Speaker 2: Top of the heap.
Speaker 1: --for science.
Speaker 2: Back then it was even more so the top of the heap.  He has a Ph.D. in solid state physics.  And so he--well was a scientist until he retired.  And like I was talking about First, he was one of the first.  And so through these, my brothers, I could get to who actually was the first and I used to interview.  And then my youngest brother was a carpenter and the carpenters' union [United Brotherhood of Carpenters] in Washington, D.C., was fairly racially segregated and he was one of the first carpenters in the union back here in Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 106169
Speaker 1: It was very strange.  My father--not strange but this is a characteristic of it.  My father was an integrationist.  My mother was silent on it, very mistrustful of the outside world, the white world.  And--but she knew that--what was coming.  And so she--my father was the pusher, pushed into that but our personalities were structured more by her because the perseverance and the strength and that sort of thing to do those things came, it seemed to me, from her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was a nice combination.  The relationship between the two of them, it was a good relationship because if both of them had been like either one of them was, we wouldn't have gotten the combination of characteristics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If I'd been like my father I'd been much more flighty.
Story_ID: 106170
Speaker 1: Now, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memories come from what is a spiritual tradition because--we'll talk about it later.  But I always had the sense that I fell from the sky.  And when I used to get mad at my mom I would tell her to send me back to the sky where I came from.  And so--
Speaker 1: When did you start feeling like that?
Speaker 2: When I was real young.  I don't know how I got that feeling. I was absolutely sure that I came from the sky.  And this is not necessarily related to heaven or religion or anything like that.  But probably the reason why I became a flying officer in the military was I used to lay out in an open field where I couldn't see the horizon and look up at the sky.  And so those are early memories and I used to wonder, what in the world was up there and that I'd come from up there somehow.  And that is more spiritual than religious even though my family is religious, I just felt that connection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in some ways I was a strange little kid.
Speaker 1: Well that's, you know one is curious about what's going on, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 106171
Speaker 1: Now can you describe the--now you grew up in Baltimore [Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: No, no, I grew up in rural areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I-Wheeling [Virginia] was the only city I ever lived in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your parents--
Speaker 2: Grew up in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: All right.  They came to Baltimore--they went back to Baltimore--
Speaker 2: Balt--from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And one of your brothers is--
Speaker 2: Was born there, yeah.
Speaker 1: --then they moved to Virginia?
Speaker 2: These rural churches.  My father's ministry was among rural people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was assigned by the bishops to rural churches?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I think he preferred--he had one church in Baltimore [Maryland] once.  He had a church in Washington, D.C., once.  But--and my next oldest brother was born in Richmond [Virginia] which was a pretty important city at that time.  But other than that, once I was born they were all rural churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were growing up in rural Virgin--in--
Speaker 2: Virginia, Maryland and--
Speaker 1: --Virginia and Maryland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now Annapolis [Maryland] which is a good sized town now, I lived there but when I lived there Annapolis was just a little town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was almost rural.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up considering all these places?
Speaker 2: Food, hunting with my father.  He used to take the three oldest boys with him fishing.  I should say fishing instead of hunting because he never shot anything.  But fishing, absolutely clean rooms that you couldn't enter in my mother's house.  But a kitchen that was always you know good food cooking, board dinners at church, board dinner--if you had to stay at church all the time the women in the church would bring food and lay it out on these long tables and it was a feast of plenty.  In the middle of all of what we considered being poor, we didn't consider it being poor then, but later on you think of it as poor.  I remember the smell of all of that food and you know you'd have about three different kinds of macaroni and cheese and three different kinds of collard greens, three different kinds of fried chicken, three different kinds of this and that.  And being a preacher's kid, I could get to the front of the line and I could pick you know this woman's sweet potatoes I liked, and this woman's, and potato salad I liked.  And so that's probably the sight and sound of you know corn pudding, man just couldn't imagine.  And so I know that the poverty was there but I remember the plenty and the plenty is associated with smells.
Story_ID: 106172
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right, now well, tell us about, now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Sunset Hill Elementary School was a one room school up on Sunset Hill outside of Strasburg, Virginia.  One room for all of the black kids and what I enjoyed most about it was I was in the class with my two oldest brothers.  And being a little smart aleck I could hear what their assignments were.  And when--if they ever came home and told my mom that they didn't have homework, I knew what their homework was.  And so I used to--they used to try to beat up on me but I got very fast, I could run.  I would tell mom, no, they got this to do and they got that to do.  One of the big advantages of one room schools is that you could proceed at your own speed.  That if you're in the first grade and there is all the other grades in there with you, you can listen and if you catch on, you catch on.  I used to catch on just to, with my two brothers.  One was two years ahead and one was three years ahead.  And they were very strict, those schools and they gave you a good education even though there was not that much equipment.  And the teacher knew your parents because as I said, it was kind of a tribal existence and they would go to the church and so you had to kind of behave and be on your Ps and Qs, because the teacher would see your mom and dad on Sunday and so you were wrapped around by a community.  And as I'll say later on about tribal existence when I went to Africa is where I got the idea that I was actually part of a tribe and actually, they used to call my father, Chief.  And then they'd have the camp meetings and Native Americans would come to the camp meeting.  A camp meeting is when you have the church outside under the trees--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and people from other churches would come and there'd be food, it would be almost like a county fair or something like that.  And then the Native Americans would come along with different kinds of things that they would sell.  And then there were gypsies in the south at that time and there would be some gypsies on the edge of the camp meeting you know and we used to tease each other about the gypsy taking you off with them and that sort of thing.  So it was an interesting existence and those are the things I remember from it.  There was bad stuff but I tend not to carry that very well to--
Speaker 1: You mean in terms of racism and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh yeah, there was racism, oh definitely there was racism.  But it didn't affect me as much as the good times and that's been true all of my life.  I have not been able to get into that, in victimhood I think is a scourge of our community, a sense of hanging onto that.  And I am thankful that I shed it.
Story_ID: 106173
Speaker 1: So you started school at Sunset Hill [Elementary School in Sunset Hill, Virginia], but now where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: Then there were other schools in rural Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to African American schools all the way up to the tenth grade, ninth grade.  And then Wheeling, West Virginia right after the '54 decision [May 17, 1954, Brown v. Board of Education], Wheeling didn't take any time at all to integrate schools.  And so in 1955, I went to Wheeling High School, there were four of us who integrated Wheeling High School.  It was not one of those eventful integrations like the ones that took place in the South where kids were subjected to all sorts of mob violence and this sort of thing. It was fairly easy and of course Wheeling is up South, very far up South.  Wheeling is closer to Ohio and Pennsylvania than it is even to the rest of West Virginia and so that was easy.  Then me and ten other students integrated the schools in Baltimore [Maryland].  Baltimore at the time was the largest segregated, legally segregated school system in the country.
Speaker 1: Let me go back a second--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --to Wheeling high school.  You're like 16?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, I was about 15 or 16.
Speaker 1: Fifteen or sixteen.  And during this period of time, had you been a good student up to this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was always a good student.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so I didn't have any problem at Wheeling.  You know there were racial things but I don't tend to hang onto to those very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they don't bother you now at all.
Speaker 2: They bother me but I don't carry them around with me.  I just don't like to.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a story about--for instance for the sake of history, just tell us a story.
Speaker 2: Oh, back then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What--?
Speaker 2: Oh.  I was in the band and--
Speaker 1: This is at Wheeling, right?
Speaker 2: Wheeling.  And we were going into the stadium and somebody said, "Last one into the stadium is a black nigger."  It was, it wasn't traumatic.  I didn't like it, but I do have a quick trigger in terms of fighting and once the fight is over, I go on about my business.  And that was the way it was see, because in Baltimore I had fights in school that were related to race.  But if I had gone to black school, I would have had fights.  These were just racial fights and so at Wheeling, that was one thing I remember.  Other than that, not much at Wheeling at all.
Speaker 1: Now were there many other black students there?
Speaker 2: There were four.
Speaker 1: Four and--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my oldest brother Vernon and two other kids.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Because as I said, my father was, being a minister was an integrationist and he was very insistent about breaking down those barriers in the towns.  And so he put me and my brother into Wheeling High School.
Story_ID: 106174
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So Wheeling, Wheeling High School [Wheeling, Virginia], this is--now had, up to this point had you had any significant teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a woman in the fifth grade named Mrs. Gwatney [ph.] who I totally disliked because she made me do my work and she conspired with my mother to make sure that I got my work done.  And I was always plotting to get away from there because I didn't--as I said they are responsible for my education and my structured personality.  I am a wanderer.  I like to wander around, I like to take it easy and stuff like that.  So I would say, this is a strange thing.  Not a strange thing but a significant thing about the way teachers were back then.  Mrs. Gwatney and my mother took me off to college when I was seventeen, and she was my fifth grade teacher.  So she knew me all the way from fifth grade, even though my parents had moved to other towns until I went off to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So as far as mentors were concerned, my father was very educated and I used to admire him.  And he could speak Greek and he could speak Hebrew and I thought that was good.  And he taught me a lot about writing essays, speaking.  Here's where I would have to write them but--so that was it except the effect that my mother had on me in terms of motivation in terms--I was very much in love with my mother that I wanted to please her.  And being so silent was sometimes hard to figure out how.  But I did figure it out and the thing I figured out most about her is that she wanted us to learn stuff.  And so whenever I learned stuff it pleased her but it wasn't the kind of reaction from her that showed how pleased she was.  And so it kept you doing to win that reaction and so I gathered after a while that that was her method and that's why it worked.
Story_ID: 106175
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So now why did you leave Wheeling High School [Wheeling, Virginia] for Baltimore City High School [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, we moved to Annapolis [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's church--National Conference of Christian Jews were trying to integrate the schools in Baltimore [Maryland].  This was very early too, 1955.  And if you remember that was like the first year after legal segregation in schools was over and so my father wanted, volunteered me.  And I didn't live in Baltimore at the time but he had a sister in Baltimore.  All of his sisters and things lived in Baltimore so I went to live with one of his sisters in order to be in that integration class.  And it was good because it never, I never had a big negative effect from the integration.  And I think that's one thing that both my father and my mother knew about me.  Now my mother would fix breakfast and stuff like that and send me off to this integrated school where there might be trouble.  But she'd never like say anything encouraging or anything like that.  But she'd always convey through her attentiveness that she was supporting it because there was always this ambivalence about integration.  We'd like to assume now that most black people were integrationists.  They were not necessarily.  My mother wasn't.  It was an inevitability for her and it had something to do with spirituality.  She would say that white people were poor, lost souls, lost in the wilderness of the world, meaning that our life was spiritually oriented.  American life is materially oriented and that's what I discerned later on that lost in the wilderness of the world meant lost in a world of things and our world was much more spiritual.  And so she had not just for racial reasons, she had problems with the American mainstream on giving up who we are as a people spiritually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was separate in some ways from religion because my father was more religious. She was much more spiritual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she didn't see it in the context of Christianity and the Bible necessarily?
Speaker 2: No, not in that context.  It was just that, a connection to--yeah, well the unseen, invisible was God of course.  But it all felt very tribal to me, that, older than that.
Story_ID: 106176
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any teachers at Baltimore City College [Baltimore, Maryland]--now what was the composition of Baltimore City College cause--?
Speaker 2: Baltimore City College is the second oldest public high school in the country, second only to Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts].  It was like a magnet school.  It was huge, at that time huge, a couple of thousand.  You know now they have plenty of schools that were a couple of thousand.  But it was then and there were ten black students.  And it was arranged by the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Jews were already there.  And so Mr. Kaufman, a counselor, if we had any problems in the school we were supposed to go to him and he could get us out of a teacher's class if the teacher was racist or anything like that.  And it was rather smooth.  As I said there were some fights that were racially grounded but I got along pretty well with most of the kids there and the fights were not catastrophic or anything like that.  They were bad enough.  The thing I remember most about it is I used to get very good grades and the math teacher would say, would call the names of the students to come and get their papers back from him after he had marked them.  And he would save the highest paper to last and I worked and I worked and I worked to keep getting called last.  And then when I'd go up to get my paper, the teacher would say, "They sent us the smartest little colored boy in Baltimore."  And I would--I wasn't insulted because I had struggled to do that.  I thought it was funny and there were white kids in the class who were friends of mine and I would just you know like bow like that because I used to always get the last call up to the teacher.  And then one of the students went to Mr. Kaufman and told him that this teacher was racist and Mr. Kaufman took me out of that class.  But I didn't really want to go out of that class because I was having fun.  Fun--it was all about the worth of us as people and I worked very, very hard to get those grades and I was glad that he did that.  There were fights, but I won some and I lost some.  They were not mob--you know there was no mob violence.  The City of Baltimore was run by a guy named Little Tommy D'Alesandro [Thomas Ludwig John D'Alesandro, Jr.].  That's Pelosi's, Nancy Pelosi's father.  And he was, he said there's not going to be any of that mess in Baltimore.  And for the first couple of years of integration Baltimore didn't have any you know really bad scenes.  They were down in Cambridge.  Cambridge, Maryland was the bad place but Baltimore itself because Tommy D'Alesandro-
Story_ID: 106177
Speaker 1: So now, so you had good grades at Baltimore City College [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: High school--
Speaker 2: Excellent grades.
Speaker 1: And you were mainly interested in, were you interested in writing?
Speaker 2: No.  In 1957, the Russians put Sputnik [first artificial Earth satellite] up.  And so it was all about physics because we were supposed to be the--if you were the American kid you were supposed to beat, help to beat the Russians to the moon.  So I pretended to be good in sciences until I got freshman year [of college] and I had chemistry and physics in the same semester and then I changed my mind.  But yeah, Baltimore City College was a good experience for me--
Speaker 1: Now what about Eugene Parker and Pierre [H.] Davis?
Speaker 2: I don't know who they are.
Speaker 1: These are two African American teachers that you mentioned in some other publication I think.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't know about them?
Speaker 2: Eugene Davis?
Speaker 1: No, Eugene Parker and Pierre Davis.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't know?  Okay, well that's--okay, we got that wrong then.  That's--
Speaker 2: Wow, I wonder where that came from.
Speaker 1: That's--no, somebody did the research and that's not--okay, so we won't--don't worry about them if you don't remember.
Speaker 2: Unless they were at Baltimore City College with me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what the note here says they were two black teachers at Baltimore City College.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no.  There were no black teachers at Baltimore City College [sic Parker taught at BCC for thirty years beginning in 1956; Davis taught for one in 1956 and returned to the school as its first African American principal in 1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What they probably found out is that there are black teachers there now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were none in '55 [1955] when I went.
Story_ID: 106178
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So we'll forget that and we'll go on to, now when you were thinking about going to college, you know, what kind of counseling did you get?
Speaker 2: Well I got a bunch of scholarships and I was going to go to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and I hitchhiked, you know back in those days you could hitchhike anywhere.  It was much safer than it is now.  I hitchhiked up to New Jersey and it was not an official visit but I just walked around Princeton and stuff like that and decided that no, I am not going to go here because the racial feelings-- you know like, I can pick things up and sense things.  And I just didn't want to get lost in that place where there was no value to who you were as a black individual.  Princeton was very much steeped in western tradition and you know this sort of thing.  And so I came back to Baltimore [Maryland]--
Speaker 1: So would you have been going there as a physics major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would have been going there as a physics major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came back to Baltimore and the counselor, Mr. Kaufman, knew about this place called Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York].  I didn't know much about it.  And he had a stepson who went to school there and he quick and got me in because I didn't--I hadn't applied.  I had you know John Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], Princeton [University], blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah--
Speaker 1: Princeton I guess because of Einstein [Albert Einstein, former theoretical physicist] having been--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just was a dreamer you know and I was going to help the United States beat the Russians to the moon, even though I was interested in writing and loved writing and stuff like that you know.  The hype and so when I decided that Princeton [University] would be alienating in ways that I didn't want to deal with, I came back, Mr. Kaufman got me into Colgate with scholarship.  Well my scholarship was one that would follow mw anywhere, the main one that I was going to use at Princeton.  And so--
Speaker 1: So was this a scholarship from a specific--what was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation [Environmental grantmaking foundation; from 1947-59, the foundation aided students with tuition at the schools of their choice].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was that and you know other various scholarships and stuff like that and so I went off to Colgate.  I'd never been there, no visits but it was much smaller and less chance of getting lost.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now where is Colgate?  That's in the northeast?
Speaker 2: Upstate New York, just--
Speaker 1: Up--
Speaker 2: --south of Syracuse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About forty miles south of Syracuse.
Speaker 1: That's an Ivy League School, right, Colgate?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: It's--used to be trying to be one but it is not.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought it was (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, it's on the edge but they gave athletic scholarships further along than--see, the Ivy Leagues pretended not to give athletic scholarships.  And part of my scholarship was in track.  I was a high jumper back when 6'4" was a good high jump.  And a senior, John Thompson--John Thomas--
Speaker 1: Thomas, right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, broke seven foot barrier either when I was a freshman in college or that [in 1960], but up--
Speaker 1: The '60s Olympics around the time of, I think was it him or the Russian [sic Soviet] Valeriy Borzov [sic Valeriy Brumel]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in--
Speaker 1: --no, not Borzov but (unclear).
Speaker 2: --in the '60s, maybe I was--
Speaker 1: Valeriy something.
Speaker 2: But up until then before they came in with that style, 6'4" was a good jump and so I had a track scholarship with part of what happened at Colgate.
Speaker 1: You were jumping western roll, was that what they called it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Then all of a sudden John Thomas came along and went over seven feet and so, wow.  But I was second in the state of Maryland with 6'4".
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a Russian that did seven feet too and I can't think of his name now.  I can't--
Speaker 2: People can just jump higher nowadays.  I mean a six foot guard dunks regularly now.  Back then they didn't.  You didn't?
Speaker 1: No, I can't jump.  I can't dunk.  I'm six feet.  I mean I know what it takes to do it.  It's a, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know guards can do it now.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: Woo!
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Little guards can go to the hoop and dunk.
Story_ID: 106179
Speaker 1: So it--okay, so you're at Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York].  Now was there, now before--did you graduate with any honors from--
Speaker 2: Baltimore City [College, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Baltimore City.
Speaker 2: Not honors, but I had loads of scholarships.  And the reason was that college board tests are easy to study for if you study over a long period of time.  At that time there were those analogy tests and the math tests and this and that and I used to study and study and study because I knew that my family didn't have the money to send me away to school and I definitely wanted to get away from home.  The person I loved the most I wanted to get away from, that was my mother.  Me and my mother were very, very close and I wanted to get--get away from that woman because she had a picture of me that I really didn't want to play into, very practical, very narrow, very--and so the father, the part of me that was like my father, I wanted to get away from her and Ms. Gwatney [ph.] the school teacher from my fifth grade and all of those people who were trying to channel me into being a more practical person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: What did your mother think about you going into physics?  Did she like that?
Speaker 2: She wouldn't say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She guided me almost like without speaking.  She was a big influence on my life.  Even now, she's dead and I have conversations with her.  But those conversations are not conversations in which when I was growing up in the house she didn't necessarily participate.  Any difficulties I had at Baltimore City College she would fix my meals in the morning and I would interpret by her diligence to that and her absolutely, absolute faith I mean in doing that, living the, out that responsibility was the encouragement I need.  The encouragement really was George, you can do this.  She had faith in my ability to do things but she didn't encourage me to do things.  She just felt that I could.  George, you can do that.  George, you can do that.  You can do that.  You can do this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was that kind of--
Speaker 1: And in high school did you--I didn't ask you when we were talking about high school but did you either in any clubs or anything or did you run for student government or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I was on the track team.  The basketball team was not integrated because Baltimore City had to play other schools in Maryland and therefore they didn't play, have a black person on the team.  Yeah, and then I had this other thing where I was doing some writing and I got a commendation from Baltimore City for a short story that I wrote in high school.  And so it was kind of a divided kind of situation where I had this surface ambition to do physics and math and that sort of thing just because that was the thing to do in 1957, but I really had the other desire because I had always been writing.
Story_ID: 106180
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What was your favorite literature at that point?  What kind of--?
Speaker 2: Wow, in Annapolis, Maryland there is a library and I used to sit down on the floor in the shelves and read faraway places.  And my fascination with Africa came from that.  My fascination with the East--Asia--came from that because I have a good imagination and I could imagine myself in these places and then figuring out life.  And so I was a dabbler in books, never totally captivated by any of them but picking from here and here and here, little snippets to put together some sort of picture of the world.  So--
Speaker 1: I think when you were coming along (unclear), people like John Gunther would write about travel--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Lowell Thomas--
Speaker 2: I knew all of that stuff, yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Lowell Thomas, TV shows and radio shows would feature these men talking about--
Speaker 2: Because I was deadest on getting away from home because it was a very narrow life and I wanted all this stuff out there in the world--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I wanted to--
Speaker 1: Now did you have to work in high school?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not really.  I had worked earlier as a paper boy for the Afro [the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper] in those little towns in Maryland and places like that.  The Pittsburgh Courier and the Afro used to have paper boys.  And so yeah, I did work and then when the migrant workers came to town the boys would go out with them and pick tomatoes and they would stay out there in the campus but we would do it and come home and we would earn enough money.  So yeah, parents made sure that we worked but the main thing was school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The main thing was--especially for me.
Story_ID: 106181
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, at graduation you were on your way to Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and you had the support of the school, administration in terms of--
Speaker 2: You mean Baltimore City College [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In terms of going--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Kaufman made sure that everything was setup up there for me to come up there.  And it was a nice experience, you know, getting--because I thought I was running away from home and I thought I was never going to come back to see this woman I loved, my mother, because she got on my nerves, right?  And so it was just nice running away from home, being driven.  You know I wasn't like Tom Sawyer with the little cane--
Speaker 1: Stick.
Speaker 2: --stick and the handkerchief, I was sitting in the back seat, my oldest brother was driving, my mom and Ms. Gwatney was there and my next oldest brother.  I said man this is the way to run away from home because they're never going to see me again, no matter what I wasn't going to ever--and then I got up there and they had food that was like their food instead of the food I was used to.  So in a little while I said ain't no use in cutting off my nose to spite my face.  I called, mom, I said mom, I'm coming home for Thanksgiving and she didn't even know I had run away.  She said, come on home dirty face.  And so I just went on home and it's been like that, that place called home always had that ambivalence that it was a very narrow existence but it was home.  And so I went home for--because there's no sense in, you know they had these little teeny rolls like that, but at home we had the big rolls and they call a salad, they put a scoop of cottage cheese and a cherry on top of a piece of lettuce and call that a salad.  I said you know I was used to a salad, potato salad with eggs cut up in it and stuff like that.  So I was just used to--I just wasn't going to have a life that was not filled with the things that I had.  I wanted what I had back then--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --but I wanted what was new also.  I wanted both.
Speaker 1: All right, that's a lot of people feel that way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But tell us about Colgate now.  Were you--what was the environment like?  Was it welcoming to you and were there other African Americans at Colgate?
Speaker 2: There were six African Americans in my class.  There were twelve at Colgate.  There--and of 1,300, all male.  Getting use to an all-male environment was tough even though Baltimore City College was all male also.  Welcoming, yeah I had a pretty good--because I'm motivated more by curiosity than any other emotion and learning about different ways of life.  One of the things I learned later on was that world was patrifocal and the world I came from was matrifocal because in the dining hall they had all of these old thirteen men of yore, these older white men with the beards and stuff like that because it was started as a Baptist school.  And you remember the old days, the Baptists, white Baptists, were very, very superior--severe people and so one of the things that I discerned is that very much African American culture is shaped a lot by the mother figure.  When a boy, boy's father might be the coach but when he scores a touchdown back in those days, hi mom, how you doing?  You know it was always for her.
Speaker 1: Right.  They never said anything about dad either.
Speaker 2: Never said, even though he was the coach, never said anything about dad it was always--and so in some of the writing that I did especially or psychology today trying to discern what I thought was different about African American life is that the balance between the feminine and the masculine was, it was more balanced because my father was the preacher but the women ran the church.  I could tell that very early who the real power was.  And so they--and then my mom used to say my father was breath and britches which means that he could speak a lot but the details of running things in those tribal existences seemed to fall on women.  And then when I got to Africa I found out that in a lot of cases that's the same thing, that in those villages the women are the core of the economy.
Speaker 1: This is true.  This is true.
Story_ID: 106182
Speaker 1: So was there any, was there a formal introduction into the study of African culture at Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York] or did you have to like figure these out on your own?
Speaker 2: Well I think chemistry and physics in freshman year as I said and so in order to run track and things like that you have your chem [chemistry] lab and your physics lab in the afternoon and so I didn't really want to do that.  And so I switched over to my other love which was writing.  So I switched over to the English department.  I wasn't very happy there and the most memorable racial incident that I had at Colgate happened there.  I had put my heart into writing this story and this professor called me into his office after a story--after a class and asked me where did I get the story.  He says your people have come a long way but they have not come far enough for you to have written this story.  And so I swept all the stuff off of his desk.  See I was--I flare up very fast and swoom [sweeping hand motion].  And so--
Speaker 1: So what was the story about (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was just a story about some little kid.  But what he was alluding to was that it was better than he thought that a black person could do because it was not--it was about, I can't even remember what the story was about.  And so I swept everything off his desk.  Just took my forearm, boom.  So rather than getting thrown out of school, I'm the kind of person who falls up instead of falls down.  A couple of professors took me on as a cause because they probably knew what this professor was saying in faculty meetings and stuff like and so they knew he was a racist, right?  And so the professors took me on as a cause, the guy who ran the university church, the guy who was the professor in anthropology, a Professor Sio [Arnold A. Sio, professor of anthropology and sociology].  And so I didn't get thrown out of school, I switched to anthropology.  And then Professor Sio saw me in the hall one day and he says, "You want to go to Africa?"  And I said, "I don't have any money to go to Africa." And he said, "Don't worry about it."  And so he got me a grant to spend my junior, summer of my junior year in Nigeria in a small town.  There was something called Operations Crossroads Africa--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which took African American students to Africa for summer to do things in village life.
Speaker 1: I think it's still in operation and the founder is a man named Robinson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, James Robinson.
Speaker 1: James Robinson.
Speaker 2: But he's probably not--is he still living [Robinson died in 1972]?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: If he is, he's in his nineties because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he was an older man then.  So yeah, Reverend James Robinson and so he got me a way to go to Africa.  And so what I, the way I linked it all up in my mind is if this guy hadn't have been a racist, I never would have gone to anthropology and if I had never gone to anthropology I would never have gotten that free trip to Africa.  And that free trip to Africa was like one of the most important things in my life because I was able to notice similarities between myself and the tribal life I lived.
Story_ID: 106183
Speaker 1: So let's back up a little bit.  Now you go to Africa in 1960, is that true?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, 1960.
Speaker 1: It's 1960.  This is a pivotal year in American history.  You have the election, presidential election, Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon, 37th President of the U.S.] v. Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the U.S.].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You got, it's an Olympic year, you know, the Civil Rights Movement is starting.
Speaker 2: Yep, it was heating up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were getting ready to do the Freedom Rides and that sort of thing.  So you go to Operation--also, now you go to Nigeria, isn't this the year of Nigerian--?
Speaker 2: Independence, in November [sic October].  Yeah, I was there a couple of months before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was also in Africa--
Speaker 1: So you were there when they were getting ready to have the celebration, was that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were getting ready to have the celebration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Ghana had already run into problems based on CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] undercutting Nkrumah [Kwame Nkrumah, first President and Prime Minister of Ghana/the Gold Coast State: oversaw the nation's independence from British colonization] and so most of that was stuff that was less important to me than living village life.
Story_ID: 106184
Speaker 1: Living village life really was the high point of my life so far because it was so--I discovered so many things about my African-ness, so many things that had not been lost in the time I had spent over--my family's for 400 years that's been--because I could see people who looked like Mr. Bernard Anderson.  Or that guy over here looked like Mr. John Hunt.  And the thing I noticed most was they laughed for the same reason that black people laugh over here.  They can laugh without a reason that if you're happy you laugh.  That the--there were just subtle things because I had ability to perceive what was below the surface of things.  And there were a lot of things below the surface that we had not lost in the time we were here.  And they constituted the difference between who we were as African Americans and who the other people were as European Americans and I didn't get a good handle on it intellectually until I began to read Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois (William Edward Burghardt), American sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author and editor], The Souls of Black Folk.  And I said, oh okay, yeah, now I see.  What he was saying stuff about the dusty desert of dollars and smartness and that we are an oasis of simple faith and reverence in this dusty desert.  And that all related to my mother's ambivalence because I was going to go over into the dusty desert and get lost in the wilderness of the world maybe unless she had had that profound effect on me.  And the effect was strong enough to perpetuate some things where holding onto this and getting a grasp of that.
Speaker 2: So this is a--so you're really exploring what it means to be a black person or an African--?
Speaker 1: In the positive sense.  So much of that ends up being negative.  What is the positive contribution of Africans to the modern world?  That contribution to me comes through African Americans that the spirit of Africa is still with us.  And it accounts for a lot.  It accounts for the fact that this little tiny group of people, such a small portion of the world's population grew up here in America and spirits spread throughout the entire world because the symbol of America is in a lot of cases manufacturing power, though it this power, that power.  The spirit of America also is the spirit of our popular culture.  And our popular culture is very much influenced, distorted to--in a lot of ways, but very much influenced by the African spirit that melded with the American.  I did an essay called "The Racial Integration of the American Mind".  I did it for Psychology Today because they deal with mind, but the real title should be The Racial Integration of the American Spirit.  Because when Carl Jung was here, he was telling white people way back in the 1920s that they were no longer like Europeans, that they're mixing with us had made them somewhat like us.  And our mixing with them had made us somewhat like them.  And so this new American character, so the positive, the thing gets distorted into negatives and--
Speaker 2: Because of rhetoric in those days, for instance there was a Negro problem in America.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem.
Speaker 2: That's a--
Speaker 1: We were always looked upon as a problem.
Speaker 2: We're always a problem, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I did not want to look at it that way 'cause I don't see myself as a problem.  I don't want to believe that all contributions need to be quantified.  I gave a speech out in Ohio, your place, at Cleveland State and I had a picture on the stage behind me, huge pictures of founding fathers.  And then I hit the button and I said but these are our founding mothers.  That's the whole thing about matrifocal and patrifocal. And it was a class-ecology--of African American women, right?  The static part of our background came from these men but the fluid, cultural part of our background came from these women.  And so just as I have as a black person, a white founding father that everybody in the audience, white, by then you had Asians and everything, every American also has a black founding mother.
Story_ID: 106696
Speaker 1: Okay, so Crossroads, Operation Crossroads Africa.  You go to Africa in 1960, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you spend time in a village called Akubini [ph.], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Akubini.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, and where is that in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Warri is a lumber town, up from Port Harcourt which is a now polluted oil delta town.  But it's on the Niger River.  On tributaries of the Niger River there are villages like Akubini and they flood, seasonal floods.  And we were there building a flood wall but mostly participating in village life which was the enjoyable part of it.  Now I was the only black student, the others were white.  The little boys, thirteen, fourteen years old used to come and get me in the morning and take me out on the river.  And it was really a great experience because they weren't afraid of crocodiles so I couldn't show them that I was.  We were in these boats that weren't very big and I swore one of those crocodiles could have turned over that boat but I certainly wasn't going to show this thirteen year old kid that this big, bad American was afraid.  They claimed that because of the color of my skin the mosquitoes wouldn't bother me as much and maybe they didn't, I don't know.  But it was a feeling of being at home, a feeling of not that "twoness" that [W.E.B.] Du Bois talks about, there was no twoness.  And yet I did know I was an American and I was very glad that, for the progress that America has made and would, I wouldn't have wanted to stay there.  I was not that kind of person.  But I wanted to identify parts of myself that came from there in order to better understand them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say that there are like plenty of African survivals that you could recognize?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and on a spiritual level, American culture to me right now is very much influenced by non-western culture through African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because as [Carl] Jung says, Jung says that white Americans are not Europeans.  They are influenced by Native Americans and African Americans.
Story_ID: 106697
Speaker 1: Now were there any particular teachers or individuals that were key to your understanding in Nigeria when you were there?
Speaker 2: Not in Nigeria but the man who sent me, the man I never would have met, Professor Sio, never would have met if this teacher had not been racist in the English department.  He helped me understand a lot.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: S-I-O.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's S-I-O, and he's an--he's a white man, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he tolerated my preaching.  I used to go to class and they had a course in sociology called "The American Negro."  And I used to go to class and preach and he used to allow it--
Speaker 1: Preach Christian preaching?
Speaker 2: No, not Christian preaching just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --generally saying that no, my life was not like Richard [Nathaniel] Wright [former novelist and short story writer] said it was.  No, I was not tortured like Ralph [Waldo] Ellison [former novelist, literary critic, scholar and writer], Little Guy was in that story.  And so I learned a lot about writing in his class because he would let me deliver these papers.  Whenever I disagreed with the picture of the Negro that came out of our literature I would roll home, write up me a paper based on the way I knew the life to be.  For example, Native Son is about this guy who just totally alienated from self, kills these two people in Chicago.  I said well why doesn't American literature look at the other side of that?  My mom and dad were in Chicago at about the same time that Bigger Thomas was and they had a love affair.  And my mom used to tease my dad about the way he danced.  Why are there no love stories?  And so I used to, you know write stuff like that.  I mean like he--I didn't think that that was representative--and of course it was called the American Negro and they were teaching us about who the American Negro was by using James [Arthur] Baldwin [former novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic], Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison.  And I said no, they only allow that to be published.  There are many more stories.  And so my writing over my life has been to tell some of those other stories and they're not as popular and they don't find a way to get exposed and stuff like that.  But I live to do that, to stress that other spiritual contribution rather than the victimhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So Professor Sio would be the one who would allow me to give these papers and always rather than saying I was wrong, and in many cases I was, he would give me something else to read.  And then when I read something else I come back and give another paper that--and so it was a lot of, I enjoyed it because I was the only black person in the class and I had a chance in every class meeting to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So for the most part what you experienced at Colgate a good experience?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was positive, very positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you graduated in '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Sixty-One [1961].
Story_ID: 106698
Speaker 1: And now '61 [1961] is when Freedom Rides are going on.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: [President John F.] Kennedy is in his first year.  Did you have any feelings about you know joining the Civil Rights Movement at all at that point?
Speaker 2: Well my Brother Vernon was in--at Savannah State College [in Savannah, Georgia] and they were organizing a rally because in Georgia at that time the black schools, public schools would not get new textbooks.  The white school would use the textbook first and then they would ship them over to the black school and they were all tattered and this and that when they were getting ready to throw them away at the white schools.  And so people at Savannah State were organizing a rally to change that, among other things because Savannah was not a big battle front.  It wasn't like Tallahassee or one of those but there were battles in Savannah.  But that's the one that I remember that I went down there because my brother--I was at Brandeis [University in Boston, Massachusetts].  I had gotten a scholarship to go to Brandeis.
Story_ID: 106699
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're getting ahead of--but, so you went from, after you graduated from Colgate [University in Hamilton, New York] you went to Brandeis [University in Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah, for--
Speaker 1: For graduate school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a couple of weeks, but then you know like--
Speaker 1: But you didn't stay?
Speaker 2: No.  No, there was a lot of racial turmoil and Boston [Massachusetts] isn't the most open racially city in the world and they had to make special--to give me housing, off campus housing and all of that stuff.  And then when my brother said they were doing this thing in Savannah [Georgia], I said why don't I go to Savannah?
Speaker 1: Now was it surprising to you that in Boston there was such racial--?
Speaker 2: I was surprised that you know because Boston is Boston!  You get a sense that it is a open, non-racist city.  But in the '60s [1960s], Boston was bad.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '70s [1970s] too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, seven, '70s [1970s] too.
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean it's, I think a lot of people are surprised that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Boston--
Speaker 2: Boston of all cities.
Speaker 1: --Because of the Kennedys and other politicians that come out of there--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --it seems a liberal haven but it's--
Speaker 2: But it was--it's not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there two weeks before you joined your brother Vernon--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a full ride over there and I said no, let me go and still wandering to try to find--
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me ask you was [HM] Angela Davis [American political activist, scholar, and author] at Brandeis when you were there or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, she's younger than I am, I think [Angela Davis was born 1944 and matriculated at Brandeis as an undergraduate in 1961].
Speaker 1: Is she?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think.  Hold on.
Speaker 1: We were thinking that you all were, would have been there about the same time but we weren't sure.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't stay there long enough to know who was there.
Speaker 1: So you were--were you an anthropology--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was going to study, at that time it was called primitive religion but I like to call it primal spirituality because primitive religion has some connotations that I really don't want to deal with.
Story_ID: 106700
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what happened in Savannah [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: We in, got involved in marches and this sort of thing and there was a requirement in civil rights movements that you be able to absorb punishment without reacting. And I can't do that.  I flare up very easily.  There were a whole lot of reasons why this was not going to work.
Speaker 1: So did you try it at all?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sit in at a counter or something?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't sit in, we were marching.
Speaker 1: Or did you--marching.
Speaker 2: We were marching and--
Speaker 1: What were you marching about?
Speaker 2: We were marching--on River Street, we were marching, I guess that's the name of the street, the main street we were marching for, to change the situation with textbooks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said before the old textbooks--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what Vernon called me down there and told me that they were going to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you get arrested?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get harassed, did you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was, you know harassment and there were you know that sort of thing but no I didn't get arrested.
Story_ID: 106701
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But so, how long--now you eventually joined the [U.S.] Air Force, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I joined the Air Force almost from Savannah [Georgia] and the Savannah experience was the experience that contributed to my joining the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a fall, all of this happens in one autumn, right, in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You go to Brandeis [University in Boston, Massachusetts], then--
Speaker 2: Then I go down to Savannah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) and then--
Speaker 2: And then after Savannah I came home to Annapolis, Maryland to--and that's where I, was my home of record for the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still wandering, still trying to find out the meaning of things.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now I read here somewhere that you thought that the Air Force would provide fuel for a story.
Speaker 2: A novel?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That would change the world.  I was that naive.  You remember how it was in the '60s [1960s].  There was an article in the Negro Digest I guess it was.  It was called "Black Youth Can Change the World."  We thought we could change the world.  I thought I could go to the Air Force, tell the truth and write this novel and then people would just stop fighting because it seems farfetched now but there was a lot of that in the 1960s among us.  We didn't know how intransigent the situation was.  We were absolutely certain of our right and righteousness and so all we had--and then having very high opinions of people generally--all you have to do is tell the truth and things are going to change.  That was like one of the foundations of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And to some extent, it's true on some extent, I mean to some extent that the truth has to be told.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  But we thought that once the truth was told people are going to stop doing this.  We didn't know that the truth was many-sided and that other people were looking at something entirely different than we were looking at.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in the Air Force, now what was your intention in the Air Force?  Had you had ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps.] or anything, or--?
Speaker 2: No.  I went to Officers' Training School [sic Officer Training School]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the higher your grades, the greater your selection in terms of what aircraft you want to fly.  And so I came in very high in my class and so I was able to choose reconnaissance.  No, this was--yeah, reconnaissance and refueling.  So I flew in a KC-135 [military aerial refueling aircraft] because I didn't want to fly strike missions.  Strike missions mean you know--
Speaker 1: You're bombing and strafing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, napalm all, strafing.  So you only do that in B-52s for the bombing and the fighter planes were doing the ground support and stuff like that.  The refueling planes were far above everything and so I started taking notes for a novel.
Speaker 1: So at this time the U.S. really was not supposed to be engaged in--
Speaker 2: Nope, we told--
Speaker 1: --war in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: We told our families we bring back all of this stuff from Thailand but we would tell our families we were in Okinawa [Japan].  We had to say we were either in Guam or Okinawa and yet, we'd bring back Thai silk and, see I was in Thailand mostly.  The big planes flew out of Thailand instead of Vietnam, only the fighters, mostly the fighters.
Speaker 1: Were they doing bombing missions in Vietnam at that point?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is '61 [1961] that I'm talking about or--
Speaker 2: Oh no, this was '60 [1960]--
Speaker 1: --or was it later?
Speaker 2: This was later see, because I had two years of--I had Officers' Training School and Flight School and so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So by '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: --we're talking about '63 [1963] or four.  We're talking about '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that (unclear).
Speaker 2: And yes we were doing some bombing over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, before that from what I recall the U.S. was providing military advisors--
Speaker 2: And stuff like that.
Speaker 1: --to the government of South Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  But even after we claimed we were doing that, there were things going on.  We just could not tell our families that they were going on even though there was every evidence that we were not in Okinawa, we were not in Guam, we were not in the Philippines, we were in Thailand.
Story_ID: 106702
Speaker 1: Okay.  So okay, so in '63 [1963] you were stationed in Sacramento [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the early part of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: I got married in Sacramento.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you meet your wife and where did you meet her?
Speaker 2: She was in a beauty contest, Miss Bronze, California.  Remember those Miss Bronze contests they used to have?  She was in this Miss Bronze contest and she was--her father was a minister in the Church of God in Christ.  So of course she was not allowed in those things and she was trying to break away from--the Church of God in Christ. At that time you couldn't wear lipstick, you couldn't this, you couldn't that.  So she--
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: --got in this contest and that's where I met her.  I met her and one of the things that attracted me most was she was a fantastic musician. That was the same thing that Sly and the Family Stone and those people, they came out of the same, Southern California Church of God in Christ Choir.  Ed, Eddie, I forget his name [Freddie Stone].  There was a whole bunch of them that came out of that choir and went into show business.  Those were the kids who were breaking away from the Church of God in Christ and going into the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Sly--
Speaker 2: Sly Stone was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sly Stone.
Speaker 2: She was the keyboard player for the Mass Choir, [Northern] California Mass Choir when he was a part of the [Northern California] Mass Choir.  So she knew all of those people who, I think about three or four of the family went over and formed Sly and the Family Stone. And so I met her out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this--these are good days, you marry Miss Bronze California--
Speaker 2: No, she didn't win.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I bet that she would win (laughter).  And even when she didn't win, I said they were wrong and I was right.  That's kind of my mentality.  You know how that is, right?
Speaker 1: She was a musician, a virtuoso and the--on the keyboard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, could--like Sly and those people could play without taking lessons, Earl Garner, there are a lot of them around.
Story_ID: 106703
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, but shortly they send you to--do they send you to the Far East and then to--?
Speaker 2: They send me to Little Rock, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Little Rock, okay.
Speaker 2: And she went down there with me and for a while I was the only black flying officer on the base and she was an officer's wife who had worked at McClellan [former Air Force Base] in Sacramento [California] and so she could transfer her civil service status to Little Rock, Arkansas.  So you know how happy they were in the mid '60s [1960s] about having me and her on that base.  I encountered a lot of racism there.  But the military worked very hard and there was a structure where it could be attacked, the racism.  And individuals who were racist had to conform to a structure and that structure allowed me a lot of room to protest.  And so joining the Civil Rights Movement in Little Rock, Arkansas was easy because to sit in a place like sit in a Howard Johnson's [hotel chain], I put my uniform on right.  You go in there with the uniform on.  If they arrest you and you're late for a flight the next day, there's going to be hell to pay.  And Little Rock Air Force Base was the biggest economic entity probably in the entire state.  And so I have the uniform on, I go in there with this preacher, Reverend Riley and we would sit in and he had his turnaround collar and I had this and they couldn't arrest us because if the United States government ever put Little Rock City off limits to the air base, it would be horrible.  And so there were all sorts of ways in which being an officer made it possible for me to participate in civil rights.  For example, they had buses coming on base that said color seat from the rear.  Now the colonel on the base was Colonel Sam Dykes from Stone Mountain, Georgia, a Stone Mountain, Georgia guy of the '60s [1960s].  And so I said Colonel Dykes, said, "You know it's against the law-- " because at that time it was against the law, color seat from the rear, those buses could not come on federal property.  And so I said Colonel Dykes, "Isn't that against the law?"  And he says, "Davis, you have a car?"  I said, "Yes sir."  He said, "Why don't you drive your car and let me worry about this base?"  Man, I was so mad I went to the PX [post exchange], bought one of those Polaroid cameras.  You know the big folding ones they had back there?  I jumped on the bus and I took a picture of that sign.  So then the air police came by my house not long after that, took me back to see Colonel Dykes.  He said, "Davis, what you going to do with that picture?"  I said, "I live in D.C. and I wanted to see something.  I think it's against the law for them to come on this base."  He knew it was against the law.  I said, "I'm going to show it in D.C."  Now I had not dispelled the idea that I was related to Colonel B.O. Davis [former Air Force general and commander of the Tuskegee airmen].
Speaker 1: Oh, they thought you were related to B.O. Davis?
Speaker 2: They thought that there was some--you know, they asked and I axed it.  You know I didn't answer one way or another because in the army the older Colonel Davis was--became a general and then when I was in the service, his son was colonel.  And so we sparred around and he says, "What you going to do?  Who you going to show it to?"  I said, "I don't know yet.  I just think it's against the law."  So you know I ran into trouble but if you're an officer your records are kept at headquarters and not on the base.  And so there are very few things he could put in my file without justifying.  And so he couldn't justify that.  So they found something else and put it in there.  And I got delayed six months making captain but he got sent to Alaska so he lost that one.  But it was, it was tough.  It was tough.

Speaker 1: They had to give her, my wife, a job because she already had a civil service rating at McClellan [Air Force Base] in San Francisco [California].  So you know they spent--spilled coffee on her at the officers' club.  There was a whole lot of stuff like that that was very different than I had experienced as far as racism is concerned in those schools.  So that was Little Rock Air Force Base [Arkansas].
Speaker 2: That's something.  So we're now, we're where, around 1963, '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: We're in '63 [1963], '64 [1964], something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So now had you already had pilot's training?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And you trained to be a pilot at--
Speaker 1: No, navigator.
Speaker 2: A navigator, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, navigator.
Speaker 2: And where did you train?  You train in Little Rock or (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Waco, Texas.
Speaker 2: Waco, okay.  So you weren't the pilot, you were the navigator--
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --on these flights?  Okay.  They--we have a note here that you did refueling missions and--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, refueling and reconnaissance.
Speaker 2: Reconnaissance, all right.  Now did you fly over Vietnam at all or did you ever go--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had forty-seven combat missions over Vietnam.  But they were all out of Thailand.  Big planes didn't go into--like B-52s and KC-135s, didn't go into many of the bases in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because they were too easy to hit if you try to land.
Speaker 2: So now you were awarded the Air Medal in--?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 106705
Speaker 1: You--so well did you really start writing a novel about this experience?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started taking notes for a novel about the war.  I had taken notes before that for a novel called The Cold War Soldiers when I was on alert.  See, this was early part of my career I also did alert in Thule, Greenland which is above the Arctic Circle.  We were waiting for the Russians to come across the Arctic Circle and we had refueling planes on alert at all times up at Thule or in Fairbanks, Alaska.  And we would fly up to refuel bombers going across and that's what we were supposed to do.  And so I started taking notes for this thing called The Cold War Soldier which was about whether their enemy was across the poles or the enemy was right there inside the bunker with us, the perceptions that we had of each other as Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that one never got published but then I started taking notes while I was in Vietnam for a Vietnam novel.
Speaker 1: All right, oaky.  So well what did you, now what were some of the things you noticed about African American soldiers or the treatment of soldiers and race relations in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: What, Coming Home  is too much about and if I were going to do it again it's about the clash, the racial clash between black and white soldiers.  I mean soldiers, Air Force, but mostly about soldiers and that.  The Vietnam War was the first time that a lot of whites and a lot of blacks were pushed together that closely in that kind of contact with each other.  And so the book records a lot of that, so much of it that in some cases it loses the point of the entire story because the story is not really about racism.  Not on that level.  It is about the fusion of the races that begins to take place during the 1960s.  It was a bumpy fusion but it was an Asian war, African American and European Americans fighting in an Asian war.  And the world seeming to come together because at that time there were revolutions all over the world, most African countries became free during that time.  There were revolutions in Germany, there were revolutions everywhere.  And so it was really about the merging of the spirit of the rest of the world with the western world because at that time the western world was symbolized by American.
Story_ID: 106195
Speaker 1: All right.  So now in '68 [1968], from what I understand, you were faced with a choice of flying strike missions or leaving, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did that--tell us sir.
Speaker 2: Okay, there was a program--see, little known fact is that we were losing aircraft over North Vietnam and they had to cross train people who were in tankers and other--into a program called Wild Weasel.  And they wanted me to cross train.  Then you're in the back seat of a strike aircraft and you're a part of the whole scene of making raids on villages and all of that stuff.  I had enough time to get out.  Once you have five years after flight school even though an officer by understanding is career but you can get out after five years.  And so I just said that I was not going to go in a Wild Weasel.  I ran into some difficulty and I got out.  I was not given an honorable discharge when I got out.  I was counseled on patriotism and this sort of thing and being a credit to my people and a whole bunch of stuff like that for you know, spreading napalm on those people over there.  But I eventually did get an honorable discharge, probably about the time because at that time in '68 [1968], the war was so unpopular that if I had been tried I probably would have been found innocent anyway because I was--legally I could get out.  And so it became, are you going to follow an order in the cross training?  No, I'm going to resign.  And so that was the, I guess legal conflict and so I resigned.  And for about ten or fifteen years afterwards I never got in an airplane.  I just wouldn't get in one because of what was happening inside.
Speaker 1: Now 1968 was a pivotal year for you of course but it was also a year when the country, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know that had to affect the morale of the African American soldiers.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah cause I was in the service then as I was in the service as I in when--no, not, when [Robert F.] Kennedy was killed--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that affected because in the south the Kennedys [Robert F. and John F. Kennedy] were blamed for our being officers.
Speaker 1: They were blamed for it, right.
Speaker 2: They were blamed for our being officers cause Colonel Dykes said, "Them Kennedy boys sure did treat you good."  And you know Bobby [Robert] was disliked more than John because Bobby was more impulsive.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And said things that John didn't say as far as what was happening down there.  As Attorney General he [Robert F. Kennedy] was--he had a temper.  And so the people there on base used to accuse me of bring protected by the Kennedy boys.  Said, "Those Kennedy boys sure do treat you good, Davis."  (Laughter).  I said, "Yes, sir."  It was nice.
Speaker 1: They had this lingering suspicion that you were related to the Davises [General Benjamin Davis, Sr. and General Benjamin Davis, Jr.] too, the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, well I never cleared it up.  I'm, as far as I know, I'm not related at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, it's interesting, interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: The south is a--the American military is very southern oriented and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you know about Colonel Dykes, like some of the sergeants didn't really want to obey.  Said to Colonel Dykes, "You have to take my side."  "Well Davis, why don't you do this?"  "Well," I said, "I'm an officer, Sergeant Green is a sergeant.  He comes, tells you about me. You have to discipline him and not me."  And so man yeah, it was rough.  But you got that structure and that's how they were able to cure a lot of the racism in the service.  And then like I was put on the crew with the highest ranking officer in the squadron who outranked Colonel Dykes.  But he couldn't become squadron commander because he couldn't read.  People don't know that sort of thing.  This guy could fly.  His name was Colonel Paladino [John Louis Paladino] and he made battlefield rank in Korea [the Korean War] because they could guy land a plane on 14th Street, he was that good.  And so he went up the ranks but he couldn't read and we would fly into a place and he would--hand me stuff--"Davis, take care of this." And so I never embarrassed him.  And so he never allowed Colonel Dykes to really get his hands on me.  And I went through military with a mustache because Colonel Paladino says, "I never seen a black man without a mustache."  And he protected me from Colonel Dykes.  So I played one against the other because Colonel Paladino outranked Colonel Dykes.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's--this is something.  This is incredible.  So--
Speaker 2: It's all in the adventure.
Story_ID: 106196
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in '68 [1968] now, upon your return to the U.S., you're hired by the Washington Post as a reporter.  Is this immediately or--?
Speaker 2: I worked for a little while as a proofreader out at American University [Washington, D.C.] while I was waiting.  I had written some stories while I was in Vietnam.  Like when we would go close to Da Nang [Vietnam] you would see things burning all over the place you know right outside the base.  And we flew into Da Nang.  You almost had to go straight down into Da Nang because bedcheck Charlie was off the runway and they'd shoot you down.  And you saw these big oil storage they post that were American oil companies and you wondered why they didn't hit those.  And so the story that we got was that they were paying the Viet Cong.  So I said you know, blah, blah, I took pictures, wrote stories, stuff like that.  I turned the stories over to the Washington Post when I got back because the oil companies were conspiring to keep their stuff from getting hit by bedcheck Charlie and the other guys off the ends of the runways there because the most obvious target would have been one of those big storage tanks, right?  And yet, in the middle of all of that they were sitting out there with the name of the American company right on the side.  Man, I had me a ball.  I was just--cause I thought it was like a great expose and stuff like that.  I came back, offered it to the Washington Post.  They set it in type, offered me a job and they never published it.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now this is a era a lot of people are hired by major American newspapers that never took a journalism course--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --during this period of time.  I've interviewed at least five or six people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that have this story.  Right after the riots, after Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--after [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] assassination the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] you know blasted the American press for not having any black reporters--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and all of a sudden they started hiring people.
Speaker 2: But there was another reason.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was a more--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sinister reason.  And it's the reason why I didn't stay at the Washington Post.  They were expected you to report on the black community where they couldn't get in.  And I left the Post when these kids over in northwest or northeast Washington [D.C.], they set up something called the Freedom School.  And they had gotten the Board of Education of Washington [D.C.] to pay for this school.  It was in a church and they weren't allowing any reporters in it.  And me and a reporter from the [Washington Evening] Star, the black reporter from the Star, they allowed us in.  And so the school was doing very poorly.  Volunteer teachers were not showing up, it was chaos.  So I told the reporter at the Star, I said you know if we write this story they're going to kill these kids' school.  I said why don't we not write the story.  And I had the morning paper.  I could have beaten it with a story because the Star was a high noon paper.  So I got back to the thing and the editor asked me, you know like for the story.  I said that ain't no story.  I said I got the names of you know kids who were running this thing and when it becomes a story I'll get the story.  Don't worry about it, that's not a story.  He said well the school board is having a meeting, blah, blah, blah and we need some sort of status report.  And I said it's not a story.  So Ben Bradlee [editor of the Washington Post] came and talked to me for a while.  And I said, Ben, you hired me for my judgment as well as you know doing this thing and I said it's not a story.  The next day the Star ran the story and so I decided to hell with it.  I had already set up something with the New York Times because they had seen you know like some of my reporting and stuff like that and I had been accepted at Columbia.  So I left because the compromise was always going to be there.  That their interests, which they had every right to pursue was different than my interests and I didn't want to be involved in that compromise time after time after time.
Story_ID: 106197
Speaker 1: Where, see for example, there was a reporter who said, told the Washington Post that [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson used off the record, that word "Hymietown."  Those reporters knew a lot of racist comments, white reporters, but they didn't report it or they didn't put them in the paper.  And so it wasn't a fair situation.  They sent me over to cover the hearings on the Chicago Seven [originally the Chicago Eight], right?  Chief FBI agent for Chicago [Illinois] said that the Chicago Seven went over to the south side and tried to get the niggers to join and they didn't join.  And I bolted out of the room, went to the phone because we didn't have the--you had to get the--didn't have cell phones then, and told the Washington Post I had a front page story.  The chief of the Chicago FBI had just used the "N" word in this hearing in Congress.  So they told me go back in and finish covering it and--it was an honor for that small time at the Post for them to even send me over there.  So I went back there and I started covering and then I came back to the [Washington] Post after the hearings were over to see what the re-write person had done with my front page story because I had you know, been dreaming these big headlines across the thing.  And then they told me it wasn't a story. So I understand their interests but my interest was different, I thought it was a story.  And that's the way it came up then.  It came up as about what is significant judgment?  Those kids at, when I was at the [New York] Times those kids at Cornell [University, Hamilton, New York] who had guns on campu--students okay?  The story said they had guns on campus but didn't say that the D.U. [Delta Upsilon] fraternity had shot into a girls' dormitory the night before [sic cross-burning at Wari House (African American women's co-operative house)].  So I said you got to do both.  You got to say--and so, I got you know--but I always had, like I said I fall upstairs.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 106198
Speaker 1: So in this case now, but you leave the [Washington] Post, you go up to the New York Times?
Speaker 2: New York Times and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --then I had that same problem at the New York Times being compromised there by stories like that which was none of my business.  But--'cause I was not on the city side, but I went down, talked to the city editor, I seen a story.  It doesn't say in the story, somewhere else I had read that they-D.U.s [Delta Upsilon fraternity] had shot into the girls' dormitory in Cornell [sic cross-burning at Wari House (African American women's co-operative house)].  And then all of a sudden they got this story about black kids with guns on campus but they didn't say why.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is what you're saying sort of dramatizes the reason why they need some black reporters and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, why they need some black reporters and black editors and they need ones who didn't have the hair trigger that I had.  Yeah.  And I give them a lot of credit for sticking it out, sticking it out through all of those compromises.  They were very difficult for me to do because I would flare up and say um, you know I'm going--
Speaker 1: Oh, you give the black reporters credit for hanging in there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the black reporters for that.
Speaker 1: When--okay, when, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know a lot of them.  I know a lot of them.  They were able to--because that's how we got to where we are, by swallowing a lot of things that we didn't want to swallow, I know that.  It was like being in Savannah [Georgia] and not being able to deal with somebody hitting on me.  Same thing but a lot of respect for people like John Lewis who let it happen.  And that's part of one of the documentaries I recently saw was about the Freedom Riders who came from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] down to--
Speaker 1: Was that Anniston, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yeah, down--
Speaker 1: Yeah, to Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to Anniston and further--
Speaker 1: --and then--yeah.
Speaker 2: They went further down to Birmingham.  Those were the brave people, to allow that we wouldn't have gotten here if those people had not been brave enough to allow themselves to experience that much fear without reacting, without fighting back.  So--but I just couldn't do it.
Story_ID: 106199
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you're in graduate school at Columbia [University, New York, New York] in '69 [1969] and your--well who were some--were there any significant teachers there or--?
Speaker 2: John Oliver Killens.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, the great John Oliver Killens.  Okay, well tell us about--
Speaker 2: John Oliver Killens--well let me put it this way.  I got sixty credits from Columbia, thirty-six of them were with John Oliver Killens (laughter).  And many of them were classes, if you want to call them that, that I took at his house.  John Oliver Killens was probably the most instrumental person in my getting around the difficulties of getting into publishing, getting a book published.  Coming Home probably would not have been published because I wrote Coming Home as my master's thesis in a workshop run by John Oliver Killens because he was at Columbia, he had something you know it was an extension of the Harlem Writers' Guild.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He had a branch of that at Columbia and I was in that.  And he gave me his agent at International Creative Management, introduced me to his agent.  He just did wonders and so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the Harlem Write--give us a little, can you give us a little history of the Harlem Writers' Guild as you understand it?
Speaker 2: It was one of the most influential writing groups to come out of the 1960s.  For a while [HM] Maya Angelou was in it, [HM] Nikki Giovanni [Yolanda Cornelia "Nikki" Giovanni] was in it for a good while, [HM] Walter [Dean] Myers who does children's books was in it.
Speaker 1: Walter Dean Myers.
Speaker 2: Walter Myers was in the one in Columbia, I don't know whether he was in the one at--and those were all things that John Oliver Killens did.  As far as influence on writing that came out of that period, he was one of the most influential.  They met in Harlem and then on I guess it was Tuesday nights we--he had his students mostly at Columbia but he mixed community people in with his students.  And so you didn't get lost in the Ivy towers of Columbia, a very great man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you got your, you earned your--an MFA--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --from Columbia in creative writing?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, and that's in 1971.
Speaker 2: Seventy-One [1971].
Story_ID: 106200
Speaker 1: And what was your novel Coming Home, your--?
Speaker 2: Coming Home was the--
Speaker 1: Project, yeah.
Speaker 2: --project, my master's project and it was accepted by Random House.  And John Oliver Killens allowed me to run the workshop at Columbia for two years, two terms after that.  That's how close John and I were because I was always a student of the narrative of storytelling and stuff like that.  And so that's even more of an influence.  So I taught at Columbia [University, New York, New York] those two semesters because of John [Oliver Killens].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Meanwhile so Random House picked the book up and--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so it's published in 1972?
Speaker 2: Seventy-One [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy-One [1971]?
Speaker 2: The copyright says '71 [1971]  but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think it's February of '72 [1972] that it actually came out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, talk about the novel.  What was the novel about?
Speaker 2: [HM] Charles [F.] Harris, have you heard about that name?  He was a pioneer in publishing.  He was at Random House and he published it.  As I said it was a novel that talked a lot about the racism that was part of the service of African Americans in the military.  But it was really about spiritual people trying to find their place in a society in which--okay, let me put it this way.  When we came into the mainstream we had a little saying, "I'm a spiritual being having an earthly experience."  In the mainstream the configuration was, I'm a material being who sometimes has spiritual experiences.  Those two things came together in Vietnam and that's what the novel was about.  About trying to maintain your spirituality in the face of material necessity and that material necessity was configured by American capitalism to do that war over there.  And the book was a notable book, New York Times in '72 [1972].  It got excellent reviews.  The most reviewers at the time did see the spiritual content because the conflict between the material and the spiritual is not a content--I mean not a conflict that has any racial designation, it's a human struggle.  But that struggle was brought to the surface because African Americans were so recently from places that were dominated by the spiritual aspect.  So all of those things were part of it and so it's about spiritual freedom ultimately.
Story_ID: 106201
Speaker 1: I sold it to a producer for United Artists and I had envisioned a way of doing the book as a film without the cooperation of the Air Force which it would have had to have in order to do it.  And since it wasn't rah, rah American military, I didn't think that was forthcoming.  So I began writing letters to this producer on how it can be done as a homefront story even though about half of the book takes place over there in Vietnam and only half of it takes place here.  But the idea of spiritual freedom carried forward and man I had ideas in my head about doing this.  There was a thing about war.  (Singing the song War).  War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing.  Man, I could just envision the pilots flying with that as a backdrop.  That's not the kind of thing that America does in films.  (Singing).  War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing.  So I was writing these letters out there telling this guy how we really didn't need--we could do all of that in a simulator right?  All the cockpit stuff in the simulator and then the rest of it we could do over here.  And they killed the project.  That was in '72 [1978].  And then '78 [1978] I learned that United Artists was doing the film called Coming Home with Jane Fonda [born Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda, an American actress, writer, political activist, former fashion model, and fitness guru].  And when I finally got a chance to see it, it was about a spiritual freedom of a white female.  In the book the handicapped person was a person who was socially handicapped by being black.  In the film, it was a person who was physically handicapped.  The guy was in a wheelchair.  Other than that, one of the main love triangles was exactly the same.  But United Artists was insisting that they were two separate works.  Same name, same studio, same love triangle, same theme.  We went to court and got our butts whipped because we didn't have enough money to hang on and so the guy who had a law firm who was so incensed by it that he wanted to continue.  There was a settlement offer and I told him go ahead and take the settlement and save your law firm.  And that was the end of it.  For a while, in Wikipedia the write up was, it was based on the book by George Davis.  Now they've changed that.  They say it's by somebody else.  So that's how Coming Home, you know, that's the history of it.  But being a movie-going kind of person yeah I was hurt and--but I still was grappling with the problem of how to depict the relationship between the spiritual and the material realms of existence because I think they are so interlocked.  And in until we understand both of them, it's impossible to understand life.  And the one that is spiritual, we've stopped trying to understand it.  We've cast all over into religious which--
Story_ID: 106202
Speaker 1: So which leads to the question like what--I think we all know what the material world is or at least we're trying to understand it through physics and other--but what is the spiritual world?  What are we talking about?
Speaker 2: The unseen invisible, the aspect of life that is not come into manifestation.  And we has--a sense of that from our religious lives.  But it wasn't until the 19th century that we began to get some sense that there was something out there called a united field of invisible particles.  They're not particles, an energy force that was non-manifested, that created the manifested world.  And so we began to find that much of what the ancients said about spirituals through intuitive knowledge was in fact scientifically provable because quantum theory and mathematical physics deal with the un-manifested.  No one sees that world but they're able to write equations on it.  And it is a bigger analogy when they found out that there's something called the Higgs Boson [or Higgs particle that gives mass to other particles] that creates everything.  They call it the God particle.  See there's a point where things get so small that tangibility and intangibility come together, right?  At that point, see I studied this for ten years at Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey], at that point when the Higgs boson takes that energy field and collides with it, things move into tangibility.  That's why they call it the God particle.  And so along what if the ancients knew and passed down to me and you what our greatest scientific minds are now only beginning to learn, that the manifest world was manifested from an un-manifested energy field which has many of the characteristics of God.  But as much as they put into it back then they gave those characteristics and they anthropomorphized them into a person up there.  But nobody believes that there is a person up there or even whether he's up there.  It is an existence in the intangible realm that generates everything.
Story_ID: 106203
Speaker 1: So I guess a question, just from a layman here sitting here trying to understand this would be, what--I mean, as we try to describe this in a material way, trying to describe the intangible in a material sense, I mean how--what does that mean in terms of how--or how does this relate to a person coming back from Vietnam and trying to fit into--?
Speaker 2: How did I get into this?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well how--yeah, or how does that, I mean how did all this information impact that--
Speaker 2: Well moving over into the material--
Speaker 1: --reentry yeah, into--?
Speaker 2: Moving over into the material world I had always had some questions about whether to give up the spiritual side of life and yet that spiritual side of life was so grounded in religion that brought along with it so many things that I did not go along with, so many things that didn't work for me.  But I didn't want to give up the power of it, the power of the human spirit, the power of my spirit, the power of the spirited.  And so is there an intelligent way to think about this and see how this, the spirit, impacts the material?  And so I started something at Rutgers [University, Newark, Jersey] called the Spiritual Intelligence Action Research Project and I began studying spiritual traditions, defined parallels between what people knew intuitively back in those spiritual traditions and what people were finding out in quantum reality, this reality that they could write equations about now.  And that was inspired by a book called The Tao of Physics [by Fritjof Capra].  And The Tao of Physics found parallels between Eastern mysticism and physics.  And what I wanted to go back to is a more ancient mysticism because Eastern mysticism--I am a believer in the out of Africa theory and Eastern mysticism was the mysticism that came out of Africa and went that way toward India whereas part of it went further straighter north into Egypt and the Middle East.  And so if you go back, if all of those came from this African mysticism--
Story_ID: 106204
Speaker 1: Now where would this African mysticism originate?  Which one--what are you talking--?
Speaker 2: It is the legacy of human beings that came from our not knowing ourselves to be separate from all creation.  Meaning that the oldest sense of being human was that we were here like trees, here like birds, here like--the separation from us from the rest of nature came much later.  We were a part of nature.
Speaker 1: So you're saying an African, I mean I was trying to--
Speaker 2: It's a primal world view rather than an African world view.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It's only African because the primal origin is in Africa and this is what people originally believed.  For example, we did some experiments with it in the Spiritual Intelligence Action Research and I asked students take yourself back to being a very primitive person without any science and anything.  If you saw trees move you would think that something moved them.  Or if you saw this, if you saw that and so we did a lot of experimentations on what the primal impulse was.
Speaker 1: For--or rather somebody moving around there than just something (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, the tree is right over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: If the tree moves then--
Speaker 2: It moves--
Speaker 1: --they--
Speaker 2: --it grows.  Things happen to it and so there is something intangible that's making that happen.  See, and you can still pick it up in a western scientific way of seeing the world and a way that's still exists in the world in Africa which I was discovering when I was over there in the 1960s.  For example, a person in the West would say, I tripped over that stick.  An African would say, well that stick tripped me.  And if you notice the diff--it's the same thing and yet it's different.  One gives the stick volition.
Speaker 1: That's what in the old encyclopedias that I used to read was described as a, they used to describe African religion as animism.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Or the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are the categories that they try to put it in but the categories that in the Spiritual Intelligence Action Research, what I did was have students--I said everything that was in your ancestors is still in you.  Imagine yourself back then and if you saw a tree move, if you saw a brook moving, if you saw this happening, if you saw a bird growing, if you--I mean plants growing and things like that, what would you as a person way back then think was happening?  You would think that there was something in that, the spirit.  Africans still believe that there is spirit in everything, even though some--the more western ones don't bring it out but they believe it.  And then too, if we go on a spectrum, African Americans believe it more than the most scientific Americans believe.  Carl Sagan believed that it was nothing to that.  There are others who are spiritually oriented who believe that things do have that intangible thing and then all of a sudden--an intangible part.  And then all of a sudden we learn from quantum theory, subatomic physics, mathematical physics that yeah there are some things that can be known about stuff that is not manifested.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm not quite sure I still understand it but I, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 1: --I had to say--
Speaker 2: You say it sounds good, huh?
Story_ID: 106205
Speaker 1: Well it's, it's the kind of thing that I don't know if I could make a--
Speaker 2: Or whether it matters?  It matters in that what I am able to account for is my sense of being a spiritual being, having an earthly experience and therefore everything that happens in this realm does not affect this because there is a place in each of us that has never been hurt, harmed or endangered, that is the spirit.  And this stuff does not, I mean if you can get away to that.  And you know we have various forms and ways you know meditation, prayer, of getting away to that, this has less effect.  And I think that one of the ways that Africans survived slavery was to be able to get away from this and live in that now.  They were not looking for heaven when I die through incantation, through spirituals, through song and this and that, they could actually live in that and move away from that.  Now it's not always a good thing because you have a tendency if you live in the spirit to not want to work as hard to change the material realm.  But when those two things come together, they're extremely powerful.  And I think [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King lived in this because if you notice, look through all of the photographs with Dr. King and you find very few if any in which he's really stressed, in which there's anguish on his face. And I think that's the most remarkable thing about him, his ability to live in the spirit, to--because they're carrying him off to jail, there's no anguish on his face.  I said wow, that's very, very powerful.  And I think it's how he is the hyperbolic example of how we survived as a people because slavery could have done some damage that it didn't do because we were able to live in the spirit.  When I used to go to Georgia, my Uncle Archie would vote during the 1940s and '50s [1950s], right?  And my Aunt Lucy would put all the kids outside when he would get in his truck or whatever and go into town to vote.  And she would be in the house humming and then when he would come back safe, she would allow the kids in the house.  But until then she was communing with the spirit and it made it possible for all that fear that must have been there to be endured.  And my mom was like that and a lot of the older women in the church they would hum.  And in that humming, they were not fully present in this disaster that was happening, so that's the value of it.
Story_ID: 106206
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So your, your writing is about the transcending of the material world in a sense or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's being able to be an agent in the material world but also to be transcendent of it so it doesn't affect you in the same way.  Or I don't think [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] could have stood as much as he stood if he had not been able to transcend because some pretty frightening things.  And then you look at his picture, you say, wow, this guy's face is calm.  There's anguish on some of the other peoples' face but not on his.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a couple--it's once I saw him when he was hit by that rock in Cicero.
Speaker 2: Got him.
Speaker 1: That kind of shook him up and you could see it in his face.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But he made a, he seemed to as you said being able to transcend what was going on around him in some you know mentally or however.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it goes back to that primal thing, you are you in the world--you're not in the world, the world is in you.  And anything that is in the world that you're not--forgive is something in you that is unforgiven.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's another story that I think Taylor Branch tells, I hadn't seen it anywhere else about a white man that walked up to the pulpit and slapped Dr. King and Dr. King got up and he hit him, but before he could hit him again the reverends present had tackled this fellow and started beating--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know these non-violent reverends but it was--
Speaker 2: Taylor Branch is a good historian.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's a great historian because he does get into the spiritual value of the experience.
Story_ID: 106207
Speaker 1: So now, so Coming Home, how did Coming Home as a novel do?
Speaker 2: It sold, not well.  As I said it was well-reviewed.  It was a notable book of the year.  It was taught in some courses but the whole film thing is something that I put behind me and start moving towards some other stuff.  And the next one was Love, Black Love, which I was then doing some work with Essence [Magazine] back in the very early days when [HM] Marcia Gillespie was running Essence.  Marcia Gillespie and I were good friends and so I used to do some writing for Essence and so Love, Black Love was in Essence and it was very successful there.  And then I did Black Life in Corporate America, which was the only book that really sold extremely well.  It sold and it was really about how does African man live in Babylon without losing himself?  How do people like my brothers live in IBM without losing themselves?
Speaker 1: Or Bell Labs or--?
Speaker 2: Or Bell Labs or--yeah, IBM was worse because it was the most regimented environment and the thing, Bell Labs had some freedom because of--you know the scientists are actually--
Speaker 1: They have a collegial--
Speaker 2: --freer--
Speaker 1: --environment. Yeah.  And a scientific mind is not as structured as the sales mind in IBM.  IBM was whew!  So it was about the human spirit surviving in a (unclear) house and it was a book that had a lot of crossover appeal because when we'd go around to speak at corporations there were white managers who would say, I feel like that, you know.  That's true about me too, blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah.  And so we were offered teaching courses at nearly every business school in the country and we took a teaching job at Yale School of organization and management and created the first course on corporate diversity at any university in the country.  What that course was really about was what happens in these places where things are structured and repetitious and when the human spirit is constructed in another way.  And it's going to be very important in the future it seems to me because most of the people in the world are still, very inspirited in one form or another and as western civilization moves, the big subliminal quest is going to be to bring that all together.
Speaker 2: And Karl Marx [philosopher, social scientist, historian and revolutionary] talked about the fundamental alienation of the worker being a contradiction that was eventually going to blow up.  To--
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: --expect a person's human nature to accept a humdrum job--
Speaker 1: Dull existence.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and per--you know into perpetuity is a recipe for explosion.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 106208
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is what--and what's going to happen now is all of these people from say--because the migration of people into Western culture now they come from everywhere.  Most of those people are still believing in the primary nature of spiritual existence and that spiritual existence is sometimes contained in a religion as in the Muslims or something like that.  But it is still not secular as the Western world is.  And we accommodate this country can accommodate that better because this country is more of a mixture than Europe is.  Europe is much more secular than we are and so the model for the fusion between people who are inspirited and people who are of the material world almost totally is here in this country.  So it gives me a way of being very optimistic about the future even while I am seeing all this stuff going on.  All this confusion that's going on seems to me to be a--growing pains for the human spirit as it moves into some sort of fusion between the material aspect and the spiritual aspect and that's scientifically supported, those--that fusion.
Speaker 2: Now let's back track a little bit.  Now you taught at Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --before you wrote Black Life in Corporate America.
Speaker 1: I was--
Speaker 2: Was that--?
Speaker 1: --there at the same time.
Speaker 2: Same time you were writing it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  And then the book is published in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Was it?  Yeah, '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-Two [1982], and becomes a non-fiction best seller.  And--
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  I be--started at Rutgers in '80 [1980] and so I guess I was more there than not.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And now you had a co-author, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What I did was, the co-author is [HM] Glegg Watson.  He was at Xerox [Corporation] and I needed an inside view of what the life inside was like cause I've never worked for a major corporation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I didn't want to do the superficial thing that I could have done with the interviews that I did.  You know, see a lot of that was back to the interviews that I was talking about, first black here, first black there, first black there, yeah.  A lot of material was based on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And they do, those stories do start to jive together, I mean they make a lot of sense, since you got--you know, I've heard a lot of the same stories.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Our archive has a lot of the first black and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in many in--situations, corporate situations.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I thought of a book called, First. It was going to be just called, First, because when we were coming along, I guess I'm what, a few years older than you.  But when we were coming along I was always reading someone who was a first.  I'm the first black person who--could be anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, began with the first Negroes and then--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --then the first Black--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --first African American.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  "I was the first Negro who tried on shoes at an Atlanta department store."  Because usually had to take the shoes home and try them on and bring them back.  You couldn't try them on right in the store.  So I ran into the first person who claims and there are probably about five or six of them who claimed that they were the first to do this, the first to do that.  And it was like a little joke we had when we were real young, you know, cause they had the white fountain and the black fountain you know.  And you would sneak over, get something from, water from the white fountain and then you would tell the other black kids that they reason why they don't want us to have that is they got lemonade in there.  [Laughter].  See, racism was a joke until it got serious and one of your friends got lynched and then it wasn't a joke.  Lynch was something that everybody was doing, but they needed an example.  And that is my memory of the South.
Story_ID: 106209
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], the Yale experience, now how did that--I mean did they, did you get a call one day from Yale about--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the students were suffering from various kinds of alienation at Yale because Yale is an alienating place as it is.  So they were reading the book then I went up there for a faculty conference to decide whether they were going to offer this course.  And I didn't know after the conference whether they were going to accept it and I came home and my daughter says, Daddy, they're going to do it.  And she has power.  She knows things.  It's like my mom knew things.  You know how people know things?  My mom knew things and my daughter is kind of like my mom and sometimes she thinks she is.  And on some spiritual level, there may be a lot happening with that.  But my mom knew things.  My father was educated but my mom just knew stuff about the way the world was put together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So during this period of time, during the I guess, mid '80s [1980s] to the mid '90s [1990s], are you basically earning money as a consultant or are you working as (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I was tenured at Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right that makes sense then.  So in '90 [1990], you founded the Spiritual Intelligence Action Research Project, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I wanted to maintain the power that I saw coming from my background, the spiritual way of sustaining yourself, the spiritual way of looking at stuff.  And yet, so much in what I was supposed to do that is becoming a Christian minister, I couldn't believe in because it didn't work that way.  The world doesn't work that way.  But there are--but I didn't want to give that up, I wanted to find ways in which the scientific world and the spiritual world could interact intelligently and that's why it's called Spiritual Intelligence.
Speaker 1: Now had you been taking instruction as a Christian minister or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just one of those things where--
Speaker 1: You were just saying that (unclear).
Speaker 2: --the women in the church say, That boy gonna be a preacher.  Just because--you know they can pick out what people could be or going to be in the church.  He's going to be a this and he's going to be a that and they were just reading personalities.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've heard that kind of thing, he's got a head for a preacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Cause I could recite these scriptures but I recited the scriptures to get favor from my mother and there weren't memory, they were just--[HM] Al Sharpton [Alfred Charles "Al" Sharpton, Jr. is an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist, television/radio talk show host and a trusted White House adviser] says that when he was a kid he could do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Spiritual Intelligence Action Research Project, or Sharp--or SIARP, yeah, so tell us well, you know what were you actually doing?
Speaker 2: Well I began reading ancient texts from the Middle East, from the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhist text, all sorts of swamis and this and that from over there and then getting into the Bible, not as a sacred text but as really trying to understand what it was saying and the wisdom it was saying and how certain things in the Bible could conform to what these new discoveries were in quantum theory.  I--because the Indians had gone a long way toward uniting physics and spirituality, I did a lot of that reading.  And so it was mostly about that but it was also about experimentation.  We had some huge experiments while I was doing that because the basic idea, one of the basic ideas is that change what is in you and the world will change.
Story_ID: 106210
Speaker 1: People say how is that true?  So we had to experiment to show how it's true.  If you have a positive thought the world will become more positive.  If you have negative thought, the world will become more negative.  So I wrote a book called Soul Vibrations:  Astrology for African Americans.  And I was using it in the Newark [New Jersey] school system that if a child found out for example, a young boy who had attention, claimed he had attention deficit disorder, had some sort of congenial state and all of a sudden he finds out that he's born on the same day as [HM] Colin Powell, and so you get the kid to do a report on [HM] Colin Powell and you find out that from his strict Jamaican family background and his military training he was able to channel that.  And then there's one little girl in class and nobody believed she could sing and all of a sudden she found she was born on the same day as Patti LaBelle [Patricia Louise Holte-Edwards, American singer, author and actress]. From then on, nobody could tell her that she could not sing.  So it was a role-modeling tool that--
Speaker 2: Could she, I mean but could she sing though?  Did other people think she could sing?
Speaker 1: [Laughter].  That wasn't the point.  The point was you can change the outer world once the inner world has been changed.  She could--she would work harder to sing better if she knew that kind of encouragement.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So Soul Vibrations was--I had a website and we sent out thousands of soul vibrations every day, every morning with a positive thought.  Start your day with a positive thought.  And people thought they were astrology but people would make them true, which is one of the ways that astrology works.  If I say something is true about you and it's good, which is--these things were always positive--then you are going to look for that in the external world.  And so people would write back and say, how did you know that?  That is so accurate.  That is so true.  But they made it true.
Story_ID: 106706
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just trying to, we were talking about the--off camera about the nature of astrology and whether it's--
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: --true or not, yes.
Speaker 2: In the category that I believe, true is not the point.  The point really is there is some sort of--we all live in an energy field and so the planets do affect us.  If people 5,000 years ago began cataloging those effects around dates, then that is one level on which it is true.  But that's not the level that we dealt with.  We dealt with a level on people will make it true.  If you tell somebody that it's like telling a little boy that you know, you're a leader and just a leader, you're a leader, you're a Capricorn, you are a leader.  And then you see all the people who are Capricorns were leaders, right?  That boy will start to identify [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], blah, blah, blah, whoever will start to identify with that and he will make it true.  So in the timeless realm where astrology exists, people do make things true.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this website, the Soul Vibrations website is not up any--?
Speaker 2: No, I took it down.  You know what I had over in India, until they, there was something else that was a part of the Spiritual Intelligence Action--it was called Daily Mantra.  Send somebody out, a mantra every morning, it was sent through their cell phones and it ran up until the--India has the biggest cell phone infrastructure problem because they had so many cell phones.  They would send out this daily mantra and it would say, your smile is a radiant beam to all you meet, everyone you meet today.  A person would make that true.  The sunshine that is somewhat can be the sunshine that falls on you today.  It's the power of the mind that is separate from your physical existence.  And we were getting Soul Vibrations, that's how Soul Vibration was in India, it wasn't astrology.  And the telecommunications people made it impossible to use commercial messaging in India because the infrastructure was overloaded, so many cell phones.
Story_ID: 106707
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1998, you published Love Lessons:  African Americans and Sex Romance and Marriage in the Nineties.  Now what was the--?
Speaker 2: That was a book that was kind of a follow up on Love, Black Love.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we didn't talk about Love, Black Love either.  So maybe we can speak about them in tandem here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--yeah.
Speaker 2: Love, Black Love was a book based on interviews but those interviews were turned into fictional short stories that were about people trying to love each other.  It did extremely well.  It was a cover story in Essence [Magazine].  And I was telling you that was back in a time when I was close to [HM] Marcia Gillespie and she said that it drew more reader's mail than any article in the first twenty years of--I like it a lot because I did it before I began to study spirituality.  And so the spirituality that is in it is below the surface. But it was all about how do you really love each other in a spiritual way?  And the spiritual way, I don't mean religious I mean the fusion of one person with another.  I mean in a materialistic way what you learn and what I was getting used to is you got something, I got something, we create a marriage and our material well-being is based on what you bring and what I bring.  At the time I didn't see that as a reason for love.  The reason for love was what can I say--was a feeling and that feeling fails.  It fails a lot but it was the reason.  I feel this way about him or I feel this way about her.  And so I get married but the parts don't fit because it was all--it didn't base enough on that material aspect.  So that's what it was when we went back and took a look at some of the things in Love Lessons, I'll give you an example of one of the things.  There was an African girl I interviewed in and that, and she says maybe it would have been better if my mother had chosen my husband because it's not based on feelings, it's based on her perception of her daughter and her perception in the tribe of another guy.  These two belong together.  And that's not something that you can work out in a modern democracy but it's a good story to make us think about some of the reasons why we get together with a woman and call it love and it's all feelings and not enough the practical consideration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's Love, Black Love, right?
Speaker 2: That's Love Lessons.
Speaker 1: Is that Love Lessons, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's a continuum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's say, yeah, one--it was twenty years later looking at some of the transformation that took place in the kinds of people who were in the first book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did this book do (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It didn't do well at all because as with all of my books there is the problem of not wanting to present what publishers want me to present.  There was an editor at William Morrow who was very, very dissatisfied with the book because the book did not deal with the kinds of things that the stereotype says that black relationships were.  She wanted you know all of that and it probably would have sold well.  So she had her right and I had mine and so they were bound to publish it, they thought they were going to get something else, you know, all the kinds of crazy stuff that is a part of African American relationships and it didn't turn out that way.  And so they published it and dumped it.
Story_ID: 106708
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so all right.  So now what about the "Modern Melting Pot" in 2002?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--I wrote the--an article as I said "The Racial Integration of the American Mind".  It was really about the racial integration of the American spirit.  But it was Psychology Today and they deal with the mind and they like to call it that.  And so I wrote it for them.  It was too long for them and so they gave me a blog so that I could work out some of those ideas.  And a lot of those ideas early on were about the spiritual meaning of the Obama [Barack Hussein Obama II, 44th President of the United States] presidency because we can all think of what the meanings on the surface were, but I had some ideas about how the world was coming together.  But we're getting ahead of--I can talk about that later on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's an outgrowth--but the "Modern Melting Pot" blog began in 2002, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Psychology Today.  And it just challenged stuff.  It challenged stuff like, well I did a lot of stuff later on in--no, it wasn't 2002.  Does it say 2002 in the research?
Speaker 1: It does here but it doesn't necessarily, it's not necessarily true.  I mean you know--
Speaker 2: No, it was later.
Speaker 1: You know, okay so it was later.
Speaker 2: It was probably closer to 2005 or six.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is just--
Speaker 2: And it was based on--
Speaker 1: --before the Obama campaign--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the--okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm
Speaker 1: Okay, so 2000--say it's in 2006 (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Five or six, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: So that's leading to the Obama campaign--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --cause it starts in 2007 actually.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah it did and it certainly did for this blog.  What happened was there were a lot of people when [HM] Obama announced, this obscure person with this name that could not--how in the world is this guy going to be president of the United States.  His name is Barack Hussein Obama?  But Oprah [Oprah Gail Winfrey, an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist] said that he was the one.  I began to believe that he was going to win.  This was as early as 2007.  People who see things and have spiritual insights began to believe that he was going to win.  And so that's how it eventually got around to doing a lot of the blog posts on him but that really started with that old essay, the "Racial Integration of the American Spirit", that the spirit of America is not white and not black, it is a amalgam.  And black America and white America was ceasing more and more and more to exist as separate spiritual entities.  And that you know there was all sorts of back and forth so that's what I was writing about.  It was evolutionary psychology in their view--how this--but to me it was spiritual evolution.  Because once the human race was one, and spiritual evolution would eventually, it would be one again.  We'll all be together, everything.  Those separations that came about because of the great migration out of Africa and then different people taking great, different courses, they were valuable and they were good.  But you outlive the usefulness of them and that's the point we've reached now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So (unclear).
Speaker 2: So they'll come back together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's not a--is it happening at the pace you think it should or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well in the kind of thinking that I do, I would like it on a practical side to happen faster.  But I am--no I don't like it but it's perfect.  That's the status report on it.  I don't like it but it's perfect.  I wish it would happen faster, but it's perfect.
Story_ID: 106709
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we skipped over Spiritual Intelligence, the monograph that was published in 2005.
Speaker 2: Yeah that was all about the [Spiritual Intelligence] Action Research [Project].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the report on the Action Research Project.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the best part of that project was having students at Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey] travel back in time and think of what our most primal urges were, how we--if we had not, or science hadn't happened, this hadn't happened, that hadn't happened, what would this mean to you, what would that mean to you?  So yeah that's what the monogram is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people use a different mind depending on what they thought was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --real, yeah.  Okay, now in--now you were at Rutgers long enough to become professor emeritus, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And when did that take place?  What are the--?
Speaker 2: Two thousand five.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five, okay, all right.  So this is--all right.  And well, tell us now, this is a long time span as a teacher and tell us about some of your students and what they--some of them (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well I was a creative writing teacher, I had a lot of success at it.  I got undergraduates' novels published at Random House and Harcourt Brace [now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt] and a whole bunch of places like that because the whole process was about self discovery.  I didn't actually teach, I drew out in you know some sort of ways you know like, what is your story?  And then get people to tell what their story was and Rutgers was dissatisfied with me but once I had tenure there wasn't much they could do.  And they gave me professor emeritus status after I left because that was the terms under which I would leave.  They were very happy to get rid of me because I just approached things in very different ways.  I taught classes in which I did not correct students on their papers or anything like that.  And I had all these crazy theories about how best to get a student from here to there without putting red marks on their papers, that what I wanted to do was find out what story was inside of you and I can draw that story out.  The best way for me to do that is not to say negative things about any of it and I don't care whether you can spell or not.  This is not that kind of course.  I don't care this--I just want you to tell me this, tell me that, tell me that.  Okay, put it down on paper.  And I taught a creative writing class in a computer lab.  There's no such thing as writer's block.  Write and you're going to discover after a while that the stuff you think is not good is better than some of the stuff you think is good.  Just write.  The writing is hard work and you get up and you write.  And that's what I do.  I get up every morning and I write, whether I feel like writing or not.  There were a whole lot of--in that whole spiritual intelligence action research they really dislike that.  And so it was an uneasy peace and sometimes it wasn't peace.  It was an uneasy relationship but I got a lot out of it because I enjoyed the students and was able to do a lot of good for them because it was all about, almost totally about positive reinforcement.  And colleges are into critical thinking and I used to get on the faculty meetings and say that a more important function is appreciative thinking, you know.  (Laughter).  That didn't make sense but I used to argue it anyway.  Tell a student what's good about him or her and harp on it.  And you'll get further than telling the student what's wrong.
Speaker 1: I can't argue with you on that.  I think it, I think you--there may, you know there's a lot of good (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's way things should be taught.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then when they're wrong according to you, give them something to read like I was taught.  But they're going to come out of that reading in a different place than I came out of that same reading.  But I want them to be exposed to that.  And once they're exposed to that, they will find a way.  But the people at Rutgers because professors at Rutgers could not get contracts at Random House, Harcourt Brace and there.  And I had these undergraduates who were not good in school, let's put it that way, didn't have all of the equipment, but they had stories.  And you don't kill somebody's story by trying to get them to write in a certain way you just pull that story out.  But what did you feel about your brother?  Or--see, that kind of question is more important than any kind of question that has to do with technique.
Story_ID: 106710
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you still involved in Harvard--the Harlem Writers' Guild during this period?
Speaker 2: I had a summer program over in New York [New York] for a part of that time, Harlem Youth Writing Workshop in which I was teaching, Columbia [University, New York, New York] gave me some space to bring these kids in and teach them during the summer.  You know, they put together a magazine.  And so I've always involved in having people tell their story.
Speaker 1: Now are there any you know, I guess examples you can give us in some of the students and some that you've taught that you, that you're proud of that you want to tell--?
Speaker 2: Well when Walter Dean Myers started he was in the workshop I taught with John [Oliver] Killens.  Kuwana Haulsey who did a book called Red Moon and a book on Dr. May Chinn [Angel of Harlem], she was there.  There were quite a few students who got you know, but it was all based a lot on how John Killens was with me.  As I took, as I said I took thirty-six out of sixty hours in graduate school with John Killens and it was never a corrective process it was like just listening and getting me to get it out.  It's like--but the story is still in your head, you didn't get it out and then you struggle to get it out and that's the only real struggle.  And so that would be the kinds of things that happened you know with the students there at Rutgers.  It all carried over.
Speaker 1: So was Walter Dean Myers a student of yours?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, at Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A prolific writer and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He writes about so many subjects.  I mean they're novels for youth primarily, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's primarily yeah, a youth novelist but I think he was awarded a Library of Congress citation for young adult novels.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe so.  He's, I know I consider him the best.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know.  Yeah, well we interviewed Walter Dean Myers and he's a very impressive individual.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is.
Speaker 1: And he came from a humble background with a speech impediment and a lot of other problems.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a very eager guy.  (Laughter).  Yeah, yeah, very, very eager, let's put it that way.
Story_ID: 106711
Speaker 1: Well I don't want to pass--if I'm skipping over something tell me.  We--I've got a chronological outline here and I'm not--it doesn't cover everything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But 2011, you published Barack Obama, America and the World and--right, is that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was trying to get into a new way of looking at, trying to find out what people around the world thought about this phenomenon and looking at it in a spiritual way.  What I did was use the "Modern Melting Pot" at Psychology Today, to get reactions from all around the world you know in the commentary parts of the blogs.  And then I got someone to edit the blog and edit the commentary and shape it so that it gave a different picture of what was going on.  And what was going on to me is that Barack Obama is not black-- He's not black, he's not white and he was raised in the most Asian part of our country.  The three great races of the world unite with him in ways that they will in the future unite with us as a people, Americans, and with the world, the coming together of all of that because he spent what, his formative years in a place that was 74% Asian.
Speaker 1: Hawaii, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hawaii is about seventy-four, and then Indonesia is even more Asian, it's 95%, and so part of it was a thing called Obama-R-Us as in Toys-R-Us, that Obama represents the fusion of who we are as a people, humans.  And that human transformation--but let me go back to 2007 when he announced and all of these people who saw things spiritually said that he was going to win.  Oprah being--and I think Oprah is one of the people who sees spiritual things better than anybody I know of.  And she said, he's the one, he's going to win.  People didn't think he was going to win and then there is always the question like I said, how in the world does someone, Barack Hussein Obama become president of this country, especially at a time when we were fighting Saddam Hussein and it just could not happen in terms of a material explanation of it.  And if you look around at what people from spiritual sides of life were saying, it all came back to some way in which there was some mass intervention from the spiritual side of life in order for that to happen, that he has some sense of that.  He has some sense of that because he fuses it himself, the African, the European and the Asian.  He fuses in some of the things that he says, when he went over there to Egypt and he saw that statue and he said, that guy looks like me, you know.  It's one of those statues.  He says things that indicate--and Michelle lets things out that make you think he's a kind of a special person.  I believe that there are special people in the world.  I think that he's one.  I think that Oprah is one and they can see things and they--the material world doesn't affect them in the same way that it affects most of us and that they're in touch with that other side of life in certain kinds of ways.  And so I began writing about that.  I began writing about the perception that Obama is this flaming liberal and he's not.  You know because in our race if you're too liberal you couldn't marry a woman like Michelle Robinson.  That's conservative.  We are as African American people, much more conservative than the popular culture makes us out to be.  She was not going to fool around with somebody who was way out there in la-la land, right?  There are a whole lot of reasons, the way he raises his kids and the way they raise their kids, they're conservative.  The word conservative has drifted and it's drifted to a bunch of causes that had nothing to do with the basic beliefs of people.  Conservative is a way of being in the world.  So Newt Gingrich [Newton Leroy "Newt" Gingrich, an American politician, historian, author and political consultant] says he's a conservative but a conservative doesn't spend $500,000.00 at a store on Fifth Avenue [in New York, New York].  The personality structure is not conservative.  Many of those people are not conservative.  But personality structure, he is conservative and his wife is conservative.  And so I began writing all these things and stuff like that and getting good comments from all the people that--the president he most, is most similar too in my columns was Eisenhower, he was an Eisenhower [Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States] Republican.  (Laughter).  Whole bunch of crazy stuff like that.  He's not liberal, not as liberal as people claim he is.
Story_ID: 106712
Speaker 1: But liberalism and decency are two different things.  He's a very decent man.  And so much--and but there is conservatism in decency.  My mom [Winnie Rose Davis] was conservative but she was very decent.  And much of what is paraded as conservativism now is indecency it has nothing to do with conservative.  And so you know I was writing all this stuff. That's what Barack Obama, America and the World is about.  I was getting reactions from all over the place, I was editing those reactions and you know the first part of the--I was going to publish it in five volumes and it was going to be online, an e-book.  I published the first one and then things started to change.  The first one was The Rapidly Dying Fear of a United Planet.  Because what voters decided by electing that guy president was that they were willing to have it all come together okay, and so after the first one he got into so much of the implementation in the real world that--
Speaker 2: You mean the first term?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that the spiritual, the magic left him because I thought Rush Limbaugh [Rush Hudson Limbaugh, III] and them were right to a certain extent when they were making fun of him, Barack, the Magic Negro.  And part of what I was saying in the column is that we can all be magic if we are able to tap into the spiritual truth of our nature.  And his enemy saw something about him that they wanted to ridicule but I thought the election was magic.
Story_ID: 106218
Speaker 1: All right.  So well tell us about The Melting Points.  This is written in 2012, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After I shelved the Obama project [Barack Obama, America and the World] after the first one came out, The Rapidly Dying Fear of a United Planet, it came off of that thing by the rap group, I forgot, Fear of a Black Planet [1990 album by Public Enemy].  It was a takeoff on that.  And then what I wanted to do was do a novel about the spiritual nature of reality in an espionage novel.  That wrapped up a lot of what I had began to explore in Coming Home.  Three women, African American women on a Caribbean island are set upon by spies from all, a lot of countries who tail them around the Island of St. Kitts.  They think they have a secret that they are interested in, a national secret that they're going, they come down there to sell because one of the women was married to a guy who was into some stuff.  And so it's all about these people following these women around and getting in touch with their nature and getting in touch with who they really were as people.  And the secrets that are supposed to be on this disk that everybody is looking for are really some secrets that are in their hearts because there is no disk.  But it all plays out like they're looking for some stuff on these disks.  And so, I wrote that, got very, very good reaction to it.  And it led to a look at the entire world in terms of a balance between the spiritual and the material.  That's what The Bay is Dying is, that you cannot solve the problems of our ecology until you begin to see nature is sacred and begin to see ourselves as inseparable from it.  Because if we do not, we will, our separation from nature and our building all of this stuff and using nature for this and using nature for that was in a lot of cases abusing it.  And that is a sub--below the level of that project.  But in order to get the project done, I got a lot of writers from around the world.  I got labs from over in the UK [United Kingdom] were going to turn the writing into--it's group authored, turn the writing into multimedia content.  I've been pestering IBM about getting involved with Watson [Analytics] and the serious gamification program.  And when I go back I have a letter into the Woodrow Wilson Foundation [Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars] to see whether they're going to do something with it, the condi--the Conservative--Conservation International has already said that they would allow data from there, the environmental index, performance index said they--and we were going to take all of this data on the environment and subject it to big data analytics and players would play with this because it's a game.  But decision makers inside of major companies would also be able to use data from it in decision making as you--as we push sustainability toward profitability or vice versa.
Story_ID: 106219
Speaker 1: So this way of seeing the world has led to these places out there in this project and people are attracted, IBM's serious game initiative, Woodrow Wilson Found--Center, all of those are attracted.  But whether we can turn the corner on it and get it done always becomes the problems with the stuff that I do because it's kind of far out.  And yet to me, clear and true that unless we begin to see ourselves as connected to nature, we can't save the planet.  But you can't say that to somebody at IBM.  You can't say that to somebody who's worried about profit.  You can't, certainly can't say it to an oil company, but gradually we're moving toward that and this project is a game that will get some of the fusion to take place.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did--what are you working on now at--?
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: That's what I'm working on.
Speaker 2: This is--okay.
Speaker 1: When I go home I hope to have the answer back from the Woodrow Wilson Center.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm working on that currently.
Story_ID: 106220
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a--what project do you envision another, I mean a next project after this?
Speaker 2: No, I'm going to rest after that. I mean like that's all.  I'm seventy-four years old and God and spirit has been good, but I got grandchildren you know.  I wouldn't mind spending time being--because we didn't talk about Branches.  See, I have this strange writing history.  Branches: From We Shall Overcome to Yes We Can, I did it right after the election.  I was doing it at the same time I was doing the other projects.  But I had been out in Hollywood before that and I have a picture that--of me with my griot hat and everything out there.  Oprah [Winfrey] was on board to do it as a television thing.  It was based on my great admiration for Alex Haley [Alexander Murray Palmer "Alex" Haley] on a level of a writer.  Because Alex Haley to me didn't write a book about slavery, he wrote a book about the transcendence of slavery, which is really--which is different.  That's why the book was able, to my mind, to capture the entire world because it took us back to that place where we were connected to everything.  And so I wrote Branches at that time, I wrote--you know, cause I get up every morning and I write.  And I don't spend a great deal of time worrying about the fate of what I was doing.  I was out in Hollywood, Oprah was on board, a guy named [HistoryMaker]Reuben Cannon was producing or going to produce it.  And they wanted to make it about victimhood.  It's about five, eight people who graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in the class of 1965.  [President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson spoke to their graduating class and said that they would have the same chance as all other Americans to achieve the American dream.  And so it's about these eight people leaving Howard to go out in America searching for the American dream in '65 [1965].  It was semi-fictional, it's based on those interviews that I was taking, the "First" interviews and stuff like that, but I fictionalized all of that, what happened as black people went into all of these areas.  And so it went up until 1985, till we got into a kind of despair because the counterrevolution, the Reagan counterrevolution had placed black America into despair because it was going to turn back.  And as we've see it had started, it started actually to turn back on some of the gains that were in--they started in 1980 and it's been marching backwards since.  And so I was out there to do the book and the book was turning into victimhood to do the book as a TV thing.  And a guy at Simon Schuster [Simon & Schuster, publisher] wanted me to re-write it.  I had already re-written it and it was not about victimhood, it was not about our being victimized from 1965 to 1985, even though the ending of it was this setback.  And so I found a way to get out of the contract and I just waited with faith that another chance would come again.  When 2007 came around, I started re-writing it and that's when the re-write came as--from, because the first book was called Branches, the Human Spirit in Search of the American Dream.  And I knew it was going to be difficult representing the human spirit in black skin so there were all sorts of problems with that book.  The new one that I re-wrote, the new re-write brings it all the way up to 2008, it's called Branches, From We Shall Overcome to Yes We Can.  And so Washington City Council voted a couple of times to make it but they haven't been able to get it done.  And it was one of the reasons why I stationed myself in Washington [D.C.] because of the prospect, whether it will be done, who knows.
Story_ID: 106221
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's still being considered?
Speaker 2: At Washington City Council, yeah.  They said yeah we want to do this.  Because it looks at black life in an entirely different way.  We, when we--'60s [1960s] were exciting and there was a lot of persecution, prosecution and all of that.  But what I remembered was like I'll give you an Ebony editorial and it said, "It's great to be a Negro."  That was the headline on one of those editorials.  It was a great time because we thought we were going to change the world.  Everything was possible.  We came from those little, small places and all of a sudden you know, I worked at two newspapers in my life, The New York Times, Washington Post.  The world opened up.
Story_ID: 106222
Speaker 1: Do you have a philosophy as a writer?  I guess it's--you've kind of expressed it but can you sum it up for us?
Speaker 2: That victimhood has obsessed African American literature in a way that is counterproductive for America and for African American people.  Once you accept yourself as a victim, then it's very hard to advance or do anything.  So what I'm trying to stay true to is the other side of our experience.  That is the spiritually exalted side, not slavery but the transcendence of slavery.  They are two different things.  And to remain connected to the spiritual aspect without getting mired and bogged down in what is happening materially now is what I want to write about regardless of what happens.  And you know I've been able to you know make a living at it.  There were chances that I could have made more money and done this and done that but I don't know whether--I feel that I'm happier now being broke.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Not completely.  You're retired right, from Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not broke.
Speaker 1: So you're not broke.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not broke.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You could be richer, I guess.  But when you look back on everything you've done to this point is there anything major you would do differently if you go back and change something?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't always like it but it's perfect.
Story_ID: 106223
Speaker 1: All right.  And once again when you look back on it, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy or do you consider something like that?
Speaker 2: I would like for people to be able to know what the work is about on a wider level.  But to do the work and to keep it as true as I can make it regardless of what happens with it is what I really want to do.  And at this point to sell out, to be swayed by anything doesn't make sense.  I made it this far staying true to myself.  And so I can take it on into the grave from here, still believing that the spiritual strength and beauty of our primal selves which are now, because we're of the out of Africa theory, is the most in, we are most in need of that right now.  And it will present itself through American culture because there's two sides of ourselves as a nation, materialistic side, the greedy side is in a fixed battle with the other side, which is a generous side, a good side.  And all these people who are collecting here, 178 different nations in New York City, representative, will of 178 nations, it will all come together.  And it's troubling to see the difficulties but sometimes those difficulties are good things because they keep it from coming together too fast because you don't want all of that that comes from third world invading too fast into a culture that's been able to solve a lot of the problems in the material world.  So I don't like it, but it's perfect.
Story_ID: 106224
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community specifically today?
Speaker 2: There are some things that we'll keep alive and they might get distorted, filtering them through popular culture.  But I'm not a huge fan, say, of hip hop, right?  But hip hop keeps the spirit alive.  It keeps the "I am" alive.  It keeps some things alive that I think are necessary.  I wish the commercialism of it had not forced it into some places where they're negative, where they create negative role models for young, especially African American males.  But it will be all right.  So you know like my hope for American, the world, African Americans is that you know we'll be all right because you know it's always like conflict.
Story_ID: 106225
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about your family.  Now do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, who are they, what are they doing?
Speaker 2: My son is in--he's the second child.  He teaches in a school in New York City [New York] and he does a lot of things for at-risk boys in Brooklyn because at-risk boys they need more male teachers in there to give them what he gives them.  He has two children and there's a lot of this stuff that I'm talking to you about that influenced him.  He's a good man.  He's a good man.  And my daughter is--she was a computer teacher in an elementary school in Greenburgh, New York.  They took her out of the computer lab where she was doing great with robotics, you know those Lego, Lego League robotics and stuff like that, teaching these young kids robotics and all of this stuff.  And they put her back in the classroom because in a lot of schools, minority schools, what you have is funding problems.  And so of all things they took computer lab out of a school which is a stupid thing to do right now for me.  And--because computer lab is more important than almost anything right now.  She went back in the classroom but then you know like a couple of months ago she got a job with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] where she's training teachers for the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] program, which has moved into STEAM, as a--they put an A back in it.  So, and so she was unhappy for a while because they took her out of the computer lab and she had dedicated so much of herself to the robotics, First Lego League and all of that but she's back on track.  So they're up there in New York and I came down here in order to you know get some things done.  And they needed to be away from me because for a while I was a single parent and I didn't like all the times that they called on me to solve a problem, it wasn't good, and they're in their thirties and forties, "Dad this and dad that."  So if you're talking about a hope for the future, I wouldn't mind moving back up to New York [New York] in about three years and then like be a primary person in my grandchildren's lives because they're getting to be teenagers and they do well and I wouldn't mind being involved in that.  So that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't talked about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I guess that covers it all.  Yeah, there's you know like we've covered so much.  You did, you pulled a lot out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there anything else?  Is--?
Speaker 2: That I, I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  There's too much and therefore there's nothing.
Speaker 1: All right, I hear you.
Story_ID: 106226
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Wow!  Yeah, that's a good one. I don't think about it much.  Woo, how would I like to be remembered?  I think I'll be remembered accurately meaning that who I am and what I lived for.  And my grandson is named George Davis and my son is named George Davis.  And so it's kind of like not even thinking much about leaving because they'll still be here and both of them do well.  And so I don't think about it much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think about dying.  I almost never think about it because there's a timelessness that you can exist in where you can just leave this dimension.  And I don't believe you'll have consciousness of the same self over there in the other dimension but I believe that that will happen.  I like to have a good death like my father.  My father--the most famous mayor in America was [HM] Marion Barry.  My father took some Gray Panthers [intergenerational education and advocacy organization] down to the district building, set in with, against Marion Barry and he being a southern guy he couldn't do anything about it because he had all these church ladies with hats and stuff like that who occupied his office.  And what's a boy from down there going to do against that.  And they got a, abatement for senior citizens on the buses here and he came home and died.  That's a good death.  And I think that's what will happen to me, something like that.  Yeah, he had his little troop of Gray Panthers and he back--Marion Barry is a tough guy but he couldn't handle all those church ladies with the hats.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I hope that's what happens and thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.
