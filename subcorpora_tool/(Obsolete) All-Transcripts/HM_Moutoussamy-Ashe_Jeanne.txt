Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth there are five People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask and they only take, require a short answer and I'll ask, well we'll let Mrs. Moutoussamy Harris [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] answer the first, I mean answer first and you can answer second.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: We'll do it like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So the first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a great question.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Laughter) Can it be sweet?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Those lemon bars.
Speaker 1: Oh, lemon bars.
Speaker 2: All right.  That same question for you.  What--do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 1: Mostly anything chocolate. (Laughter) Chocolate cake.  But my favorite food is gumbo.
Speaker 2: All right.  And the second one is do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  It used to be blue, and I think it still is (laughter).
Speaker 2: Sage green.
Speaker 1: All right.  What about time of the year?  What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  A favorite what?
Speaker 1: Vacation destination (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vacation destination.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Santa Fe [New Mexico].
Speaker 2: Oh.  (Laughter) I think mine is Anguilla.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The island of Anguilla.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hm.  Phrase or saying.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I better not say it (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Share that with us, please, that sounds too tempting to pass up.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I don't think so.  I don't have a favorite one.
Speaker 2: There's one that always comes to mind for me and there are many phrases but the one that sticks in my head is was a quote by the educator Richard Green [Richard R. Green] who said, if it is to be, it is up to me.
Story_ID: 377138
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about both sides of your side of the family, your mother's [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] side and your father's side and we'll start with your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?  And in your case, your brother's I guess, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's Bernadette's [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] brother, we're talking about Brother (laughter), which everyone called him was Brother.  His name was John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.  And that's J-O-H-N, W-A-R-R-E-N, Moutoussamy, M-O-U-T-O-U-S-S-A-M-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 5, 1922, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what was his occupation?
Speaker 2: He was an architect.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?  What's the history there?
Speaker 2: It would be your mother--Uncle John who was mother's brother.  So it has to be mother and--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I can well, my father, so--
Speaker 2: Who I was named after.
Speaker 1: Well first of all how far back can you trace the family?  I mean, can you trace them back to the 19th century (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you know when he was born?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I can't, cannot--
Speaker 2: I think he was born in about 18- (unclear) 1860s?  Eighteen fifty-nine [1859]?  Something like that?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, her father was and he was born--his name was French, Jean Marie [Jean Marie Moutoussamy].
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Jean Marie.
Speaker 2: Moutoussamy.  And his name was spelled J-E-A-N, M-A-R-I-E Moutoussamy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born in Saint-Francois, Guadeloupe around the late, probably 1850s or 1860, maybe 1863, for some reason that number sticks in my mind.  I actually have a document that states his birth date.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I can have a copy of that--
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: --for accuracy.
Speaker 1: --let me ask you this, the name is an unusual one for the United States and I read in some information I had about you that it, the original name was Moutou-swami or Moutou-swami.
Speaker 2: Moutou-swami--
Speaker 1: Moutou-swami.
Speaker 2: --which is a very common name in southern India.  But when your father came here I was told--and she's here for accuracy--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that his name was difficult to pronounce.  And so, but because he was from the French West Indies it had a French sound. Moutoussamy and I guess--
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Moutoussamy.
Speaker 1: --Moutoussamy was the way it was pronounced.  So it became, once he came to the United States it became Moutoussamy rather than--
Speaker 2: Instead of Moutou-swami.
Speaker 1: Yes, Moutou-swami I think was the name when they first came, when his parents, your grandparents, my great-grandparents came to Guadeloupe from southern India.  It was Moutou-swami.  There was some discrepancy over whether or not it was Moutou-carpi or Moutou-swami because it's in a document that says it could have, we weren't sure if it was Moutoucarpi or Moutou-swami.  Moutou-swami means son of Moutou--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as I understand it.
Speaker 2: What does, do you know what swami, you hear, you always see these bits on television where the guy has a turban on, he's a swami.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, he's supposed to know everything, right, a swami.  Does swami mean father or have something to do with father or something?  I mean I'm just, I'm asking.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but I somehow thought it meant son of but I'm not sure.  I'm not going to tread water in territory I'm not (laughter) so familiar with on that.  But or if it was Moutou-carpi that is son of but swami I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know, Aunt Bernie--
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  No.
Speaker 1: --know the derivation of that?
Story_ID: 377139
Speaker 1: But his parents were born in southern India and they came to Guadeloupe, and when my [paternal] grandfather [Jean Marie Moutoussamy] left Guadeloupe, he boarded a boat and came to the United States, entering the U.S. through New Orleans, Louisiana.  And making a long story short, met my grandmother [Julia Walker Moutoussamy], who was Creole, and they married, do you know the year that they married, Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris]?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Veronica [Veronica Moutoussamy Carter Imala] was born in '20 [1920] so, oh it was, the war [World War I, WWI] was going on.
Speaker 1: At the time that they were married (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Right, so I think it was 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they must have been married around 1918 and he was eighteen years old, wasn't he, when he came to New Orleans [Louisiana] from Guadeloupe?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I don't know.  My father was quite a few years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Right, right, I heard that.  What, fifteen years?  Twenty years older, maybe?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  About twenty years older.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So when was your mother born?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Ninety-six [1896], 1896.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that would place him 1876, I guess.
Speaker 1: If he were twenty years, yeah.  Right.
Speaker 2: Right now this, this is an aspect of I guess African history we don't hear about that much, I mean in terms of African Americans here in this country that, ancestry sometimes, we've interviewed maybe four or five people that have East Indian ancestry, which is kind of sort of unusual.  But on Guadeloupe, as far as you know was that like an unusual thing in Guadeloupe or was it something that happened a lot--I mean did East Indians come to Guadeloupe to work under French control in the 19th century (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They--yes, as far as I understand that, my grand- great-grandparents were brought from southern India to cut sugarcane in Guadeloupe and they took up residence in a town called Moule, M-O-U-L-E, in Saint-Francois, Guadeloupe.  There are several, many Moutoussamys in Saint-Francois, Guadeloupe.  In fact now the mayor of Saint-Francois, Guadeloupe, his last name is Moutoussamy.  It's Ernest Moutoussamy.  So there's still quite a few of us there and very few of us here in the United States.
Speaker 2: Okay, well thank you, that's an aspect of our history that we really don't know a lot about but thank you.
Speaker 1: I wish that I could give you more information about it but having visited there, I know that quite a few Indians from India were brought to the islands to cut sugarcane and that's where my great-grandparents, that's where they came into the picture.  I'm not a hundred percent sure about the decision my grandfather made to leave Guadeloupe to come to the United States, but I was told by Ernest Moutoussamy, who is the mayor of Saint-Francois, that that was a very unusual thing to do, for him to have left and boarded a boat without any other family members and come to the U.S. at that time.  So our communication when I met him was brief--he was obviously fluent in French, I'm not fluent in French I'm ashamed to say--but we communicated somewhat and I was able to at least understand that, that that was a very unusual thing for a young man to do at the time that he came, to leave Saint-Francois and his family to come to the U.S.
Speaker 2: So there was no tradition that he was working aboard a boat or something like that docked there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No I don't--no, I think he came to the U.S. to find work and he became a butcher?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I always thought and always heard that he was a cook on a boat.
Speaker 1: Ah, so that's very important to note.  Yes, okay, so that's how he came.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And that's how he came and the boat would go to New Orleans--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  --where my mother was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So he decided to stay on one trip (unclear).
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  So, he decided to pursue this woman (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, well that makes sense if he was a cook on a boat and maybe making trips back and forth from Guadeloupe to New Orleans (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Because my father was a pretty good cook.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.  Is that how we learned how to make gumbo?  Or that was more New Orleans, Mother--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  That's Mother's stuff (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 377140
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that your father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] tells or from your father's side of the family that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, from my father's side of the family. That's a tough one for me.  This is where I'd have to dig in Aunt Bernie's [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] reservoir because that's really--given that Aunt Bernie is my father's sister, she would have some stories, and I'm giving you a moment to kind of think about that.  But one story I can tell you, that is of my generation is one reason why I really wanted to do the interview here is that this house represents the house.  When I was very little--I've been coming here since I was, how old, how long have you owned this house?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Fifty years.
Speaker 2: Fifty years and I'm fifty-five years old.  I've been coming here since I was a very little girl and I always remember the reference to oh, we're going out to the house.  This was the family gathering place and it still is.  So one reason why I very much appreciated having this interview done here is this represents our family gathering place and Aunt Bernie is the matriarch of this family and she took care of all of us.  This was where we all came.  Even if you weren't family you came to Aunt Bernie's house (laughter) and you became family.  So from the story of my father's side of the family, I was very close to my father and this is where my father always wanted to come, to his sister's house because she made his favorite ice cream, she did all these very special things for my dad and for all of us.  And this house--the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving--everything was here.  Everything was here.  So this is the house and the woman whose shoulders this family stood on.  This house tells the story.
Story_ID: 377141
Speaker 1: Why did your [paternal] grandfather [Jean Marie Moutoussamy] decide to move to Chicago [Illinois]?  Did he not like New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question because I can't imagine moving from warm weather to this cold city (laughter) but he did and we still have relatives--Aunt Dorothy [ph.] is still in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I still have a lot of relatives in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Is there a specific reason that you know of as to why he moved to Chicago?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  There were several New Orleans cousins and so forth moving here and my mother followed, and he had to follow too (laughter).
Speaker 2: He followed her, smart man.
Speaker 1: Was there more opportunity here?  I know New Orleans is more cosmopolitan than some places in the South but it's still Louisiana in the early part of the century.  That's a rough place for people of color so was that part of the decision, do you think?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  They moved here not too long after they married because Veronica [Veronica Moutoussamy Cater Imala] was born here in 1920.  My older sister was born here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, so I still don't know exactly the date that he actually came here to Chicago--to New Orleans (background noise).
Speaker 1: Okay, now was, do you know if your father was here for the riot in 1919 [Chicago Race Riot of 1919]?  Did he talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I think they were.  I've heard them talk about it.  Evidently they weren't too involved, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So they just, but they did mention the riot?  So that, so more than likely they probably were here in 1919?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: In doing a bit of a genealogical search at the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] in New York [New York] I looked up my grandmother's side of the family in New Orleans and where they lived and her name was Julia Walker [Julia Walker Moutoussamy], and they lived in a parish of New Orleans that was pretty integrated.  There was an Italian family who lived next door.  I believe there was an Irish family.  There were families of color.  But the parish was integrated and I'm curious as to why they made a decision to come to Chicago.  It could have been for work.
Speaker 1: Were they Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, they were Catholic.  But, let's see, my grandmother's--your grandparents on Mother's side--Mother was my grandmother and Aunt Bernie's mother--were Amy Roman [Amy Roman Walker] was Mother's mother and Mother's father was--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Walker, John Walker (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) John Walker.  John Walker.
Story_ID: 377142
Speaker 1: Did your father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] talk about, and I guess your aunt can help with this (unclear).  What are the stories of, that your father tells in growing up or did he tell you any stories about growing up here in Chicago [Illinois] and what it was like?  You know, he becomes an architect.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, he comes out of a family, you got a butcher--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) which is a decent occupation in those days but it's not an architect--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so how did he make that rise, that transition?  You got an educator, an architect that comes out of this family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It's a very good question and what's interesting that I remember my father telling stories about was the fact that his father [Jean Marie Moutoussamy] didn't really speak English very well.  He communicated with my grandmother [Julia Walker Moutoussamy], with his mother, in patois, which is a, you know, French-English combination.  That's how they spoke to each other fluently.  So he was not fluent in English and I remember my father saying that whenever he and his sisters would be outside playing and his father would come home and come down the street they would scatter and run because he didn't speak English (laughter) and they all thought that--they didn't know exactly how to communicate with him and so they didn't want to do this in front of their friends and so they'd all scatter and run.  That was the story he used to tell me all the time which I thought was pretty funny.  But, you know, but my dad grew up in a family--I guess your father died in what year?  He was--because he was considerably older than Mother.  Mother was widowed at what age?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I think my dad was sixty-four but that was a long time ago because we were young.
Speaker 2: Right, so you were about how old when he died?  Let's see, Daddy was about nineteen, I think?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I would have been--
Speaker 2: So twenty-two?  Thirty-two?  Maybe 1930 he died?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I guess so.
Speaker 2: Something like that.  So my grandmother was widowed at that point and then my father basically grew up in a family of all women because he had the three sisters and his mom and I think they catered to him left, right and center (laughter).  I remember--that's an understatement?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I remember him talking about his mother bringing a newspaper to him in the morning.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And his coffee.
Speaker 2: And his coffee.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And we, the girls got up went to the table to eat but he got the newspaper and coffee in bed.
Speaker 2: So that gives you any indication how my father (laughter) became an architect.
Story_ID: 377143
Speaker 1: Was it tough for your [paternal] grandmother [Julia Walker Moutoussamy] to provide for a family like that, with her husband [Jean Marie Moutoussamy] gone?  Or did she have--?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  It was hard, it was hard, but one thing she pushed was education.  She pushed it where we had no choices.  College was not an option.  You know, I mean college was the thing that we were going to do.  He was--but she pushed education.
Speaker 1: Now this is a time, the time that you grew up, that's the Depression [Great Depression] era, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Yes, and--
Speaker 1: And economic fortunes of everybody had collapsed basically, especially for black people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I don't know how she did it.  We went to Catholic school until we went to high school so she paid for that.
Speaker 2: Now where did you live in Chicago [Illinois] in those days?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  We started off around 46th--across the street from Carter School [William W. Carter Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], 46th Street, I mean 56th [Street], I'm sorry but we walked to St. Elizabeth [St. Elizabeth Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois] on 41st [Street].  Carter School was on 56th, yeah, and we walked to school.  But we always went to Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And t-, Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] and Aunt Veronica [Veronica Moutoussamy Carter Imala] were both teachers and my father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] was an architect and Aunt Joyce [Joyce Moutoussamy Renfroe Labayan] worked for the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes, she was on the board.  She was on the rating board at the Veterans Administration.
Speaker 1: So Mother did some kind of job raising her kids and getting everybody well educated and my father attended the Illinois Institute of Technology [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  But that was luck.
Speaker 1: You went to Chicago Teachers [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I went to Chicago Teachers.
Speaker 1: As did Aunt Veronica.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Now did he serve, so he served in the war then?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: What branch did he serve in?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know I have my dad's dog tags.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Army.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Army, okay.  Did he, was he involved in Quartermaster Corps, did he get involved in some other unit that--
Speaker 1: Oh, he'd have a fit that I don't know the (laughter) the answers to this question and I wish that I had papers to tell you but I actually don't have that information.
Speaker 2: Did he have any stories of, did he serve overseas?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  No.
Speaker 2: He didn't, okay.
Speaker 1: I know that Mom worked for the Red Cross [American Red Cross] when Daddy was in the war, yes?  He was enlisted.  Do you want to add anything else to that, from that time?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Shrugs shoulders).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Did your brother go to Englewood too?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Nods head) He went to Englewood.
Speaker 2: And for a while did he go to Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  No?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I can't remember, I can't, I'm not sure.  He probably went there for a while but he did go to Englewood too.
Speaker 2: And my mother went to DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 377144
Speaker 1: Your father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] and then to the university--Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, all right, on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: On the G.I. Bill and even though I had heard that before when I was finally accepted into Cooper Union college [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art] in New York [New York], my first couple of days of school I was walking around the--the building and ended up on the seventh floor of the Foundation Building of Cooper Union and that happened to be the floor of the president's office.  And the president walks out of his office--I didn't know who he was--and he said hello to me--because I'm just roaming around the school, looking at artwork that's exhibited on the walls, and I said hello to him and he asked me if I was a new student and I said, yes, I just started here at Cooper and he said, "What's your name," and we shook hands and I told him, "Jeanne Moutoussamy [HistoryMaker Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe]," and that Moutoussamy name stopped him.  He said, "What did you say your last name was?" and I said, "Moutoussamy."  He said, "That's a very familiar name to me."  And I said, "Really?  Well it's an unusual name."  "No," he said, "Come with me."  So I went into his--his office and he went up on the shelf and he pulled down a yearbook from the Illinois Institute of Technology.  And he opened it up and he turned to a page and said, "Is that your father?"  And there was a picture of my dad in the yearbook of Illinois Institute of Technology.  And I said, "What are you doing with this yearbook?"  He said, "I'm responsible for your father being on the G.I. Bill and going to--to getting the G.I. Bill to go to IIT."  It was just an incredible coincidence that Jack White [John F. White], who was the president of Cooper Union at that time, had been responsible for my dad going to IIT on the G.I. Bill.  It was quite a moment for me, that coincidence.
Story_ID: 377145
Speaker 1: Now probably, I've--the name sounds familiar to me in and apart from you.  And I probably read something that [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey wrote about your father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.].  Or--not Dawoud but--
Speaker 2: Photographer?
Speaker 1: No, I'm thinking about the other Bey [HistoryMaker Lee Bey] that writes for the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] that does the architecture articles.
Speaker 2: Oh, is there another Bey (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know who I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Dawoud is the photographer.  I'm not sure of a writer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a--yeah, he's a photographer, now I've got the, I'm starting to get the memory thing mixed up but there's a Bey that used to write--he's in finance now--but he used to write an article on architecture in Chicago [Illinois].  And he was, but he would make sure he covered all the black architects, you know he wrote about.  So what did your father, just tell us a little about what he designed here, and--
Speaker 2: Well, my father--in addition to designing and building the home that we grew up in on 89th [Street] and between what was then South Park [South Parkway], is now King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] and Calumet Avenue--and one other house that's similar to it that's here on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and I think it's in the 80s, 80th [Street] and--I'm remembering the street where it was--but the point is daddy did do a couple of houses here on the South Side and then he did--along with the black dermatologist Dr. Theodore K. Lawless--Dr. Lawless, I guess the building, the three buildings that my father designed, which are south of 35th Street, I think it's between 35th and 37th [Street], east of King Drive, the Theodore K. Lawless Gardens [Chicago, Illinois], which are three high rise buildings that Dr. Lawless I believe partially financed and of course it was named after him.  And that was quite an honor not just because it was--the whole project itself was done by African Americans.  It was my dad, and Dr. Lawless, and it was named after Dr. Lawless and in an historic area of the South Side of Chicago.  In back of all of the big mansions on King Drive where [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten Barnett and her husband [Claude Barnett] lived in, and right across or south of Lake Meadows [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  Lake Meadows (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, I've been to the building.  In fact I think it's one of the first buildings I visited in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--
Speaker 1: I know that [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush used to live in Lawless Gardens.
Speaker 2: Did he?
Speaker 1: (Unclear), the police officer lived there, Tony Morra [ph.], who's from Nigeria.  I mean a lot of people, yeah, it's a nice, nice building.
Speaker 2: That was a--and I, even when I fly into Chicago, into Midway [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] now, I point the buildings out, you know.  But my father--and I can't remember which year--but he I know for years worked as an architect for PACE Associates [Chicago, Illinois] and then from there he joined the firm of Dubin, Dubin and Black and became a partner and it was then named Dubin--the architectural firm was named Dubin, Dubin, Black and Moutoussamy [Chicago, Illinois].  You can help me out with the year if you can remember what year that was.  I think I was a little girl when he joined the firm Dubin, Dubin, Black and Moutoussamy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But at that time, I think that's when Lawless Gardens was done and there were a couple of other buildings that my father had done at the time on the South Side which names I can't recall but I know that John Black [John T. Black], one of the other partners in the firm, designed Harper's Court [Harper Court] in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  He was responsible for that and I believe he did live in Hyde Park as well, John Black did.
Story_ID: 377146
Speaker 1: And eventually, even though Dad [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] did the Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], the Delta's sorority building that's on Stony Island [Avenue] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]--
Speaker 1: AKA's?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yeah, AKA.
Speaker 1: 57th [Street] and--now the Deltas'll write us letters (laughter) if they ever see this.
Speaker 2: Sorry about that, AKA's, I'm very sorry about that, apology.
Speaker 1: Right.  So he was basically steel and glass designer?
Speaker 2: Well, because my dad went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois], he was there while Mies van der Rohe [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe] was teaching, so he actually studied with Mies van der Rohe and you see the influence of Bauhaus [Staatliches Bauhaus, Germany], and that period, very much like the buildings at IIT.
Speaker 1: Right, steel and glass, very precise, you know, buildings (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Linear.
Speaker 1: Like the federal buildings downtown, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was very much of that school of architecture.  And you see that theme repeated in the house, the two homes that he did here on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  But, so, yes, that's--the building that my father is probably I guess most recognized for was the Johnson Publishing Company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] building which is downtown on Michigan Avenue which I believe was completed in 1972.  I can remember the later years a little bit better.  And that was a source of pride for him and actually for Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] as well, John Johnson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And for the black community in general, even in Dayton, Ohio, where I'm from and every place.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's great to hear.
Speaker 1: You come to Chicago [Illinois], we knew that the Johnson building was built by a black architect, by, you know paid--financed by a black business, the source of pride that, you know.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely and very much the same with my father's involvement with the Theodore K. Lawless Gardens [Chicago, Illinois].  I mean he had a tradition and a legacy of being involved and doing buildings and housing on the South Side.  If you ever--and I don't know if you have interviewed [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young--you have done an interview with Andrew Young, because I know Andy said during the '60s [1960s], they talked to my father.  He and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] with my father went to Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] and talked to him about housing, my father being involved in designing housing in the South Side during that period of time, in the early '60s [1960s], a, you know, tumultuous time in Chicago.  But, so my father has a legacy of--of contributing to the architecture in Chicago but not just as an African American, but just as an architect and in this city that's--that's quite a legacy.  He loved the City of Chicago.

Speaker 1: Let me ask your aunt, Mrs. Moutoussamy Harris [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris], about your career.  Now you, now when did you--you started teaching, well you attended Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] then Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Chicago Teachers College, yes.
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from Chicago Teachers College?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I--(laughter) I can't even remember anymore.  I didn't go straight through so I was a little older when I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I had some jobs in between and then I went to Chicago Teachers College.  I can't even--I got my book upstairs maybe (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your graduation picture.  Yearbook.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  But anyway, those kind of things I have upstairs, but I don't remember the year.
Speaker 1: That's all right, but you taught, did you teach grade school or high school or--?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I taught--I started with the little ones.  In fact I started with special ed [special education] and then I ended up with--being the head teacher of a child-parent center, so.
Speaker 1: Which one was it?  The name of the child-parent center was?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It might come to you.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I don't re--
Speaker 1: I think you told me at the beginning and I just wanted to make sure.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  It was--it was on Parker's [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] grounds so it was probably Parker Child Parent Center [Chicago, Illinois].  It was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, was there a particular highlight in your career that you can point to?  I know you--you worked for Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich [Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich], right?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I was on a writing team, a math writing team because math was my favorite.  But I had a--I was on a team with them, and--
Speaker 1: You created a curriculum for a textbook?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  It was for math, yes, and was--I was one of about seven other people.
Speaker 1: Were you the only African American on that team?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I remember when Aunt Bernie would come to New York [New York] for the meetings and that was always such a treat for me to have you come to New York but I was impressed with how she had gone from teaching in the schools to developing these curriculum and then being asked by this publishing house to contribute to the thoughts and ideas and papers, to actually document this curriculum for publication and to be used in the schools.  She--and I somehow remember your involvement with Ebony?  Didn't Ebony at one point very early on begin a television or do a recording of you?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Not--for the board I used to teach on television.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, for the Harcourt?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  No, for the Chicago Board of Education (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Education, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Closed-circuit television.
Speaker 2: Oh, all right, all right.
Speaker 1: I somehow remember something like that, yeah.  She's the true celebrity in the family (laughter).
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Oh god (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 377148
Speaker 1: Well just--well while we have you here I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions, kind of philosophical questions.  Looking back on your teaching career, what--what's your opinion of the school system today?  Do you have any i- any thoughts?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I shouldn't say.  I don't know.  I'm so disappointed in the kids.  And when I--I--even when I had special ed [special education] kids, they--they wanted to learn, you know?  But the kids now just don't seem as interested and they don't give all they have.  And I don't know what it's not--it's not the motivation from the teacher or--I don't know but I just--I'm disappointed about the way the kids accept school, and--because my kids loved it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess when you--what are your thoughts about the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Some--some are great (laughter) but I don't think that children are as inter- as involved and as interested in school and doing their best as they used to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you look back on everything you've done so far in life is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yeah but I don't know that it would work today.  Kids are a little different because it did work for me.
Story_ID: 377149
Speaker 1: One thing that I remember growing up was that Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] and Aunt Veronica [Veronica Moutoussamy Carter Imala] and Aunt Joyce [Joyce Moutoussamy Renfroe Labayan] were very much into dancing.  And all of the kids, all of the nieces and nephews on Saturdays joined at Aunt Veronica's house, I remember, and we did square dancing.  And Aunt Bernie and Aunt Veronica and Aunt Joyce in their spare time--who knows how they had spare time--they had a love of dance and we all had to gather to learn how to square dance and they taught all the kids and the name of the group was The Hashers and the Hoe-Downers [ph.], is that right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And the kids, did we have a title?  Because that was the adult's title, right, of the dancing.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  You know I wouldn't remember.
Speaker 1: I do remember on Saturday mornings we would have to join (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) I knew you had to do the square dancing.
Speaker 1: --and we had to do that.  Square dancing was a part of my upbringing.  It was because of Aunt Bernie and Aunt Joyce and Aunt Veronica that we did that.  And we put on shows and they made our costumes and it was a serious event.  And as late as May of this year [2007], according to my cousin Karen [Karen Harris Doyle], Aunt Bernie's daughter, Aunt Bernie has been teaching line dancing ever since.  She just stopped her last classes in May and--
Speaker 2: Where did you teach?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  At South Shore Cultural Center [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And she has, in her retirement years, traveled around, because when my mother [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] was at the Montgomery Place assisted living facility [Montgomery Place Retirement Community, Chicago, Illinois], Aunt Bernie would take her line dancing group there and perform for the residents and she performed at Taste of Chicago with her--with all of her students, I call them her students (laughter).  And she did this up to as late as May of '06 [2006].
Speaker 2: All right.  Now this is interesting because I've heard--I didn't--it's not that big in other cities but square dancing at one point in Chicago [Illinois] was a big deal in the black community.
Speaker 1: Well this is--
Speaker 2: People were square--I've heard this story before and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Have you?  From other people?
Speaker 2: --park district, yeah, park district was responsible on some level for it--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And you know my partner (laughter), we called ourselves Triple H, Herschel [Herschel Tolson] (laughter)--Herschel, Herschel--I still can't remember his name--but anyway, Triple H was Herschel, Harris and Harrison [ph.].
Speaker 2: Triple H.  (Laughter) That's great.  This was your line dancing?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  This is, line, yeah.
Speaker 2: Line dancing is a big deal now in Chicago.  You know, every family event there's a line dance where they play--what's the Jamaican?  Whatever, I can't think of the name of it.
Speaker 1: A song?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: I can't remember either but I've been to many family events where--line dancing was something I really didn't learn very well and I'm really ashamed because at family events, when she gets up and starts line dancing you better know what you're doing (laughter).  She will put you to shame.  Yeah, Aunt Bernie's a great, great dancer and she taught us all how to dance as well.  So she has her whole life been a very, very active, involved person in education and physical fitness and sh- we've learned a lot from Aunt Bernie.
Speaker 2: Do you have any reflections on these many years that you want to share with us?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I know one thing I love (laughter), I loved it and most people who really get involved really enjoy it.  Herschel Tolson, one of my partners, he has gone to Denmark and called--he's a line dan- he's a square dance caller.  And he has been to Denmark and traveled different places and he's one of the Triple Hs (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now do you have a favorite song or favorite music to line dance off of today?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: The one I can think of is the 'Electric Slide' but I don't know if that's, that's not the one?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Oh no, no.  (Laughter) Well there's so many you know?  There's so many.
Speaker 1: I remember learning square dancing to Marvin Gaye and, (laughter) let's see, who was it?  A lot of the Motown sounds we used to, to dance to.  'I'll Be Doggone' and there was another one.  I don't know, a lot of the Motown sounds we danced to.  They made up dances to the songs.  It was fun.  It was great fun.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  I didn't make up many.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) did?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember (Unclear) did.  Sometimes when I see Aunt Bernie I say--what does that say?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Five, six, seven, eight (laughter).
Speaker 1: Five, six, seven, eight (laughter).  That's what I call her sometimes, that's her rhythm.
Speaker 2: Five, six, seven, eight.
Speaker 1: She gave me this--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so I like to wear it when I see her.
Story_ID: 377150
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections about your family you want to share with us bef-, you know while we have you?
Speaker 2: Please do, Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris].
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Okay.  It was strange growing up with a father [Jean Marie Moutoussamy] who didn't speak English and who--with a mother [Julia Walker Moutoussamy] who didn't want you to learn French.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  My mother grew up in southern United--Louisiana, and when she went to school she was speaking this Patois--some kind of, and it was you know, kind of French--and she said when she went to school she had such a hard time.  So she wanted us to speak one language well.  So she did not let us learn French, even though my father did not speak English.
Speaker 2: So that made communication sort of difficult, I guess, right?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And he tried and I'll never forget my girlfriends and I would be in the front and my dad had a habit of walking out and saying something and then going back to the back room and we would look at each other and say, "What did he say?"  And then we all would fall out laughing, I mean it was a joke.  It was sad.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not to communicate (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) And right before my father died he was trying to teach me French, but I had a sister, the older sister who was more involved--Veronica [Veronica Moutoussamy Carter Imala] learned French, she learned everything so that she could deal with everybody.  But she was, you know--my older sister was very--she'd get involved with it so she became very fluent in French.
Speaker 2: Didn't Aunt Veronica also attend Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: In New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: She did as did Pam [Pamela Carter-Green], her daughter, who's now principal of a school.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  No.
Speaker 1: Not anymore?  Pam (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  (Simultaneous) Oh, Pam?  Assistant principal.
Speaker 1: Assistant principal.
Speaker 2: So your mother came out of the Creole tradition in Louisiana?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And when she went to school she said that they had a hard time speaking this funny kind of French--it wasn't really French--called Patois (laughter).  So she wanted us to know.  So we missed out on a lot (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well you had a representative in Aunt Veronica, huh?
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yes, but she was--had to grow up to--to show us this.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That seems to be the legacy of the oldest in a family, that they have to learn it--have to learn it all first and show everyone else the way.  But--and Aunt Veronica died young.  She was forty years old.
Speaker 1: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Forty-three.
Speaker 2: Forty-three?  Yeah, so, but she--I remember her very well.
Speaker 1: Do you still keep in touch with your relatives in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Cousin Dorothy [ph.].
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Yep.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And where is cousin Myrtle [ph.]?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  She died.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  She was in California though.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And her sister died--Rita [ph.] died recently.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that.  What year did cousin Myrtle die?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  It's been about four or five years.
Speaker 1: I had no idea.
Story_ID: 377151
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, this is one thing I guess we--people always want to have on tape, but what advice would you give your younger relatives today?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Mine is to go to school as far as you can go.  And make it something that you're really interested in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Oh buddy (laughter) I don't know.  I guess I'm the matriarch and I enjoy being that because I'm waited on hand and foot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why shouldn't you be after what you've done for all of us?  Absolutely.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  So that's what--
Speaker 1: It took a long time though because your brother [Moutoussamy-Ashe's father, John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] took that role for the longest time (laughter).
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  Oh, that man (laughter).
Speaker 1: They all called him Brother and all the nieces and nephews called him Uncle Brother.
Speaker 2: (BERNADETTE MOUTOUSSAMY HARRIS):  And people would wait for him to get on the bus so they could just look at him.  He was kind of cute (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Thanks, Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris].
Story_ID: 377316
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Elizabeth Rose, was her middle name, Hunt was her maiden name, Moutoussamy, and you wanted me to spell it?  I'm sorry.  So, Elizabeth Rose Hunt Moutoussamy [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] and you have the spelling of Moutoussamy.
Speaker 1: Right that's probably good if it's the regular spellings of those names.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, and she was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on June 29, 1922.  She came to Chicago [Illinois] when she was two years old and was raised in Chicago with nine siblings and her mother, my grandmother, who is Annie M. Hunt Foster [Annie Wallace Hunt Foster], was--my grandmother was widowed three times and it's still questionable to me whether she had ten or eleven children.  She lived to be 105.  She died in January of 1999 and the day before she died she could of told you the number of children and set me straight but (laughter)--I know that she married very young, when she was fourteen, and I think she had a child from that first marriage who later died and then the ten children from her second husband, who was Charlie Hunt [Charles Hunt].  And Charlie Hunt was also from Arkansas.  They were married, I think he died--he was the father of the ten children--he died I think when my mother was about eleven years old.  And then my grandmother married a third time and she married Reverend Foster.  And during those years she lived in Chicago and while she was a widow with ten children she worked as a seamstress and her daughters worked with her in the--in her shop.  But my mom had a real god given gift.  My mother had the most amazing voice.  Just--as one of her friends used to say, that my mother was an earthbound angel.  And that's exactly what I put on her gravestone that she was an earthbound angel because she had a voice that--when Johnny Hartman heard my mother's voice--and they did sing together--he asked her to go out on the road with him and sing, you know to--.  She was--she mostly sang in the church at that time.  But I think she sang with maybe a couple of big bands, maybe Cab Calloway, and we'd have to bring Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] back in here because she has a great story about my mom, and we'll take a break and I'll make sure I get the actual documentation on that.  But--
Speaker 1: This is big time entertainment (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my mother was, she made--
Speaker 1: Johnny Hartman, Cab Calloway.
Speaker 2: When my mother was fourteen she recorded a record and I wish we had it but we don't.  But she was singing in the church and then she sang with Cab Calloway and then Johnny Hartman wanted her to go on the road and when she was nineteen years old, maybe eighteen years old, she met my father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.].  At nineteen all of these things started happening to her with her singing career.  And when she was asked to go on the road my father (laughter)--and it was true of that generation said, "It's either you on the road or it's me."  And she made the decision to marry my father.  So her singing career basically stayed with the church.  She sang in the Baptist church and then when she married my dad she converted to Catholicism and still sang in my grandmother's church, Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], which is on the South Side of Chicago, and she sang in the church for years.  I remember going to hear her sing at our Catholic church growing up, St. Joachim Church [St. Joachim Catholic Church] here on the South Side of Chicago.  I remember my mom singing up in the choir loft and she just had an incredible voice.  She sang for friends' weddings and--so she basically devoted her life to my dad and to her three children.  She had quite a gift.
Story_ID: 377317
Speaker 1: She had quite a gift.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her favorite song was the 'Ave Maria.'  I will always remember that.  My mom [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] was eighty-three when she died on February 13, 2006.  It'll be a year since she passed come this February 2007.  And she sang even for the residents at Montgomery Place [Montgomery Place Retirement Community, Chicago, Illinois] as long as she could but the Alzheimer's really sort of took away the words, but she always remembered a tune.  She could hum.  My mother hummed (laughter) even when she couldn't remember words she hummed.
Speaker 2: Was a good hummer, huh?
Speaker 1: She was a good hummer but I think that what I learned as I grew up was that music was always in her head.  She was always humming even when I was a--when I was a little girl going to bed at night, she would hum something you know in the room--sitting in the room with me when I would go to sleep.  I just--that's my memory of her.  And even when she couldn't verbalize, she would hum.  Just in the last year of her life.  So music stayed with her her entire life, even though it really was not--and could have been a very lucrative career for her.  She--I guess you could say was a victim of her generation and made the decision to support my dad [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] which was a great decision for all of us and I don't think she regretted it.  And my dad was a successful architect and I'm proud of both of my parents.
Story_ID: 377318
Speaker 1: Are there any, any stories about you know Hot Springs, Arkansas, about your ancestors and how they came to be there or what they did there?
Speaker 2: No.  There is a wonderful photograph of my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Wallace Hunt Foster] and my [maternal] grandfather, Charlie Hunt [Charles Hunt], on top of Hot Springs Mountain, I think is the name of it, and they're in a photograph with a couple of other people who I can't really identify but I think it was taken in 1911.  And I do have a copy of that.  But I don't know a lot of stories about the days in Hot Springs.  I know that my grandmother was born in Wynne, Arkansas and she was an only child, which may have been the reason why she decided to have ten children (laughter) because she didn't like being an only child.  But how she came to move to Chicago [Illinois], that story I'm unfortunately not--not aware of.  But she was a tough lady.  And my--if you don't mind my going into some of my memories of my grandmother at that point is what a upbeat, cheerful, physically fit, go-getter my grandmother was, which was I think a testament to why she was here for so long.  Very positive attitude, she was a very religious woman.  I remember as a kid, my brother and I would want to play cards, you know as kids.  Not in my grandmother's house.  (Laughter) You did not play cards even if it was Go Fish.  You didn't do it.  She was very much a woman of God and of the church and she never wore a pair of pants in her life because she said she was all woman (laughter).  So my grandmother was--had a big impression on me, and one of them that stays with me was the fact that she was widowed three times and buried so many of her children.   My image of my grandmother burying her children was going into the funeral and seeing her always dressed in white.  Anytime anyone in the family--and particularly her children--died, my grandmother wore white to a funeral because for her it was a joyous home going.  And that's how she treated funerals.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  That's--that's an African tradition, in some parts of West Africa to wear white at funerals.
Speaker 2: At a funeral, interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Even paint--even paint the body with white clay. Interesting.
Speaker 2: Of the deceased is painted in white.  Well sh-, we buried my grandmother in an all white outfit because we knew that was what she would want.  But she was a--she made a profound impression on me and lived alone until she was 101.  And then my mom [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] put her into a nursing home which is where she stayed until she died.  But she almost saw three centuries.  She was born in 1893 and she died in January of 1999.  If she had lived one more year she would have seen 2000.  It's pretty incredible.  That's pretty incredible and considering what she had gone through in her life, I think about that often.  As you get older and you know more loss, how you approach that loss is really about moving forward and I think my grandmother had the--the key to the secret of that because everything to her was a joyous homecoming.  It was--the losses that she incurred were to her a part of, of life.  She saw that as a part of the process of living so treated it as such.  That was the natural order of things.  And many people look around and they stay pretty much rooted in their generation, not younger generation or older generation, and you start to lose your friends, and all of a sudden you look around and you don't have anymore.  Not my grandmother.  She had a range of--of friends, all ages.  And so she was always surrounded by people, and a lot of it I think had to do with her spirit as well.  She just generated that kind of energy around herself.  What kind of energy would it take to raise ten kids by yourself?  Whew (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 377319
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] have stories of growing up in so large a family?
Speaker 2: She did--she--but the stories she told were mostly about how her brothers really took care of her.  I think my mother was pretty much treated with kid gloves because very early on they realized her voice and it was rare.  And so my mother was like a delicate flower in the family (laughter), and her brothers looked after her.  I think it was a busy, playful family because my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Wallace Hunt Foster] was so playful and there were so many kids that there was always a lot of activity going on.  She didn't--I don't remember her being very specific except that my grandmother did the best that she could and she enjoyed--my mother enjoyed her brothers a lot, that they were really the ones that spent a lot of time looking after her.
Story_ID: 377320
Speaker 1: Now is there a story as to how your parents [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy and John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] met?  We haven't talked about that yet, have we?
Speaker 2: No, we haven't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I'm not absolutely sure how they met.  I know they were both very young, maybe eighteen years old, and they married when they were nineteen.  They were married for fifty-three years before my father passed away.  But I'm searching my memory.  I don't remember exactly how they met but my mom was--my father was very handsome and my mother was quite beautiful.  And my mom's singing I think gave her a certain notoriety in the community.  And on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] she was known in the high schools as the voice of--her nickname was Squeaky.  She got the name Squeaky because she was a premature baby and she didn't really cry when babies cry.  She--she squeaked, as her mother [Annie Wallace Hunt Foster] would say, so she got the nickname of Squeaky.  But that Squeaky became this incredible voice and all of the--her friends in high school called her Squeaky, her school friends called her Squeaky.  And I think she had the reputation as being this incredible vocalist who attended DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and there was a DuSable--in fact when my mother died my brother called DuSable to find out if they had my mother on tape because there was a DuSable Singers [ph.] or the DuSable talent show [Hi-Jinks] that they'd have.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they have a huge talent show every year.
Speaker 2: --my mother won that talent show for many years.  But they did not.  They looked to see if they had a recording of her voice but they didn't but records of her having won, yes.  So how they met could have been, both here on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] and that was just a union that was meant to be.  I do remember my mother telling me that she remembers meeting my father's father [Jean Marie Moutoussamy].  My father had not met my mother's father [Charles Hunt].  He died when she was eleven but that's why I remember my paternal grandfather lived until my dad was about nineteen years old because my mother did remember meeting him, my paternal grandfather.  And just telling me that, "Yep, I had the opportunity to meet him but didn't know him very well."  So, however you know you meet people in high school, I'm sure there's some wonderful story and your asking me these questions prompts the curiosity beyond my imagination.  How did they actually meet?
Speaker 1: Well we know they did and--
Speaker 2: And a union meant to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were married prior to him going to architectural school [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] and all that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.  They were married in--on March 15, 1942? Let's see, wait a minute, yes, because we had the fiftieth wedding anniversary party for them on March 15, 1992.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was March 15, 1942.
Story_ID: 377321
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably (pause) bossing my brothers [John Warren Moutoussamy, Jr. and Claude Louis Moutoussamy] around (laughter).  I was the youngest in a family of three and I had two older brothers and I wore it like a badge of honor.  Probably my dad's [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] fault (laughter), I was a daddy's girl.  But I had a lot of fun with my two brothers and they tolerated me, they really did.  They tolerated my bossiness and my--I--they somehow must have found fun in you know the little games that I would devise and the sort of, you do this now and you do that now and I thought--I think they thought that was pretty funny.  But I was definitely the--at the brunt of their jokes often (laughter).  But, and we'd team up on each other.  My middle brother hated peanut butter--peanut butter and my oldest brother and I would somehow team up and get him to have peanut butter when he--get peanut butter in his food when he didn't know he was getting it.  Oh, we did--these were things that I remember from my--my earliest childhood.  And one of the other early childhood remembrances is my mother [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] singing, yeah.  It used to embarrass me a little bit because there was my mother up on stage and I was just used to her being my mom.  But stage meaning in church you know but when you're a little kid, four or five years old, and you see your mother up on stage, it's stage whether it's church or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But does it help in your confidence or does it make you more self-conscious when you see your mother on the stage and she's and everybody's attention is focused on her?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought it was great but a little embarrassed.  That--that's my mom (laughter) that's what I remember feeling and I'd sort of sink down in the chair and my father who would sit behind my brothers and me would  tap on the shoulder and say, "Sit up, that's your mother."  (Laughter) No, I was actually used to my mother getting a lot of attention because she was so beautiful and she was so talented.  But it was my father who really got a lot of the attention because he ended up going on to--becoming a successful architect whereas my mother's voice was not so well known.
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: Well, the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] but my father built a house--which I remember it must have been finished in 1955 because I remember him finishing this house that he designed and built and I celebrated my fourth birthday in.  Which brings up another childhood memory that I'll always take with me--but that was my first--my earliest memory of the house that my father built.  And moving into it from 6951 Indiana [Avenue], which is where we were before and then moved into 89th Place, 361 East 89th Place, between what was then South Park [South Parkway] and Calumet [Avenue], it's now King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive].  And I moved in just before I turned--we moved in the summer before I turned four on July 9 and I had my fourth birthday party there.  But to go back a little bit, my earliest memory in that house is for that fourth birthday I received (laughter) one of these Bugs Bunny dolls that had--it was as tall as me--and it had elastic straps on the bottom of the feet.  And you could strap his feet onto your feet.  And so I would strap those feet onto mine and would dance around the house with this Bugs Bunny.  And it transferred from Bugs Bunny being on my feet to my feet to my dad's toes.  And then I'd you know dance around the house with my dad, with my toes on my dad's toes.  It was just a wonderful free feeling of being totally joyous with my dad.  I was a daddy's girl--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) definitely.
Story_ID: 377322
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Ruby and the Romantics.  My father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] liked Ruby and the Romantics (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Our Day Will Come,' is that (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: 'Our Day Will Come'.  My father taking me to the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] to see Peg Leg Bates.  And he took me to see Ruby and the Romantics.  He liked Frank Sinatra a lot.  My dad liked Frank Sinatra, and my mom [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] loved Leontyne Price.  She was very much into opera and the classical singers.  My father liked jazz.  So there was a lot of music in my house as--as a kid.  And my father loved sports as well.  But my mother was--went on and got her college degree later in her life, after we all were out of the house.  And she attended the Harrington Institute [Harrington Institute of Interior Design; Harrington College of Design, Chicago, Illinois] and became an interior designer.  So being the child of two parents who both loved music and the arts.  Some of my earliest childhood memories--my father sitting at his drafting table with a little pillow under his elbow because he spent so many hours with leaning on the table, drawing with his mechanical pencil that he used a little pillow under his right elbow.  I grew up with music and art and dancing and sports and having two older brothers [John Warren Moutoussamy, Jr. and Claude Louis Moutoussamy].  Even though I didn't really play sports early on, my Aunt Bernadette [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris], along with her sisters, obviously had us square dancing.  But they also tried to start us in tennis early-- which I was not very good--(laughter) I was not very good at at the time.  I was a swimmer.  I loved to swim at Tuley Park [Chicago, Illinois].   And I loved ice skating.  So I don't know how I digressed to all of that but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well those are all sights and sounds and smells of growing up, I guess.  Or part of the experience of growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, these are things that just--exactly, they just start popping into your head when you take yourself back to that time.
Story_ID: 377323
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have any interest in taking photographs in those days?  I mean when you were little (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was definitely into art though and my father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] recognized that early on.  On Saturday morning since I was eight years old my dad had me going to the Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for the early Saturday morning classes.  And I remember going with my mom [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] who would take me on the--on the bus that stopped on 89th Street and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], or South Park [South Parkway], and would stop right in front of the Art Institute and what I thought was fifty stairs leading up--because when you're really young it seems like this mammoth you know accomplishment to get up all these stairs to get into this gigantic museum--I was completely awed by it.  Of course I was there about five years ago and I counted every step and there were eleven (laughter) even though it felt like eleven hundred.  I would go to art classes and--so he really encouraged my love of art very early on and eventually my mom would just walk me to the bus stop on 89th Street and South Park and put me on the bus.  I'd have the same bus driver every Saturday and he'd make me sit right up front and we'd get to the Art Institute.  He'd say, "Have a good day."  It was just great.  And I'd get off the bus--I was maybe you know eight or nine years old and walk up the stairs and when I'd come out I would be escorted to the bus and put back on Chicago public transportation and it would stop right at the bus stop where my mom would meet me.  It was very much timed.  I remember that and I remember walking through the Art Institute as a little kid, just being completely awed by the magnitude of this place and the arts.  And there was one room that I particularly liked.  There was a--remember going through the museum, of course it's a completely different place now, to get to the classrooms.  There was a hallway that veered off to the right, and there was a miniature furniture room.  And it was a--everything was dark in the room.  And to look at the miniature furniture you had to look in these little boxes that were lit like little rooms.  But the entire room itself was dark and I thought that was the most incredible, mysterious room--to go in there and look at all those little images.  They were like little rooms unto themselves and I would escape in that and inevitably be late for my class but that was sort of my sidetrack that I would do and then walk through and see the--the real images of the posters that my parents had.  Picassos [Pablo Picasso] and Van Goghs [Vincent Van Gogh] that they had prints that they had on the walls in my home growing up.  To actually see the original work in the museum and the connection that that was very much a part of my life and very much encouraged.
Story_ID: 377324
Speaker 1: So it's no wonder--even though I wasn't taking photographs at that time and didn't know very much about photography except that my oldest brother, when he was about--whose name was John [John Warren Moutoussamy, Jr.], he was John Jr., we called him Johnny--was given a Polaroid camera one Christmas and I thought that was a fascinating thing but I couldn't use it because it was his (laughter) you know.  Hands off.  But I thought it was a fascinating process and you had to coat the--the photographs once you peeled them apart with the fixer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, there was some kind of fixer.
Speaker 1: --and it was a whole--it was a whole process of--fascinating to me because it was somewhat artistic but I didn't see it as art then.  And eventually my parents [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy and John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] had books by [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks in the house that I would you know see the photographs.  But it wasn't until a childhood friend of mine [Frank Stewart] introduced me to the possibilities.  He was a photographer.  Introduced me to the possibilities of photography as an art form.  That I began to see the use of my studying painting and drawing, shapes in my art classes [at the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], being applied to vision and seeing.
Story_ID: 375201
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to kindergarten at Burnside Elementary School [Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], which had a kindergarten, and then for first grade my parents [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy and John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] had all three of us--of their kids go to Catholic schools and I attended St. Joachim Catholic School [St. Joachim School, Chicago, Illinois], which was on 91st [Street] and Langley [Avenue].  That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) St.--?  J--
Speaker 2: Joachim, J-O-A-C-H-I-M, St. Joachim.
Speaker 1: Okay. And I went there first through eighth grade.  And oh, you know it's really hard to stay on a track because I start thinking about all these things that happened while I was in elementary school.  The big things that--that you remember.  I'm ready to jump to high school but not without mentioning making my First Holy Communion and my mother making my dress for my First Holy Communion out of this beautiful white eyelet.  And she made a beautiful cotton dress to go under the white eyelet dress with these beautiful puffed sleeves.  I mean a real work of art, big bow in the background.  I still have it.  It's hanging in my closet (laughter).  But my first--my First Holy Communion--these events that occurred at St. Joachim Church [St. Joachim Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois].  I was there just last year.  I spent my mother's birthday at St. Joachim Church so I'm still connected to it in some way.  But my mother was devoted to the church.  So that's where I--I went to elementary school and for high school I attended the Academy of Our Lady, which was also known as Longwood high school [Longwood Academy, Chicago, Illinois], all-girl Catholic high school on 95th [Street] and Throop Street on the South Side of Chicago, which at that time was Evergreen [Evergreen Park, Illinois], Beverly [Chicago, Illinois] area and was, oh, maybe 95 percent white?  Maybe there were hardly any blacks living in the area at that time and there were just a sprinkling of blacks in the high school.  But by the time--of course it's now 100 percent African American, black--and when I was in school there, there were just a sprinkling of us in the school but as--by the time I graduated we were I would say maybe the school was a third black at that time.
Story_ID: 375202
Speaker 1: So I graduated from--I started high school in 1965 and graduated in 1969 from Academy of Our Lady [Longwood Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  And I initially went to Mundelein College [Chicago, Illinois], which was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before we get you that far--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --let's go back to school a little bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and talk about that.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?  Was--was it art?
Speaker 1: Oh it was definitely art and music.  Yeah, art and music.  (Laughter) Funny enough you know I--(laughter) I loved algebra although they say art is mathematical so I guess there are relationships between the two.  I had a tough time in geometry with theories but algebra I loved.  But mostly art and music were the subjects that I stayed extremely involved in.  I mean I was a part of the madrigal singers and I belonged to the chorus and any kind of theatrical production, I participated in that.  So yes and the same with the arts.  The art teachers loved me because (laughter) I was always so very enthusiastic with my--with my projects.  Put in more time than I really needed to because I just loved it.  And I stayed at the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for the Saturday program all the way through high school.  Yeah, I started when I was eight and went all the way through.  So that was my love.
Story_ID: 375203
Speaker 1: You knew you were going to be an artist when you were coming up, did you really--you consider, did you consider yourself an artist at that--at the time you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I did and I, you know--it was--it's interesting because my father [John Warren Moutoussamy, Sr.] had a lot of--he wasn't one of those parents who said don't be an artist, get a job, get a real job.  He really encouraged my artistic passion and as a result of that I did stay with my passion and I did develop it in some of the best places and the best institutions.  The fact that even just the Saturday program at the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--I didn't--I never attended the Art Institute as a full-time student, but I did in the early '70s [1970s] take summer courses with Garry Winogrand and a printer whose name I--I know he's not there anymore, I can't remember--but Garry Winogrand was one of my favorite teachers.  But I took a summer course there and at the time had already moved to New York [New York], but I was applying to Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] because my childhood friend had moved to New York and called my father and said there's this--there's this incredible art school in New York called the Cooper Union (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--yeah now you were just--before we ended the last reel you were talking about a childhood friend introducing you to photography.
Speaker 2: Another photographer.
Speaker 1: And I don't think we really--really got into that story.  What happened actually, what happened there?
Speaker 2: Well he's actually somebody that you should interview for HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers].  His name is Frank Stewart and he is now the official photographer for Jazz at Lincoln Center [New York, New York].  And he knew very early on--he did not study art.  He went to De La Salle high school [De La Salle Institute] here in Chicago [Illinois] and was a childhood friend because we--you know I was in an all-girl high--Catholic high school [Longwood Academy, Chicago, Illinois] and he was in an all-boy Catholic high school and so we were sort of in the same circles.  And he had several friends and we all go out together all the time.  He was actually the boyfriend of my best friend (laughter) who lived across the street from me and that's sort of how we got to--to know each other.  But he was the one who came to New York and said to my father, you know, "Cooper Union's a great school."  He knew that I wanted to be in an art school.  And I had never heard of Cooper Union.  So I applied and they said, "Well we think you ought to spend a summer at--," I wasn't accepted immediately.  He said Gene Tulchin, who was the chairman of the department of photography at Cooper at the time said, "I want you to study a summer with Garry Winogrand at the Art Institute in Chicago and bring your portfolio back to me and let's review it then."  And so I did.  This was in '72?  Nineteen seventy-two [1972]?  Because I had been at Mundelein College [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you went to Mundelein first.
Speaker 2: Right, I--I think I had mentioned that, that I.  Out of high school, I had went to Mundelein.
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about it much.  You went right to Mundelein College right out of high school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did.
Story_ID: 375204
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you like Mundelein [Mundelein College, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well I liked the people.  I didn't like the curriculum so much and it was a little too close to home.  But very much being under the influence of my mom [Elizabeth Hunt Moutoussamy] wanting me to stay in Catholic schools and I think she knew the admissions director there, they were friends, and she very much wanted me to study with the art teacher who was there.  And I wasn't at the time--I really--it just--it was not a fit for me.  And so I did not stay at Mundelein.  And when I didn't get into Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] I eventually went to the College of New Rochelle [New Rochelle, New York] because then I moved to New York [New York].  And came back for that summer and took the course with Garry Winogrand at the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and went back to New York and applied to Cooper Union again, and I got in.  And that's where I stayed and never came back.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is 1972.
Speaker 2: Actually 1970 was my first trip to New Y- no, no, no, 1971 was my first trip to New York so I was at Mundelein for about two years.  And then came to College of New Rochelle and I was there for a year and by the time I applied to Cooper Union--Cooper Union did not accept the credits from--they wanted me to start as a sophomore--so I graduated from college in '75 [1975].  I should have finished in '73 [1973.]  But Cooper Union made me repeat a couple of years to just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they wouldn't accept the credits from--
Speaker 2: Well they were liberal arts colleges and Cooper Union is a school for art, architecture, engineering and science, specifically.  Not an easy school to get into and a great honor to get into it because it's a four-year, full scholarship to go to the school.  Every student has a four-year, full scholarship and there were only two hundred students in the art school, maybe 1200 students in the entire school itself.  So I tried very hard to get in and I was fortunate enough to get in, even having been rejected on my first try.  But it was because of my childhood friend [Frank Stewart] that I even knew about Cooper Union.  I knew nothing about it.  And he went to Cooper Union, which is how I found out about it.  And studied with Roy DeCarava.
Story_ID: 375205
Speaker 1: I didn't get to Cooper [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] in time to study with Roy [Roy DeCarava], but I had some great teachers, great teachers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who--who, who were some of those teachers that you had?
Speaker 1: Let's see. I had Garry Winogrand, I had Tod Papageorge, I had Joel Meyerowitz, who just had that great exhibit of the World Trade Center [New York, New York]--at the World Trade Center site because he devoted much of his photography to photographing that building.  And of course after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] he put together a book ['Aftermath: World Trade Center Archive,' Joel Meyerowitz] in a rather legendary exhibition ['After September 11: Images from Ground Zero'] now of the World Trade Center, of his years of photographing it.  And as a result of these great teachers, lecturers would come in.  Lee Friedlander came so I--I learned from Lee Friedlander.  Bill Eggleston [William Eggleston].  These are all photographers who were sort of of that--the early '70s [1970s] right after Diane Arbus came to--to notoriety and of course at this point in the early '70s [1970s] she had already committed suicide.  But all of these teachers knew her and they were all in that same generation of--of photographers and were--were what you could say was a revolution in photography in the early '70s [1970s] and very much I grew up in that street reportage way of shooting as opposed to documentary.  And I was very fortunate to learn from these people.  Arnold Newman was one of my teachers.
Speaker 2: Now what's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stephen Shore.
Story_ID: 375206
Speaker 1: What's the difference in those two styles?  Documentary and street reportage--
Speaker 2: Street reportage?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well documentary is a story.  You're documenting a story and my first book project was exactly that--my Daufuskie Island [South Carolina] book project--because I was fascinated in documenting history.  But I really grew up in studying photography with these great art reportage type photographers.  And that had a big influence over how I approached my documentary images.  But street reportage is like improvisation in jazz.  It's not going out with a story line, not going out with a preconception as you do with knowing you're documenting a specific idea, a specific--you have an intent on doing a story.  But street reportage is photographing life as it occurs.  It's improvisation in photography.  And I think that had such an influence on me that it--it has everything to do with I think my approach to life.  Whether you consider that good or bad I think it's--life is an improvisation.
Speaker 1: So it's about discovery in a sense.
Speaker 2: And about seeing.  The person that I think best--of course, I didn't learn this until I got into Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] about--Cartier-Bresson [Henri Cartier-Bresson] and the decisive moment.  It was all about that decisive moment.  Learning to be intuitive about how you see and how you react to capturing an image.  And that's called the decisive moment and it's a--it's intuitive, it's artistic and it's being in the zone.  (Laughter) You know that you're--you're seeing shapes, forms, objects, you see chaos in front of you and you want to turn it into order.  And you just automatically do that, visually, because that's how you see artistically.  You--you take all of this busyness, which is why I love New York City [New York, New York], and it's occurring in front of you and all of the sudden you see it making something--is happening in front of you.  And the intuitive part comes when somebody might come walking into the frame and rather than saying, "Please don't step into the frame," that person becomes a part of that improvisation.  And then somebody else comes into it and you feel that--that's a feeling.  I shoot with my left eye and I leave my right eye open when I'm shooting with my Leica.  And so I can kind of see and feel when somebody's coming in, but I'm focused on what's happening ahead of me.  And that moment of when it all comes together; that's the decisive moment.  And if you're not shooting, you don't get it.  Doesn't matter if it's in your mind's eye (laughter).  You see it but when you're shooting it you got it, you know it.  You just know it.  And it's a--it's a feeling that--it's my passion.

Speaker 1: How did you decide on what equipment to use?  I know photographers have, usually favor one equipment over another and I know that some of the old press photographers like--were used to big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speed Graflex.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they used the big speed--what's it called?
Speaker 2: Graflex--the speed--Speed Graflex, yeah we say the ouiji type cameras, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they'd use those, I know a friend of mine uses an old Pentax [Pentax Spotmatic], I mean he won't get a new one.  He uses the same camera and gets the results from that thing that he--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that was my first camera, a Pentax.
Speaker 1: Spotmatic?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, a Pentax and I used it mostly with a 105 lens.  For some reason I was not seeing wide angle.  I was seeing everything sort of telephoto, wanting to do portraits, until I got to Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] and I was blown wide open by 28mm and 35mm lens and being able to look at the world from a completely different format.  And that's when I switched to Leica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Leica just took over my vision (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why Leica? Why did you--?
Speaker 2: Because I think I was very much influenced by the--the teachers that were at Cooper Union at that time and that was the preferred camera for street reportage.  Cartier-Bresson [Henri Cartier-Bresson] used it.  Garry Winogrand used it.  All of the--all of my teachers were using it with the exception of someone like Arnold Newman who was a completely different teacher and point of reference for me because he was working with an eight by ten camera.  The beauty of a Leica, being a range finder, is that it's a very quick camera.  You don't have to--you don't rely on the lens to see images for you and--and be distracted by how the lens is seeing the image because that's what happens with an SLR [single-lens reflex camera], it's interpreted by the lens.  But with the range finder you're looking at exactly the way the image is in front of you and there's no interpretation.  It's what in your mind.  You make that decision and nothing distracts you from that.  A range finder was suited to improvisational photography and I'm sort of coining a phrase there, I think, because I think the terms fits for--for street photography, for reportage.  So that's what attracted me to the range finder was that my teachers were using it and I saw how preconceptions in making images could happen with an SLR but with a range finder it wasn't quite so easy.  And the range finder is when two image- when the image that you're focusing on superimposes, once that image comes together you know that you're in focus.  As opposed to an SLR where you're actually looking through a mirror to focus on your subject.  So you're--you're making that--it can actually change by how the lens sees it.  Not true with the range finder.  I hope I'm--I'm not a technician (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, that makes sense--
Speaker 2: I'm not a technician.  This has not been my thing.
Speaker 1: You're explaining this very well.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 375208
Speaker 1: You know I taught photography for four years at the Dalton high school [The Dalton School] in New York [New York] to juniors and seniors and I refused to teach technique.  I taught vision because I think the most important thing that you can do with--even if you're not wanting to practice photography as a profession but to use photography as a way of understanding yourself better.  How we see the world.  I mean particularly even more so today and that's what I really tried to impart to a lot of these high school students.  They've got visual imagery coming in from every aspect of their life.  It's computers, it's television, it's--they can now get visual imagery on their iPods, it's--stand in Times Square [New York, New York] and you're just a barrage of visual imagery.  You get on the bus and it's just--everything.  But how is that visual imagery having an effect on them as human beings.  When they take that in, what are the--how do they process it and what are they putting out as a result of what they're taking in from what they see.  What I saw as a problem with all of this visual stimulation is that it's coming in so fast that these kids don't understand how they're processing it.  So what I tried to get them to do in my classes was to bring in pictures that moved them that they saw in the newspaper or magazines.  Bring it in, explain to everybody else how it moved them, and have everybody else talk about what that particular image means to them.  One of the exercises I would give them is photograph a brown paper bag.  Everybody would have to find--photograph a brown paper bag.  Why?  Because I want everybody to see how differently everybody sees a brown paper bag.  And when somebody explains how they see it or just by looking at all the interpretations of one brown paper bag, they begin to realize how differently everybody else sees the world.  That this may be the same object but we all see it differently.  And I--I hoped that it would help them understand how important it is to process what they're taking in.  And to be aware that what they take in has a direct effect on what they put out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And their behavior, how it affects their behavior.  And you know often I--I had a couple of kids who were very serious about their photography, did--have gone on--one girl graduated from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  I mean I'm very proud of my students but I think what I'm most proud of was that it made them think more about what they see and how what they see affects how they act.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, now that's a--that's an interesting comment.  That we--you know how we see the world determines how, I mean it has a relationship to how we act.
Speaker 1: How we behave.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean that could go into--this is I'm just talking about imagery but I mean now we're talking about racial profiling.  You know it has to do with race.  It goes into many, many aspects of--of how we behave, how we interpret things, how we see things.  You know if I could just start with how we look at an image, that's a start (laughter).  Because I think that things like that can be so insidious that it can seep into our psyche, and we don't really know how it's having an effect on us.  So I--I try to start there and photography has been a means of my expressing that to young people and I'd like to keep doing that.
Story_ID: 375209
Speaker 1: What was your first major photographic project?  What you--your first--what--what you would consider your first I guess major project.
Speaker 2: My first exhibition of photographs was at the Benin Gallery in New York [New York], in Harlem, and I believe it was on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and it was in 1976.  It was my first big showing and I showed with two other photographers, both Chicagoans [from Chicago, Illinois].  [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey and I had our first exhibition together and Frank Stewart, who was the photographer, my childhood friend that had the big influence on me to start photography.  And Ed Sherman [Edward Sherman], who I believe still has a gallery in Harlem, in New York, put the show on and that was--so that was what, twenty-five years old?  That's my first exhibition in New York.  That was a big deal.  I just graduated from Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] in '75 [1975]--
Speaker 1: You were twenty-three, yeah, no, well twenty-four.
Speaker 2: Well twenty, right and twenty-five.  In '75 [1975] I was twenty-f- I turned twenty-four.  No, I was born in 1951, twenty-three.  Don't want to push myself being older, thank you.  (Laughter) I'm getting there, I'm getting there.  But what was so incredible about that--I was working at NBC [WNBC-TV, New York, New York] at the time, because I worked for the last two years of college full-time and I went to school full-time, but in working at NBC I met [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks.  And this was my first exhibition and I sent him an invitation to the exhibition and don't you know Gordon Parks came and that was such a big deal.  Dawoud and Frank and I and Ed Sherman had Gordon Parks in his gallery--it was just--it was just wonderful.  That--that was my first exhibition in New York and I will never forget how impressed I was of the generosity of Gordon to give us that kind of exposure.  Just to show up (laughter) was--was really meaningful.  And if you ask Dawoud and you ask Frank, they'll tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gordon was there.
Speaker 1: Now your--well what was your subject matter or was there a range of different things or what did you (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's pretty much what it's always been, and that's social context.  Photographing primarily in the black community.  And to a certain extent documentary but now it's become more of a fine art form than a documentary form.  But Frank and Dawoud and I pretty much h- you know Dawoud Bey's photographs have a strong social context as well--but his technique is what is challenging to the social context that he's actually documenting.  So the combination is what makes Dawoud's work so compelling.  And he shoots color as well and he does Polaroids and he experiments and--and that's what one of the things that makes his work so wonderful in addition to how he gets people to respond to him in front of the camera.  He's a wonderful portraitist as well as making statements about our community.  But--and of course Frank Stewart has been doing that all of his life and now he's documenting, which is really his day job, documenting what goes on at Jazz at Lincoln Center [New York, New York] and traveling around with Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] and the band, and--.  But he has a life of--of artwork that's just incredible and again social context of the black community in--very much influenced in his work.  It's what his work is about.  And mine is--is pretty much like that as well.  I think we're all influenced--we're pretty much children of the '60s [1960s] (laughter) so there--there's probably that sense of responsibility, that we were all visual communicators and so that's where our responsibility stayed.
Story_ID: 395537
Speaker 1: In 1975 there was a tennis sensation who was a young guy, everybody thought he was the greatest tennis player in the world, a guy named Jimmy Connors (laughter).
Speaker 2: Ha, ha, ha, ha, very funny (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  He was, he was, everybody thought he was the next coming of the tennis guy.
Speaker 2: Yes, yep.
Speaker 1: He was whooping everybody.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And brash and everything and then here's a in--at Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England], in England, the biggest tournament of the year--he faces an aging black tennis star, Arthur Ashe, who was in his thirties I think at that point, and people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-three, thirty-two.
Speaker 1: --didn't expect him to give Jimmy Connors much of a struggle.  They figured he's--well--why are we playing this game?  It was almost like that.  But Arthur Ashe beats the--beats him pretty bad.
Speaker 2: Bejesus out of him (laughter). Four sets.
Speaker 1: Where you paying attention to that back then?
Speaker 2: I think there was a female horse who was running in the Kentucky Derby (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Secretariat?
Speaker 2: --Secretariat.  I was paying attention to Secretariat.  Well, absolutely, and I you know I was very much a spectator, just knew that I thought Arthur Ashe was--was a tremendous sportsman, not just a tennis player but a sportsman.  I had seen him in a TV show then that was Edwin Newman's 'Speaking Freely,' which showed what an intellect Arthur Ashe was.  And I had read John McPhee's book, which [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks gave me, 'Levels of the Game' [John McPhee], which was a story about Arthur winning--actually it wasn't about--he ends the book with Arthur winning the U.S. Open [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York] in 1968, which was the first U.S. Open.  But that was a story that I didn't know and I think most people tend to focus on 1975 because of Jimmy Connors and Arthur was not considered the shoe-in for winning that.  In fact, if anything, everyone thought he was going to lose.  Your bet should be on Jimmy Connors (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was improbable.
Speaker 2: It was improbable that he would have won and to be the first black male to win Wimbledon.  But 1968, winning the very first U.S. Open, he was a lieutenant in the [U.S.] Army at West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  It was 1968.  That was a year when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was shot, Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was shot, I mean the, the Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico] was going on, and we had the boycott, and--
Speaker 1: Riots and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was really--riots in Chicago [Illinois] and Watts [Los Angeles, California] and you know all of this tumultuous activity was going on in the country and in--sandwiched in all of that was Arthur Ashe winning the U.S. Open.  First black male.  Althea Gibson was the first black to win.  But--and not for money.  Arthur was an amateur.  He was not playing for money.  He played for country.  And he let--as many--he got a lot of criticism at that time for not voicing--Arthur Ashe was not considered the militant.  He wasn't raising his fist, he wasn't--although he did in '75 [1975] when he won--in 1968 he let his racket speak for himself and--and for the community.  And he did in a quiet way but with an incredible rage and in '68 [1968] that was really a very proud moment.  But I realize now in perspective and historically how important that was in reading John McPhee's book--'Levels of the Game' is a book that really illustrates how significant that period of time was for an African American male to have survived in the tennis world at that time.  And Arthur didn't just survive, he didn't cope, Arthur thrived.  Everybody loved this guy.
Story_ID: 395538
Speaker 1: So yes, you can fast forward to 1975, but when you consider what happened from 1968 to 1975 it's really quite an incredible life.  But you can fast forward to 1975 because in 1976 I met Arthur Ashe (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  He was well known before '75 [1975]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --but that, that '75 [1975] game [at The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England] was so dramatic because nobody expected it.
Speaker 1: Nobody expected it, that's very true.  That's very true.
Speaker 2: He was almost history at that point as a tennis player.
Speaker 1: Because of his age?  Yeah.  No, it's true but it's interesting, when West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] had its one hundredth anniversary not too long ago, I wish they had said that when Arthur Ashe won the U.S. Open [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York] in 1968 and he walked into the dining hall at West Point, and they showed pictures of the dining hall and all of the events that occurred in the dining hall at West Point, there was a documentary done on West Point, huge, where all the cadets would come and sit and dine, when Arthur walked in after winning the 1968 U.S. Open, the entire dining hall stood up and applauded him.  That was not mentioned in that, that documentary but what an incredible thing in 1968 for a black man to walk into that dining hall as a lieutenant and everyone stand up and applaud him.
Speaker 2: At a--especially in light of that dining hall being the scene of so many instances of pain for black cadets going all the way back to you know the 19th century.  Anybody who was there had pain inflicted upon them psychologically, physically, West Point was a tough place for black--
Speaker 1: That's such a good point because that really brings to the forefront how Arthur fought in a quiet way but made a significant difference and vindicated all of the pain of those past black cadets.  And he did it in such a dignified way, graceful way.  There was no anger in it, just skill.
Story_ID: 395539
Speaker 1: Now you met him in 1976?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Good question, what happened (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) See how skilled I am here (laughter).
Speaker 2: We met in October of 1976 at a United Negro College Fund [UNCF] tennis event that he actually hosted in his name to raise money for United Negro College Fund.  I was still working at NBC [WNBC-TV, New York, New York] at the time having graduated from Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] and I stayed on at NBC in the graphics department and was doing more and more photography and [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks was playing in this United Negro College Fund event.  And Gordon said, "You know--," he called me Moutoussamy [HistoryMaker Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe]--, "you know, Moutoussamy, you should come and photograph this event because there's going to be you know all of these people there and I think you should come and photograph this event."  I said, "Great."  So I went to the sports department at NBC and asked for a press credential and I went to Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] and I photographed the United Negro College Fund Arthur Ashe tennis event.  And I don't know--I took--I was taking pictures of everyone there and--and I went out to get a bite to eat or a drink or something and I was walking back into the stadium and I tripped over somebody's foot.  It was Arthur [Arthur Ashe].  And I said, "Oh, I'm sorry."  Then I looked up and I said, "Oh," and he said, "That's okay, I have another one."  (Laughter) I said, "Oh, okay, thanks."  I was so embarrassed.  But you know saw him--it was a weekend event and I saw him the next day and he came over and asked me my name and could he call me and I said, "Well, sure," he said, "What's your name?" and I said, "Jeanne Moutoussamy."  He said, "What?"  (Laughter) I said, "Moutoussamy."  He said, "Moutoussamy."  "Well just--I'm at NBC," and I didn't give him the number, I just told him I worked in the graphics department at NBC and I told him that--he knew another woman photographer who worked at NBC because he mentioned her name and I knew her, Jess- Jessica Burstein.  And he asked me if I knew her and I said, "Yes, I know her," and he said, "Okay." So the next day Arthur called NBC and asked me if I would like to go out to dinner with him.  And he said, "I've got a--," I thought this was interesting, he said I've got to fly to St. Louis [Missouri] or someplace and I'm coming back and I'll pick you up at such and such a time.  And I thought hm, fly to St. Louis and take me out to dinner.  This was new (laughter).  And he did.  He was right on time.  And it's a very sweet--it was a very sweet thing because when I came down from the sixth floor, from the graphics department, maybe it was the seventh floor graphics department because that was the news room for the NBC local news channel, and I walked out of the elevator bank and sitting at the bottom of the escalator on the--sitting on the escalator ledge was Arthur with one red rose.  And I came out and there he was and I said, "Oh, how are you?" And that was our first date and he gave me this red rose.  (Laughter) It was very romantic and he was very sweet and what can I tell you except that four months later, having endured Arthur traveling to Australia and various places around the world and we had a--basically a telephone--we dated when he was in New York [New York] and we kind of fell in love on the telephone.  And he said, "Well, why don't you come and travel with me on the tour?"  And I said, "Because I have a job and I can't do that," you know.  So he said, "Well, why don't we get married?"  (Laughter) And I said, "Okay," to make a long story short.  And he had a bone spur in his left heel that he wanted to have operated on.  And Arthur being very methodical, decided in February of 19- February 10, 1977 he was going to have his heel operated on and on February 20, 1977 we were going to get married.  So come February 20, 2007, it will have been our thirtieth year.  Yeah, it was thirty years so--that's how I met Arthur and I fast forwarded you all the way up to February of 2007 (laughter).  Not fair but that's the way my artistic brain works (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that's keeping things in perspective also.
Speaker 2: Trying to.
Speaker 1: Well that's the way to solve the problem of a long distance relationship.
Story_ID: 395540
Speaker 1: By this time I mean he was a like a world figure.  He was all over the place, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean people would invite him--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he was.  You know he had won the U.S. O- [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York]--he had won the two great ten- tennis tournaments and had done it not just as a tennis player but really as a--an ambassador, a global statesman.  He considered himself a world citizen, true to that expression.  And that he was indeed.  Oh, I was just completely impressed and enamored and awed and over the moon about having met Arthur [Arthur Ashe], yeah.  He was just terrific.  And we had a seventeen-year marriage where most of the time he was ill.  In fact I said to him, "Okay, I married you on crutches.  Was that an import of things to come?"  (Laughter) Because he did--he had a couple of heart attacks, he had two bypass operations and unfortunately illness just kind of predominated the marriage but only in the sense of it having to be something that was always present.  But not dominated the marriage in terms of our relationship.  No, we had a great time and we traveled the world.  It didn't stop him from being Davis Cup captain.  We didn't stop traveling after he quit the tennis tour and after his first bypass operation.
Speaker 1: Now when did he have his first by- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first was in December of 1979.  December of 1979.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it some kind of a congenital heart--?
Speaker 2: Congenital heart condition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His father [Arthur Ashe, Sr.] died of a heart attack and had several.  And his mother [Mattie Cordell Cunningham Ashe] had hypertension.  She died when he was almost six years old, not quite six years old, and she was twenty-seven.  So, yeah, he had a congenital heart, but for him it was--they found out after you know he had his first heart attack--that it was really not so much cholesterol; it was calcium, calcium deposits.  So that was you know again something congenital.  But what a full life.
Speaker 1: Well yes.
Speaker 2: What a full life.  So we married in February of '77 [1977] and the beginning of April of '77 [1977] I found myself in South Africa.
Story_ID: 395541
Speaker 1: Now this is when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) South Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now how did this take place?  I mean South Africa in those days was off limits to--
Speaker 2: Still--
Speaker 1: --black people for the most part.  I think Japanese were considered honorary whites in South Africa, apartheid was (unclear).
Speaker 2: So were blacks considered honorary whites.
Speaker 1: There were certain blacks who--okay.
Speaker 2: It was not a title that we--going over we did not agree to that but that's how the South African government--for you to get visas to go--.  We went because obviously Arthur [Arthur Ashe] has had a history with South Africa and apartheid and having grown up in the South in Richmond, Virginia his being denied a visa to go to South Africa in the early '70s [1970s] completely made him fight the apartheid system.  So they were not too warm about Arthur coming to South Africa but at the time he was working as a television announcer for ABC television [ABC Sports; ESPN on ABC] and he asked if he could do a story on sports and apartheid.  And he was not playing then because it was a month and a half after his heel surgery.  Soon as he got off the crutches and had the cast off his leg we were in South Africa.  Life was not dull with Arthur (laughter).  And I saw the importance that his, his, what his life meant.  I mean I knew it before but, but the importance that Arthur felt world issues and his contributions and his voice and what he was able to do.  And his privilege of traveling the world as a tennis player, that was just a vehicle.
Speaker 1: Now was he able to, to connect with ANC [African National Congress] while over there in South Africa while he was there?  No?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he did not meet Nelson Mandela until--because of course Mandela was in jail (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was in prison, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as was Robert Sobukwe.  So he was not able to meet any of those leaders but I remember in '77 [1977] he did meet, not Robert Sobukwe--
Speaker 1: Tambo [Oliver Tambo]?
Speaker 2: No, Mbeki [Thabo Mbeki], Tambo, no.  Head of the KwaZulu.  Robert--no, not Robert Mugabe.
Speaker 1: Buthelezi?
Speaker 2: Yes, Gatsha Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi].  Thank you.  And I photographed him with Gatsha Buthelezi.  But, you know that was, politically that was a very interesting, Arthur had a--had the ability, the insight and the graciousness to treat all people the same.  And whether you know it was Piet Koornhof, who was the minister of sport in South Africa--an Afrikaner--Arthur could sit and talk to him and conduct an interview in a gracious way and get information that Piet Koornhof may not give to anyone else, black or white.  And sit with Gatsha Buthelezi and do an interview, and even though it wasn't popular necessarily, to talk with Gatsha Buthelezi, that didn't matter to Arthur.  What was important was getting information.
Story_ID: 395542
Speaker 1: And that, that was admirable always wanting--
Speaker 2: Okay. 'Cause I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to hear both sides of the story.
Speaker 2: I don't remember all the details but I know that Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] was considered by many African Americans who were activists around the South Africa issues of being--as being a--on the wrong side of right.
Speaker 1: Exactly, that's exactly right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And in fact there was I know in the early '80s [1980s]--I can't say if it was the '70s [1970s]--but the early '80s [1980s] there was a, sort of a--people--there was a boycott of South Africa because they were, at a certain point, the South African government was allowing black entertainers to come over and that sort of thing, trying to lure them to come over to try to show the country was normal or something I guess--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when it really wasn't.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But was there pressure on him from I don't know, from actors--?
Speaker 1: None whatsoever.  They knew not to ask him.  In fact it was called Sun City [South Africa] was a place where they were trying to lure black entertainers and sportsmen.  I mean Jimmy Connors went.  And everybody knew in the tennis world Arthur's [Arthur Ashe] position on South Africa.  And when Jimmy Connors was offered a million dollars to play tennis with I think Nastase [Ilie Nastase] at Sun City they went.  When John McEnroe was asked to play at Sun City and was offered a million dollars, he called Arthur.  "What do you think?"  And spent an hour on the phone talking about the political dos and don'ts or just the--this apartheid system and really understanding it.  John McEnroe didn't go.  So, he--(laughter) I mean Arthur always felt John's social conscience was there.  But he was on the right side of those issues, absolutely, Arthur was.
Speaker 2: So Arthur Ashe basically provided some intelligence I guess for people in the future in terms of him going--
Speaker 1: That's good, that's very true. He was a resource and the real thinking people who wanted to, like Arthur, wanted to know both sides of the story, called on him, used him as a resource.  But those who had their opinions and didn't have an open mind to know beyond that; they made their own choices.  Fine, that's fine.  That's, that's okay.  We all have to make our own choices but I think that it's something to be said that with Arthur's leadership that there were people who you know (laughter) listened to that.
Story_ID: 395543
Speaker 1: Is there anything outstanding in terms of your own personal reflections of being in South Africa in those days that stands--that stands out you know now?
Speaker 2: I just remember the first time getting off of an airplane and I just wanted to take my camera and start shooting immediately because there was a tension in the air and Arthur [Arthur Ashe] said, "Wait."  Because I tend to just start shooting but had not--I didn't grow up in the South.  I hadn't been to South Africa before.  I was just ready to (makes sound) jump in and start shooting.  I had that feeling that there was something going on.  So I didn't.  But then when I got in the airport and I saw those signs black, white bathrooms, black, white drinking fountains.  I didn't grow up in the South so I photographed that and I, I couldn't resist it.  I couldn't go and not document that.  So I did and I mean he knew I was going to do my own thing anyway (laughter) but it was a good lesson for me to know.  And I later applied that to 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe], my first book project in going to the island [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] and really getting to know people before actually thinking I could go in there and just photographically take out their lives, document their lives without their permission, just shoot.  And that, that was a good lesson for me.  I was young (laughter).
Story_ID: 395544
Speaker 1: When did you work on the 'Daufuskie Island' book [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe]?
Speaker 2: I started that in late April of '77 [1977].  When I was at Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] I did a six month independent study on the West Coast of Africa and I photographed quite a few of the fishing villages in the Ivory Coast and in Ghana.  And I had studied the--the first slaves that were brought to the states even though you know there were the--the Caribbean Islands, the South Carolina and Georgia Sea Islands were one of the first stops and those fish- those were fishing villages.  And I thought that--I had heard that there were connections between the two which is how the Gullah and Geechee culture developed coming directly from West Africa.  So I always wanted to go to the South Carolina, Georgia Sea Islands to sort of investigate that having spent six months in West Africa from January '73 to June '73 [1973] I was in West Africa.  And then in late April of '77 [1977] I made it to the Sea Islands and Arthur [Arthur Ashe] went with me because he understood what it was I wanted to--to do.  And I started photographing in the Sea Islands.  And that was the first--my first book project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got to know the people first before you just starting shooting them, you were saying?  That's--
Speaker 2: Yes, thank you (laughter), to bring me back to where I was.  Yes, I visited the islands and met some people and someone said, it was Vertamae Grosvenor [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] and my friend [HistoryMaker] Donald Bogle, I should write that down as a HistoryMaker, Donald Bogle--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the movie--
Speaker 2: Critic and writer.
Speaker 1: I think we've interviewed him.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: He's a--he's a movie critic and a--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a neighbor of mine for a long time but he said to me, "Call Vertamae Grosvenor.  She's from Beaufort, South Carolina, and she'll connect you with some people."  And that's exactly what I did.  I called Verta and Verta called [HistoryMaker] Emory Campbell who at the time was head of the Penn Center, which was on St. Helena Island [South Carolina], a great African American resource, Penn Center.  And I went and talked to Emory.  And Emory said, "Well, I think the island that you should focus on is Daufuskie Island [South Carolina]."  And Emory got on a boat with me.  The great thing about Daufuskie is that there's no bridge linking it to the mainland.  The only way you can get there is by boat.  So Emory got on the boat with me and thus started my project of photographing Daufuskie Island.  That was in April of '77 [1977] and I photographed it until January of '81 [1981] and took it to the University of South Carolina Press [Columbia, South Carolina].  They published it and it came out in October of '82 [1982.]  And the entire document of the island, the--not the negatives but a set (background noise)--a set of prints are housed in the University of South Carolina--the museum of Columbia--Columbia Museum of Art and Science [Columbia Museum of Art], I'm sorry, which is in Columbia, South Carolina.  They have the entire document of photographs from the islands on record there.
Story_ID: 395545
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a--this is a culture that's disappearing now.  Right?  I mean we've heard a lot about the Gullah and Geechee culture really being a victim of development like a lot of communities--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) black communities around the country.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it's, it is, very little is left of the culture and I'd like to get the book reprinted because those pictures can never be taken again.  Not just because of the time but because the culture is so changed.  Many of the people who owned land didn't really have deeds to the land.  Historically it had just been given to them by the plantation owners or the people who owned the land, just didn't give them deeds, they just said, "Here, you can have it."  And the land was sold to many of the developers for you know a thousand dollars for seven acres of land.  And then the developers would build a home for--and sell it for a hundred thousand dollars.  And this was when the development first started happening and they would promise the islanders a piece of property in Savannah [Georgia] or somewhere else on the mainland.  And of course they ended up in these little matchbook apartment houses that they moved into and lost their land but the island has since been developed.  I think that there's still some native Daufuskians that are still there but the people that I knew and worked with, most of them are gone.  So Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] is--I think there's been some movement in [U.S.] Congress to actually allocate several million dollars to preserving--maybe $20 million to preserving the Geechee and Gullah culture.  And this is something that's just recently happened or is about to happen so I hope that--that that is true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's a movement to do that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They have a website.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's moving in that direction, thank goodness.
Speaker 1: These are the most African of the African American settlements in the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, in the United States that is it.  That--I mean we could talk a long time about 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe], and I would like to get back to it, maybe even by the end of this year.  I'm soliciting it to publishers now to try and get it republished.
Story_ID: 395546
Speaker 1: The second book was 'Viewfinders' ['Viewfinders: Black Women Photographers,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe], a history of black women photographers, which I was inspired to do not knowing very many black women photographers, at least there was no historical survey on women photographers even that had been done at that time.  And what inspired me to do this really was Arthur [Arthur Ashe] was working on his 'History of the African-American Athlete' ['A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete,' Arthur R. Ashe, Jr.], the three-volume history.  And I said, wow, this has not been done in photography with black women.  And so there we were in tandem working on these two books and it was wonderful.  It was a great time.  We were comparing, comparing careers and accomplishments and it was a wonderful time.  And both books were actually published in 1986 [sic.].
Story_ID: 377161
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The History Makers.  Our videographer is Neculai Burghelea.  Ma'am could you please state your full name for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April 15, tax day, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are actually in my dining room of my home.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we are completing the interview that we started in January I believe.
Speaker 2: January 15, 2007, in Chicago [Illinois].  We are in New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] birthday--
Speaker 2: Right, it was Dr. King's birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We pick significant days, don't we Larry (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Story_ID: 377162
Speaker 1: We were at about 1977 and you were working on the 'Daufuskie Island' book [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] I believe.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I probably mentioned in the previous interview that I had done a six-month independent study when I was in college [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York] and I went to West Africa.  And at that time I was completely involved and, and overwhelmed by the fishing villages that I, I visited when I was there in Ghana and Liberia on the West Coast of Africa which was basically where I spent my six months.  And when I came back after my studies I thought it would be--and I graduated in '75 [1975]--in '77 [1977] there was a, a tennis tournament that was held at Hilton Head Island [South Carolina].  And I had always heard about the Sea Islands and the connection between the West Coast of Africa and the eastern shore and the Sea Islands, South Carolina and Georgia Sea Islands.  So we--my husband [Arthur Ashe] and I went down to South Carolina and I started investigating the Sea Islands and decided I was going to focus on a project there.  And visited a lot of the islands until, and I'm pretty sure I mentioned this before, a friend of mine Vertamae Grosvenor [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor], when I talked to--she's from Beaufort, South Carolina--when I spoke to her about the idea of the project that I wanted to do, she said, "You have got to go to Daufuskie Island [South Carolina]."  And of course I said, "What's Daufuskie?" And she gave me a little history and background of the island and gave me the name of a gentleman whose name is [HistoryMaker] Emory Campbell, who at the time was running the Penn Center which was in--on St. Helena Island [South Carolina], also known as Frogmore.  So I connected with Emory and Emory took me on a tour of Daufuskie and that was--that was the spot.  And in 1982, what's that five years after I first started the journey of the Sea Islands, after repeated visits through 1981, I think January '81 [1981] was my last journey, I photographed Ms. Blossom's funeral.  And then I took the book, shopped the book around to publishers and it was a tough sell but somebody suggested the University of South Carolina Press [Columbia, South Carolina].  And they were interested and published the book.  And at the Columbia Museum of Art and Science [Columbia Museum of Art, Columbia, South Carolina] in South Carolina we had a, a pub date for the book and we had an exhibition of all the photographs of the book which now remain in the Columbia museum.  And the book is a collectors' item.  And we're in 2007, that was thirty years ago.
Story_ID: 377163
Speaker 1: So you can't find it anywhere and I am indeed in the process of trying to get it republished because of course Daufuskie Island [South Carolina], just like Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], has been completely developed and it still has no bridge linking it to the mainland which makes it really unique to all the other Sea Islands.  But developers did buy up all the land from the native Daufuskians.  And they now have beautiful waterfront homes and a place called Melrose Plantation [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina], which did employ several of the Daufuskians who lived on the island so that was a good thing.  But for many of the people who really didn't know what was happening you know they were selling land for a thousand dollars an acre or something like that, which is a lot of money to them, and moving to Savannah [Georgia] in these very small apartment-like structures.  And of course the developers then went on to sell the land for about a hundred thousand dollars an acre.  So, and that's a well known fact.  I mean, in fact there was a not-for-profit law group, the Christic Institute, that was based in I believe probably s- Columbia, South Carolina [sic. Washington, D.C.], I'm not absolutely sure where Christic Institute was, but it was a corporation of--of not-for-profit lawyers who actually advocated after they heard what was happening for the Daufuskians to--.  Because it was common knowledge that most of them didn't have deeds to their land.  They were handed down through generations.  And this was a--an island that was loaded originally with plantations and slaves.  So they are all direct descendents of slaves.  So the long story short is that Daufuskie Island has been transformed.  But now that it's been transformed thirty year later I think the book ['Daufuskie Island,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] should be republished so I'm still on a mission to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the concern of most I think African American scholars, dating back to, and I can't think of his name, I don't know why, I just saw the book in a bookstore not long ago--
Speaker 1: Is he at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: No, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the black his- linguist and anthropologist that went over to Daufuskie and wrote the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I know--
Speaker 2: Anyway but since the '30s [1930s] I know there's been academic effort on the part of black folks to--
Speaker 1: There was Robert Conroy [sic. Pat Conroy] who wrote 'The Water Is Wide' and actually taught school on the island and of course there was a famous movie called 'The Water Is Wide' that Jon Voigt played.
Speaker 2: Conroy, right, well 'Conrack.'  They titled the movie 'Conrack' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's what it was, yes.
Speaker 2: He taught school, about a white man teaching school on the island based on Conroy's book.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  But I'm not sure who this person was at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: I, I, I can't--I'll think of it before this is over (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was it Professor Herman Blake [HistoryMaker J. Herman Blake]?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't Blake.
Speaker 1: He's at San Jose [sic.] now.
Speaker 2: It wasn't Herman Blake but I, I just saw the book recently.  They had it appropriately priced very high (laughter).
Speaker 1: And when was this book published?
Speaker 2: This was sometime in the '30s [1930s] or '40s [1940s].  Yeah, I think the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Book that I did research was written by Crum [Mason Crum], C-R-U-M, last name.
Speaker 2: It wasn't Crum.  There's a--there's a book by a black scholar from University of Chicago who studied them, and I can't even tell you what discipline, but he studied languages.
Speaker 1: The Gullah language.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the Africanisms and the Gullah language.
Speaker 1: Yeah, somehow that's jogging my memory a little bit but I can't come up with the name but it has been recorded, yes, as a language (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And people are, black people have been--there have been organized efforts to try to slow down the development process over there.
Story_ID: 377164
Speaker 1: I mean now, in 2007, Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina] is developed now, are there any, any pristine places left?
Speaker 2: Well I have not actually been there in about ten years.  The lady that I stayed with when, when I was going down there frequently thirty years ago, I went back to see a couple of times and I spoke to her maybe about three years ago.  Someone called me and told me that she was very ill so I called her and we had a couple of conversations and then she died not long after that.  So I'm in touch with--I haven't spoken to him, [HistoryMaker] Emory Campbell--but I am in touch with Vertamae Grosvenor's [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] family and as far as I know the island is pretty much developed, developed.  But there are probably some native islanders who are still holding on and living there.  But I haven't been.  It would be a curious thing to go back particularly with the republishing of the book ['Daufuskie Island,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe].
Speaker 1: Your book came out in '82 [1982] and I think [HistoryMaker] Julie Dash's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, her movie--
Speaker 1: 'Daughters of the Dust'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was out I guess in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: That's right, I think that's right.
Speaker 1: She worked on it for years before was able to--she was able to release it.  You know but people--that's the--that's the most African part of the United States.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, that's exactly what the lure was for me to go there having spent those six months in West Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there-are you going to republish it as--?
Speaker 2: Well, can you find a publisher (laughter)?  It's a tough sell.  With photography books fine art is--fine art photography is a very tough sell.  But I'm actually having a meeting in a couple of weeks with a gentleman who is going to come up hopefully with a concept of how to present this to a publisher because I've tried a couple and--and it's been turned down.  But hopefully we'll do it, we'll get it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Story_ID: 377165
Speaker 1: What did you work on next?
Speaker 2: Let's see, that was published in 1981 and I did several photography exhibitions in between--while I was working on the Daufuskie Island [South Carolina] piece, I was doing freelance work.  And then I pretty much started doing more fine art photography rather than documentary type work and was focusing more on you know just street reportage as it was called.  So I was happy to do that.  I mean I think that--that the work like 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] was very meaningful to me but also my artwork because I was traditionally trained in, in photography as a fine art form.  To really--I still wanted to explore that.  That was really my passion.  But in 1984, which is about three years later, I got the bug to do a book on African American women photographers.  And I did that, again largely inspired by, I believe it was--well actually no, that's--that's not true.  Arthur [Arthur Ashe] started his--he was working on his 'History of the African-American Athlete' ['A Hard Road To Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete,' Arthur R. Ashe, Jr.] in the mid to late '80s [1980s] because his book was published in '86 [sic. 1988].  And I remember him doing most of the work while we were living in Mount Kisco, New York and we moved there in 1985.  But I did my entire 'Viewfinders' ['Viewfinders: Black Women Photographers,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] project while we were living in the city [New York, New York].  And it too was published in 1986.  But we were both working on historical surveys of our, our individual careers and lifelines so to speak.  So it was really a good time to be working on historical perspectives because we were comparing notes and we were both working at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] at the same time to go for research work.  I was doing quite a bit of traveling to do interviews with some of these photographers.  And I had a research assistant who--one was Kali Diana Grosvenor [Kali Grosvenor-Henry], who was Verta Grosvenor's [Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor] daughter that I'm still very much in touch with now.  But she was my research assistant and did quite a bit of flying around to libraries to help with the research work.  And it was interesting.  How--it was not easy to find women--black women photographers from the 1800s.
Story_ID: 377166
Speaker 1: And the earliest one we found was 1839, Mary E. Flenoy from, from Danville, Texas [sic. Danville, Illinois].  And--
Speaker 2: How did she get involved in photography back in those days?
Speaker 1: How did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there's got to be a good story as to how she got involved in it.
Speaker 1: Mary, Mary Flenoy began--I believe that she, because you're really jogging my memory.  I haven't read the book ['Viewfinders: Black Women Photographers,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] for probably in quite a while now but she worked with a mom and pop studio, which was very popular during that time, particularly later.  But it was--they were called mom and pop studios because husbands and wives were operating the studios at that time.  And she trained with this, this couple, which was a white couple, and learned photography that way.  So the way that, that we discovered her was--at that time there was a, a career directory so that you could go through the directory and depending on--if you looked under photographers, you could look up names and the way you could tell someone was a person of color is there was a C a- after the name and the C marked the person as a person of color.
Speaker 2: Just like in a census, basically, they had a similar thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly and we did--we did the census as well but the census--this was actually a document on a directory of professions that was actually put together by the census.  So we had gotten leads from libraries in different cities that these were possibilities, that they had heard this.  And so of course Kali [Kali Grosvenor-Henry] would go down and research this.  And there was a woman in Danville [Illinois]--I want to say Moline, Illinois, but I believe it was Danville, Illinois, who, that's Danville twice, who was also working with a mom and pop studio.  There was a mom and pop--I should have known you were going to ask me these questions about the book--studio in Charleston, South Carolina, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you're saying, from what I gather from what you're saying, you don't have to go through all the details of the book, but--that these women were involved with these ma and pa studios with white folks and as assistants in some way and then they decided to get involved in the actual discipline of photography--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and producing photographs.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  In the case of the woman in Charleston, South Carolina, her husband was a painter and she often took photographs that he painted, which is exhibited in the book.  So they worked differently than a mom, pop studio but he encouraged her, she encouraged him.  And there were a lot of stories like that.  Obviously it goes into women photographers, the war photographers, you know the women photographers and then there were the camera girls who took pictures in the nightclubs where the soldiers would go which was a whole story unto itself.  And then you had the WACs [Women's Army Corps].  There were WACs who were photographers, the--the women in the Army Corps.
Story_ID: 377167
Speaker 1: Sounds like this is a profession new in 1830s that had not been assigned a gender yet (laughter), maybe, I'm suggesting that maybe that's.
Speaker 2: Well, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because people tend to think of professions, especially in those days, as belonging to a gender, one gender or the other.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: But this is a profession that people hadn't figured out who it belonged to yet (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true, that's right.  Well certainly the reason why I went into it is that I knew that my generation of black women photographers weren't the first and s- therefore there had to be others.  But where were they?  And we hadn't heard anything about them.  And the other research assistant that I had on the book is the wonderful [HistoryMaker] Deborah Willis, who's now a MacArthur Fellow and a Guggenheim [Guggenheim Fellowship] recipient and Arthur Fletcher Award [A.J. Fletcher Foundation Award].  She's, she's just incredible.  She started--she was working at the Schomburg library [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] at that time as their photohistorian and researcher.  So Debbie and I used to have conversations about these women.  She would go through some of the archives of the Schomburg and she'd send me a picture and you know she was really kind of egging me on.  "We've got to do this project together."  So she really didn't have the time to devote full-time to doing this book project.  So we really did it together.  But I, I wrote the book myself but she helped in large part with the research as did my research assistant, Kali Diana Grosvenor [Kali Grosvenor-Henry].  And the great thing is all of the wonderful responses that I've gotten from women who--contemporary women photographers and women who aren't photographers who never knew that these women existed.  And then of course the wonderful kudos I received from Naomi Rosenblum who wrote 'The World History of Photography' ['A World History of Photography,' Naomi Rosenblum], and after seeing 'Viewfinders' ['Viewfinders: Black Women Photographers,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] decided to do 'Women in Photography' [sic. 'A History of Women Photographers,' Naomi Rosenblum] and she used my book to reference the black women that she used in her book on women in photography.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's quite a compliment.
Speaker 2: It was quite a compliment and you know made me feel totally vindicated (laughter) about the project.
Speaker 1: And this is groundbreaking research and it's the kind of thing that expands our knowledge of who we are--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and what we've been doing.
Speaker 2: Which, exactly, that's what started it.
Speaker 1: I think young people often think well 18- that's back in slavery days and that's all we were doing, picking cotton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all we know, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But that's--we were doing a lot more than that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, yeah.  So now, is, is that book hard to find now?
Speaker 2: It did go into a second printing and it's now out of print but you can probably find it remaindered some place.  Actually I have seen it on Amazon, and although 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] is listed on Amazon.com, all four of my books are listed on Amazon.com, it says 'Daufuskie Island' is out of print.  'Viewfinders' they have some used copies.  I went to a book company that's, that you can reach on the Internet, it's called Alibris, and Alibris sells used and out of print books.  And they had a copy of 'Daufuskie Island' maybe three months ago and the price for it was $1400.  And I went back to look for the copy because I was telling somebody else about it and it was gone.  So that kind of thing really makes me feel like this book needs to be republished.  Somebody has an interest in it and it could even be the developers who developed the island [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina].  So it you know it's progressive to try to find somebody to support the interest in, in getting the book republished because it only went through one publication.  'Viewfinders' is--you can buy it on Amazon.com if you just type it into books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was 1986.
Story_ID: 377168
Speaker 1: What did you do after, after the publication of 'Viewfinders' ['Viewfinders: Black Women Photographers,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Viewfinders'?
Speaker 1: Did you go on tour with the book?
Speaker 2: I did go on tour with the book and did a lot of press and it received a lot of recognition.  But it got a lot of ink, which was a very good thing.  Also it was a national type book because women photographers from all across the country were very interested in this concept.  So it, it did--it did pretty well.  And obviously it went into a second printing so it did well enough to do that.  But then I was hooked on women projects and I went back to Dodd, Mead [Dodd, Mead and Company], who initially published--did the first publishing of--first printing of 'Viewfinders,' and I took them an idea on centenarian women.  So I wanted to do this book on a hundred centenarians.  And I started doing the interviews but I got interrupted and along came my daughter.  (Laughter) So I just told the publisher I'm going to have to put this aside because this I something that I'd been waiting for for a long time and didn't want to divide my time.  I was thirty-six years old and I was ready, had been married for ten years and was ready to be a full-time mom.  So I did that.  And continued to work as a fine art photographer and did--you know my poor kid she just grew up with a camera in front of her face all of the time beside the fact that I named her Camera [Camera Ashe] (laughter) which does mean room of light and I'm always--I've always reminded her of that, yeah.  So and then I came up with a couple of other project ideas during that time, had several exhibitions internationally.  I showed my work in Florence, Italy, and in Paris, France, and London, England, and at that time, particularly in England because of the Caribbean, Caribbean Englanders you know who had the mixed heritage of English and Caribbean culture, they were very, very interested in 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe].  So I had a couple of shows in London, one at a place--a gallery called the Elbow Room [London, England].  And it was received--a lot of press in London.  So I did some traveling with that and then other things started requiring my time.  And even though I was still working I wasn't really involved in a book at that time because I was a full-time mom and when my daughter was twenty months old we discovered that you know Arthur [Arthur Ashe] had been diagnosed with AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.]  So I was pretty much devoted to photographing my personal environment and my personal world.  And I went off and did photographing at one place or another.  Went to a couple of workshops so I stayed enga- stayed engaged in the dialogue of photography and talked to my colleagues but I was pretty much devoted to home at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well that's a consuming kind of a crisis.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The whole country was going through it, sort of a trauma behind the whole concept of AIDS and the whole thing being somewhat new in the '80s [1980s] and not knowing what to make of it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know where does it come from, how do you get it, who's got it?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And what should we do about it, and you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so many questions about it.
Story_ID: 377169
Speaker 1: Now there's an interesting story about how your husband contracted it, which was one of the ways that most people didn't think about, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, well we certainly didn't think about it (laughter), yeah.  But when he lost movement in his right hand, it just literally stopped working, the right hand.  He couldn't write anything and so he knew at that point that something was really wrong.  And he woke up one morning with his hand, it was like, it was just dead.  We were actually living in Mount Kisco [New York] at that time at it was 1988 and we were scheduled to do the CBS morning show ['CBS This Morning'].  They had a, a segment that they were doing on visiting the home of various people.  And we had scheduled this for a very long time and he said, "No, let's go ahead and do the interview."  So if you watch that interview you'll see that he does not move his hand.  But of course we didn't know what was going on.  We had just made this commitment to do the interview.  And we got through that and got in a car and as soon as that was over and went right to the doctor and had x-rays done.  And the first thing that they told us was that there was a brain mass and that he had a brain tumor.  So we dealt with that for a little while until we were sent into New York City [New York, New York] and of course they did studies on this brain mass and at the time did a blood test and found that he was HIV-positive.  So this was 1988 when we found out and of course AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] was a big taboo still, big taboo.  And many, many people were afraid to talk about it.  Didn't quite know how to embrace the issue.  I mean the idea of embracing the issue is, is really wrong because certainly our government didn't take leadership.  So there was no way that the country was going to stand up and say okay this is--this is something we need to do.  And at that time, for us as a family, because we didn't know for five years, that--from the time Arthur [Arthur Ashe] had first been infected was 1983, and we were just trying to, to cope with that and to thrive as a family.  Camera [Camera Ashe] was so young.  And so we found ways of doing that and it was not something that people wanted to share openly.  And it wasn't just us even though we were a, you know a well-known family.  But Arthur's infectious disease doctor [Henry W. Murray] had actually arranged for me to speak with several women who were caregivers of their husbands who were infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], to talk about--we strategized on the phone of how we were dealing with this.  And we did it completely anonymous.  They didn't want me to know who they were and I certainly didn't want people to know who I was at that time because it, that anonymity was, was very important and yet we had a very strong need to converse about the subject.
Story_ID: 377170
Speaker 1: I don't think we really stated how he contracted AIDS [auto immunodeficiency syndrome], I think--I mentioned that it was in an unusual way and you said yes and then we moved on, but just for the record why don't we just--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well Arthur [Arthur Ashe] had a heart condition that was congenital and of course didn't know.  His father [Arthur Ashe, Sr.] had had several heart attacks and actually his mother [Mattie Cordell Cunningham Ashe] died when he was six years old.  So he had a--you know being an athlete and being the picture of health no one ever suspected that this could have been a problem in him.  And of course it showed up.  He had a heart attack when he was--he was what, thirty-six years old.  And he had a bypass operation in 1979 and then in 1981 I think the--one of the--one of the veins had closed up, become occluded again.  And he did not want to--took him a while but he didn't really want to slow down.  He was enjoying his lifestyle even though he had retired from tennis.  He had also been named the United States' Davis Cup captain, which required a rather vigorous lifestyle so--and not to mention the amount of stress involved.  But--so in 1981 he started developing problems again and having chest discomfort.  But it wasn't--it was manageable.  But by 1983, about a year and a half after he started having some problems, he decided to have another bypass operation.  He had it at St. Luke's Hospital [Mount Sinai St. Luke's] here in New York City [New York, New York] and, and right, it was 1983 and he did not do well after the surgery.  The second day that he was in the hospital he was very, very weak and they decided to give him a blood transfusion, which was not the case for his first bypass.  He did not need a blood transfusion.  So he had one and you know all was well until he started--he survived the operation, came through it just fine and went on and led a normal life until 1988.  In the summer of 1988 we started--he started having flu-like symptoms and again you know we didn't pay much attention to that.  Just--I just remember being in London [England] at Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon] and he was working for HBO Sports doing the commentary, that he would have days that were kind of rough and he'd be--he would be sick.  But in 1988 it was when the hand, to take us back full circle to that when the hand went numb.  That he was sent in to check out this brain mass and although they had then done the blood test for--just to check everything out to be thorough and they found out that he was HIV-positive.  They then did a brain operation to check out this mass and in by  doing a biopsy of the brain mass they found out that he had toxoplasmosis, which was full blown--which was an indicator for full blown AIDS.  So from that point it was little by little, telling family members, you know was very hard on his father who actually died a year later of a stroke.  And it was very hard on family as people who have to manage this, this disease and this illness particularly during that period of time.  It was very hard because there really wasn't a language that was developed openly and people were taking great caution.
Story_ID: 377171
Speaker 1: But I think that there are those, fast forwarding a little bit, who would take issue with that but I think everybody has to make a decision based on what works for them.  And I might add here because it comes to my mind--because it was an emotional decision for us as a family, not to go public with it.  But for those people who criticized us once Arthur [Arthur Ashe] did go public for going that long of a period of time without going public, it's important to understand that Arthur Ashe had been an advocate and had been at the forefront of many, many causes for his entire life.  AIDS [auto immunodeficiency syndrome] was not a cause that brought him to the forefront.  And he knew at that time that he had to get everything in order.  He had so many commitments that if he came out with his, and he was healthy dealing with various issues at the time but healthy enough to really get his life in order and all of his commitments in order.  To scholar-athletes, to--towards his, his commitment to education and illiteracy, his commitment to grassroots tennis programs, I mean it goes on and on the commitments that he had--to racism, apartheid.  He was flying down to South Africa.  This man had causes his entire life and AIDS was another cause that he absolutely intended to step to the plate and do but when he decided to do it.  And he was not given that choice and what he had predicted happened because you know AIDS needed spokesperson--people.  We were very aware of that but so did all of the other causes that no one was really in the forefront of.  No one was so eloquently speaking and being such an eloquent well-spoken voice on all of these issues that you know Arthur decided to continue to do what he had to do to, to have all of the causes that he had brought to the forefront taken care of and put into perspective because he knew that they were going to go on the back burner once he went public with AIDS.  And it did happen but I think everything worked out for the best and I think that the--unfortunately the pressure that was the additional pressure that was put on him at that time in 1982 didn't help his medical condition.  There is no question about it but because he was Arthur Ashe there was no avoiding it.  So it was a matter of him deciding when he was going to make that decision and there was only one Arthur Ashe and it was his decision to make that.  There's only one of all of us and it should be our right to make that decision as long as we have our free will as to how we determine our direction in life and what we choose.
Story_ID: 377172
Speaker 1: That obviously changed our lives forever.  I mean we couldn't walk down the street without people walking up to us and literally start crying.  And you know putting all of that into perspective it was the--particularly for our daughter [Camera Ashe], who was about five years old at the time--but--in the big picture the response was heart-warming and it was supportive and I think that if there was anything good that was going to come out of it, given who Arthur [Arthur Ashe] was as a human being, and given the way people loved him, he handled that so well.  And the public received him so well, overall, not everybody but overall, the majority.  So he lived, let's see that was April 8, 1992, when he made his public announcement and that was a very busy year.
Speaker 2: Election year.
Speaker 1: My daughter--sorry?
Speaker 2: An election year.
Speaker 1: It was an election year, that's right.  And we got our wonderful President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] that year.  And yeah, actually Arthur did see the inauguration and in fact wrote about it as he worked with Arnold Rampersad in 'Days of Grace' ['Days of Grace: A Memoir,' Arthur Ashe and Arnold Rampersad].  The last chapter of the book was called "Dear Camera" ["My Dear Camera"] and he wrote it while he was watching Bill Clinton--Bill Clinton's inauguration on TV which was January 20, 1993.
Story_ID: 377173
Speaker 1: But just to go back a little bit because--one of the things we were dealing with was Camera's [Camera Ashe] kindergarten and the kids at school who were profoundly behaving based on the misunderstanding or the judgment of their parents in talking about death, illness, AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  It was something they could not talk about around their kids so if they were discussing this--because now of course it was out in the open, and we didn't know this was going on until the teachers were telling us that, "Look, Camera's having to deal with some very specific issues about her father's illness," and they told us some of these stories that was going on in the classroom.  And we decided as a family to do a story based on, with photographs, based on a child dealing with a parent with a severe illness and in our case it happened to be AIDS.  And we wanted to give parents a way to--we wanted to give them language, a way to discuss illness and death with their kids in a very tender way through Camera's eyes.  And we--let's see we finished--we were doing all of these pictures until Arthur [Arthur Ashe] passed away on February 6, 1993, and Ar- Camera and I began doing this book shortly after that.  We made the decision as a family to do this book.  And in December of 1994 'Daddy and Me' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] was published which was my third publication, my first children's book and one of the hardest books to do but yet one of the--hardest in that a children's book is not an easy thing to do because every word counts in a children's book.  And you have to be simple and it's not easy to be simple.  But it was a, a joyous thing for my daughter because for her it was a celebration of her dad and other people saw it as a young child losing her father but she saw it as a celebration of her dad.
Speaker 2: Now what was she six when it was published (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was six when he passed away.  She had just turned six.  She's a December baby.
Speaker 2: Those are precious times for fathers and daughters and parents and their children.
Speaker 1: No question about it, they were very, very close so I think that that really shows in the book.  And their relationship I thought was a really good teaching tool and I think we were successful in doing that.  So you know Camera was always very proud of this publication.
Story_ID: 377174
Speaker 1: So we've had transitions since then.  I continued to work and I was very--we, Camera [Camera Ashe] and I, and Arthur [Arthur Ashe]--were very blessed with a young woman who was living with us at the time, Dolores [ph.], who was from Manchester, England, but of Jamaican descent.  And she helped with Camera, she's a terrific girl she was going to school at Hunter studying--Hunter College [New York, New York]--studying early childhood education.  And she was living with us and helping to you know manage--we were so pulled from so many different directions at that time.  And after Arthur died she stayed on with me which was enormously useful because not only had I published and went on a book tour for 'Daddy and Me' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] but that year I received--Arthur received, eleven posthumous honorary degrees, eleven.  And it was--(laughter) you know it was a very busy year so I needed help with my daughter and the fact that this woman was already in our lives was a lifesaver.  And we're still friends today--to fast forward--and I'm the godmother of her baby, of her daughter who's now twelve (laughter).  But that's, you know that's how we made it through that period of time and after that I was able to continue thriving in my passion and my love in addition to trying to help Arthur's legacy to con- to continue to thrive.  The demands were at times insurmountable and at times I had to not be doing my work but I have always been true to the Moutoussamy part of my name, always.  And that's why I kept it even after I married Arthur and it's paid off because it's that passion for what I grew up learning how to do in the arts that has really helped me to survive as a--as a person and I think the work I've been doing--by the work I've been doing I feel vindicated by that (laughter).  So I did quite a bit of work after that and my first big one-woman show after that was in 1996, after Arthur's death, and I did a kind of--it was somewhat of a twenty-five year retrospective of my work at the Leica Gallery [New York, New York].  And that really got my feet back on the ground.  With all of the not-for-profit work I had started doing, I was learning how to juggle that and at the same time get back into my own work, so that was a very good period of time for me.  Now, (laughter) borrow a line from Arthur, I've learned to be a very good juggler (laughter).  It's just how many balls can you continue to juggle in the air at the same time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You've done an admirable job of juggling.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 377175
Speaker 1: The latest book of yours is 'African Flower' ['The African Flower: Singing of Angels,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe and A.D. Coleman].  Right, and tell us about that one.
Speaker 2: After the exhibition in '96 [1996] I was just traveling and working and doing my fine art work and doing some assignments and contributing to various book projects, again doing some projects with [HistoryMaker] Deborah Willis but really participating in projects that she was doing.  And decided since in 2001, so that was about five years later, but in preparing, so in 2000 I decided that by 2001 I wanted to do something really big because I was going to turn fifty.  And the thing that was so significant for me about turning fifty was that Arthur [Arthur Ashe] didn't.  He died when he was forty-nine.  So it was hard for me to make that leap to the next decade because in a sense you know you felt like you were leaving him, truly leaving him.  Grief is a life long process.  It does get much more manageable.  I know I'm, I'm going aside here but I think it's appropriate to, to, to mention.  But you know the thing about grief is that you have to learn how to partner with it and I think the first year I did not and I slowly gave in to partnering with grief.  And it was a great lesson that I learned to do it.  And I thought that by the time I turned fifty--because when Arthur died I was forty-one years old, I thought I was cruising but that's what you got to learn about grief.  That it keeps coming up and at first there are just waves and waves of it.  But as time passes by, and this was nine years later, there are events that will continue to bring it up.  And lots of people recognize this.  They--you know if somebody hears me say this they'll recognize it.  And there are people who have completely denied it and not allowed grief to happen and they're paying for it (laughter).  They're probably managing but with grief comes fear and you really have to face that fear, just partner with it.
Story_ID: 377176
Speaker 1: So when 2001 came along I said, okay, how am I going to approach this year.  I decided to start a website for myself, JeanneMoutoussamy-Ashe.com.  So I bought a bunch of domain names and decided to start getting involved with the Internet and really learning it well, how to set this up, get my work online because this seemed like, I mean it's 2000 now, it made sense that at this point I should be ab-, but had not.  I decided to publish another book and have a one-woman show.  So I hired a couple of assistants and I applied for a grant, because when I shopped the idea around for the 'African Flower' ['The African Flower: Singing of Angels,' Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe and A.D. Coleman] book, again a fine art photography book was not welcomed.  And I did take it to Michael Hoffman [Michael E. Hoffman], who was the head of Aperture, who publishes Aperture books.  He's passed away now but at the time I took the book to Michael and he loved it.  And he asked me to leave the work with him.  He was going to talk to his people about it and he really liked the book.  But I took him a maquette with all of the photographs and he looked at the maquette, which I had printed on black pages because that's the way I saw the book, and Michael said, "This book should not be printed on black pages; it's just not going to work."  And while I respected his wisdom it was not the book I wanted to do.  So (laughter), call me an idiot, I don't know (laughter), but I said, "No, that's not the book I want to do."  So I applied for a grant and I published the book myself.  And he was really respectful of that and actually called Stinehour Press [Lunenburg, Vermont] and said--who published, published a lot of the Aperture books--and said, "This young lady wants to publish a book and she's getting a grant and you know the work is--," he liked the work, "Pay special attention to it."  So I drove up to Lunenburg, Vermont with my maquette and discussed the book project with them.  And brought on a book designer, who was a graduate of, of Cooper Union [Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York], my alma mater, and she had just graduated.  I had two very young assistants at that time.  One who was helping me with the Internet project and one who was helping me with the book project because I really didn't know Photoshop that well at this point, I was learning it on an as needed basis.  And a friend of mine, photographer Ralph Gibson, who I had known for quite some time but was getting to know a lot better because I was much more engaged in my work at this time.  I took this project idea to Ralph Gibson, and he loved the idea and he worked with me.  We sat down at a computer and was very generous with his time, showed me how Macs work in book publishing.  Here's a man who's published over forty books and he'd done half of them himself so that was great inspiration for me to publish my own book and with--in fact the book 'African Flower,' once I did get it published, is dedicated to Ralph Gibson and it's dedicated to Camera [Camera Ashe] and to Arthur [Arthur Ashe].  So that book was really a book of transition for me as was the exhibition and the title name of the exhibition because I had transitioned from this period of time where I really knew that, "Okay, you're fifty now," and life is--you're going to approach things differently.  And, and I've been on a roll ever since (laughter). Yeah, so it's been one good thing after another.
Story_ID: 377177
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) You know, one of the things that I think has really deteriorated in our community is really taking good care of ourselves.  Understanding the value of education.  Understanding the value of wellness.  Understanding the value of self, that you are a human being.  I mean Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] has been saying that forever, as long as I can remember.  But to now see us as a community not really taking good care of ourselves.  This is something that comes from within.  And you can either be responsive to the negative aspects of the world around you or you can shut it out and you can find the resources within yourself to do for yourself, to help yourself.  We look a lot in our community for help.  And there's no question that humankind needs help, it's not just our community.  But what I hope for our community is compassion for each other, compassion for yourself and to take care in, in moving your life forward with a path, a good path.  Because you know if each one of us does for ourselves and take- takes care of ourselves, and there's no question (laughter) you know race has been a very predominate theme in this society.  And proof positive, here it is April 15, 2007 and Don Imus has made this incredibly stupid remark that was so thoughtless.  Not only was it a racist and sexist remark but what it must have felt like for those particular girls from the Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] basketball team to have gotten so much notoriety from that statement and not how they pulled themselves up in this tournament.  And even though they lost that there was an emphasis on what big hearts they had.  That racism drove that.  And the sad part about it is that that perpetuates, for other people in the--this country, in the world, who think that, oh Don Imus--that was just his humor.  That's just the way he talks.  That's just--.  Hey, there are people who believe that and if a Don Imus is publicly making that remark, then it's okay to do it.  It's not okay in our community, absolutely not.  That's what I mean about compassion and respect for yourself.  But it certainly is not okay if you are media and have the responsibility of being a voice to the public to make a comment like that.  So, yes, we are faced as a community with that kind of aggression and violence, which I hope that we can as a community really not listen to that and instead conduct ourselves in a way that commands respect, commands respect.
Story_ID: 375237
Speaker 1: It's really interesting and one or two people have said to me, "What do you think Arthur [Arthur Ashe] would say about the Don Imus comment?"  And you know I can't tell you word for word what he would say but I can tell you that would have immediately called him to arms.  It would not have been anything that he would have taken personally but instead stepped up to the plate and would have eloquently and with great integrity talk--he would ask to have a conversation with Don Imus.  He would go, if someone were to call him and asked him--and ask him what he thought, he would go do--Arthur was very accessible, particularly was passionate about discussing race.  This would have made him front and center to come back with the, the positive and the negative of what has happened as a result of Dom Imus and move us into a different place as a--as a global community with an issue like that.  Because I, I really don't--not to make Arthur this great icon, but Arthur did have a way of--it was his conscience, his deep conscience that he considered everyone.  He was completely inclusive and yet, having grown up in the segregated South, knew, and growing up in the white tennis world, the effects of race.  He knew it from the time he came into this world.  So a comment like that I think would have made him stand up tall and address it and address whoever would like to address him.  He never shied away from any kind of discussion.  And he didn't argue with you.  He never argued.  He discussed.
Speaker 2: The disturbing thing about the--the Imus comment is that some of the girls said it hurt them deeply--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and but I must say when you see them on television they were, they handled themselves (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, they were very dignified and very courageous and have great leadership with Vivian Stringer [C. Vivian Stringer].  I thought that [HistoryMaker] Gwen Ifill, the television reporter who did a wonderfully skillful, eloquent piece in The New York Times, I don't know if you saw it--
Speaker 2: I didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in The New York Times op-ed piece--
Speaker 2: Was it in today?
Speaker 1: No, it ran I believe Thursday, maybe Wednesday or Thursday of this past week.  She was right on it and just said exactly what needed to be said and addressed the fact that this is really about those girls and how--what these girls have had to endure in doing that which should make us all stand up and take note.  Very, very good op-ed piece.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What do you think your husband's advice would be to the basketball players of the Rutgers' [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Oh, he definitely would have met with them and embraced them and apologized.  But probably not apologized in the sense that he felt that he needed to apologize to them.  Apologize in that I'm really sorry that this happened to you because he would have felt it deeply for them.  Not so much Imus making the comment but feeling badly for these girls.  I think that--I try to not speak (laughter) for Arthur but because he had--he really could speak from his heart so well.  I think he would have spent time with, with these girls and they would have felt his care.  He would have been added to the stream of, of support that they've been receiving and I think that they really would have appreciated it from him.  He for sure would have met with them.
Story_ID: 375238
Speaker 1: You mentioned, you know we've alluded to all the work that you do representing the legacy of your husband and just give us an idea of the many different things.  I know the latest thing you've done is create a website.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what are some of the other--Arthur Ashe Foundation, which was created while he was alive (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS [Arthur Ashe Endowment for the Defeat of AIDS] was created while Arthur [Arthur Ashe] was alive and it was created to really be a sunset organization.  He timed it to run the entire fifteen months of the tennis tour, which is how the tournaments are set up.  And after that fifteen months, that would have been the end of the effort.  But he didn't live to the end of that fifteen month period of time so I decided to continue the work.  And after he--his goal was to raise $5 million.  And after we surpassed the goal of $5 million the board, which I then shared, voted to transition the AIDS endow- AIDS foundation into an endowment.  So we took a million dollars from the money that we had raised and we had been distributing to programs, AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] programs worldwide because the money was being raised worldwide--because the tennis community is a world community--that we took a million dollars and we set up an Arthur Ashe Endowment of the Defeat of AIDS at New York Hospital [NewYork-Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York], where Arthur was treated and his infectious disease doctor is now the Arthur Ashe Professor of, of Medicine [Arthur R. Ashe Jr. Professor of Medicine] at, at New York Hospital, which is something that we just--we just started.  But so the endowment, we decided to keep it going on but what happens with the endowment is that it operates several programs that are global programs.  The one we're most proud of is the international healthcare worker training program where we bring six to eight workers globally, from around the world, to New York Hospital.  They're given a stipend.  They're given room and board and they train at New York Hospital and various AIDS clinics in New York City [New York, New York] and go back to their communities, whether it's Zimbabwe, or Lesotho, or Ghana, or Thailand, wherever, India.  We bring them from all over the world and they train and it's sort of under that trickle down theory that the information they learn will be passed on.  You don't have to be a doctor or a nurse.  You can just be a caregiver and be nominated for this program.  So the endowment is continuing to raise money.  We've now started--we still do fundraising at--during the U.S. Open [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York] at a booth where we sell merchandise that advocates the endowment.  And we operate these AIDS programs.  And the program should go on, hopefully, for as long as New York Hospital houses it.  But we have an Arthur Ashe Lecture [Arthur Ashe Endowment Lecture] once a year, in addition to the programs and, and the professorship, which Dr. Murray [Henry W. Murray] now holds that title but when he leaves then another doctor will take that title.  And I'm on the board of the endowment so you know I'm still very much involved with that.
Story_ID: 375239
Speaker 1: There were twenty-four groups operating--named groups after Arthur [Arthur Ashe] operating at the time--shortly after his death.  We counted about twenty-four and I just could not--people were calling me and saying, you know, "Well, this group is competing with this group and who do I give money to?"  In terms of a fundraising effort all of these groups really wanted to thrive and they were all sort of jumping on the momentum of Arthur having been in the forefront and it was a difficult thing to manage.  So I started the Arthur Ashe Foundation [Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS; Arthur Ashe Endowment for the Defeat of AIDS], which really was the umbrella organization for all twenty-four groups to get them to recognize the importance of each group and how they could--I had license agreements drawn up so that you know people wouldn't be fundraising in other people's territories.  That a stadium wouldn't--you know there wouldn't be two stadiums with Arthur's name within a five-mile radius of each other, there were schools and--.  So just to kind of get things through that period of time I set up the foundation and it raised money that distributed money to these twenty-four groups specifically.  And that worked well for quite a while and just recently we have now transitioned that.  The attorney general here in New York, which is where the organization was actually set-up, has okayed the foundation transitioned into the endowment.  So all monies that were left over from that has now gone to the AIDS endowment, which I still stay on the board of.  I was the chairman of the foundation.  So as a result of dissolving the foundation and setting it up with the AIDS endowment now, or combining it I should say, I thought, okay, I want to get back in my dark room.  There were a lot of things that I knew were on my plate.  My daughter's [Camera Ashe] graduated from high school now, starting college, and I'm having a little bit more time to really now get into my work, full-fledged.  So I thought, how can Arthur's legacy be known other than bricks and mortar, other than someone else going around and talking about him?  How can we bring him alive?  And how could I do it in a way that would free me up and yet still work with the legacy?  So I came up with the idea of ArthurAshe.org, which is a website that was intended to bring Arthur Ashe alive.  And on February 6, the fourteenth anniversary of Arthur's death, 2007, with the help of Merrill Lynch [Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc.; Merrill Lynch Wealth Management] and a team of experts at Merrill Lynch and a team of friends, a creative director, a marketing person and a creative team called ERA404 [ERA404 Creative Group, Inc.], we put together an introduction for this website.  And when I ran out of money to do it I took it to Merrill Lynch and I said, "Can you help us with this?"  They absolutely loved the concept and it was through Merrill Lynch that we were able to--it was two weeks, two weeks to this deadline of February 6, and Merrill Lynch said, "Let's do it."  And I was on top of it and went to Merrill Lynch everyday and sat down with their team of, of web people and February 6 we got those six videos up and the website is now live.  Go to it: www.ArthurAshe.org.  And it is wonderful and we are constantly updating it.  We just recently put some new press about, about Arthur and about the website on the website.  Articles have been written since then.  We add new information and one of the wonderful things about this website is that people can write in and give a testimonial about what they thought about Arthur.  And what's been happening is that people who had--whether a five minute conversation with Arthur, that maybe stood at a rental car agency counter renting a car at the same time with him, recognized him and had a conversation or knew him when he was a little kid, these people are writing in and telling wonderful stories about their engagement with Arthur and what they thought about him.  So we've now set-up a testimonial page, and you can go to the website and click on testimonials.  We don't use full names of people.  We just identify people by their first names with what they're saying about Arthur.  And it's just great.  It's almost like a blog, you know which I'm still trying to learn the concept of a blog.

Speaker 1: The next thing that I want to do--I've just actually got back--returned from South Africa.  And just briefly in 1976 Arthur [Arthur Ashe], on his trips to South Africa, and I think everybody knows how involved he was in the apartheid movement and how important that was to his legacy, that he really did indeed affect change in that country, that in '76 [1976] he built tennis courts in Soweto [South Africa] just as this small glimmer of light in this horrible apartheid system to give something to the community.  So he built these courts, which unfortunately were torched during the Soweto riots.  And the community, the South African Tennis Association [Tennis South African Association] and a wonderful gentleman who grew up in Soweto knew that Arthur had built these--built these courts, did not play tennis but believed in the work that Arthur had done in the community, put forth an effort to rebuild the tennis courts.  And on March 31, just a couple of weeks ago, I was in South Africa rededicating the new Arthur Ashe Tennis Center [Arthur Ashe Tennis Center and Library, Soweto, South Africa], which is a phenomenal facility.  And the best thing about this facility is not so much that the community has completely committed to this, and Wire Zondi [Bongani "Wire" Zondi], the councilor who really made this happen, but it wasn't Arthur's idea and it wasn't my idea, it was their idea.  They built adjacent to the tennis center a library, unprecedented in Soweto.  This shows you how this community has changed.  So it's now the Arthur Ashe Tennis Center including this library and it's just a great thank you to Arthur for what he did to affect change in the country. So--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --finish that up if you don't mind.  So, so one of the things that I want to do with the pictures that I shot while in South Africa, I even did an interview with Wire Zondi asking him the meaning of seeing this completion and what Arthur Ashe meant to him.  So I'm busy now putting together this film and putting together the photographs to display them on the website.  And we're going do a whole South African tennis stadium as one of the events.  There's an events component to the website.  So we're going to keep updating this and keep doing this so it will--it will thrive, it will live and this will--hopefully younger people will get engaged in the website because I'd like to hopefully partner with 'Sesame Street' and do some work in creating Arthur as an animated figure, teaching kids how to count, how to toss a tennis ball.  I mean there's so many things that you can do by simulating his voice and animating his, his image, his, his body that we're going to engage kids and let them know that this guy really was a human being (laughter).  Because kids relate entirely to the internet now so let's get them some really good substantive material and let the legacy live on with that.

Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your photography work, now have you been--I know we discussed your use of the Leica you know, your affinity for that--
Speaker 2: Oh, the Leica is my without which and even though I, like in the South Africa trip, I photographed mostly with digital for the website [www.ArthurAshe.org] but that Leica was strapped right on my shoulder and I was shooting left, right and center (laughter).  And all that film is awaiting me in the darkroom.
Speaker 1: So do you think you'll ever be tempted to go digital completely?
Speaker 2: I think that you should be censored for saying that (laughter).  There's no way.  I see--thank you (laughter), he's covering his mouth and he should after saying that.  There's definitely the advantage of digital and I think with this website I can see shooting things specifically for it.  The only way to go with that is digital.  But in, in doing the books that I'm doing now, even though I photograph in black and white and still develop my own negatives and still print my own prints, prints in the darkroom, I mean there's nothing to replace that moment when you look at a roll of film and you hold it up to the light, and it's dripping wet with fixer (laughter), you're looking at wow, it's magic.  And then you dry the film and you put it in that little film holder that goes into the--my Leica II enlarger (laughter), I'm Leica all the way, and you see that print developed.  It's magic.  In fact for me it's spiritual.  And I don't have that kind of feeling with the digital camera experience but I do have it with the Leica and I have it in the darkroom.  The darkroom is my place of refuge.  I actually did a, a lecture and delivered it at the Union Theological Seminary [sic. Union Presbyterian Seminary] in Richmond, Virginia, called Photography and Faith (laughter).  And it really does address how we have to go into darkness to see the light.  Which really kinds of--is kind of a lesson that I've learned with the lessons that, that I've had in my fifty-five years of, of life, coming up on fifty-six this year.  And it happens in the darkroom and it happens in the real world and there's a metaphor there and it's spiritual.  Depending on how you look at it, it can be very spiritual.  I wouldn't give up black and white darkroom work for anything.
Story_ID: 375242
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done to this point, you're only fifty-six though, but is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Nope, nope.  Because everything I did, whether it was what one would consider a mistake or what one would consider, you shouldn't have done that, there was always the other side of the coin.  And somehow, whatever I have done in my life, there's always been a lesson and if you miss the lesson, that's what you should regret.  And I think that I've worked to not miss the lesson.  Took me a while to learn it, but compassion for myself showed me that.  That's why I wish that for my community.

Speaker 1: Do you have any future artistic or personal goals that are right on the horizon that you--?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have a new book project, which I'm sh- shopping around right now along with the 'Daufuskie Island' [Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe] republication.  It's called, it's based on a vesper written by a minister who taught theology for thirty-eight years--a theologian who taught theology at the Chicago Theological Seminary [Chicago, Illinois] for thirty-eight years.  I read this vesper about maybe three and a half or four years ago.  It's called 'Goodbye Comes Before Hello' [ph.].  And I was so moved by this vesper that I put together a book, with his permission, of photographs with the vesper.  And I'm now trying to get that published.  And it's, it's really a post 9/11 [September 11, 2001] kind of project because it deals with how we have to move on.  That's the, the biggest thing on the horizon, but I have, in terms of my personal work, this--I'm, as I mentioned earlier I am meeting with a gentleman who helps one to consolidate their ideas with projects, particularly as an artist.  And I'm really looking forward to this meeting.  We've had several meetings on the phone, but we're getting together to actually look at the work because I have other, more work that I'd like to see shown.  One particular body of work, there are twelve images, all black and white, done in my darkroom, that I, I'd like to have shown as an exhibition.  It's a very intensely personal body of work.  So he--once I talk to him hopefully we will be seeing that in the not too distant future.  Shown, yes, maybe even as a book project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You think you'll ever go back and do the one hundred centenarian book?  I mean the--
Speaker 2: Yes, when I'm a hundred (laughter).
Speaker 1: It'll be--it's the new seventy then (unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  You know my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Wallace Hunt Foster] lived to be 105.  I said that very early on and I've got the genes for it so go for it you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 375244
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too, what at this point do you think your legacy is?  Or I mean, at this point what do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a tough question to answer because in terms of what I do, you're only as good as the next picture that you take (laughter). So my legacy?  I'm still working on it, Larry [Larry Crowe].  You know that's what somebody else is going to have to decide when I'm not here anymore and I hope that I will have left a good one.
Story_ID: 375245
Speaker 1: You discussed your daughter, now she's in--she's in college now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She's a sophomore in college and she's moving right along.  She's doing well.  She's just changed her major to art history, which I'm thrilled about.  So she's, she's doing well. Camera's [Camera Ashe] really a wonderful young lady and she's twenty years old, she will be twenty-one come December, so maybe we should talk next year after she's turned twenty-one (laughter).  But she's doing very well and hopefully she will continue towards an advance degree when she finishes and you know because that's--her life is her life and it's very personal for her maybe one day she will do an interview and talk about her own life but as a mom, all I can tell you is that I think she's great.
Story_ID: 375246
Speaker 1: I just want to recognize the fact that your aunt, who started this interview with us in January, recently passed away.
Speaker 2: On February 28 [February 28, 2007] she did so I really thank HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] and you, Larry [Larry Crowe], for the opportunity to be able to catch her on film.  The family is so thrilled.  When Aunt Bernie [Bernadette Moutoussamy Harris] died everybody was just so grateful that we had gotten her on film.  We wished that we had done it earlier when she was in much better form.  She was pretty ill, but she was not shy, as you could tell, and as ill as she was, she sat down in front of your camera and attempted to answer as many questions as possible.  So we were proud of her for doing that and thank you.
Story_ID: 375247
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to the legacy, a little different, and I know we have another fifty years to go but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, how would I like to be remembered?  Hopefully as a good person, a good person that cared and that's from every aspect of my life from how I see, my vision, who I choose to point my camera at and why, my life with my husband [Arthur Ashe], my life as a mother and my friends.  Because without friends and family, you know that's really what--what your legacy is, friends and family.  So I've been really, really blessed and I'm really grateful for that and I hope that people will know, yes, I've been very blessed but I've been so grateful for all of my blessings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Larry [Larry Crowe].  It was a pleasure.
