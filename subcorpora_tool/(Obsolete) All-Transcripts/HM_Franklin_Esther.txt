Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: I'll be waiting for you. That's what I tell my husband [Ronald Franklin] all the time 'cause I'm always late and I always try and flip it that I'm waiting for him he's not, he's not waiting for me. He finds that hilarious (laughter).
Story_ID: 659803
Speaker 1: So I'd like to go back in time and, and let's go to your parents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Would you tell me your mother's name, when and where she was born and tell me about her?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dolores Antonia Dabon [Dolores Dabon Johnson] is her maiden name and Johnson is her married name.  My mother was born in New Orleans, Louisiana.  She has a birthday in January; she will be eighty-five years old.  My mother is a very accomplished woman.  She was always interested in learning and challenges and she was the first black secretary on Canal Street in New Orleans.  My mother's mother [Ethel Cager Dabon] passed when my mother was young and so she was raised by her aunts [Inez Cager, Evelyn Cager and Ruth Cager Dozier] and she has one brother [David Dabon].  She met my father [Leon Johnson] in New Orleans and they came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So Dabom [sic.] you said how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-A-B-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what's the origin of that name?
Speaker 2: Henry Dabon was a Frenchman so that is a French name.  I don't exactly know the circumstances or why he came or how he ended up in New Orleans but New Orleans was populated by a lot of people of French descent.  So he came here and married Victoria Etienne [ph.]. I believe that's how it goes--and Victoria Etienne was Indian. And so that is the lineage of my mother's family.
Speaker 1: So your mother's father was French--
Speaker 2: Her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, her grandfather was French and her grandmother was Native American (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Native American correct.
Speaker 1: And so where does African American come in?
Speaker 2: That was on her father's side [sic.]--let's see yes on her father's side are the Cagers and so the Cagers were African American and Native American.  We're just getting all this history now and she gave me this wonderful book just last week and it has all of this historical information when people were born and where they came from.  So we're starting to go through that now and really understand that side of the family. We have been more focused on doing a family tree on my father's side of the family so it's really exciting now to have that side to add as well.
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up did you know that you had such diversity in your family?
Speaker 2: We knew. 'Cause in--New Orleans it is its own special place and people there, especially before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], when it was how it had always been is probably one of the most prolific melting pots in America when you think of a city.  So people came from, you know, France they came from Scotland, they were Native American and it was just this really wonderful hodgepodge and I guess that's where gumbo you know the whole idea of that came from.  So we were aware but it didn't--the awareness that we had was not the awareness that people have today it was just how it was.
Speaker 1: Well then do you, do you know if your family at any point, this would be predating you of course, participated in--there was a social hierarchy based on color.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: So there were the quadroon and octoroons and the whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --within the color line there were different strata.  Was your family involved in any of that social experience?
Speaker 2: They were--it was all around them but they didn't practice it if you will.  Within our immediate family we had people that were very, very light and had light blue eyes and green and hazel and I was always envious when I was young that I didn't get green or gray eyes.  But then we also had at the same time people who were very, very dark and had coarse hair.  Some of them had long straight hair and so within our immediate family we had this range and so there wasn't because you're light with straight hair you're better or, or that kind of thing practiced within the family.  Obviously in society that played a factor. And I mentioned that my mother was the first African American secretary on Canal Street.  My mother is lighter skinned, she has brown eyes but I'm sure because of the way she looked and her coloring that was one of the reasons that she was able to be employed at that time in that type of position.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So your recollection is that you--your family had the rainbow--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but not the judgment that often went along with it.
Speaker 2: Correct. Correct.
Story_ID: 659804
Speaker 1: Did any of your relatives talk about race and color as you recall?
Speaker 2: I don't recall it. I mean I--there are very few snippets. As I mentioned both my mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] and my father [Leon Johnson] were the only people in their families that left New Orleans [Louisiana] and came up north. And so there, you know, all of our family was there and I do remember a couple of incidences when we were travelling--we would travel by car.  The memories I have were from the period of time in the '70s [1970s] my father was a minister at Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio] so we would be driving from Ohio down to New Orleans and we were very young.  One incident we were driving and it was night, and we were somewhere in the South and we were pulled over by a policeman for some minor reason; I don't know the rear taillight was out, or something like that.  So they pull us over, my mother couldn't drive, she has three children age seven and younger and they took my father wherever into the town and left us in the car on the highway in the night, just left us.  So as a child, I didn't really understand the significance of it, I remember that happening but later my mother was telling me how scared she was because she didn't know where they had taken him, she didn't know if he was coming back, she didn't know how to drive a car, she's got three kids and we're just there.
Speaker 1: And were you the eldest?
Speaker 2: I was--I'm the oldest yeah.  So I remember that very vividly. I also remember on another occasion driving down south that we pulled over, this was in the daytime so I tell my dad--and I was always a daddy's girl--that I had to go to the bathroom so he says, "Okay."  So we go to this gas station and he says, "Okay you can go to the bathroom."  So I started going to where it said here's restroom, and again I was a young girl, and he said, "No you have to go to this one over here." And I said, "Why?" Because my parents never wanted us to really be exposed to that kind of thing and they didn't talk about it a lot.  But that was the first time in my consciousness that I realized that it was a bathroom for colored people and bathroom for white people.
Speaker 1: And at--what age were you and where were you?
Speaker 2: Again I was young so somewhere between seven and nine.  I don't know what town I just know that we were driving south to go, you know, see our relatives in New Orleans and that situation occurred.
Speaker 1: And when were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in 1957.
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: It was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So there were many instances where we were in New Orleans with our cousins and we weren't allowed to go to the theater because you had to in those days still in some theaters, the blacks still had to go sit in the balcony and my parents would not allow us to do that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 659805
Speaker 1: Back to your mother's family, you can trace to European and to Native American. Can you trace to slavery?
Speaker 2: No I can't and I keep saying that I'm going to do the, you know, Ancestry.com [Ancestry.com Inc.] and get one of those kits and do the swab test but we have not done that yet, so.
Speaker 1: So you don't know it in your lineage?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Will you tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: My father is one of nine children and my father--my family is a very religious family.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: My father is Leon Johnson, he does not have a middle name, and he was born in October nineteen twenty--'28 [1928].  My father just passed in October 3rd of this year so that was a significant loss for our family, but at the same time our father lived a beautiful life and he always believed that he was in service of, of the Lord.  And he--so every day that he woke up he was grateful to be able to serve the Lord but we know that he is ecstatic about being in the presence of the Lord.  So we're--I'm not sad, I miss him but I'm not sad.  But my father was definitely a family man, my father was a minister, his father was a minister, his sisters, his two sisters are ministers, my brother [Leonidas Johnson] is a minister, my mother's grandfather was a minister.  So you can tell we have a lot of like spirituality in my family and I often wonder, how did I get in this family 'cause that's not, you know, the path that I took.  But my father joined the [U.S.] Air Force when he was a young man and did not graduate high school so he received his GED [General Educational Development] while he was in the Air Force.  He was in the Air Force during the Korean War and that's when he got the calling to become a minister and he was in Japan and when he came home he helped his father start a church in New Orleans [Louisiana] and that was Gloryland Baptist Church [Gloryland Mount Gillion Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana].  My parents left New Orleans--
Speaker 1: When did they meet or do you know how did they meet?
Speaker 2: They met at church (laughter).  My mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] was telling me, so her aunt belonged to my family's church and she--my mother went to, I don't know maybe they had some event at the church and that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Do you know how old they were when they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know how old they were if I did the math I could probably figure it out but I'm not that great at math (laughter) I need a calculator.
Speaker 1: So you said he's one of nine children what birth order is he?
Speaker 2: I believe he is the--he's kind of in the middle 'cause I was--for a long time I thought he was the baby but he was not the baby that got clarified but he's not toward the, he's not toward the oldest so he's in the middle going to the bottom somewhere in there, so.
Speaker 1: And his--you began telling me his family background is, is what? How far can you trace them?
Speaker 2: His okay on his side his parents were born in Sunshine, Louisiana [Sunshine, St. Gabriel, Louisiana] and we can go back one generation from that. So that would be--my grandfather, my great-grandfather--my great-great-grandfather's. And they were also religious people.  I don't know as much about them in the past as I know about my mom's people 'cause I was just reading that book.  So his parents--my father's parents were born in Sunshine, Louisiana. Herbert and Rachel--Herbert Johnson and Rachel Bryant [Rachel Bryant Johnson] and they came to New Orleans.  In New Orleans they established Gloryland Baptist Church.  My aunt Lois is an internationally known gospel artist and her children have performed with many of today's leading gospel artists, so--
Speaker 1: What's her full name?
Speaker 2: Lois Dejean I didn't get--I don't have the gift of preaching, I don't have the gift of singing (laughter) but I have the pleasure of being a part of the family and I can enjoy it all. So that's my contribution.
Story_ID: 659806
Speaker 1: So your parents met in church [Gloryland Mount Gillion Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: They met in church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they're the only ones you said who left New Orleans [Louisiana]. Why did they leave?
Speaker 2: They left because they both came from large extended families and they just felt that large families kept a lot of stuff going on and they wanted to be able to chart their own path and kind of live their own life without being in the middle of all of the cluster and bluster that comes with being you know, in a city where everybody lives close together and everybody has an opinion on what's going on.  So both my parents were very much interested in education so my father [Leon Johnson] came up here to go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] after getting his GED [General Educational Development] in the [U.S.] Air Force.  He attended Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] so he received an undergraduate from Dillard.  My mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] received hers from Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  They came up here, my father went to the University of Chicago and he was in the theological seminary [Chicago Theological Seminary, Chicago, Illinois] there as well as got a few degrees in other areas like psychology that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: A few degrees?
Speaker 2: He has several degrees yes.
Speaker 1: And, and in his family was he the first to be degreed?
Speaker 2: He was. Yeah my aunt was telling me that last week, he was the first one to go to college.  As a matter of fact, she my aunt Lois [Lois Dejean] just turned seventy-nine and she received two weeks ago her Ph.D. or her master's [degree]? One of the two. And she was telling me that her brother inspired her to go because she didn't have that opportunity when she was young and he told her it was never too late and she's been going to school ever since, so.
Speaker 1: And your mom what was her work?
Speaker 2: My mother was a schoolteacher also.  My mother taught elementary school, she always taught grades one through three somewhere in that range and my father though he is a minister and practiced ministry all of his life was also an educator and his most recent position in Chicago [Illinois] was teaching alternative high school kids that had been kicked out of school on the West Side of Chicago.  So my father always felt compelled to help those that were disadvantaged and he always wanted to be in an environment where it was clear there was a need.  So if it was a church that was well organized and had a lot of people that were active and involved he felt that they were taken care of they didn't need the help but he would go where there was not that kind of situation.
Story_ID: 659807
Speaker 1: So now, you were born in Chicago [Illinois] correct?
Speaker 2: I was born in Chicago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and what is your birth date?
Speaker 2: My birth date is July 21, 1957.
Speaker 1: Can you take me to when you were born and what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Okay. I have--it's interesting to me because I've always been a pet lover but never a cat lover.  I remember living on a- in an apartment at that time when I was young so under seven [years old] for sure.  We lived on the second floor of one of Chicago's typical brownstone walkups and it was a long apartment and my bedroom was at one end.  So I'm in that bedroom and it's maybe like dusk 'cause it's not quite dark but I'm laying down and all of a sudden I see this really dark, dark gray cat appear out of the corner and I was terrified of this cat but at the same time I was mesmerized by this cat and the cat I call him Shush Shush [ph.] and I'm like, "Here Shush Shush come here Shush Shush."  At the same time that I'm terrified of this thing I'm telling it to come to me and I don't know where that--I don't know what that was about but I never forgot that, so.
Speaker 1: And it was at night?
Speaker 2: It was dusk like that kind of twilighty so it's not quite dark but not light. So that was Shush Shush.
Story_ID: 659808
Speaker 1: Where did you grow up? What--in what neighborhood?  Can you--do--what are the sights, sounds and smells you remember from your childhood, your early home in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well I have two so we were in Chicago [Illinois], we lived in Hyde Park and I went to, I went to Ray Elementary School [William H. Ray Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]. So I remember that we would walk. You know, there would be a big bunch of kids that would walk down the--from our apartment to the school and there are a couple of memories I have of that.  One, in those days, girls always wore dresses, right? So I remember--'cause I loved--I had a slip. It was those petticoat slips, but it was three colors like one layer was blue and one was yellow and one was green. I just loved that slip so I would wear it all of the time.  And my father [Leon Johnson]--I was always sort of a timid kid, so my father had told me not to carry this girl's books 'cause this girl would every day have me carry her books but she was kind of--she was in charge so she told me to carry her books and I was carrying her books.  And one day he was walking toward us and I saw him and I was carrying her books and I knew I was in trouble and so he came up to me and he put me over his knee, pulled up my dress and spanked me right in front of all those kids and I remember because I had on that really pretty slip (laughter) with all those colors on it.  I was like how could he do this but I never carried her books again so I remember that.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was under seven [years old] 'cause we moved, we moved from Hyde Park to Ohio when I was turning seven so this was, you know. And I was going to school so it had to be between five and six then, so I remember that.  And I also remember at Ray School that I didn't, I never talked. I was very, very--I didn't really start talking until I went to college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  So I was a very quiet kid. And there was another girl in my class that was quieter and maybe we shared that in common and her--she was a white girl and her parents always wanted me around because we could relate to one another and she wouldn't relate to anyone else.  I remember her parents were taking--they were going on a summer trip to Europe and they wanted take me with them. And because of the times my family did not allow me to do that. They just felt it was too risky, but I do remember them offering that.  And I remember, I can see her, she was blonde she had these two pi- pigtails but I don't remember her name.
Story_ID: 659809
Speaker 1: Do you have any recollection or observation of why you were so quiet?
Speaker 2: When I think back on it now I don't know why.  I think just my personality even if I think about my personality I'm not one to just go in a room naturally and start introducing myself.  I've learned to do that in my profession so I do it, it seems more natural now but I would prefer to sit back and observe. But when I think about my upbringing and my family and I told you we would always go down to New Orleans [Louisiana] and we'd always stay with my father's [Leon Johnson] family and they had nine children but they were loud. I mean--and they are all ministers.  My aunts are loud and they all had a lot going on.  If you go into the room and everything goes up five decibels and I would try and engage but I couldn't because they were just--so I just sat and watched all of this and I think because I just spent so many years doing that that suited my personality and my nature.  It was extremely entertaining and I always knew what was going on, I was always in the middle 'cause I wanted to know what was going on so that just was how--I don't know that's how I was.
Speaker 1: So you weren't intimidated?
Speaker 2: I was not intimidated, no, but I didn't feel I could--I didn't feel that I could part the sea (laughter) to get a word in and so it was just fun to be a part and watch.
Speaker 1: But then in school they'd like for you to speak up.  Did it ever work to your disadvantage that you were quiet?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I was always smart, I read like a fish.  I loved books, I loved school, I always did well in school, I wrote well so I never had a problem even though they would say, you know, "She should speak up more," but, but it was never, it was never a problem for me.
Story_ID: 659810
Speaker 1: Let's go to your growing up. You have how many siblings?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: And what are their names?
Speaker 2: Leandas--Leonidas Christian Johnson and--no Leonidas Alexander Johnson [Leonidas Johnson] and Worthington Christian Johnson [Worthington Johnson]. And we're all two years apart.
Speaker 1: So what--tell me who comes when.
Speaker 2: So first me then Leonidas then Worthington; he's the baby.
Speaker 1: These names where--tel- what's the origin of the names?
Speaker 2: My name is from the bible Queen Esther and then also Rebecca both biblical names.  Leonidas was my grandfather's middle name and Alexander comes from the Bible and then Worthington my parents [Dolores Dabon Johnson and Leon Johnson] said that they were, they were in a car and they heard a store called Worthington [ph.], I think it was, and so that's where his name came from but then Christian was another name from the Bible.
Story_ID: 659811
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up with your brothers [Leonidas Johnson and Worthington Johnson] being the only girl with two brothers, the eldest?
Speaker 2: It was fun but at the same time it was--I think I was always--I always had to be in charge and so I was always the one who--you know, I'm supposed to make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to do.  I'm the one who if we weren't doing what we should have been doing I should have known better.  They would gang up on me because they were boys and they would say that they didn't have to listen to me or do what I said so we had our typical sibling rivalry in that way but at the same time we had a lot of fun together.  So I was born in Hyde Park in Chicago [Illinois] but then my father [Leon Johnson] had an opportunity to become campus minister at Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio. So we moved there when I was seven, so (mumbles) '64 [1964] when we moved there and part of the reason that my parents chose to make that move was because that was during the time so much civil unrest and we were living on the South Side of Chicago, there was just a lot going on.
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what was going on in Chicago (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know. I was completely oblivious.
Speaker 1: Well what did they tell you?
Speaker 2: Well that civil rights, black power there was a lot of fighting for equality, a lot of restlessness in the streets and they just felt that it was only going to get worse before it got better. And so my father was always a practicing minister.  He was a very learned man, received a fellowship to go to Central State University and they thought that would be a good thing because it was in southwest--it's in southwest? Yeah--southwest Ohio this small rural town and they figured that it would be a nice environment to raise a family in.
Speaker 1: Before you go there I want to go to Hyde Park.  So what was the racial composition of Hyde Park when you were living there?
Speaker 2: I think it was primarily white at that time.  There were definitely blacks there but it was primarily a white environment at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the kids in your neighborhood?  Did you play with the white kids in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. We did. We played with the kids.  We had it both black and white but all played together.  Ray School [William H. Ray Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was I think it was part of the public school system [Chicago Public Schools], but because it was associated with the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you had a lot of university kids going--kids of people associated with the university going there.  So it was a very diverse school.  So I had no concept of racism or any negative connotations associated with it, I'll put it that way.  But at the same time I say that, I have another vivid memory of sitting with my mom [Dolores Dabon Johnson] and dad and my brothers in our apartment in Hyde Park and asking my dad very earnestly why he made me and him black and my mother and my brothers white and why did that happen 'cause I just didn't understand why I couldn't be like them 'cause they are lighter than me.  But now I look and we're all kind of the same color so maybe it was my imagination, I don't know.  But I remember asking that question and he said, "No we're all the same." You know, so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember them being treated differently?
Speaker 2: No. I don't know (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was just visual--
Speaker 2: It was just visual.
Speaker 1: --at that point.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 659812
Speaker 1: So now you, you move to Ohio to this small town in Ohio [Wilberforce, Ohio].  Your father [Leon Johnson] thinks he's protecting the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what was your experience there?
Speaker 2: That was fabulous because we came from urban Hyde Park in Chicago, Illinois and we go to this place.  Our house was on five acres of land, we had an apple orchard in the back, we lived on U.S. rural route 42 [U.S. Route 42].  The house across the street from us had slave--what do you call it? Like a shack where sla- that slaves lived in at one time, we just thought it was a little house.  I would walk down--we lived on U.S. rural route 42 and then there was this road 'cause we were on the corner. I don't remember the name of the road but I remember I would walk to my friend's house, I would walk down this road and we had five acres so we had to walk past the five acres and around the bend and they lived on a farm like a real farm--working farm and I would walk to their house.  So we'd play with those kids and then the house immediately behind us she didn't have--her children were older so her grandkids would come and we would play hide and seek in the cornfields and that was just like the thing to do and didn't think anything of it.  I think about running through a cornfield now it's got to be itchy and all kinds of gnats and things like that but we were oblivious to all that but that's what we did.  So, so we had that part of the experience, we had this one--there was--our yard was full of oak trees, old oak trees. And so because we're in this rural area and there weren't a lot of kids around I would spend a lot of time in this one tree.  I would climb up the tree--in the bowel of the tree with a book and my dog--I had this little dog and I would be there for hours just reading or counting you know, the cars as they went down the rural route.  So I have very vivid memories of that.  There was a young girl that lived maybe three or four houses down, Laurie [ph.] and her mother was a Girl Scout leader so I joined Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] with her and we did a lot of things together, we had fun together.  I was always very creative and interested in culture and other people.  People in places that I had never been, I always had that interest and fascination.  So I would sew. And being in the Girl Scouts and the 4-H in the rural areas they have fairs so I would always enter into the fairs my sewing of this or that.  I would always have, you know, tons of blue ribbons from winning those kinds of--participating in those kinds of things so I have those memories.
Story_ID: 659813
Speaker 1: I absolutely just loved that experience 'cause it was a black college campus [HBCU]. That didn't mean anything to me other than my- that's where my father worked but in those days sororities and fraternities were huge.  And so because we were part of campus life, we would see the pledges as they would line up and do their thing and I just loved watching all of that.  My father would always have people, my parents [Dolores Dabon Johnson and Leon Johnson] would always have students come to our home on Sunday for dinner 'cause students always liked home cooked meals.  I just remember the conversations. Both my parents are very progressive so it was dynamic times.  So to have these students or teachers or visiting guests that were visiting the university in our home on Sundays and just listening--again I didn't participate 'cause I was always a listener.  But listening to these conversations and being a part of what was going on and going to see different speakers whether that was Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] or you know, a lot of the leaders in the civil rights movement would come to historically black campuses including Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and would be delivering messages and we were a part of all of that.  The Harlem Globetrotters, we--they would come and do their performance and we were a part of that.  We would hitchhike into town; the closest town was Xenia [Ohio] so we would hitchhike with our dad to town.  These are things that you can't even--even if you lived in a rural environment now you couldn't do these kinds of things.  So those are the kinds of memories I have about being in Ohio and living in that environment and it was, it was great at the time.
Speaker 2: You said that there was a family on a farm, your neighbors, because you were at Central State, this is a black school, were there black people or was it also mixed?
Speaker 1: So there it was black. It was--Central University and Wilberforce University were in Wilberforce, Ohio. And that basically was Wilberforce, Ohio, the two towns--the two colleges.  So I grew up in a black experience but again not really cognizant of that that was atypical, typical, or just was the experience I had.  Because it was a university environment people were--I don't remember any kind of unemployment or homelessness or the poor side of town, I don't remember that.  If anything I would say in hindsight the two girls that lived on the farm they worked the farm and then they would come to school and when they got out of school they'd go back to working on the farm.  Well when I think about it now you know, they probably didn't have a lot of money but I didn't know that then. They just, that's what they did.  I remember the first time they got their hair pressed, they had--it was long to here (gesture) but they always had braids and stuff so who knew that.  There are so many memories of being in Wilberforce, Ohio that were--that I'll cherish for the rest of my life.  I remember the post office, the store and--it was a post office and a store and the candy store. It was all one thing.  It was just one little house and that was the post office and the grocery store. So things like that.
Story_ID: 659814
Speaker 1: Now how did being in that environment shape your cultural identity?
Speaker 2: I never thought about it that way but what I would say is that it just made me very aware of the customs, of the sentiment, of the intellect, of the creativity, of the idea that you can do things however you want to do them that became the norm.  So I'll give you an example. My father [Leon Johnson] was a college minister, my father was also the best pool player on the campus [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  So we had many trophies in our home of him winning pool tournaments but at the same time he's a minister.  So his thought was if I'm going to be ministering to people that are on a college university I have to be able to relate and enjoy life and that's okay.  And so when I mix things together, when I think about I definitely have a creative side but at the same time an interest in people and I'm very analytical.  I--because I had an experience where whatever you wanted to do was okay and it was in a black setting, I never felt the limitations of you have to be in this box or if you're African American you maybe don't have access to X, Y and Z.  I always felt that if I wanted to do something, it was--the door was open to me and the limitation would be myself, not something else.  I think in other ways when I talk or when I think about the sorority and fraternity experience and all of the creativity that went into that kind of thing.  The display of pride, the display of, of, of--what do you call it--parademanship and you know, all of those kinds of things I saw that as an everyday occurrence, it wasn't special it was what happens.  So the fact that you can be in a group of people and all be dressed the same but then all bring your unique style to it, that was just a part of how we lived our life.
Story_ID: 659815
Speaker 1: I also remember very vividly, and I think this had a big impression too, I told you about my friend Laurie [ph.] and we were in Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] together. Well Laurie was light skinned and she had long straight hair and I was darker skin and I had, you know, the typical little, I don't know, pony tails or something. And so we were selling our Girl Scout cookies in the dormitory and I remember one dark skinned college student saying--'cause they were all flocking to Laurie to buy her cookies and she said, "I'm buying my cookies from her," me, "because she's brown skinned and I want you to know," and she said to me, "you are just as beautiful as your friend and I never want you to forget that," and so I remember that.
Speaker 2: Did you have any awareness that--
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: Well your friend was the one people were buying the cookies from, how did you feel that they weren't buying the cookies from you?
Speaker 1: I have the same personality as my father [Leon Johnson].  I knew it was happening but it was--it didn't bother me.  It just was how it was.  I have a very even personality. I--not a lot ruffles me and I don't get, I don't get disappointed by a lot of things.  I'm very emotional and I have deep feelings and sensitivities but at the end of the day, I don't know, I'm just more--I've always been an observer not necessarily in judgment either way.
Speaker 2: How did you feel when, when that young lady said that to you?
Speaker 1: I was like oh okay yay (laughter) more cookies for me.  The thing was I guess some of these experiences were mitigated by the circumstances. Because we were the only two Girl Scouts on the college campus [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  We always sold a lot of cookies regardless. But that statement was a powerful statement and that statement--her statement brought me to a level of consciousness that I didn't think about before and she said it and I appreciated it and then we went back to how things were.
Speaker 2: At what age were you?
Speaker 1: Okay, so I lived in Ohio from age seven to fourteen so--
Speaker 2: Okay so formative years.
Story_ID: 659816
Speaker 1: College, your, your father [Leon Johnson] was the college minister.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: College is typically the time when students question their faith.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned your father playing pool figuring out a way to access them, but as an observer for you what did you see?  Because you're in the space of your father being the minister, he's holding the spiritual foundation. Very, very typically college students are leaving spirituality on the sidewalk and exploring everything else.  For you as an observer what was before your eyes?
Speaker 2: During those days?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, what did you see?
Speaker 2: What I was seeing was a lot of college students that--because that was the heart of civil rights and so the conversations were more around what was going on in terms of discrimination, lack of access, how are we going to address the situation.  A lot of college students were angry about what they were seeing.  'Cause what was the incident that happened at--was it Antioch? It was where the students were shot on the college campus in Ohio [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], I can't remember.  So there were a lot of conversations about how should we act or just students expressing their anger or frustration about the times.  And so my father always--he just always had a powerful but intellectual way with words.  For example, one of the titles of his sermons was: it's not about aptitude it's about attitude.  So you could be as smart as you want to be, you can be as learned and have all those degrees but if you have the wrong attitude you're not going to get as far as you could and conversely someone who has the best attitude and not all of those accolades can get farther.  So he would have a way of talking with the students in that manner that was both intellectual but sharply pointed on what the issues were.  And so that's why they flocked to him 'cause they loved being able to be in that kind of debate and discussion.  So I remember those kinds of things.  I remember H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and just being exposed to all of these people (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He came to the campus [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes all of these people who had such a pride of our culture and were extremely articulate about why we should think in certain ways or why we should behave or why we should not be accepting of less than.  But again it was all part of just normal every day, it wasn't portrayed as this is special or this is something to pay attention to, 'cause we were kids.  So we would be in these environments and wouldn't be like we would be sitting there just in rapture about what was being said.  We would be in those environments at the same time that we would be talking or running around the arena. But if you're so exposed all that stuff just seeps in and you get it in different ways.
Story_ID: 659817
Speaker 1: Were you in Ohio when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--
Speaker 2: I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the day of his assassination?
Speaker 2: I remember his as well as JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy]. And I remember being in the house and just--my father [Leon Johnson] was on the campus [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]; we did not go on the campus.  We were in the house with my mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] for both incidents and there was just a silence.  We were watching television and it was silence that's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Silence is powerful.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: As an observer sitting in that silence what do you remember?
Speaker 2: I just remember how sad--everybody was so sad and watching the people's reaction.  You know, it was--I've been involved in--I've been a part of so many historically tragic moments, so that was probably the first that I remember. And I was watching how people were responding and just watching how grief strucken how, how--what sense of profound loss and such disbelief that this happened.  That's what I remember, I remember that more than the aftermath because the aftermath was when all hell broke loose. But that's what I remember.
Speaker 1: In being on the campus around all of these incredible minds who were coming to speak about their beliefs and what was needed as you described and then this happens, how, how did your father react?  What happened on campus?
Speaker 2: I don't really remember--
Speaker 1: How old were you--
Speaker 2: Again somewhere--
Speaker 1: --in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968], so '57 [1957]. I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was eleven years old.  I don't remember there being a lot of disruption on the campus.  I don't remember rioting or I don't remember protests, I don't remember--I'm not saying that it didn't happen but I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: And when Kennedy was assassinated?
Speaker 2: It was the same. It was the same type of thing, just the quiet observation and when I--I talked about my father's family being loud and boisterous. My immediate family I don't think I've ever seen either of my parents have any kind of emotional outburst about anything. They were very measured, not removed, but just--my parents are extremely, extremely pragmatic.  And that happened and we were sad and then what did you get from it, okay go on out there and keep doing something.
Story_ID: 659818
Speaker 1: --Want to talk about your spiritua- your spiritual life as a child.  So you're, you're growing up in the church.
Speaker 2: I grew up in the church.
Speaker 1: What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist. Now so traditional Baptist 'cause you say your father [Leon Johnson] didn't have any outbursts--
Speaker 2: Traditional. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But he was a quiet traditionalist, or? How did that work?
Speaker 2: He was an intellectualist.  In that, you know, I think that there again had a bearing on why they left and came up north because my father always felt that the message had to be of the times and had to stimulate your own thinking.  So he was not a pastor that was driven--trying to drive by emotion. That was not his style and that was not the style of any of my relatives.  But that said in New Orleans [Louisiana] the singing and the music, all of us played instruments.  I played piano, I played flute, my brother played the drums and my other brother played the trumpet, so music was a very important part of our lives and a very important part of my memories of religion.  When I was very young and we'd go to church in New Orleans there was one person his name was Dwight [ph.] he played the organ he was masterful and he ended up going to Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  But he inspired me, I wanted to play like him, I wanted to be able to play the piano and the organ just like Dwight 'cause he just was nailing it all the time.  I started taking piano lessons. I never got to where he was but--so there was that.  My Aunt Lois Jean--Dejean [Lois Dejean] who I talked about being the gospel artist always had a gospel choir--a youth gospel choir that travelled internationally so I was always around that, I was never a part of it 'cause we lived in Chicago [Illinois] and that was in New Orleans.  So that's another memory of the church.  So when I think about church in my young life I've held every position.  I've been an usher, I've been a Sunday school teacher, and I've been head of this committee or head of that committee.  We--in Ohio when we didn't have a chapel on Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] so we would have church in the student union, my brothers [Leonidas Johnson and Worthington Johnson] and I were the ushers that dispensed communion.  So, you know, I was involved in all that but again it was a part of our everyday lives it wasn't special.  So when I say not special what I'm saying is I remember me and my brothers on Saturday nights we would have to get the communion stuff ready 'cause that's when you poured it from Welch's grape juice so we would do that and then we would go and we'd put on our gloves but then some kind of way kids always make a game out of something.  So we're supposed to be passing out communion and it's like well who can get done fastest you know those kinds of things.  So it was my religious upbringing was very much intertwined with everyday life and it was also very much intertwined with the joy of life.  We didn't have to be so serious that you sit and you can't say anything and you can't move in church.  We would get in trouble for being too talkative and you know, too playful but my parents recognized as kids you have to have a balance and so that's how I thought of religion.  When I got to my own college age, I felt I had an overload; I didn't want to do that anymore.  I felt that--by the time I went to college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], we had moved back here. So the churches that we joined because I was a pastor's daughter there was an assumption.  People didn't ask me if I wanted to teach Sunday school, people didn't ask me if I wanted to head up the tea committee I was just told. And I did that 'cause I was very quiet and I was pretty, you know, obedient but when I went to college, I was like I'm doing any of that. I'm tired of that.  People, you know--I don't, I don't like people assuming that I'm going to play this role or that role and as a matter of fact I don't know if I'm even going to church (laughter).
Speaker 1: Which is what often happens at college.
Story_ID: 659819
Speaker 1: But we're going to go backwards, we'll get back to college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] in a minute.  When you were, when you were in Ohio serving communion, you and your brothers [Leonidas Johnson and Worthington Johnson] were the youngest people on the campus [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So was that daunting in any way that all these students and professors who you're serving?
Speaker 2: No because to us--remember my father [Leon Johnson], his office was in the student union which is also where the pool hall was and everything. So we would--we were always around everybody 'cause my father went into the pool hall, we would be in the pool hall, his office was there.  So it was--those were just the people that we were around.  They were the people of our community and neighborhood so we would see them on Sunday it was the same people, so.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school while you were there?
Speaker 2: I went to school in Xenia [Ohio].
Speaker 1: So Xenia, it was a drive away?
Speaker 2: It was a drive away and I had to--I caught a bus, but the bus was--the bus stop was at the end of the block but remember we lived on a rural route [U.S. Route 42] so the block was down the wheat field.  I remember in the wintertime having to run through that field sometimes to catch that bus and being in trouble if I missed the bus 'cause that was a problem (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then what would happen? Your mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] had to take you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At this point your mother could drive?
Speaker 2: Right, yes exactly.
Speaker 1: But then you'd have to run back the five miles--
Speaker 2: Yeah I had to run back.
Speaker 1: And what would the punishment be?
Speaker 2: She was, she was clever. She would--and all she would do is say, "Wait until your father gets home."  (Laughter) Then I would be all day thinking about what was going to happen when my father got home, so that was, and that was usually enough to keep me straight.
Speaker 1: And so we know that your father gave spankings--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause he gave you a spanking in front of other folks.  What other kinds of punishments did you have?
Speaker 2: Oh no, spankings. We were spanked.  Go get a ping pong paddle or give me my belt or whatever. Um-hm, yep and I didn't have--I got my share, but not as many as my brothers (laughter).
Story_ID: 659820
Speaker 1: As a young girl, what did young Esther [HistoryMaker Esther "E.T." Franklin] imagine she would do when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: I always had this dream, and it started with Boston [Massachusetts] and where that came from I don't know, but I wanted to go to Boston because--what is--there is an area of Boston I can't think of it now, it's really--I can't think of it, but it's very popular.  It's a nei- it's like a neighborhood but anyway in my mind I never went to Boston, I didn't know anyone from Boston and I'm not sure if I saw it on TV, but in my mind in this--Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]. That's what. I wanted to go to Roxbury because in my mind I thought I would get there and there would be these cobblestone streets, there would be these red brick buildings and there would be these black people that talked with a cockney accent and I just wanted to see that.  I wanted to talk to them because I wanted them to talk to me.  So that--I was going to go there when I was young I was going to Roxbury.
Speaker 1: And what were you going to do?
Speaker 2: I was just going to be there (laughter) listening to these black people talk funny.  That is what I wanted to do so I just wanted to go there.
Speaker 1: And when you imagined what you would do for your work what, what did you imagine?
Speaker 2: I was all over the place 'cause I loved animals and at one point I thought I'd be a veterinarian.  I--in Ohio is where I had a music teacher, Mr. Rhodes [ph.] and he exposed me to the flute and to the string instruments, to being in a marching band, to being in an orchestra and so I loved music.  So at one time I thought I would do music some kind of way, be a pianist maybe.  Those were--I loved sewing, I got exposed to sewing when I was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who taught you to sew?
Speaker 2: I learned on my own because my mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] would start making me things and she would never finish. And so I learned by picking up on those things and--
Speaker 1: You'd finish the things that she started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would finish. And got to the point where I could make my own clothes.  So, so between those things, you know, I thought at various points and times I would do one or the other and tr-, and travel to Roxbury.
Story_ID: 659821
Speaker 1: Now you stayed in Ohio until you were fourteen, I think you said?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So then does that mean you went to high school when you moved back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why did you move back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: My father [Leon Johnson] was coming to Northwestern Garrett Theological Seminary [Garrett Theological Seminary; Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois].  He had some kind of fellowship or something like that.  So we came here for him to go to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and I remember leaving Ohio and we drove and we were coming down Howard Street and I hated my parents.  I was like how could we--we just left this home that had five acres and apple orchards and all this and we're coming up Howard Street and it's really urban and it looked dirty and I was, and I was entering high school so that was the worse.  I was mad.  So we came and that's how we got here.
Speaker 1: And what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Evanston Township [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois] so I went from a small school in Xenia [Ohio] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which had about how many students?
Speaker 2: I don't remember but we definitely you know, five hundred or less I would think, to a high school with two thousand and I didn't know anybody so that was awful, parents, awful.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I continued my quietness. So for the most part I--again I loved school so I was a great student and I was very into my class work, did well in school and I was pretty much to myself.  Then I met a couple of other young ladies that were more quiet like myself on the way to school and developed a long friendship with Lynn Robinson and, you know that, that started my route to making more friends.  And I had a good high school experience for the most part.
Story_ID: 659822
Speaker 1: And where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: I went to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  So that felt more like my Ohio experience. But--
Speaker 1: Because it was smaller.
Speaker 2: It was smaller, it was in a rural, you know, more in a rural area like Ohio, but it was, it was also a challenging time because the year that I was going to high school [sic.] is also the year that my father [Leon Johnson] had his first seizure.  So when I went to college I had never--times are different now.  When I went to college I didn't visit the college before I showed up at the college.  My parents were going to take me to college but because my father had this seizure right before I was to go he couldn't go so it was just my mom [Dolores Dabon Johnson] that drove me down there.  So it was just--it was a disconcerting start to a college experience but it turned out okay as well.
Speaker 1: So now had he been a healthy man up until this point?
Speaker 2: He had been completely healthy.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: One night--we lived in a duplex so--and our, our bed--well the kids' bedrooms were on the top and my parents were on the bottom and I heard all this commotion.  We lived across the street from a fire station and so we heard the siren go off and then I heard all this commotion downstairs and I was like that's odd.  So our unit had two levels and there was a first floor unit so the assumption was something happened to the family on the first floor.  So I come tearing down there and see the paramedics in my parents' bedroom and my father lying on the floor.  So that was just petrifying and he was okay but that was very, very scary.  He wasn't okay enough--the timing must have been--it must have been like the same week I was going to college it was all right there together because he couldn't go and my mother asked my boyfriend's parents if he could ride down--take the drive with us and they said yes.  So that was, that was how that started.
Speaker 1: And you said his first seizure so did it turn out that he was--heart disease?
Speaker 2: No my father had chorea, and it's like a--it's similar to Huntington's and Parkinson's but not the same in the sense it's not hereditary but it does--over time, it's debilitating in instability and he has involuntary body movements so that became the beginning of that whole process.  So my father had been a very active man and he continued to be even with this illness, but it was hard in the beginning because you would hear things that people would say like oh your father is drunk or your father is this or your father is that and that wasn't the case.  But my father always said, "It's their problem not my problem," and he always moved and maneuvered in the world as if he had no problems and if there was a problem it was other people's.  So there were great lessons learned in watching him.
Speaker 1: So even as he became debilitated over years he continued to work and do--
Speaker 2: He continued to minister, he was the interim minister at Second Baptist Church in Evanston [Illinois].  Our stay here was intended to temporary it was just intended for him to finish the program at Garrett [Garrett Theological Seminary; Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois] but then this happened.  There were things happening at Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] so we ended up staying.
Speaker 1: Because the intention was to go back to Central State?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Because everybody loved it there?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we ended up staying here and he became minister to several, at different points in time just several churches within the community.  He was no longer ministering on a campus--on a college campus, but within the community.  So that's what I, that's what I remember.
Story_ID: 659823
Speaker 1: So now you're at college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], you're off to a rocky start because your dad [Leon Johnson] is ill and this is your first time leaving home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You're quiet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you're living on campus, what is your campus experience?
Speaker 2: It was great. Again my parents are very pragmatic, they're like just get up and get on with it.  So I compare that to me and my daughter [Lauren Terrell].  It's just, and the world today, it's so different.  My mother [Dolores Dabon Johnson] literally drove me down there, we did little paperwork whatever had to be done and then she drove me to the dorm and said bye and it's like, "Okay bye." And so that was that.  So I lived in an all girls dorm Lincoln Avenue Residence [Lincoln Avenue Residence Halls] at the time it was all female and I had a roommate from Evanston Township [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois] that I was rooming with Rose Marie [ph.], Rosie.  So we--our parents were similar in terms of the values and the way we were raised.  So when we went down there we had our football passes and you know, our passes to the games and things like that.  So we would go to the games and all that kind of thing and we were very active in the campus experience.  We would go to some parties and things like that but it was a very, I guess normal college experience. Nothing extreme either way.  In my second year is when I saw the Delta rush and I said I was going to go and see what that was about.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had seen it at--
Speaker 2: At Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and I knew I was going to be a Delta, I knew I wasn't going to be an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you know that, soror (laughter)?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was like--I could relate to--I felt like they were a browner skinned and I just liked the way they, I liked the way they performed and I liked what they were all about and so Delta was it, loved the color red and I went to the rush and decided to apply and I got selected and that was the beginning of that experience.
Speaker 1: How many women were on your line?
Speaker 2: Nine, there were nine of us, inseparable nine.  I am the anchor and all of my ship live in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: You were the tallest?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh you were the--anchor is the shortest?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What does anchor mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In our line the anchor is the strongest.
Speaker 1: Ah the strongest okay.
Speaker 2: Yep so we are a very close line to this day and we all get together.
Speaker 1: Oh I pledged at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I was number forty-eight of fifty-three.
Speaker 2: Wow that's a huge line. Huge line.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Actually I want to talk about the sorority a little bit.  You mentioned you were a child in Ohio observing the rituals of the sororities and fraternities. Apart from the pageantry of it all, what was appealing to you like as a child?
Speaker 2: It was--a lot of it was the pageantry but a lot of it was 'cause they seemed like they were having so much fun, there seemed like there was such unity there. They were always--I was exposed to a lot of the community service work they were doing 'cause Wilberforce [Ohio] is such a tiny community so when anything is going on you are a part of it.  So I don't know I just loved all of that. I, I just--
Speaker 1: And so now you're at your college and you, you pledge.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I won't ask you about the pledge process (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We can't talk about that, but what did you do because Delta is known for--Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] is known for a lot of public service. What kinds of activities did you do?
Speaker 2: We did a lot of clothes donations, we did a lot of, of raising money by selling different foods like bake sales that kind of thing.  We went into the local community there and serviced some of the community organizations so we did quite a bit of activities.  We had parties where we would also raise money that we would donate back to the community as well.
Speaker 1: And what years are we talking about now?
Speaker 2: So we, we went over in 1977.
Speaker 1: And you were in college what years?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975] through '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Seventy-five [1975] through '79 [1979]
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 659824
Speaker 1: Politically what's going on at that time?
Speaker 2: I had no idea. I was so unaware (laughter).
Speaker 1: So on campus, you--that--it wasn't political in that sense?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Like at Wilberforce [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Correct, no.
Speaker 1: Or Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you mentioned now you're in college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], you've taken off the cloak of I'm going to do what they tell me to do in church.  What was your spiritual life like when you're in college?
Speaker 2: I didn't really have one. I don't--I didn't go to church, I went to church when I came home but on campus I didn't--I wasn't involved with the church community.  I don't even think I went to the campus chapel.  I was always moved by music, so I--gospel music, inspirational music I always listened to that and I always felt that I didn't--this was when I was really big into if God is everywhere and if I believe in God why do I have to go to a church? Why can't I be out in the world and have a relationship and all that kind of thing so I was into that big time then.
Speaker 1: Now there are some stories of PKs or preacher's kids is that they go stark raving wild you know when they are in church, espe- excuse me, when they are in college, especially after being away from dad. Did you ever have that kind of experience?
Speaker 2: No I didn't. I mean I had fun. I, I had fun. I went to parties, I partied and all that but I was never an extremist. Never. It's just not my personality.
Story_ID: 659825
Speaker 1: What did you study in college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]? What was your major?
Speaker 2: I started out in liberal arts and realized that you had to take a foreign language and I was like okay where don't I have to do that (laughter) and I ended up in the College of Business [Gies College of Business] for that reason.  So that was the reason I ended up there, and then once I got there I got into marketing research and marketing I really enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: And then you went from there to get your master's right away?
Speaker 2: No. I worked (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What happened right after college?
Speaker 2: So got out of college, could not find a job for a couple of years--
Speaker 1: In '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: This is '79 [1979] and so I ended up doing a lot of random jobs.  I worked at Carson Pirie Scott [Carson Pirie Scott and Co.; Carson's] as a sales clerk, I was secretary to an administrator at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois]. I had jobs like that 'cause I just couldn't find a career job. And I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do either.  I interviewed in banks, I interviewed for anything that I could find.  And then there was a job, I don't, I don't quite remember how I got to this but there was a job at Market Facts [Market Facts, Inc.] which was a marketing research company as a field project director and I got that job.  That job was the beginning of allowing me to travel and go to communities that I otherwise would not have had access and exposure to and so that was the beginning of the journey that didn't start in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] physically but it sort of whetted my appetite for travel and being around people that I didn't know.
Speaker 1: And so that job when you say you were traveling meeting people you didn't know, what kinds of people, who were the people that you're coming to meet?
Speaker 2: Market Facts was a market research company, so the area that I worked in was as a field interviewer.  So we would get assignments, an example of an assignment was we were working on a large healthcare project for the government and the government wanted to know what kind of access people had to healthcare, what kinds of things they were doing.  So we were--we had to go and interview people to fill out these long questionnaires.  Again sign of the times. So I'm young early twenties and they send me to--let me just get some water.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Where is Duke University [Durham, North Carolina]? University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia]? All that--
Speaker 1: Where is Duke? Do y'all know? What town?
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I don't remember what town it is.
Speaker 2: All right. So they send me to a rural area that's just outside of the town of [President] Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia.  I had never been to this town and I was by myself so the hotel I was staying in was a motel on the side of a two lane highway.  That was not a problem, you know I had got on a plane and I was somewhere new so that was exciting so I stayed in that motel. And I had a rental car and I had to go into rural communities and knock on people's doors and then have them fill out the survey.  So I'm in some rural area by myself knocking on people's doors going into their homes to do an hour long interview.  They're nice people, they didn't know me and I had no fear and no concern and I'm like wow I really made it, I get to travel and do these kinds of things.  So that was just one--
Speaker 1: And how did they react when you knocked on their door?
Speaker 2: Most of them were fine. I guess 'cause they thought I was crazy, just like, who is this girl out here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are you, twenty-two, twenty-four something like that?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 659826
Speaker 1: So from that job where did you go?
Speaker 2: So I was in that job and I was watching TV and I saw a special about Burrell Advertising [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois]. It was their tenth anniversary. And Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] was on TV and they were just talking about the kinds of things they did and they were showing ads and things like that and I had never heard of a black advertising agency, so I was fascinated.  I was like wow that's really exciting. So I'm sure they have a marketing research department so on the weekday on Monday I called Burrell Advertising and asked to speak to the head of research and that person came on the phone and they said, "How can I help you," and I said, "I saw a special on TV about Burrell Advertising and I'm working at a market research company and I want to come and work there."  He is like, "What?" (Laughter), "You want to do what?"  "I want to come and work there," and he said, "Okay you come in here 'cause I want to see who this person is that would just think they can call up somebody on the phone and say they want to come work and get a job."  So I went and I interviewed very well and I did get a job. So.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: What year is that? That must be (mumbles) so that had to be around '82 [1982] or '83 [1983] somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: In '82 [1982] yep.
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: What role did you start there?
Speaker 2: In research--marketing research (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did? And so you were just hired? You went and had this meeting and you were--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I was like (makes sound) man, I really made the big time now.
Speaker 1: You also went to graduate school so how did that fit in?
Speaker 2: So I worked at Burrell for ten years and--Burrell and Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] and Burrell. And I, like my parents [Dolores Dabon Johnson and Leon Johnson], I always had a thirst for more or what was next.  I never had a clear vision of exactly what I wanted to do ever but I always knew that I wanted to prepare myself so that if something interesting came up in the future I could take advantage of that opportunity.  So I had been at Burrell for about ten years and I was just feeling that I wanted to know more.  I wanted to know what it would be like to work in Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] or an agency like that.  So I went to graduate school.
Speaker 1: So that ten years later?  Okay, so let's, let's be at Burrell for now.  So you started at Burrell, you had this job where you were doing the field research knocking on doors in rural America which you knew rural America 'cause you lived there, so it wasn't completely unfamiliar.  But now Burrell is the big leagues, I mean--
Speaker 2: That was big league yeah.
Speaker 1: Right? And, and so in your research--your marketing research roles, what were some of the things that you did while you were at Burrell?
Speaker 2: There I learned--so the job at Market Facts [Market Facts, Inc.] was interviewing people.  The research job at Burrell was research analysis so it was understanding how to use data, how to analyze data, how to conduct research projects and structure them, design so that you could get the type of data back that would allow you to develop implications after analysis and that kind of thing so slightly different job but in the same profession.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And what kinds of accounts did you work on while you were at Burrell?
Speaker 2: I worked across all. And the research department is a support department so whatever clients we had if they had a research need I would have an opportunity.  So clients like Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], like Ford Motor Company, like Brown-Forman [Brown-Forman Corporation], beverages, McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], companies like that.  They were--most of them were national clients.
Speaker 1: And at this point this is 1982 to 1993 right?  So black advertising agencies were very strong then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Burrell being one of the leaders.  There were dollars that were--big pots of dollars that were allocated to black advertising agencies to make advertising specific to the black community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what was the experience like?  There was an abundance was there not?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. It was fabulous.  I thought--I mean like I'm working and I'm getting paid and I'm having this much fun and I'm meeting all these people and I'm travelling even more. You know, it was, it was great.
Speaker 1: So travel was where were you going?
Speaker 2: I was travelling in the United States so Coca-Cola was in Atlanta [Georgia], Brown-Forman was in Louisville, Kentucky, McDonald's was here, Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] was out of New York [New York].  So wherever the clients were. You know, Ford was in Detroit [Michigan] so places like that.
Story_ID: 659827
Speaker 1: And Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], who's the leader of this organization that is in Chicago [Illinois]--most of advertising is in New York [New York] but Burrell is here in Chicago and he's quite a force.  So you're a young woman working at this agency. Did you interface with them and what was your relationship like working with this powerhouse?
Speaker 2: It was great. I mean again my background--I come from a black family that was--I had a lot of exposure to black people that had a lot of power whether they were ministers or whatever.  So it was--I was accustomed to that but Tom was great, he knew everyone and everyone knew him.  At that time I think when I started at the agency maybe there were fifty people so I wasn't in the beginning but I was close to the beginning.  There were some unique things that happened in those days.  One of the things that happened was there was such a sense of camaraderie. And we had these talent shows.  So I was there the year that the talent show started and I told you that I sew and I made my own--at that point I was making my own clothes.  So I entered the talent show just like everyone else.  It wasn't, it wasn't a big deal it was just fun you know do what you can do.  We had it at [HistoryMaker] Howard Simmons' studio on Chicago Avenue.  So my talent was the fact that I made my clothes so I found other women in the agency that were about my size and I put on a fashion show.  So we're in the back, you know, drinking and eating and they're announcing the winner and somebody said well, "You've won," and I was like--I just kept eating and drinking, and they said, "No you won."  So I won the first Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] talent show with my fashion show clothes that I had made.  So that was something that--so Tom of course was giving the award so that happened.  But again it was such a small environment and he was present all the time so I knew him just like other people.
Story_ID: 659828
Speaker 1: So now by the time--well at what point did you--were you I guess loaned out to Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]? How did that work?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause you were working for Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: I was working for Burrell--and it's one of the highlights.  I feel that I've worked for some of the most prolific black entrepreneurs that--of our time so Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] was one.  At--when I was working at Burrell my manager was a woman named Debra [ph.] I can't think of her last name, but anyway her name was Debra and she left to go work for Johnson Publishing and she was there maybe a few years and then she was leaving to start her own company.  So when she was leaving she reached out to me to say hey this opportunity is here, would you like to take advantage of it?  It was a higher title, more money and I thought yeah and I was going to be reporting directly to John Johnson.
Speaker 1: What was the role?
Speaker 2: It was research manager.  I think I had been an assistant research person at Burrell and so now this was like a promotion.  So I said yes and I went down and I was in that role for about six to eight months, something like that. But it was six to eight months of direct contact with [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson and that was a learning experience that I will not, you know, trade for anything.  He was an interesting, he was just an interesting, interesting man.
Speaker 1: So this is around what time, what year?
Speaker 2: This was still in the '80s [1980s], mid-'80s [1980s] maybe mid to late '80s [1980s] somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: So if you're in the mid-'80s [1980s] Ebony and Jet are still thriving.
Speaker 2: They're thriving, Fashion Fair is going strong--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the Ebony Fashion--what was the fashion show?
Speaker 1: Right, Ebony Fashion Fair
Speaker 2: Ebony Fashion Fair that was hot. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So that company and all of its entities are thriving.  John H. Johnson was like the godfather.
Speaker 2: He was a godfather, a true godfather.
Speaker 1: You know, peop- everyone came to Chicago [Illinois], every celebrity, every African American business owner would come and meet with him and take a picture--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and do a tour and so he was an incredibly powerful man.  You say you've learned a lot from him. What are some of the highlights that you learned from him?
Speaker 2: I learned not to be apologetic, I learned to speak up for what was rightfully yours and I learned to remain proud always. My office was one floor below his and there was a back staircase and he would just yell down there, "Esther [HistoryMaker Esther "E.T." Franklin] come up here right now."  So what he would do is he would have me sitting in his office which is all red, he would be sitting across the desk and he would make his phone calls and all--my job was just to sit there and observe.  So while he was conducting business whatever it was he would be sitting there talking and I was just sitting there watching all this.  And so, you can't learn--there's no better way to learn than to be in observance of someone like him doing his thing.
Speaker 1: And you're an observer.
Speaker 2: And I'm an observer so I was happy.
Speaker 1: Now you didn't stay very long.
Speaker 2: I didn't stay long because he couldn't teach me about my profession.  He could teach me about being an entrepreneur, but I also knew that I was, I was young in my career and so I began to think about well where am I going to go from here.  I'm not getting, I'm not developing my research skills, I'm not developing my management skills, I'm not developing those kinds of skills.  I'm learning how he was able to be successful, I'm learning how he conducts business, I'm learning how to be in the world in an extremely successful way, the way that he was and how he maneuvered through all that, which was invaluable.  But then I still have to go and find a job. Now what kind of job am I going to be able to get if I don't want to stay in this environment?  So I would begin to think about that and I went back to Burrell Advertising in a different capacity in account management.  But I had a very, I had a conversation with Mr. Johnson about leaving and why and he was extremely supportive, so.
Speaker 1: And Burrell was supportive of your leaving and then coming back?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yeah.
Story_ID: 659829
Speaker 1: So you go back to Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] to continue your education on the job.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now at what point do you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married before I went to Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] but I was at Burrell at the time. And so I was marrying my first husband's name is Albert Terrell [ph.] and we were getting married at the same time the movie 'E.T.' ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'] was coming out and so people at the agency started calling me E.T. [HistoryMaker Esther "E.T." Franklin] and that name has stuck with me forever.
Speaker 1: So that's why you're either Esther or E.T.
Speaker 2: Exactly
Speaker 1: How'd you feel about being called E.T.?
Speaker 2: Well I loved the movie 'cause I was like it was so cute and now it's so interchangeable I don't even think about it, but it gives me a little hook so for example when I think about my email address I use my personal one, E.T. phone home or some variation, so it's--yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's great and you have a child from that marriage?
Speaker 2: I do. Lauren Terrell. She is twenty-eight, she was born in May of 1986.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay married?
Speaker 2: It was five years I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere right around five years.
Speaker 1: So now as y- you're building a career in advertising which is incredibly busy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --raising a young child and being married, can you describe the juggle of that?
Speaker 2: It was a juggle but it didn't feel so juggly, I'll put it that way. Because at that time in that job, the job was more like a family as well so it was job and family all intertwined.  We were very close and we did a lot of, we did a lot together outside of work. And I found a wonderful woman to come and take care of Lauren and her name was Chlorie Young [ph.].  I interviewed several people to help with that and I was on my last interview and I went down into the lobby of our building and there was an older woman that had on red high heels, had on a red sleeveless dress and her purse and I was like could that be the woman that's interviewing to take care of my daughter? And it was and she was great and that was--so with her I didn't have to worry.
Story_ID: 659830
Speaker 1: So now in ninete- what--when did you leave Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] to move to Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.], correct?
Speaker 2: Correct. I left Burrell in 1993.  I did a lot in November of 1993. I left Burrell and went to Leo Burnett, I graduated from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] with my graduate degree and I got married and I moved.  So all those things happened within thirty days (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: I don't know it wasn't planned that way but coincidentally that's when they all coalesced together and they happened it was efficient (laughter).
Speaker 1: Pragmatist. So who did you marry?
Speaker 2: I married Ronald Franklin and we are married to this day.  We celebrated our twentieth wedding anniversary last year.
Speaker 1: And what does he do?
Speaker 2: Ronald has his own research company--marketing research company NSights Worldwide. But he came out of the advertising industry as well that's where we met.
Story_ID: 659831
Speaker 1: Okay so you go to Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.], which is a bigger mainstream advertising agency, correct?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And, and what did you do when you went there?
Speaker 2: I was hired in their marketing research department. So I started as marketing research and at that--shortly after I got there, the industry made a change from marketing research to account planning.  So I was there during the transition and I was in--I've been in that type of role ever since.
Speaker 1: Now Leo Burnett had huge brands that it worked with.  What were some of the key brands that you were working with during that time?
Speaker 2: I primarily worked on Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.]--while I was at Leo Burnett, I worked on Philip Morris for ten years and then I also worked on a corporate initiative which was the corporate trends initiatives.  So those were the two things I was involved with at that time.
Speaker 1: And this is--you were there what years?
Speaker 2: From '93 [1993] to about 2002.
Speaker 1: And Philip Morris is the company that has tobacco products but also lots of other initiatives.  What were you doing with the Philip Morris brand?
Speaker 2: So I was working as a marketing researcher.  Philip Morris had--was very interested in research and they were very well funded, their research initiative, so I was responsible for helping to understand what was going on with consumers in that context.
Speaker 1: And was it primarily around--didn't you all create the brown Marlboro man?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No, okay what--tell me some of the things more specifically that you did with Philip Morris (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So for example one of the things that I did and a lot of people ask me how could you work on cigarettes there is a whole issue around that and I always tell people that Philip Morris had the highest respect for research than--I'll put it this way. They were at the top of the list in terms of respect and funding of research from all of the different clients that I've worked on.  And because they had such an interest in research they were very open and liberal about what you could do.  So an example of what I did is in new product development.  They were always thinking about what kinds of products do we want, new brands of cigarettes to be in development.  We had our creative teams develop concepts for different new brands of cigarettes.  Rather than just take those concepts out and expose them, show the people maybe storyboards or read the concepts, which you would traditionally do what I did was I built sets.  So each creative team was given a booth, we had a convention company come in and build a whole series of booths. And they could outfit this booth with whatever they wanted to convey the idea of this brand so that had never been done before.  The client came in and people used all kinds of things to express or articulate what the essence of the brand was.  They would use artwork, they used concept boards, they would maybe stage it in terms of furnishing.  So that was something that was fun to do but also provided an insight to how people would respond in ways that had not been done before.
Story_ID: 659832
Speaker 1: To your point of what people would say at this time when you're at the end of the '90s [1990s] into the 2000s there is growing awareness of the dangerous effects of cigarettes, nicotine and a lot of push back.  What was your experience being on the inside working on these products and this presentation when nationally there is a wave of push back that was growing probably fairly large at that point?
Speaker 2: Right so for me the way I always thought about it and the thing that I always appreciated about Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] is that they practiced not the letter--not only the letter of the law but the intent of the law.  So if the law stated X, Y, Z it was Philip Morris' posture to say okay that our minimum criteria on top of that we're going to look at other implications and possibilities that could emanate and we're going to make sure that we're not promoting anything surrounding that as well.  So I felt that they were always going above and beyond in intent.  The other thing that I always ask people is that well the product is legal and so if our government and our society are saying that it is a legal product to sell than people should know about the product and be able to make choices within the parameters of legalized products.  So those were the things I thought about as I worked on the business.  Also always encourage people to really understand what they were doing and stop. You know, so.
Speaker 1: Were you ever a smoker?
Speaker 2: I never smoked.
Speaker 1: Was it ever hard for you with your friends talking about it?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh. The only time that it was sort of a little bit of a strange issue I was having a minor procedure and so I was in the hospital on the stretcher and the anesthesiologist came in and they always want to talk to you to sort of--you know so you're not nervous and the anesthesiologist asked what I did and I told him and he said, "You work on cigarettes."  He had an opinion and it was a negative one and I'm thinking to myself but wait a minute but you're getting ready to give me anesthesia.  I don't feel so com- I don't think we need to be having this kind of conversation at this moment.  So that was a little bit, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's--that's a memorable moment.
Speaker 2: That was memorable.
Story_ID: 659833
Speaker 1: Now you worked on an initiative called LeoShe.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: LeoShe came under--so I mentioned I worked on corporate initiatives as well, and this was one of them.  So there was a group that was formed to better understand how to market better to women at that time, and that was the whole purpose of LeoShe.  What matters to women, what's the female's voice, what's her perspective, that kind of thing.  It was a multifaceted process, there were lots of layers to what we were doing and coincidentally someone on our LeoShe team knew someone that worked for Oprah Winfrey and knew that Oprah was getting ready to do a segment on beauty. And so there was sort of informal conversation about that.  The Oprah Winfrey studio was interested in what we were doing with LeoShe and invited a few us to come over to talk them about what we were doing.  And I got--I was selected to be one of those people. So we were at Harpo Studios [Chicago, Illinois] in their cafeteria area and the dogs came in Sophie and the other one, I can't remember. And I'm a pet lover so I'm playing with the dogs not knowing, not noticing that Oprah had come in but she was not dressed and made up, she just looked like every other person.  So we're playing with the dogs--I'm playing with the dogs I guess she's observing all this and so she selects who she wants to come in and have the interview, you know, hear more from.  So I was one of the persons selected and ultimately I was selected to be the representative of the LeoShe team on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.' So that was, that was--
Speaker 1: And when was this?
Speaker 2: When was that? Let's see. So that had to have been somewhere in the mid-'90s [1990s] I would say. I guess.
Speaker 1: And so this, this research that you did around LeoShe was looking at--it was called a deeper view of what beauty meant. So what did you discover?
Speaker 2: One of the things we were trying to better understand was if there was a difference in the way black women looked at beauty versus white women. And so coming out of that study we found that there was.  We found that African American women had a higher beauty aesthetic, they had less issues.  We talked about sort of this Barbie aesthetic which was something that black women never aspired to 'cause that just wasn't happening. And so that became really interesting and provocative sound bites to talk about the beauty esteem among women in our society at the time.  It was that piece that Oprah was interested in hearing more about and that was the piece that I spoke to on the show.
Speaker 1: Well this is a po- a very powerful and dynamic shift in thinking--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at least publicly.
Speaker 2: Publicly, yes.
Speaker 1: That there would be the notion that black women might have higher self esteem than white women.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That is not, I mean, I worked at Essence for many years so I know that if you were immersed in black media you might be aware of that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but otherwise you were not.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So now you're at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.], which is a mainstream advertising agency looking at this.  How was the study received nationally?
Speaker 2: It was well received. You know, people--advertisers were--it was an eye opening moment for them.  It was a moment in time when they understood more clearly why having a different message or having that message manifest itself differently for an African American audience versus a white audience was an important thing to do and that there were ways that you could speak to the black female audience that were different from the way that you would speak to a white audience.
Speaker 1: So then did it open up more advertising dollars targeted to African American females?
Speaker 2: It did, but we're here in 2014 and we're still, we're still challenged in that way.
Speaker 1: Seems like it's going in the other direction now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's gone the other way oh my god. I'm just like, am I in the '70s [1970s] (laughter)?
Speaker 1: But back then--yeah, well.
Speaker 2: It was, but it was--
Speaker 1: But at that moment in time--
Speaker 2: At that moment in time.
Speaker 1: --it, it--that study opened up--
Speaker 2: It opened--
Speaker 1: --some money.
Speaker 2: Yes it did.
Story_ID: 659834
Speaker 1: So now while you were at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] you also did some work for the Na- the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center [Cincinnati, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Leo Burnett takes on pro bono assignments and it was a pro bono assignment. P and G [Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio] was a very large client and through that relationship we were informed that their previous chairman John Pepper and [HistoryMaker] Edwin Rigaud were go- were working together to amass the funding for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.  And so we took that on as a pro bono client and I was assigned as a strategist on that project.  That was a fabulous project.  John Pepper is an amazing man.  He is profoundly interested in what is going on with equity and inequities in our country and he's such a revered businessman that he was able to really raise the kind of funds that were necessary to get that museum going.
Speaker 1: And where is that museum?
Speaker 2: The museum is in Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And is it still--
Speaker 2: It is still there.  So I started working on the project, I developed a strategy for the project before groundbreaking.  I think we started about three years prior.
Speaker 1: Which would be around what time?
Speaker 2: I'm so bad with dates it would have to be--
Speaker 1: The 1990s still, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah we're still in the 1990s, yeah late 1990s (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Late '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: --I would say.  So we started it about three years prior to groundbreaking, so we were able to be a part of the groundbreaking ceremony and see how that came to light.  We were there when the building was erected and first opened.  It's a beautiful, magnificent building that was designed by a black architect.  And then John Pepper, Mr. Pepper brought me back in probably about 2010 or so.  They were repositioning the museum and he brought me back in to do the strategy for that so I remained involved with that project.  He invited me--the freedom center honors a national freedom hero every year so I think it was three or four--when I redid the strategy the Dalai Lama [14th Dalai Lama] was coming and so he invited me to that event and so I, I was able to shake the hand of the Dalai Lama.  So that was an amazing experience.  Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was another one. The historian that passed what was his Franklin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Charles Blo--
Speaker 2: Yeah his last name was Franklin or maybe his first name was Franklin but he--
Speaker 1: Hope--[HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin?
Speaker 2: Yes he was (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson, was he part of it?  He was in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he was very involved in--he had thousands and thousands of documents from the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 2: I don't remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know him?
Story_ID: 659835
Speaker 1: When did you move to Starcom [Starcom Worldwide]?
Speaker 2: Starcom was after 9/11 [September 11, 2001]. 9/11 where I flew into New York [New York] that morning and saw the planes hit and I believe went to Starcom the next year.
Speaker 1: So was there any significance of 9/11 or that's just your memory marker?
Speaker 2: That's a memory marker, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had been at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] for about ten years, was it? And was it just time to move? What made you move to Starcom?
Speaker 2: I got that itch again. It was I learned a lot, I had experienced a lot, I was exposed to a lot and I knew there was more and I wanted to know what more was.  And so I expressed to my manager that I wanted to be exposed to some other things and around about the same time Renetta McCann [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] reached out to me.  She was at Starcom at that time and she reached out to me and asked if I would consider coming over to the media side and initially I was like why would I do that? I'm quite fine here and I didn't know about it.
Speaker 1: And at this point Renetta McCann is in what role?
Speaker 2: At this point she is--
Speaker 1: She's one of the most senior--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --African Americans and females in advertising.
Speaker 2: She was the North America CEO, she had to have been yeah she was North America CEO or maybe she was CEO for Starcom USA.  I think she was CEO for the USA at that point. So she--
Speaker 1: And then just for context Leo Burnett at this point is also under the Publicis [Publicis Groupe] umbrella by now right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Yes.
Speaker 1: So Starcom and Leo Burnett are under this global umbrella. Starcom was also. So you're playing in the same sandbox even though it's a really big one.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Does it seem like that?
Speaker 2: It does, because the companies by then were completely separate from one and other even though they were in the same building.  Separate P and L [profit and loss], separate operating units, they were very separate entities but were kissing cousins because Starcom used to be the media department of Leo Burnett and then it became its own entity.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, and Renetta was head of that.
Speaker 1: Got it so she called to say do you want to come over and now it's in a completely different division.
Speaker 2: It's in media and while of course being in advertising for all those years I was exposed to media, I never really had direct interaction with media.  So it was an area that I did not know much about it at all.  So that call came and there's a little bit of time between when the call came and I, and then I reached back out to her. Because I started doing some research to see what was going on and started to see that there were just some little trickles of how media companies were now interested in understanding people in the same way that advertising companies had been.  And so in speaking more closely with Renetta about what her vision was, what she was looking for, she was looking for someone to come into the media organization and bring the skill set of account planning, the discipline of, of understanding consumers into that environment.
Story_ID: 659836
Speaker 1: So it was a perfect storm for you, bringing all of your skills into a new space that needed those skills.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So it felt comfortable, did it?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I think I was surprised by how uncomfortable it was.  I knew what I was doing. At least I thought I knew what I was doing and then I went into media and I realized that even though we were using the same terms and we were talking about the same things we had very different meanings behind what we were saying.  So I went in there like okay I've got a vision, I've got a plan and it's going to work like this.  And it became very clear to me very quickly that I needed to take a step back. I need to--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: You were talking about Renetta McCann [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] who invited you to come [to Starcom Worldwide] and then it wasn't easy.
Speaker 1: No the first six months I was in that role I did not know what I was doing.  I thought I knew. I mean I knew how to--I knew the discipline of understanding consumer behavior and how to, how to determine people's preferences and how they incorporate brands into their lives. What I didn't understand was that the terminology while similar to terms used in an advertising agency had very different meanings.  So the first six months I was in that role I felt was learning the language of media and being able to talk and communicate in a way that a media practitioner could understand what I was meaning as I communicated with them.
Speaker 2: So can you explain what does it mean working in the media. You know what--because obviously it was something you had to figure out what that meant too.  Media is this word that means a lot of different things.  What does it mean in the context of that business?
Speaker 1: So at the agency--at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] I was on the creative side, I was informing people about consumer preferences and behavior so that they could create advertising.  On the media side it was all about where is that advertising placed, how do you determine where it should be placed and then negotiating the rates for what you're going to pay for it to be placed. A very different side of the business; a business that is much more strongly driven by return on investment.  They want to know exactly what am I getting for my money, what are the numbers saying as when we place this advertising are we seeing any kinds of differences.  And so I went from a world that was more about feeling and emotion to one that was much more rigorous in terms of measurement.
Story_ID: 659837
Speaker 1: And you said it t- it took six months for you to get your sea legs I guess, is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And what shifted?
Speaker 2: What shifted? Well what I did is what I do best is I started identifying people to establish relationships with and in getting to know individuals within the media organization, I could sit down and have a one on one conversation with them so that I could be--I had the time to explain in more detail this is what I'm trying to do or this is where I'm trying to go, how would you get there, how would you talk about that from a media perspective and that kind of back and forth is what enabled me to begin to have a, have a conversation with media experts about human behavior in a way that they could understand, internalize, and act upon.
Speaker 1: So these relationships that you are seeking out were helping you to find a translation? Is that--
Speaker 2: To find a common ground. Because I was--again my role was to introduce a completely discipline into a well oiled machine.  So from most people's perspective within the media company, why was I there, everything is working, we're successful, technology was really evolving very quickly at the time and technology was driving media growth.  So they were growing without this insight so why do we need the insight.  So it was--the position was multifaceted in several ways. One, why are you here, what are you going to bring to the table that's going to mean something to me; two, why do I need that if we're doing well now, for what reason do I need to consider these other aspects; number three, okay I get that it might be a good thing to consider them but exactly what do you want me to do and exactly what are you providing for me and how is that going to change anything that I have been doing or I should be doing moving forward; and four, how do we when we're going out there selling our strategies and our activation ideas, what does this additional layer look like that sets up the proposition from a people perspective before we get into the specifics and mechanics of media?  And so it was just maneuvering and massaging through all of that and that was the role.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is a new role with a lot of push back because people don't necessarily understand the value of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: As you just articulated you are attempting to explain the value of it but in the beginning what did that feel like? Because you've got these powers of observation that you've developed from a young age with this powerful industry with a lot of push back.
Speaker 2: So in the beginning it was hard, it was hard.  I knew I had an ally in Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] but I was removed from Renetta so I wasn't--she wasn't a person that I was interfacing with on a day to day basis nor was she steeped into the specifics of what I was doing.  So I had an ally that was a little bit distant and it became another, another example of how I've operated my whole career.  And most of my career has been to go into a situation that is uncharted, to go into a situation that didn't exist before and to have a vision for what it could be and develop the steps necessary to get there.  So I very quickly went into that mode.  There is no roadmap. When there is no roadmap there's no wrong direction either (laughter).  That doesn't mean there is going to be smooth sailing but it gives you a blank canvas.  And so I started to have fun with it. What would I want it to be?  If I could do anything how would I craft it? Because that was where I was; I could think of it, I could dream it and I could then lay out a plan for how to bring that light and that's what I began to do.  I had some successes and I had some failures.  I had times when I felt like I was moving backwards and then I had times when I was leaping forward.  I had times when I felt that no one in the organization [Starcom Worldwide] wanted to have anything to do with me, not personally, but they just didn't find the value or the need, to having a champion that seemingly came out of nowhere that enabled me to have my first real significant success and once that happened then I was on my way.
Story_ID: 659838
Speaker 1: So what was the big success?
Speaker 2: Ah, okay. So the company had bought into my vision and now it was time for me to hire a person to work on a specific piece of business.  I found the right person, brought her in and we were at the client presenting why this new role should be incorporated into our scope of services.  So I'm up there doing my best, you know.  Here's all the rationale, here's the reason, here's the benefit all of that kind of stuff, and they're politely nodding and you can tell they're like, "Uh-huh, no we're not interested in paying for that.  If you want to do it for free that's okay." And this woman Jill Vanatta--
Speaker 1: Who you, who you had hired?
Speaker 2: No she was a person who was heading the account at the time.  She stood up and she went on a soliloquy about the need, the rationale, the benefit and I was sitting in the meeting and I was like--you know the longer she talked the more I sat straight up in my seat, I was like wow.  I have a real supporter here. And she fought and she volleyed and they said great and from that day forward I thanked her because it was my first success, it was my first win in getting the discipline acknowledged by a client in a way that would be paid for that validated everything that we had been trying to do, so.
Speaker 1: And this is how far into your being at Starcom [Starcom Worldwide].
Speaker 2: This probably is eight or nine months.
Speaker 1: Is this--what is your role--what is your title at this point?
Speaker 2: At that point I was senior vice president, director of consumer context planning.
Speaker 1: So is this the title you created? Consumer context planning?  It's not--I don't know that title.
Speaker 2: That was a title that existed within the industry.  There were a few different titles to describe the same profession--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was the title that was being used at Starcom.
Speaker 1: What does that mean consumer context planning?
Speaker 2: It was the account planning discipline, the study of human behavior in the media space.  So they were similar disciplines, account planning, consumer context planning, channel planning all of those kinds of titles were used to describe the discipline that really is rooted in, you know, consumer behavior and anthropological types of methodologies.
Speaker 1: And how does analytics fall into that?
Speaker 2: It puts it all into context. So when you think about account planning or consumer context planning or experience planning it is about what is the whole story.  What do the numbers say, what do the cultural inputs add to the story, what does what's happening in the news media add to the story, what does personal perspective add to the story.  It's about taking multiple inputs understanding what aspects of those inputs can be used to help shape a story in an effective way to produce better product at the end of the day. So that's what it is.
Story_ID: 659839
Speaker 1: Now while you're in this role I believe was when you worked on the project with The History Channel [History]?
Speaker 2: The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 1: History Channel's 'Band of Brothers.'
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that project and what your role was?
Speaker 2: History Channel 'Band of Brothers.' That was--at that time we were trying to think about how we're going to innovate in the media space and how is that going to--how we are going to be bringing it closer to consumer experience.  The industry had been growing driven by technology and we felt if we can bring the consumer perspective into the mix that it would distinguish us from our competition.  So there was an opportunity by the-'Band of Brothers' was being developed and there was an opportunity to place that--I'm sorry that was being placed on The History Channel.  The History Channel came to our media organization [at Starcom Worldwide] with a traditional package.  For X amount of money you can have thirty second spots here, you can have integration in this way you know the traditional media package.  What we said is we want to do it a little bit different, we don't want to just place advertising in the, in the programming.  We want to create lead in and lead out interstitials if you will.  So if the 'Band of Brothers' is a series of episodes people might not necessarily be able to be see every, every segment of the series.  What if instead of taking the traditional media package we use that time and create summary vignettes of the previous episode.  So that if a person missed the previous episode when they sit down to watch instead of seeing a commercial leading in they'll see the summary from the previous episode and at the end of the program they'll see a lead in into the next one.  So we used our media dollars to create those interstitials and place them in that manner and that was new and innovative at the time.  It was a way to think about placing and using media and programming in a way that was--reflected consumer behavior versus placing advertising in programming.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: That had to have been around 2003.
Speaker 1: So HBO [Home Box Office] at this point is huge. Right? HBO is one of the main players in creating new content and now you're using interstitials in a different way because interstitials are not new but this use of interstitial is new--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how effective was it?
Speaker 2: That was very effective.  People were writing in about--we were able to increase people's engagement, in other words, time spent.  They were talking about these interstitials as a new way of seeing how media was being used.  So the [U.S.] Army was very happy and The History Channel was happy so that was very effective for us.
Speaker 1: So was the Army the advertising end of this?
Speaker 2: No, not necessarily.  I can't remember exactly the clients that were involved in advertising. I don't, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 659840
Speaker 1: At this point you are also being recognized for your contributions to the world of advertising.  I mean you were named an Ad Age Woman to Watch [Ad Age Women to Watch] in 2004.  This is all around the same time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is it not?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean in the world of advertising? That honor?
Speaker 2: That's a very prestigious honor.  Every year they select a small group of women, I think it's maybe around twenty or so, and they acknowledged them for their contribution in the industry and talk about where these women are going.  So it's a, it's a recognition that is hard earned and it's a recognition that comes from the peers within the industry so it's very nice in that way.  At that time I think I was--I, I believe I was the only African American woman that year.  There might have been one other.  I was not able to actually go and attend the event, I had a conflict, but there just weren't very many women of color that had been acknowledged in that way, so.
Story_ID: 659841
Speaker 1: At this time this was in the early--mid-2000s, what other black women are leaders in the advertising industry?
Speaker 2: So there was Ann Fudge [Ann M. Fudge] she was in New York [New York] and her name was always on my radar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And at that point what was she doing?
Speaker 2: I don't know if she--she had a significant role and she eventually rose to being the CEO [of Young and Rubicam; Y&R]. I'm not sure if she was CEO yet but she was clearly ascending upward. And then there was Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann].  Those were the women on my radar.  There, there weren't very many, there just weren't very many.  Ann was in New York and Renetta was in Chicago [Illinois] that was how I thought about it. And then I was coming along.
Speaker 1: And are there many more now?
Speaker 2: Oh my god now there's Veda Harris [ph.] she's at Foote, Cone [Foote, Cone and Belding], Tiffany Warren [Tiffany R. Warren], myself, Renetta's back, yay, and Sandra Sims-Williams.  Those are, those are--are there only four of us? That's four. Kendra Hatcher, Kendra Hatcher King was at Initiative and then she left and now she's, she's back in a Publicis network [Publicis Groupe].  But the point is we're talking about one hand. We're talking about one hand.
Story_ID: 659842
Speaker 1: So at two tho- in 2006 you were promoted, correct, to EVP of--and director of cultural identities--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at Starcom [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]? What does that role include, what are the responsibilities?
Speaker 2: So I have been at Starcom where I built the discipline. Smooth sailing, had a great team and was ready to maintain and I was called to consider a position in multicultural unit. And the way the position was brought to me is that the perfect alignment had happened.  There was not many opportunities where the interest of the company, the interest of the industry and the interest of the person align.  In this case it has all aligned and we would like you to come and work in the multicultural unit to be our African American specialist.  That was how it was presented to me. And I said, "But you never asked me what my interests were.  So how do we know they align?"  That was an interesting moment in time. And let's just say approximately four or five months later the opportunity was represented in a different way, so, resulting in the promotion and director of cultural identities.  My initial reaction was that I had been at Burrell Advertising [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois]; I had worked in the African American arena so you're offering to me a heading up an African American discipline was not an evolution of my professional development.  When I came back and thought about what would be something that would be exciting to me, what would be something that would make me feel I was continuing to grow, I thought about this idea of culture and identity and African Americans, of course would be a part of that.  But that platform would allow an expansion into all kinds of cultures, all kinds of people, all kinds of communities and so that is how that came to be and that was how it was developed.
Speaker 1: When you were presented with the initial offer, how did you handle that? Because even though you're at this point, you're at a high level in the company, obviously you're well respected, still to say no is tricky.
Speaker 2: It's very tricky.
Speaker 1: And it can often mean goodbye.
Speaker 2: It can. I didn't know how that was going to go.  What I knew for sure was if I accepted what was on the table that I would not grow, I would not be happy and in my eyes I would start to stagnate. That was not an option.  So I spoke up and for several months I didn't know how it go--went.  There was no reaction. So I was like um-hm, this is, this is interesting. And then four or five months later the opportunity came back and again Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] was instrumental in helping me see how it could potentially be shaped.
Speaker 1: So after you were offered this then you--would you consider her your mentor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you then confer with her about this?
Speaker 2: I told her what happened and then there were months when there was just silence and nothing happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nobody had come back to you?
Speaker 2: Nothing happened that I was aware of.  What I later found out is that they were interviewing people during that period of time.
Speaker 1: And they figured out you were still the best person.
Speaker 2: I assume (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well you were, you were offered a repositioned role.
Speaker 2: I was offered a- I was offered an opportunity to create the role.
Story_ID: 659843
Speaker 1: And so you created cultural identities?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And, and so what, what did you create?
Speaker 2: I created an opportunity to re-think about how we thought about culture and identity in the context of marketing and advertising.  I created an opportunity to start with a blank canvas rather than starting with assumptions about communities whether it's African American or Hispanic or whatever.  So that then made it a very different proposition and one that was exciting to me.
Speaker 1: Which is probably better for the company [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] because people don't live in black and white anymore.
Speaker 2: They don't live in black and white anymore but when you're starting from large Corporate America, you have to help them internalize it. People don't live that way anymore.
Speaker 1: And at what--where are we when this is--at what space and time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay 2006.
Story_ID: 659844
Speaker 1: And at what point is Laura Desmond ascending?
Speaker 2: She is ascending. She is ascending at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah she is.  So she--I'm probably not going to have all the dates correct.  So when I came into Starcom [Starcom Worldwide], Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] was head of Starcom USA.  Renetta ascended to be the CEO of Starcom globally.
Speaker 1: Which is historic for a black woman to be in this role (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Historic never happened.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When that happened Laura Desmond began to ascend.  I believe Laura Desmond became the CEO of Starcom and Renetta was CEO of North America and then became global CEO.  So these things were happening simultaneously.
Speaker 1: So Starcom becomes this powerhouse place for women.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In leadership in any case.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So internally does that shift your experience? Because you are also in a very high level position and now there's a black woman who is running the whole thing and a white woman who has become CEO.  So in the world of advertising would you not think of it being female headed?
Speaker 2: Right and then the specific division that I was in--that I moved to from Starcom to SMG, to Starcom Mediavest Group [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], I went to the holding company where SMG multicultural is Monica Gadsby was heading that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: So yes you have Renetta, you have Laura Desmond, you've got Monica Gadsby, so very strong female leadership.
Speaker 1: And comparatively in the industry is this unusual?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 659845
Speaker 1: So being in this place that is now female headed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you are in a very high level position too, does it shift any of your ability to do the work that you're doing?  What is your experience in this environment?
Speaker 2: It was great. It was great because Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] had a vision at that time for investing against multicultural communities to get information that would help us reposition opportunity.  So with her funding we were able to create and establish Beyond Demographics and her backing and that was a very special moment in time.  There was significant investment from our organization [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] put into that.  A quarter of a million dollars and that had never happened before. And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the Beyond Demographics project?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So can you describe that project specifically?
Speaker 2: Beyond Demographics is a way of going into a community and looking at the community from the inside out.  So typically in advertising and marketing we'll do these huge research studies, there will be analysis done.  The information will be clustered with like minded and labels will be put on these various segments.  In our case we said we know that there are identities within the African American community that we're not seeing anywhere in the marketing arena.  We seem to be focused on one or two but we know they exist and so if we go inside the communities and start with identities that the community knows to be true and exist and they see every day and use that as a foundation and then build data out from there you're going to have a completely different picture.  And that's what Beyond Demographics is. It's taking an inside look--inside out look from a community perspective and then supporting that with qualitative quantitative data that helps clarify the face of the community and their media preferences and behaviors.
Speaker 1: So is this essentially what you came in to do evolved?
Speaker 2: I came in to create a different way of understanding multicultural communities.  That was what I came in. Now how that was going to be done was completely open.  Beyond Demographics became what was created to fulfill--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --against that, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how many years are between Renetta saying, "I know you can do this," and Beyond Demographics happening?
Speaker 2: So it's a little tricky question because when Renetta said, "I know you can do this," that was initially bringing account planning into media.  So that was about five years in that role.  Then she said, well this is something else you can do, so I came in there in 2006 and 2007 we were, we were on our way.
Speaker 1: So having someone having that faith in you makes a huge difference too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Phenomenal. Makes all the difference in the world, all the difference.
Story_ID: 659846
Speaker 1: Have there been other mentors in your career?
Speaker 2: I have not had many.  It's been a, it's been a difficult road, it's been a road in spite of. I've only had one or two, but Renetta [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann] was significant.
Speaker 1: And have there ever been any male mentors in your career?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I have--so can your mentor also be your, like your husband?
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because Ron Franklin [Franklin's second husband, Ronald Franklin] he's been like--he was the one who hired me at Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] when I made that phone call so (laughter) and he also is one that has always known what my potential was even when I was unsure of it myself and has always been extremely supportive in all of the different roles, all of the challenges that I've faced in my career and made sure that I was armed to do the task.
Speaker 1: And as you have excelled in your career was there ever any competition between you?
Speaker 2: No. The only--it's not competition but you know when you're in these careers you come home and you're like daggone it again and again and again.  So I was coming home at one period in my career and everyday it was something else.  One day he looked at me and said, "It's them or me. Pick." And I was like okay.  So I needed that kind of jolt to help change my attitude and my perceptions so that what I was going through was not affecting me on a personal level so much.
Speaker 1: And so you left it at the door right?
Speaker 2: I did 'cause there was no choice to me. I was going to keep my husband.
Speaker 1: How long in your marriage was that?
Speaker 2: That was (mumbles) maybe about eight or nine, eight or nine years.  I was at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] at the time and he was like, "I've heard this story one too many times," (laughter) and I was like okay.

Speaker 1: Your current position is what?
Speaker 2: My current position is executive vice president, director of SMG Americas Experience Strategy [at Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], so that's another mouthful.
Speaker 1: And you stepped into that role in 2011 right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And what does that role mean?
Speaker 2: So that role acknowledges that we made a shift from consumer context planning to experience strategy. And experience strategy is an even more clarified focus on following people because people are driving change.  That's the first piece, the second piece is I had been previously U.S. multicultural only and Americas encompasses U.S. multicultural and Latin America, so that is what that role reflects.

Speaker 1: Now how does digital and the whole explosion of the digital platform affect your work?
Speaker 2: It affects the whole industry--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and my work as well.  And so, focusing on people, their media behaviors, their preferences, those kinds of things.  About five or six maybe seven years ago now we as a company [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] began in earnest to really follow and understand the digital trends and recognized that digital was going to begin to take over analog in terms of the way people are interacting and using media.  So our whole organization had to become digital capable.  So when I'm studying people's preferences and how they are using media and how they are bringing experiences into their, into their lives, so often that they are doing it via accessing some kind of digital or mobile platform.  So I have to really know and be on top of what's going on with digital, what's going on with mobile to understand how people are bringing that into their lives and how it shapes what they do, their preferences and how they engage in media.

Speaker 1: In 2014 you published an article, 'Are You Reaching the Black American Consumer: How the Rise of U.S. Multiculturalism Ended Up Sending Mixed Marketing Messages' [Esther "E.T." Franklin]. What's that article about, what's the core message?
Speaker 2: The core message of that article--I'll step back just a minute.  One of the hot topics in our industry now is total market.  Everybody is acknowledging the demographic shifts that are occurring within the United States population and in acknowledging that the industry is saying we need to respond.  It's no longer necessary in a lot of cases to think about audiences separately since we're all together now.  And so total market is the way we should reach out from an advertising and a communication messaging perspective, meaning develop a message that can reach everybody.  So I started seeing the ads and the strategies that people were describing as total market and I was thinking back to my experiences at Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] and Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] and all that period of time, and I realized to me the black consumer is being left out of total market efforts.  Now you see black con- people in total market ads and you see black people portrayed in programs and things like that. And my question is are you tapping into the black perspective or are you only using casting and music to convey interest? And that's what that article is about.

Speaker 1: As was true many years ago, it seems that it is again true that there is a question about the relevance of targeting an African American consumer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now to be fair, the Hispanic consumer has only recently been discovered as, oh this is a huge gold mine.  So many people are late to that party. But recognizing that's important it seems in an industry that recognizing the Hispanic market is important is often at the expense of continuing to recognize that the African American consumer market is important.  Does that--do you think that's true? Is that happening?
Speaker 2: I think it is happening and it's unfortunate because with the population shifts in growth the pie is expanding.  So there is no need to take the same sliver of pie and divvy it up in smaller pieces.  If you recognize the opportunity to raise the whole (unclear) then you don't have the question of reallocation, you have the questi- you have the opportunity of expansion and that's not what we're seeing in the marketplace.
Speaker 1: It seems ironic if you look at the numbers how much money black consumers spend on consumer products in relation to anyone else including Hispanics but certainly white Americans and that's not even getting into both Americas, I mean it's disproportionate.
Speaker 2: It's disproportionate, I mean there is the economics of it that you're mentioning, it is disproportionate but there is also the concept of we're living in a post racial America and so culture is no longer important in reaching out to people, especially at younger ages when we talk about millennials and that age cohort.  And that's not the case and what concerns me so much is that African Americans are spending money and the investments of advertisers don't reflect or acknowledge the money that's being spent that they are making profits on.  But also beyond African Americans--African Americans have always been a trendsetter but it's a trendsetter in this way as well.  So the reason why African Americans often get left out of total market efforts is because African Americans speak English and they over deliver on most media platforms.  So there is no need to do anything different.  If you think about the Hispanic audience into the future they are more and more going to be English leaning and English dominant.  They are going to find themselves in the same situations as African Americans when they speak English and they're watching general medial platforms, same challenges. And it's not going to stop there.  So we look at the Indian, U.S. Indian community, they have got the highest income, they're definitely influencers in tech- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) East Indians
Speaker 2: East Indian exactly, technology and other categories, they speak English.  Does that mean that they don't want to see themselves or that they don't want to see cultural nuance woven into general messagings that acknowledges, hey you know what? We acknowledge and appreciate the contributions you are making to our business.  So African Americans are a leading indicator of what's happening culturally across multiple segments in our country.
Speaker 1: So being aware of this as a leader in your industry--so you've written about it, but what else do you do because you can lead the horse to water but how can there be a shift?  Because part of this is racially motivated too I'm sure.  Or would you believe that it is?
Speaker 2: I think what's happening--I think race is definitely a part of it.  I think what's happening is that the powers that are in control now don't know what their future looks like in a world that's changing so profoundly and that's the issue.  Because if you can't see your future you're going to fight harder to hold on to what you have, even though if you could open your vision and understanding and embrace what you don't know or don't understand as much to see that opportunity can bring you continued success we'd be in a different place.
Speaker 1: But isn't that the story of civilization?  (Laughter) That's what happened with slavery, that's what happened--I mean, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know. That's what happened and that's why it's hard and that's why it's still a fight.  So when I think about our industry whether it's advertising, whether it's marketing, whether it's communication and oftentimes people say, "Why are you still in it? Why do you hang in this industry?" Because our talent that's coming up has to see somebody that looks like them.  They have to have some hope that they can ascend to a position of power and influence because that's where our hope is.  Our hope is behind us and they need to see themselves.
Speaker 1: (Cough).

Speaker 1: When you think about your career and you look forward, what, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy.
Speaker 1: What you believe it is?
Speaker 2: (Pause) My legacy I want to be that you can make a difference in a well oiled machine that doesn't understand, that doesn't quite accept or doesn't fully embrace what you bring to the table.  That you can even when unaffirmed hold your head high and be effective and that you can do that with dignity, you can do it with authenticity and you can do it with grace.

Speaker 1: What message would you give to young black boys and girls who might want to enter your field?
Speaker 2: Come in, the industry is exciting, the industry is dynamic.  It will expose you to things you never imagined before.  At the same time it will be difficult, it will be lonely and you will wonder what you're doing in this space. But there is room, you are needed and your voice needs to be heard.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: No I have no regrets.  It's been, it has been a joy and in addition to the things, other things I said about why I continue to be in the industry, I am in the industry fundamentally because I love it.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who had a great run, who enjoyed every minute of it, every minute second.
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: I don't think so; I, I think you've been very thorough.
