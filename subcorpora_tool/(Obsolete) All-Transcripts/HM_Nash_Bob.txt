Story_ID: 11274
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your father's side and your mother's side, but first, can you give me your parents' full names, birth dates and spell their names for us.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Jacob B. Nash, Jr.  He was born in Texarkana, Arkansas on June the 8th, 1924.  My mother's name is Eva Jo Nash.  Her maiden name was Whitmore.  She was born May 1st, 1928 in Texarkana, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side.
Speaker 2: My father's grandfather was named Jack Nash.  He was a farmer.  He grew up in Miller County, which is close to Texarkana, Arkansas, and he, I think, moved to Arkansas from Louisiana, I think.  He bought about 400 acres of land for two dollars and fifty cents an acre back in the early 1900s and started farming.  And he had five kids.  My father's father was one of those kids.  And they raised cotton and corn and cows, and that farm is still in the family today, although we're not farming it.  We have it leased out to someone.  My father's mother was a housewife all of her life.  On my mother's side, my mother's father was a, a farmer.  And her mother was a housewife.  And I do not know the history of my mother's father or my mother's mother prior to knowing them in Texarkana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there--are there any stories at all passed down through--.
Speaker 2: One second Larry--find out about those (unclear).  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories passed down, in your family, stories or songs or incidents of life in Arkansas way back when?
Speaker 2: Well, there were some interesting stories.  We, you know, farming was pretty tough back then.  And, you didn't, as a small black farmer in Arkansas, you had a hard time getting loans for your product or selling your product for good prices.  And so I do know that one of my uncles supplemented our farming by brewing some, something, some alcohol that he would sell to his friends.  And that would always, I know supplement the farming operation years ago.  He's long gone, and, but I remember seeing this old still years ago in the woods.  And they would talk about how that was a, a part of the effort to supplement the operation of the farm, basically using corn.  And I also remember that back then the, the Farmers Home Administration, which provided loans for farmers in the area, that black farmers always had to wait until the end of the, the loan process to see whether or not there were, there were any dollars left for them.  And I remember always--my grandfather always saying, well, we got to get down there to be in the last line, and you'd have all the black farmers going down there to see whether there were loans--loan dollars left for farming.  And I remember that as a young kid, which was very disheartening.
Speaker 1: So they got whatever was left after everybody else--?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's exactly right, black farmers did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about your father.  What kind of person, you know--what's his personality?  And what, you know, what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father was also a farmer, but he also worked for a defense, munitions factory.  He actually made bombs and bullets.  He only grad--he, he, I think finished the tenth grade, was in World War II, was shot in Sicily in the leg and came home after that and started working on the farm and working in this munitions factory, making bombs and bullets and hand grenades.  And he did that all of his life.  In fact, he died on the job, going to work one morning.  He worked, one of the--he was one of the first African Americans to be employed out there.  It was a very well-paying job back at that time, but also very dangerous.  And he just had a heart attack on the job [in 1974].  But he farmed and worked at that munitions plant for many years.  And, again, my mother was basically a, a housewife.  I, in fact, worked at that munitions plant in the summers.  He got me on out there, and I had made hand grenades one summer and got paid very well.  But it was dangerous.  Then another summer I made 105 shells, which were these very large shells that, that you shoot out of these long guns turrets, and, but that's what he did most of his life.  And he always wanted me to go to college, but--even though he never had a chance to go.
Speaker 1: How far did he have a chance to go?
Speaker 2: The tenth grade.  He finished the tenth grade, and I think my mother finished the eighth grade.  But they--and I was the first one in my family to go to college, but they always wanted me to go 'cause they wanted me to have a better life than they did, and they worked very hard to, to send me to college.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your mother like?  I know you said she was a housewife and--?
Speaker 2: She was a hard worker.  When I say, housewife, she was a housewife, she was a, she was a farmer, and, you know, you think a housewife is not a job, but she would get up very early in the morning, cook, wash, clean, get kids off to school, then, then do farming.  And, but she was always very diligent, a very hard worker, didn't travel much, stayed around the home and always wanted her kids to have a better life than she did.  She was one of about twelve children.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have seven brothers and sisters, and they're all living and they live anywhere from Los Angeles, California to Texarkana, Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, and they all are, are doing different things.  You know, one's a, an IRS [Internal Revenue Service] agent, one's a farmer, one's a landscape developer, one is, is, works for, works for a prison as a, a maintenance supervisor of the prison, and all kids who, who really appreciated being raised by Jake and Eva Jo Nash.
Speaker 1: Now, where do you fall in that group again?  You're the--?
Speaker 2: I am the next to the oldest.  My sister, who's older than me, her name is Mae Nash.  So I'm second.
Story_ID: 11275
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Can you describe growing up for us?  What was, where did you grow up?  Did you grow up in town or in the country or?
Speaker 2: We had a house in town.  And the farm was about sixteen miles out of town.  So during the week, we would be at the, at the house in town, and on the weekends--and sometimes in the evenings, we'd go down to the farm, which is about sixteen miles out of town.  But I went to an all-black high school, Booker T. Washington High School [Texarkana, Arkansas].  And I graduated in 1965.  Texarkana, Arkansas was an interesting place.  It's a twin city.  There's a Texarkana, Texas and a Texarkana, Arkansas.  Together, the, the population of those towns is about 50,000.  They're probably about 60,000 now.  But I, I never had a chance to participate in sports or any after school activities because I would, I'm usually going--I would go home and work on the farm out in the country or, we also had a small farm uptown.  When I say small, it was about ten acres.  So we would raise vegetables there.  And I, I enjoyed Texarkana, but I also knew that it was a place that I really didn't see a lot of opportunity.  Basically, professionals were ministers, teachers and that was about it.
Speaker 1: You have a funeral director or somebody?
Speaker 2: We did have a funeral home director, who was very prosperous.  Let's see, in fact, we had two funeral home directors, yeah, in Texarkana.
Speaker 1: That seems to be the same pattern in every town (laughter).
Speaker 2: It is, it is, exactly right.  But I enjoyed it.  We worked hard.  We, we raised a lot of our food.  We always had transportation to get from here to there, and we had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember hunting.  We always would love to hunt, and basically, small game hunt, squirrel, rabbits.  And we would always love that.  So the fall, I think that's--earlier, I said the fall's my favorite time of the year, and that's when we would go hunting.  We also had some pecan trees and we'd pick our pecans and sell those in the fall or you would kill hogs in the fall.  And so that, that whole feeling about being around a farm and being around animals and nature and woods was something that I remember.  We really weren't what you call city, city people, although Texarkana was not, and not that small.  Like I say, it was about 50,000--if you count both sides of town.  So it was, again, we enjoyed it.  We had a lot of fun.  There was not much exciting going on there.  If you wanted some excit--in high school, if you wanted some excitement, you'd drive to Shreveport, Louisiana, which was ninety miles away to listen to a concert, some big entertainment, you know, James Brown or somebody like that.  Or you might go to Little Rock [Arkansas], which was a hundred and forty miles away, to listen to entertainment.  But for the most part, you went to school, worked on the farm, hunted, and that was about it.
Story_ID: 11276
Speaker 1: You grew up during segregation, it was still--.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --very much in evidence, right?
Speaker 2: It was.  In 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas, you know, they had the big integration crisis at Central High School.  But it was not until 1967 in Texarkana [Arkansas] before--it was 1967 before schools in Texarkana were integrated.  And I went to--I graduated from high school in 1965, all-black high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Texarkana, Arkansas].  I was bussed past Arkansas High School [Texarkana, Arkansas], which was the white high school at that time.  And in 1967, two years after I graduated, they integrated the public schools, starting with the, with the first through the sixth grade.  And then in 1968, they integrated from the seventh through the twelfth.  And so I remember getting the books from the high school, which was the early editions.  We would get those at Booker T. Washington High School.  And while I didn't play sports, I know that some of the people on the football team would get the pads and the shoes and other things from Arkansas High School after they had finished with them and they got new things.  So I remember that as being something that--it was almost like, it was always that way.  We didn't really kind of think it could be any other way.  And later, in later years, we learned that that was not the way things were supposed to be.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any teachers, and where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to grade school in, in Texarkana, Arkansas at George Washington Carver Elementary School.  And I guess I started--I finished elementary school, it must have been in 1961, I believe, but that was all in Texarkana, Ark--Texarkana also.  Again, segregated elementary school, and I do remember that our facilities were always less adequate than the ones at--on the other side of town.  I do remember that.  And ironically, now, the schools, the Booker T. Washington High School and Arkansas High School are now one high school.  And a few years ago, about five or six years ago, I was honored at Arkansas High School, which is what it's called now, as one of the outstanding graduates of, of, of the high school.  And what they did was, because--it didn't matter whether you were Booker T. or Arkansas High, they were honoring people.  So they would honor three or four people a year.  And a few years ago, I was one of the one's honored by the school at the building that I passed by that I couldn't go to school to.  That was rewarding.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any teachers that particularly stand out as mentors to you or inspirations to you when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Yes, Elwood Shannon was a teacher who was, he was an English teacher and he was a 4-H Club leader.  And Elwood Shannon was someone we always looked up to because we knew that he would always keep us on the straight and narrow.  And he cared about us.  If we didn't do something in school that was right, he would let our parents know or our grandparents know.  And he would work hard day and night and would always be concerned about you and encouraging all of us to go on to college--he wanted everyone to go on to college.  He didn't want you to stay and work.  Some, some people would say, well, I can't afford it.  He'd say, yes, you can afford it.  So Elwood Shannon was someone that I looked up to.  Another person was Trickey Jones.  Trickey Jones was the football coach, but he was also a science teacher.  And the one thing I remember about Trickey Jones is he had a unique way of, of motivating you.  He had this strap which was his fan belt that--and, you would always know that if you didn't do right, you would get that fan belt.  And he called it tough love.  That was before tough love was, you know, was a, was a word that people knew about.  And so we would always be motivated.  But he cared about us.  He cared about us dearly, and those two, two men, I think had more influence on me in, at Booker T. Washington High School than anyone else.
Speaker 1: How would spell Trickey in Trickey Jones?
Speaker 2: T-R-I-C-K-E-Y.  His--actually, his name was Nathan, but they called him Trickey because he was a, he was a football coach, but also when he was playing football at the same high school, he would have all these trick passes and trick plays, so they started calling him Trickey, and that name stuck with him throughout his life, you know.
Story_ID: 11277
Speaker 1: What kind of a young person were you?  I mean what did you like to do and what did you--what, what moved you?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in younger years, basically, it was, it was around the farm [in Texarkana, Arkansas].  It was doing work there.  I, I spent a lot of my time there.  And I took a lot of responsibility as the second oldest person in the family.  And I didn't mind work.  I worked all the time.  My first job off the farm was working in a restaurant as a dishwasher.  And, and the, the restaurant was in Texarkana, Arkansas close to the train station.  And I remember that we would work long hours, and I think we were probably getting paid under the minimum wage at that time, but I always would work and save my money because I was thinking about going to, going to college.  I wanted to do better.  I didn't want to stay on, on that farm.  And so, so growing up was, was about work on the farm, late--in later years, working off the farm, and dreaming about going to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you have an example of someone else around you that had gone to college that you--?
Speaker 2: No, no one in my family had gone to college on either side of, of my family, my mother [Eva Nash] or my father [Jacob Nash, Jr.].  Now, there were teachers in town that had gone to college.  Those were the people I knew who were college graduates.  And so I knew that teaching seemed like a pretty good job, but I know they didn't make much.  I didn't know then, but they didn't make much money.  So those were the, were the individuals I looked up to as saying, hey, I really would like to get a college degree.  I wanted to be a social worker cause I wanted to help people.  That was my goal.  In fact, my major, my undergraduate major was sociology cause I wanted to be a social worker.  And that was my--part of my motivation for, for going to college.
Story_ID: 11278
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you said when you were in high school [at Booker T. Washington High School, Texarkana, Arkansas] you didn't get a chance really to participate in a lot of activities and so forth?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I didn't play any sports, no basketball, no football, no track, nothing.  I never did.  Again, I was back home working at the farm uptown, on the farm out in the country and I did a chance to--sometimes I would, you know, go to listen or, or, or in the, in the audience, you know, at a football game or something like that.  Occasionally, we got a chance to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you run for class office or anything or--?
Speaker 2: I never did run for class office, no.  I, I did not.  That took a lot of time, and, you know, again, you need to be around, participating in extra curricular activities.  And I did not do that.  I just studied--and I was, I was a fair student, wasn't a great student.  But I, I did, I did well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so when you were on the verge of graduation, did you--had you planned out your college--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had decided, I, in the, in the twelfth grade, that I wanted to go to AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural Mechanical and Normal College] in Pine Bluff, Arkansas [now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff] because a lot of my friends were going there, my close friends were going there.  So I applied, took the entrance examination and, and passed, and was admitted in September of 1965.  That was my first time away from, from home literally.  I think I had gone on a field trip to Little Rock, Arkansas when I was senior.  That was probably my first time out of town.  And the interesting thing about that field trip is when I went to the state capital, there was a cafeteria in the state capital.  And in 1965, at that time Orval Faubus was the governor.  And I could not eat lunch in the cafeteria at the Arkansas State Capitol in May of 1965.  But the ironic thing about that, in that same state capital a few years later, 1983, I was Governor [Bill] Clinton's senior economic advisor, sitting three doors down from the governor in that same state capital.  And I thought that was just an interesting twist on, on history.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.  So what did you do about college?  What did you--?
Speaker 2: I went to Pine Bluff, and I stayed--I had some relatives there in Pine Bluff who lived out of the city.  So I stayed with them which helped a lot on expenses.  So I didn't pay room and board.  And I decided I wanted to be a social worker.  So I decided my, my degree was gonna sociology.  And so entered in the program and four or five of my friends also entered.  And one of the earliest things I remember about it is, very frankly, it was sort of nice to be away from home.  And my aunts were elderly, and they sort of didn't--they were really easy going.  You know, they didn't say you got to be at this time or that kind of thing.  So I remember that, and that was nice, having some freedom.
Story_ID: 11279
Speaker 1: The other thing I remember is, early on a guy named Henry Wilkins who was a--who was a professor of local government [at Arkansas Agricultural Mechanical and Normal College, now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff], got us involved in a school board campaign in 1966, where we were taking people to the polls to vote, elderly people who didn't have transportation.  And the thing I liked about that is that many of these folks would not have been able to vote had we not driven them to the polls to vote in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  And I felt very good because we--the first election we were involved in, the candidate we were supporting won.  So that was my first taste of politics, like--and I'd never been involved in politics before.  And that was, that was as much of a learning experience as my work in sociology or local government in the classroom.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: 1966.
Speaker 2: '66 [1966], okay.  Now, this was the era of a lot of organizing, I don't know--in Mississippi and Alabama, in terms of voter registration and so forth.  SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was in, was working--did you work with SNCC at all in Arkansas?
Speaker 1: I did not work with SNCC.  SNCC was not as active in Arkansas as they were in Mississippi, Louisiana.  The NAACP [National Assocication for the Advancement of Colored People] in Arkansas was very active.  In fact, Daisy Bates who was the matriarch of the Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas] crisis in 1957 was still very active.  And I remember being a member of the NAACP and being involved in voter registration.  There were not a lot of sit-ins in, in Arkansas.  There were some in Pine Bluff, which we--which I participated in, but the NAACP was the, was the premiere civil rights organization in Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you volunteered with the NAACP?
Speaker 1: I was a--a member and a volunteer with the NAACP in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and in Texarkana, Arkansas.  There was one summer in Texarkana when, there's a, there's a large water park you called the Texarkana Dam, a large reservoir.  And we couldn't swim there.  And one summer the Texarkana NAACP, we organized a large group of people and we went out to the Texarkana Dam to swim on the beach.  And it was quite, it was quite a, an event.  I did not get arrested, but several of my relatives got arrested.  And the people who were at the beach got out of the water when we got in, and the police came and arrested many of us.  And that, to me, was sort of another taste of, of trying to change the system back in my hometown during the summer.  And I believe that this was 19--the summer of 1967.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's--was there any violence associated with this takeover?
Speaker 1: No one got shot or anything, but one of the things that I remember happening is that the men and women who were in the water, who got out once we got in--and this is the craziest thing in the world, they took broken bottles--they took bottles and broke bottles along the beach after we were in the water.  And several people got their, got their, their feet cut as when, as they were, as they were walking out.  That's really about the only thing.  That's the most--the worst thing that happened that day, but no one was shot or, or cut by anyone with a knife or anything, but several, several of them did--I did not, several people did get cut on this broken glass.  But it was silly because, you know, they had to come back to that beach.
Story_ID: 11280
Speaker 1: Tell us about the University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.  What, it's a state-supported black school, right?
Speaker 2: It's called an--1890 school, state-supported, land grant school.  It was, the full title was [Arkansas] Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal [College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And the school graduated the majority of African Americans in Arkansas for, I think it started, I want to say in like eighteen--well, I guess it was 1860--1890 is when it started.  And there were about 4,000 students there, all black.  The teachers were paid less than the teachers at other colleges and universities in the, in the system.  And it was stand-alone school.  It was not a part of the University of Arkansas system.  But we had instructors who cared about us.  They challenged us, they worked us hard, and the graduation rate was very high.  And people would go on to be teachers or go work in--some people started breaking into the private sector because in Arkansas, not many of the companies would hire African Americans then in any kind of job, other than manual labor.  But I enjoyed the school.  It was always very active.  And they, they didn't mind us getting involved in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] activities or in local board or city council races.  And I, I, I did, like I said, I did fairly well.  And, and then we also had a chance to work out in the community with, with elderly or with young kids.  That was a part of our, of our academic work.
Story_ID: 11281
Speaker 1: You're talking about Texarkana College [Texarkana, Texas].
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I graduated from high school, I decided I want to go to AM&N College in Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural Mechanical and Normal College, now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff].  And one of the reasons was, was because my friends were going there, as I mentioned earlier.  But I couldn't go to Texarkana College because they would only let a few of us in, and in 1965, I think there were about four or five light-skinned African Americans who were, were, who could go to Texarkana College.  And, and that was fine because, again, wanted of us wanted to go to AM&N College anyway, where most of the African Americans went.
Speaker 1: Was there a sort of light-skinned bias at that school or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) I mean, you know, it--there was.  I mean it's just--it was, it was a fact of life, and I didn't think about it back then, but when I look back, I, I--actually, well, we actually did know it.  But I didn't think, quite think a lot about it.  But that changed in later years, but absolutely, that was the case.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Does it still exists?
Speaker 2: The college still exists, but, you know, obviously the system has changed 180 percent now.  It's fine.  It's, it's--now that they've got African American professors and the whole nine yards, yeah.
Story_ID: 11282
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your major in school?
Speaker 2: My major in, at AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff] was sociology, and I, and I minored in local government.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, were there any teachers there that particularly stand out as inspirational to you?
Speaker 2: Henry Wilkins, who was a local government professor who got us involved in local politics.  And he was also a, late--in later years, he became a state legislator, his wife is now a state senator.  His son is a state representative.  So they had, they had a long history in politics.  And I would say that he probably was the biggest influence on me in terms of getting involved in politics because I've spent the last twenty years of my life at the, either the local, state or federal level involving politics and government and policy.  And Henry Wilkins was the major influence on that, starting in 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, anybody else?
Speaker 2: At AM&N College, I would have to say Lawrence Davis, who was the president of the college.  Lawrence Davis was the president of AM&N College for about thirty-five or forty years.  And he was president of that college when they got the short end of the stick on any and everything, whether it be appropriations, facilities, buildings, money, you name it.  But he still made that college work and produced some people that are now, you know, leaders all over the country.  So Lawrence Davis, in fact, his son is currently the president of that same college.  The name today is the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff because it is a part of the University of Arkansas system.  But Lawrence Davis was the kind of guy who would try to figure out a way for you to go to school. If you were from Dermott, Arkansas or Dumas [Arkansas] or Hot Springs [Arkansas] or Texarkana [Arkansas], and you didn't have enough money, he would try to find a way to let you come and let you pay on time and--there were some students who couldn't afford it.  But he had this can do attitude, and he wanted everybody that had a will, to go to college.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Okay, so were you involved in campus activities at the University of Pine Bluff?
Speaker 2: I did not--I did not join a fraternity.  The most I got involved in had to do with work out in the city, whether it be a local campaign or in some of sociology classes where we were out working in local human service agencies where we were volunteering or helping people, old people go to the grocery store, those kind of things.  So most of my activities were outside of college.  I didn't get involved in the student, student government.  And I was a member of the sociology club and the local government club and things like that.  But, but the thing I liked about both of those two clubs is that our work not only related to academics, but it relate to--it related to the community in and around Pine Bluff, which at that time was about 65 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have any--did you have much personal contact with Daisy Bates?
Speaker 2: I met Daisy Bates on several occasions because she was big in the NAACP [National Assocication for the Advancement of Colored People], and she was always an inspiration and motivation for us.  Interesting, interesting, my wife worked for Daisy Bates in later years.  Daisy Bates ran something called the 'Arkansas State Press', which was the black newspaper that was operating in the '50s [1950s] that was shut down because advertisers, white advertisers refused to advertise in her paper because she was involved in integration.  My wife actually was her, editor of her newspaper and later bought the newspaper and ran it for years, the 'Arkansas State Press'.  So Daisy Bates in later years, after I left AM&N College became a very personal friend of me--of mine and again, my wife worked for her and eventually bought her newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Anything else about the University of Arkansas, at Pine Bluff?
Speaker 2: That university, you know, has given me more than I think I could ever give them in return.  I would not have had an opportunity to work for the leader of the free world or to do anything I've done in my life without the base that was given me by AM&N College in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  So I'll, I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 11283
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do after graduation?  Did you graduate with honors or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I did not graduate with honors.  I graduated with a lot of perspiration (laughter).  I worked hard, but I went back to Texarkana [Arkansas], and I went to work for the State of Arkansas as an employment counselor, and my job was to go out and find unemployed, unskilled workers, and to put them in a training program and get them placed in a job.  So that was my job.  And I enjoyed it, and I couldn't find a social work job, but I felt like it was just as important to try to help people get, maintain a skill--I figured if they had the will to work, and if they could acquire the skill to work, we could find them a job.  And that's what I did.  And I did that for about, oh, a year and a half or so.  The interesting thing about that job is that I was one of four counselors.  And I had a better placement record, a better recruitment and placement record than all the other, the other three counselors, who at that time were white.  When our supervisor got a promotion to another job, I actually applied for the job of the supervisor, and was told at that time that I couldn't get the job, very frankly and bluntly, because you, you can't get it because you're black.  And these guys are not gonna work for you.  And I said, well, I got the best record, the best record of anybody.  I place more, I recruit more.  They said, I understand that, Bob, just, just wait.  We, we'll see.  And I didn't get the job.  And I decided then that I was going to leave and go and get me a degree, a masters degree.  And so I didn't go and sue and anything like that because I figured, well, if I do that, who knows what will happen.  You get ten dollars, and then you, and then you're labeled, you know.  So I said, I'm gonna go and get a masters degree.  So I left town and applied for a, a fellowship.  At the time, I was active in Texarkana also in something called the Model Cities program, which was another outreach program.
Speaker 1: LBJ [President Lyndon B. Johnson], yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and so what I would--what I did was, I was a member of something called the Sandflat Neighborhood Center Action Area.  And so I was involved in trying to get stop signs in the black neighborhood, trying to get streets done.  And so I had a lot of interaction with the city manager's office.  This is about the same time that I'm not getting this job that I know I deserve because, because I have the best record.
Story_ID: 11284
Speaker 1: And so at the time--the city manager [of Texarkana, Arkansas] at the time, along with Elwood Shannon, who's one of the people that helped me in early years, motivated me, encouraged me to apply for a fellowship to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  This was 1970.  At that time, there was one black city manager in the United States of America.  His name was Jim Johnson in Compton, California.  So the International City Management Association, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the [U.S.] Department of Housing and Urban Development decided that they were gonna try to recruit, train and recruit more African Americans to be city managers.  So I competed to win one of six scholarships at Howard University.  There were six at Howard and six at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.  So I won one of the six at Howard and left Texarkana to get my masters degree at Howard University in 1970.
Speaker 2: Well, how did you like Howard University?
Speaker 1: I loved it.  It was something that was--I thought it was a culture shock to get away from home to go from Texarkana to Pine Bluff [Arkansas], but to go to Washington, D.C., and then see all these people from like sixty different countries and to be in a metropolitan city where, at that time, there was a black mayor, Walter Washington was the mayor and a university with about seven or eight thousand students, activist students.  I mean people, they were, you know, wearing all the dashikis and all this.  This was back at that time.  And it was, it was phenomenal.  The professors were actually--I went to school at night because I was required to work during the day.  In fact, I worked in the office of Walter Washington as an intern, the mayor of Washington, D.C.  And I went to school at night.  So our professors were actually government officials during the day, but at night, they would come and teach graduate school.  So it was just a tremendous, a tremendous educational and learning experience for me.
Story_ID: 11285
Speaker 1: Now, that's something.  Now, how did you get the position of intern with Walter Washington?
Speaker 2: The, this internship program [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that was designed to train African Americans, twelve of them to be city managers, required that you serve an internship where you would work twenty-five to thirty hours a week.  The International City Management Association contacted local--the chief executive officers of local governments in and around Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Virginia, Arlington, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Fairfax, Virginia, Bowie, Maryland and one other one I can't remember.  So we were actually placed at very high levels, working with the, the heads of those governments.  And that was part of our--we got academic credit for it, but we did real work.  And that's how--and so, what happened is, there was a reception one evening where all the chief, all these chief executive officers and mayors together with six students.  And we interacted and had a little reception.  And then we put down our desires about where we wanted to go first, second and third.  And they put down who they wanted first, second and third.  And interestingly enough, I picked Washington, D.C. as my first choice, and they picked me as their first choice.  So I was selected, and that's how I got to the city--to the mayor's office.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.  So what was that like?  Now, Walter Washington was the first black mayor of Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: He was.  At that time, the mayor was not elected.  The mayor was appointed by the president.  Richard Nixon appointed the mayor and deputy mayor of Washington, D.C.  The deputy mayor was Graham Watt.  The mayor was Watt--was Walter Washington.  He was the first African American mayor of Washington, D.C.  And it was interesting because again, it was--to see all these folks in charge, you know, it was like, running everything.  And so I was an administrative assistant.  I just did whatever needed to be done.  I would follow them up to the [Capitol] Hill when they were testifying for new appropriations or I would go out into the city when they were meeting with community groups or I would attend cabinet meetings when they were having cabinet meetings.  I would write papers on youth programs.  I would write programs on community develop--community outreach.  I would sit in on budget hearings.  And it was won--I learned as much in that internship as I did in my academic work because it was real.  Most internships, many internships aren't really real, sort of put you in a corner.  But because this was--I entered at a, at a, at a high sponsorship level, they gave us real work to do.  So I enjoyed that.  I, I spent a year there.  After that, I wanted to get the experience of a smaller city.  So I moved the second year to Fairfax City, Virginia where I--which is a suburb of Washington, where I worked for the city manager.  And there, it's, it was, it's a bedroom community of Washington, D.C.  And I was the only African American in City Hall in Fairfax City, Virginia.  This was 1971.  I still lived in Washington and still went to school at Howard at night, but during the day I worked in Fairfax City, Virginia.  And very frankly, it was very interesting because I was warmly received.  I was given real work to do, and to this day, I keep up with some of the people I worked with out in Fairfax City, Virginia.
Story_ID: 11286
Speaker 1: Well, what did you do next [after earning a master's degree from Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I, after that I decided--again, the program was training you to be a city manager.  And so I interviewed, after graduation or close to graduation, I interviewed in Newport News, Virginia.  I interviewed in Clearwater, Florida.  I was offered a job--and several other places, I was offered a job in both those places, in Clearwater, Florida and Newport News, Virginia.  But at the same time, there was an organization in Washington called the National Training and Development Service that was about the business of training local government managers in how to do a better job of running local government.  They needed an administrative officer.  I wanted to stay in Washington.  So I interviewed there, and I was hired by a guy named Tom Fletcher.  So I stayed in Washington and went to work for the National Training and Development Service.  And one of the things that I was very happy about is that I had an opportunity to encourage local government all around the country to hire more African Americans in their cities and in some cases, county government, because I had had contact with so many people at Howard University, and the organization I worked with allowed me to have an influence on the curriculum to include diversity and affirmative action.  And that--I didn't know that when I went in, that I would have an opportunity to do that, but that was one of the most rewarding aspects of being the administrative officer for this organization in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Now, there're just a few cities, a select group of cities that have city managers, you know.  I know Dayton, Ohio, Nash--I think Nashville, Tennessee has some--
Speaker 2: Well, actually today, in 1970, as I said, there was one black city manager, Jim Johnson in Compton, California.  Today, there are probably several hundred, over a hundred at least, African American city managers.  Now, in the U.S., there are several thousand city managers.  They're not high profile because usually the mayor gets all the attention.  But there're actually several thousand city manager sin the U.S. today.
Speaker 1: Okay, a little more than I would have guessed.
Speaker 2: But I, I didn't go the city manager route.  I went, again, I didn't--I went the route of this National Training Organization.  And I stayed there for a little over a year.  And interesting, I got homesick.  And I wanted to go back to Arkansas.  And at that time, Governor Dale Bumpers was governor of Arkansas.  And he followed Winthrop Rockefeller, who was the first progressive governor in Arkansas.  I asked--I, I'd had, I had had contact with Dale Bumpers, and his chief of staff, Tom McRae.  So I said, I want to come back home.  This was 1974.  And so I went back home, and they hired me as director of state and local planning, where basically, what I did was to help local governments with things like housing and streets and water and sewer, by providing grants to these town.  And I went back to Little Rock, Arkansas and started work there in the Dale Bumpers administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 1974, were you--did you attend or were you a part of the National Black Political Assembly?  I think that was--?
Speaker 2: In Little Rock [Arkansas]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah--no.  I was not.  I, I do know about that event.  It was quite an event.  It was, it was televised nationwide, and there was a lot of activity.  I--now, I believe that I was still in Washington, D.C. when that occurred.  I think I got there--I think that happened in the summer of '74 [1974], I believe.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had the big one in Gary [Indiana] in '72 [1972], and then the next big one was Little Rock.
Speaker 2: In Little Rock.  I got there after that, but I do know about it; had some friends who participated in it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, just checking.
Speaker 2: I stayed there, and then Governor Bumpers went on to be Senator Bumpers.  And then David Pryor became governor, and I stayed there for a while longer.
Story_ID: 11287
Speaker 1: Then an interesting thing happened.  A friend of mine who was the chief of staff to [Arkansas Governor] Dale Bumpers, his name is Tom McRae, went to be president of the [Winthrop] Rockefeller Foundation.  Governor [Winthrop] Rockefeller came to Arkansas in the, in the '50s [1950s], fell in love with the state and moved there and became governor and--for two terms.  And when he died, he left a lot of his money for this foundation.  This gentleman who went to work for the--as president of the foundation, called me in state government and said, "Bob, you're doing a lot of progressive things in local government in economic development, community development, come work for me."  So I went to work for the Rockefeller Foundation as vice president.  And what we did was try to improve the quality of life for low and moderate income people in Arkansas by giving grants to colleges and universities and non-profit organizations and community groups for housing and agricultural cooperatives and community development corporations and employment and training corporations.  And that's what I did for seven years.  And I loved it, and it was one of the most rewarding and impactful jobs I've ever had.
Speaker 2: It's, it's interesting.  You seem to be following a path that's similar to that of Milton Davis, who founded this bank [ShoreBank Corporation].  You know, he went--he was sociologist.
Speaker 1: Milton Davis was a sociologist.  And he, Milton Davis, was one of the four founders of this bank, and, as you know, ShoreBank was started thirty years ago when the people who owned this bank decided they were gonna move it to the suburbs because the community changed from about 95 percent black to about 95 percent--I'm sorry, ninety-five percent white to about 95 percent black over a twenty-five or thirty year period.  And these folks said, we're gonna move this bank to the suburbs.  The Feds said you can't do it.  So Milton Davis and Jim [James] Fletcher and Ron Grzywinski and Mary Houghton said, we'll buy this bank, and we'll loan money to this neighborhood, make money and do good.  And they've been doing that for thirty years.  And that's where I am today, and where I'm very, very happy to do that.  But you're correct, my career, while I was involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and a lot of outreach activities, I always was trying to figure out other ways on the inside.  And for Milton Davis, it was inside the bank at that time.  For me, it was inside local government, inside state government, inside a foundation to try to make an impact in the community.  And that's, that's what, that's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, as we approach the '80s [1980s], what were you--you were doing the development work?
Speaker 1: I started work with the foundation in nineteen, in about 1976.  And I worked for the foundation from 1976 up until about 1982.  It was very rewarding.  One of the things I remember about the foundation work is I got really involved in this whole issue of black land loss.  You know, in the 1960s African Americans in this country owned about twenty million acres of land.  In nineteen--in the late '70s [1970s], that twenty million acres had gotten down to about six million acres.  And a lot of that land was lost by things like unfair tax sales, partition sales, adverse position, unfair foreclosures, and we were--things I was proudest of is the work we did at the foundation to try to help families who had lost or were in the process of losing their land to keep it.  So we hired lawyers.  We did training programs on teaching people how to do wills.  We helped capture land that was in the process of being foreclosed on, and, and I was very proud of that, of that work that we did.  And because of that work, hundreds and hundreds of people who owned land in, in Arkansas, now have their land.  And I know for a fact that there are people all over this country who have a story to tell about a relative, an uncle, an aunt, a grandfather, mother, father, who lost land for some reason they just didn't quite understand.  And that was one of the pieces of work that I was the proudest of at the Rockefeller Foundation.
Speaker 2: That's something that--yeah, that was a big issue, and I guess it still is.  Is that--?
Speaker 1: It still is a big issue.  In fact, when I went to be Under Secretary of Agriculture, while my work had mostly to do with rural development, I did get involved in a lot of the work having to do with trying to rectify past discrimination and to make sure that farmers who had been discriminated against, like my grandfather, were actually paid for, for, for discrimination that had been, that had been forced upon them while they were trying to make a living in crops.  And it's still a problem.  There's no silver bullet, there's no silver bullet to fix this problem, but we made a lot of progress under Mike Espy, when he was [U.S.] Secretary [of Agriculture] and I was Under Secretary.  And, but it's still a problem today.
Story_ID: 11288
Speaker 1: I caught the attention of Bill Clinton, who at the time was Governor [of Arkansas], when I was doing the work at the [Winthrop] Rockefeller Foundation.  We did a lot of work.  In addition to land loss, we helped small communities with low and moderate income housing projects.  We helped small farmers develop agriculture cooperatives so they could market their stuff, not on the side of the road, but selling to major grocery stores.  And we were focusing on small business and minority development at the foundation.  Well, this caught his eye, and he called me night at midnight at home, and said--I knew him because I had worked in a couple of his campaigns.  He said, "I want you to come to work for me."  I love my job at the foundation.  I said, "No, I don't want a job in state government."  And he said, "Well, come see me tomorrow."  And I did, and when I left there, I had accepted a job working for the governor at a reduced salary, twice the hours, and I loved it.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what was the position that you took on?
Speaker 1: The position Senior Executive Assistant for Economic Development on his staff.  What that--and this is the same state capital where I couldn't eat in the cafeteria in 1965.  In 1983, I joined his administration in that position.  And basically, what that involved was, in Arkansas, as in many southern states, the economic development strategy was to try to steal a plant or an industry from the North.  Say, we're in the South; we got cheap land, cheap energy, cheap water, no unions; come on down.  So you'd have these low wage, low skill industries that would move to the South, land in a cow pasture, stay four or five years, and then move on to Mexico.  What the governor wanted to do was to broaden and diversify the state's economic development policy; not just to try to steal an industry from another state, but how do you do more in the state to help the businesses who are there now to grow?  How do you spend more time and effort and money on minority business, women-owned business, small business, service-oriented business?  So what he wanted me to do was to help develop policies to encourage the support of that kind of business and not just this shotgun approach to economic development.  And that's what I did for him for seven years.  And we were very successful.  We created the first minority business program in the history of the State of Arkansas during that period of time.
Speaker 2: Now that takes us to, to nineteen--you were there seven--?
Speaker 1: I was there, I was there, I was there from 1983 until 1989.  In 1989, I got burnt out.  I was working sixteen, eighteen hours a day, six and sometimes seven days a week.  And I decided that I was going to leave because I just physically needed to go do something different.  And I told him.  He said, "Don't leave.  I need you to do something else."  So he asked me to go run the state bond finance department [Arkansas Development Finance Authority], which was under one of his cabinet heads.  And so I went to run this department, and the purpose of this department was to finance small businesses, manufacturing plants, also to build schools water systems, sewer systems, college and university buildings.  And so I ran the state bond finance department for--from 1989 until 1992.  And one of the things that we did, I was very proud of, is, we, for the first time, this department financed large, minority-owned businesses.  One example, is a company called ISOPLUS [owned by J. M. Products, Inc.], which is one of the large black hair care products company, located in North Little Rock, Arkansas.  And we financed one of their new plants, and they now sell products all over the world now.  And there were a lot of other examples of things like that.  But I ran it up until the president decided to run for president--the governor decided to run for president.  And I got involved in the campaign, worked all over the country.  And he won--when he won the election in 1992, we went to Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 11289
Speaker 1: Tell us about William Jefferson Clinton.  What was he like and what was it like being on the campaign trail with the Clinton campaign?
Speaker 2: You know, the first time I heard about Bill Clinton, some of my friends who were law school students in Fayetteville, Arkansas at the law school [University of Arkansas School of Law,], came to me and said, "There's this young white guy who's gonna be running for Attorney General, and we want you to--he's a friend of ours, and we want you to support him."  I said, "I've never heard of this guy.  Who is he, man?  What, what is the deal?"  And they said one thing to me, they said, "You know, Bob, when we were in law school, this guy, on his own time at his apartment at night tutored us, those of us who were having problems in law school to help us get through law school.  And he says if he wins the attorney general's race for the first time in the history of the State of Arkansas, he's going to hire black assistant attorney generals."  Well, to me, that was like different.  So I volunteered at his campaign when he ran for attorney general.  I didn't work in, in his--he won.  But I'm working for the [Winthrop] Rockefeller Foundation, but I volunteered.  The next time he ran for governor.  I supported him again.  This was 1979.  They were two-year terms at that time.  I worked in the campaign again.  I'm still working for the Rockefeller Foundation.  They were Republicans, but we separated politics, the foundation and politics.  So then he got beat in 1980.  He ran again in 1982 when I worked in the campaign.  And this guy was very progressive; brought African Americans into the attorney general's office, into the governor's office, put them on boards and commissions like no other governor had done before, including Dale Bumpers, including Winthrop Rockefeller, including David Pryor, even though they had done a good job.  Before them, there was nobody except maids and janitors.  When he ran again in 1982, as I said, I worked in his campaign.  He called me at home at midnight and asked me to come to work for him.  And we did a lot of good in the state.  When he decided to run for [U.S.] President, it shocked a lot of people because people in the country did not know him.  Who is this young guy from a small rural state?  What they did not know is that he is the most--the hardest working, smartest political strategist and a guy with a brain that is just phenomenal and a heart just as phenomenal.  So when he decided to run, no one thought he had a chance.  But we always knew.  In fact, we had t-shirts that said, "We always knew" that he was gonna be president.  And so during the campaign he would work longer and harder than anybody else.  No one worked harder than him.  He would always remember a name--what was always impressive to me was, he would walk into a room, and if you somebody who was stuffing envelopes or carrying out the trash or whatever, he'd always say thank you and remember their names.  And for the first time in I think any campaign in Arkansas or probably nationwide, there were African Americans and women's who were at--women who were at the table, sitting at the table debating and arguing and helping decide strategy.  And that to me was different.  And because he felt like he didn't see color.  If you were good, you were good; if you weren't, you weren't.  He didn't care what it was.  But he also had this, he also had this feeling that, that if you were African American, you hadn't had a chance, and he wanted to bring you in.  And you, you could, you, you would have the opportunity to show what you could do.  That's Bill Clinton.  That's the kind of guy he, he was then, and he is today.
Speaker 1: And so what was it like being on the campaign trail with him?
Speaker 2: It was tiring, it was stressful.  We would, some of--you know, we'd sleep like seven and eight to a room.  We didn't have as much money as, you know, a lot of the other candidates.  We were all over the country, but people were so excited.  One of the things that--that we enjoyed was when they saw this guy, he would connect with the crowd.  It's almost like, if he's talking to a crowd of 500 people, he had the ability to, to make sure that any individual in that crowd felt like he was talking to them.  That was important.  The next thing that happened is when he, when we went places, if you'll look, look back at some of the tapes, whenever he, whenever he traveled, there were always African Americans or women who were involved.  I mean you didn't go anywhere where you didn't have a campaign that looked like America.  And that's what it was about, and people appreciated that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, are there any good campaign stories, incidents that happened in the campaign that stick out, that you'll always remember?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, I think--let me think.  There was one time we were, we were, we were going, we were going to a meeting.  I want to say it was a big meeting of bankers.  And, and we were running a little late, and he saw some people under a, under a shed that looked like farmers or maintenance workers or something, about twenty of them.  And he wanted to stop.  And we said, Governor--cause he was running then, "Governor, Governor, we're gonna be late for the bankers' meeting."  And he said, "Listen, do you know what I'm gonna say to the bankers?"  And we said, yeah.  He said, "Do you know what the bankers are gonna say to me?"  We said, yeah, cause our lobbyist is all--have already been through.  He said, "Do you know what those people over there are thinking?"  We said, no.  He said, "That's why we're stopping over there."  He was smart enough to know that if you go over there, you're gonna learn more from those folks, who are everyday folks than you would from those bankers that we were go to.  And he was right.  Those kinds of instincts, I think, is what helped catapult him into being president of this country because people, the average everyday person connected with him.  He had that unique ability.
Speaker 1: There's a story I saw in a paper back in '92 [1992] about--tell me if there's any truth to this 'cause when I read it, it was, it was a New York paper.  It's about President Clinton coming to Harlem [New York] and speaking in a church and putting a plastic bag on his head like the guys that put the, the chemical stuff in their hair and making some kind of remark about that or something.  Do you remember anything about that?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't remember that.  What I do remember is on the campaign trail we were at--in fact, it was a church, I believe.  And it got to a point where we were gonna sing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing', the Negro National Anthem.  And we were singing and, and usually, you know, you might sing the first verse.  Well, in this case, the minister kept going.  We were singing the whole song.  Me, and a lot of the other campaign workers who are African American could not sing the other verses.  He sang every verse, loud.  And that was--we went back and learned it 'cause he knew it, and we didn't, the whole song.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always a phenomenon when that song is sung in large gathering.  People can sing that first verse, and then you see them and they trail off.--.
Speaker 2: You get beyond that, they start mouthing.
Speaker 1: They--yeah, right.
Speaker 2: He knows, he knows the song.
Speaker 1: He knew it all.
Speaker 2: He knew it all.  He, he was very sincere about that.  You know, after the campaign, we went to Washington [D.C.].  I went to, I went to Washington ten days after the campaign, and--in the transition.  And he asked me to go to work in the personnel office of the transition.  And the reason is I knew him; he knew me, and I knew people who were involved in this campaign, black, white, all over.  He said to me, "I want you to go to Washington in the next few days, and I want you to make sure that women, African Americans, Hispanics are adequately represented in this administration when we start staffing this administration."  And I went up there, and we worked seven days a week, eighteen, twenty hours a day between November the 17th, 1992 and January 20th when we took in, during the transition.  He cared about that.  And that's why, that's why you got an administration that looked like America.  During the campaign, he promised that.  He told the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], he said, "I'm gonna have an administration that looks like America."  You know, for year when the Republicans were in, it was always like the "rule of one."  The Republicans always had Bob Brown who was always there.  The Democrats had Lou Martin, you know, always there.  When we joined the administration, assistants to the president, we had, we killed the rule of one.  You had Thurgood Marshall [Jr.], assistant to the president; Minyon Moore, assistant to the president; Alexis Herman, who later became [U.S.] Secretary of Labor, assistant to the president; Bob Nash, assistant to the president and director of White House personnel.  You had Ben Johnson, head of the One America on Race office, and many others.  When you took that picture of African Americans in the White House, it was a lot of people, not just one.  It used, used to be said that when Bob Brown or Louie Martin wanted to meet with other African Americans in the White House, they had to meet with themselves.  When we had a meeting, there were a lot of people there, and they were capable, and they were competent, and they made a difference in that, in that administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, incidentally the bag story--somehow, he was able to pull that off--the way the story goes in this paper without offending anybody in the church (laughter).  Though I, you know, which is another strange kind of story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know that story.  I mean there were so many, there were so many things that were said during the campaign and even during the administration.  As you know, we went through a lot there.  And that was quite a learning experience for me.

Speaker 1: My first two years were at the, I went to the personnel office in the transition between November [1992] and January 20th [1993].  But then I went to the U.S., to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as Under Secretary of Agriculture, and spent a lot of time working on providing money and resources to the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, Indian reservations and at other poor places around the country, that in the past had been short shifted as it relates to basic services like housing and water and sewer and telephone.  So I spent two years doing that.  And then one night--he had this amazing ability to call you at home at night at midnight or one o'clock.  So he called me in 1995 at home and said, "I need you to come run the Personnel Office because it's, I've had--there were several sort of missteps at first."  The Zoe Baird story, the Lani Guinier, the Dr. [Vincent] Foster issue; said, "I want you to come over, and I want you to run this office and keep it out of trouble and, and make it--keep, keep making it look like America."  So I went over to the White House Personnel Office.  And I was the first--I'm sorry, the first African American male to run the White House Personnel Office in the history of the country.  I was the second African American because there was a lady who ran the office who was the first appointment who served there for about a year.  And I followed her.  I spent the next six years, up until January 20, 2001 at noon, running the White House Personnel Office.  And we ended having the most diverse administration in the history of the country, and I would argue, the most successful, given by any, any measurement of social and economic indicator you want to name; unemployment rate, poverty rate, housing starts, all those things.  We were--and I think it was because of the leadership of, that he displayed and because we had very capable, very competent and a very diverse administration.
Story_ID: 11291
Speaker 1: Tell us about the tough times in the White Hall 'cause I know, you know, here's this popular president basically, and, I mean it's, all of a sudden there's all of these investigations.  First it's Whitewater.
Speaker 2: Having worked for him for a number of years, I was involved and questioned about everything from, starting from Whitewater, where I went before the [U.S.] Senate committee, special prosecutor; also, as it relates, what they call the White House coffees, the issue with Monica Lewinsky, and all these things.  And, so those were very stressful times, but what I knew is this, I knew that I had never done anything wrong, and I didn't know of anybody else that had done anything wrong, including the president.  I did not know.  And so those were stressful times because we had to run the government and run the country, and at the same time, deal with these allegations that involved hours and hours of interviews and investigations and producing documents and, and working, you know, seven and eight hours a day just producing documents.  But one of things that I think I remembered in that is that he always stayed focused.  And he encouraged us to stay focused.  Do your job.  Respond to whatever these requests are, but you also, in addition to that, you had to do your job.  And so, and that's what we did.  And the thing about is African Americans--another thing about is African Americans were always involved, however tough it was or however easy it was, they were there.  You might remember Cheryl Mills, who was, who testified on the, on the floor in defense of the president, who was the deputy general counsel at the White House.  She was a key player there as well as other people in the administration.  We all were called to testify.  So, for me, growing up in Texarkana [Arkansas], sometimes I thought I would never get to the end of the cotton row.  And maybe I even dreamed about going to Washington, D.C. on a Greyhound bus.  But to have the opportunity to work for the leader of the free world, directly in Washington, D.C., was like a hundred dreams come true.  So all the stress and all the pressure, very frankly, was worth it.  And I would do it over again a hundred times.
Story_ID: 11292
Speaker 1: Did you work on the [Al] Gore [2000 presidential] campaign at all or did you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I spent some time in the Gore campaign, not as much--I did not leave the White House.  I stayed at my job, but what I would do on the weekends is, I would travel to speak to places all over the country where the Gore campaign, the Gore-Lieberman would ask me.  But I had made a decision that I was going to leave.  I did it because I wanted to see President Clinton's programs continued, and so I spent time on the Gore-Lieberman campaign.  I was--I knew he was gonna win.  I was convinced he was gonna win, and I was very disappointed in what happened because I felt like a lot of the programs that we had started might be rolled back.  Some of them have, and--but I was, I was very disappointed because we had worked so hard to put so many things in place.  And some of them won't--can't be changed, but again, I enjoyed the experience, and wanted Vice President Gore to win, think he would have made a great president.  And, but I had to get on with my life, which is why I decided to go to the private sector, but go to the private sector in a way where I could continue my, my mission-oriented career, but at the same time, do better than you can do financially in government.
Speaker 1: Just one, a couple more things about the Clinton campaign and where the Gore campaign, as it relates to the Clinton campaign, a lot of people have since analyzed the Gore campaign, and--well, even while he was running.  And they said he was really staying too far away from President Clinton, and that was a mistake.  Now, what would--do you have any--?
Speaker 2: Any thoughts on that?
Speaker 1: --any opinion about that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I do.  First of all, I will say this.  Each president has the right to run his or her campaign the way they want to.  That's the first thing I'll say.  Second, if I was managing Vice President Gore's campaign, I would have utilized the president in more places and more times than he did--than he did because I think it would have made a difference in this race.  But again, it was Vice President Gore's campaign, not mine, not Bill Clinton's.  There were a lot of us who wished that he had used the president more.  There are people in this country--in fact, all over this world who, who love Bill Clinton.  And there are people who don't like him.  But we're convinced that he had the ability to energize the base and energize people in this country who cared about continuing his progressive programs, whether it be about affirmative action, whether it be about lowering the deficit, whether it about--be about reducing the trade deficit, whether it be about putting more people to work, we all felt like, that those programs would have been best continued under Al Gore and Bill Clinton could have helped.  So again, but I, I can't--it was not Bill Clinton's campaign.  It was Al Gore's campaign.

Speaker 1: You hear it in popular culture all the time in the black community that Bill Clinton was the first black president, you know.  How do you feel about that and do you feel that there is--is the country closer to electing a black president than it was before?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, as it relates to Bill Clinton, and he's been called the first black president.  In fact, recently, he was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame as an honorary member into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame.  And, and, and that happened because people in Arkansas, African Americans, in particular, and for the first time in the history of the state, he bought--brought African Americans into the state in large, large numbers.  And no one, no one criticized him by saying that you recruited someone who was incompetent or unqualified.  And he did the same thing in, in the federal government.  And it was something that was just a natural for him.  He didn't have to figure out, what do I say if I'm around African Americans?  It sort of just flowed naturally without being what people, some people would call a Negro expert.  He didn't ever come across like that.  And I think what he did was, he set the tone in the administration so that you will never have this "rule of one" again, where--whether you're Republican or Democrat, where you've got one, a Bob Brown or a Louie Martin.  You look, even now, there are people in the current administration [of President George W. Bush], there, there are number of people--not as many as he had, but there are people who are there.  So I think those are the reasons he was, he's, he was called the first black president.  Now, are we closer to electing a black president?  Absolutely, we are.  Will it happen in my lifetime?  I don't know.  It could, I think it's possible.  You know, there've been rumors about Colin Powell who's a very capable, competent individual with a stellar career.  Yes, I do.  But I think people--the more people evaluate folks based upon what [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, the content of the character rather than the color of their skin, the more--the closer we will come to someone deciding that someone can be president regardless of their color.  So, yes I do.  I'm a, I'm an optimist about that.  Again, when I think about this [Arkansas] State Capitol and the number of years it took for me to, to not eat in the cafeteria to sit three doors down from the governor, it can happen.  It, it'll happen.
Story_ID: 11294
Speaker 1: What did you do after, after 2000?
Speaker 2: After, after 2000, after January 20, 2001, at noon, which was, which was when I drove out of the White House actually before that, had started looking around for something to do.  And I decided that after over twenty years with local government, state government, foundations and the federal government, that I was going in the private sector to try to, you know, make a living.  My kid--I was fortunate enough, my two kids were out of--my daughter's [Creshelle Nash] a physician in Little Rock, Arkansas at the University of Arkansas Hospital.  My son [Eric Nash] is a real estate developer in Little Rock.  So I was fortunate that they were off my payroll.  And so my wife [Janis Kearney] and I decided that we would try to work in the private sector.  My wife is a writer.  She's writing a book on Bill Clinton, about his relationship with the black community.  She's also writing a book on her family.  My wife has eighteen brothers and sisters.  Her mother and father were sharecroppers.  Eighteen of the nineteen of them are college graduates, and nine of them are lawyers from Harvard, Yale, Vanderbilt law schools.  So she's writing a book about her family.  So that's what she does.
Speaker 1: Just in brief, how do you think they did it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It was amazing.  They believed in education and church, God.  Their--her mother and father were both uneducated, I think the fifth grade and the seventh grade.  Her father's still living.  He's ninety-eight years old.  Her mother died about ten years ago, and they were sharecroppers.  And they believed in education and God and church.  And that's how they did it basically.  No twins, no triplets.  They're all living except one.  They live from Johannesburg, South Africa to Los Angeles [California].  Anyway, she's doing that work.  So I decided I was gonna go to work in the private sector, but I wanted to--because I wanted to make a better living and also do good.  So I came to work for ShoreBank Corporation, which is the largest community development bank in the country.  It started thirty years, and basically, what we do is we make loans in the African American community on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], the West Side of Chicago, the East Side of Detroit [Michigan], the East Side of Cleveland [Ohio].  We have a bank in Portland, Oregon, which is a environmental bank, and basically, what we do, is we loan money for small businesses, for people who want to buy apartments, who want to buy single-family homes.  We loan money to churches.  We've loaned money to 800 churches, for church buildings, for housing projects and things like that.  And we do good and we do well; good, in that we're investing in the community and well, in that we are, we make a, a very competitive profit at this bank.  And we've been doing it for thirty years.  And that's why I'm very happy to be here.  So I'm a part of the management team of this bank.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's--yeah, ShoreBank was, I believe the first development in the country.
Speaker 2: It was the first, it was the first, and it is today the largest development bank.  In fact, today there are about forty other develop--they call them community development bank, in this country.  In fact, Bill Clinton, when he was Governor [of Arkansas], patterned federal legislation after this bank to, to, to pass legislation to invest in other banks that wanted to become community development banks.  And he studied this model for, for doing that program.  And that's what I do here now.  And so we, we're hoping--I think that banking will take more and more of the model that we have, which is high touch, relationship oriented, peeling the onion back a few more layers to find good loans.  We don't make bad loans.  We spend time, more time than some others might do to find good loans.  And we invest in people.  And we work with them.  We don't do things for them.  We do things with them.  That's the culture of Shorebank.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us a good story of a loan that really profited the individual and the community?
Speaker 2: Yes, there's a gentleman here in South Shore who--I won't call his name because we're not supposed to call customers' names, but I'll make this point, it'll communicate to you.  He was a maintenance man, and he wanted a nice place to stay.  And, 'cause where he was staying, he was paying a lot of rent and the landlord didn't keep the place up.  He was in, like a three flat.  He came here and said, "I'm a good maintenance man.  I found a building, but I don't have the money to, to buy it, put down on it."  But people looked at him, and they believed in him and looked at his work record.  They loaned him money to buy a three flat.  He lived in one part of it, fixed the other two, two flats up and rented it out.  That was about fifteen years ago.  Today this man is a multimillionaire.  He owns about twenty large apartment buildings, and they're all very, very nice, landscaped, fence around them, painted, fixed up.  In the basement, they've got daycare centers.  He hires a lot of people from the neighborhood, and, and that's because this bank believed in this guy.  He had no collateral.  But he walked in--he had a good work record, and he had a good credit record.  And, and there are, there are stories like that all over the South Side and West Side.  That's what ShoreBank's about.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Has there been an aspect of this job that's difficult at all for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's, it's harder--community development banking is harder than what I would call "regular" banking because if you--a regular bank says, well, you know, we loan money, and wherever people need it, and, and they can, and we think they can pay it back.  What we do is, we invest in the toughest part of town.  If someone said to ShoreBank, "We want you to move all your banking operations, all your lending, all your investment downtown in the Chicago loop and make all your loans there.  You'll double your salary, double your return on the equity, double your profit, would you do it?"  The answer is no.  We would not move.  And most other banks would.  The reason is, we're committed to mission.  But at the same time, it's hard because you're dealing in some cases, where you've got to look harder and sort of understand why somebody might have a, a collection on their credit record.  And you peel the onion back, and you realize that that was a medical bill because the person didn't have a major--didn't have major medical insurance.  And the rest of their record looks good.  And you say, well, you know, that was just a blip in their record.  So when you have to--it's hard, you have to figure those things out to find the good in a loan or an investment.  And that's an example of how it's just tough, but we've been very successful at it.  And we expect to be around another thirty years.
Story_ID: 11295
Speaker 1: Let's start with the definition of a community development bank.  Is it a legal definition or it's about mission statement or what is it?  I mean what is a community development bank?
Speaker 2: A community development bank is a bank that is in existence to do two things.  One, to make money.  Banks cannot stay in existence and won't be allowed to stay in existence unless they're run in a safe, sound manner.  But at the same time, a community development bank has a mission to invest in the neediest areas of the community.  So what you will find is many community development banks will be in area where you have low and moderate income individuals who live there, where the median income--median income is lower than it is in other parts of the city.  So in our case, we spend most of our en--effort and time and energy and money on the South side and the West side.  It doesn't mean that we might make a loan in the loop, but we don't go after them.  So it is a, it is a mission statement, but at the same time, we're--we, we have to follow the same regulatory requirements from the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] and the Federal Reserve and the state bank examiners as other large banks.  Now, the [U.S.] Treasury Department has a legal definition because they will invest, they will buy stock in banks that say that they want to invest in the community.  And so they have a legal definition.  So you have to submit reports to say where you make your loans and who they're being made to and this kind of thing.  So that's a community development, that's a community development bank.
Speaker 1: So the federal government subsidizes your activities on a level by buying bonds--stock--bonds?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't use the word subsidize.  They buy our stock.
Speaker 1: Stock, okay.
Speaker 2: They own stock.  They have a return.  They own a--this bank is owned by, not by a few individuals who are looking for the highest and best return, highest and best.  It's owned by foundations like the [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation.  It's owned by church groups like the Catholics and Lutherans.  It's owned by--large banks also own stock in this bank.  The reason large banks own stock in this bank is because we do so much investment in the community that they get credit under what they call the Community Reinvestment Act.  We do way more than we need to do, given our size.  The fact that they own some of our stock, they get a return.  It's a fair return, but it's not--they could make more money going other places.  But they invest in us because we--of what we do.  Let me tell you the other thing and one other interesting point, is that in 1977 when the Community Reinvestment Act was being considered by, by the Senate Banking Committee, the only bank in the United States of America that testified in support of the Community Reinvestment Act was ShoreBank [Corporation] and Ron [Ronald] Grzywinski who's the chairman of the bank, and supported by Milton Davis, African American and Jim Fletcher, African American, and Mary Houghton, the other member, the other founding member of ShoreBank.  So that's what a community development bank is.  One other aspect of our institution is that we have people from all over the United States of America who buy certificates of--who deposit money in this bank to buy certificates of deposits or who have a money market or who have a checking account.  And the reason they do this, is because they believe in our mission.  So they would put their money here because they know we're gonna take that money, and we're gonna invest it small business and we're gonna invest in housing, and we're gonna invest in daycare centers, and we're gonna invest in churches in the neediest parts of the city.  So people from all over the United States of America through our development deposit program, where they say, we'll put a hundred thousand dollars CD in your bank 'cause we know it's safe, it's sound.  I'm gonna get paid a competitive interest rate.  Oh, and by the way, we're gonna be investing on the South Side and the West Side, in Detroit [Michigan], in Chicago [Illinois] and Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 11296
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today.  And we may say black communities since you're involved in so many.
Speaker 2: I am, am an optimist, first of all.  And I believe that we have made a tremendous amount of progress in this country, and we'll make a tremendous amount more in the years to come.  I think that, particularly, young, African American black males are offered the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity in this country.  And I believe that education is the way up and out for the majority of them.  So I think what we have to do in this country, as individuals and as institutions, including this bank--for an example.  We have made a commitment of eight million dollars to fund scholarships for students in our neighborhoods, primarily African American, but also other students who want to go to college.  That's our commitment to education.  I serve on the local school committee here in, in the South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].  Our, our bankers go to classes and teach banking and personal finance.  We have financial literature courses that we teach to young people whether in churches or in schools.  So we have a tremendous commitment to education in young folks.  And I think African American males in particular offer an opportunity to help improve, not only their own quality of lives, but the quality of life of the community.  And that's why we spend a lot of time, other than banking, on education, whether it be our scholarship program or our own personal time and energy.  And I think when that happens, and I think it will happen, because more and more when we look, when, when projects like the HistoryMakers and people see that people who have made history, many of them, most of them are educated and can pay back and help themselves as well, when they see programs like this, I think it's gonna serve as a motivation to more and more and more young African American males and females in this country.  And I think it will also show people who are not of color that there are people who have achieved great things in this country and, and they will also be well--be educated to that and attuned to that and acclimated to the fact that you've got to judge people by what they can do and not what color their skin is.
Story_ID: 11297
Speaker 1: At this juncture in your life, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would say that for the last, over twenty years, I've spent my time on the government side trying to show that government policy and programs can work for everybody and can reach out to people who have been left behind like my grandfather, years ago, by Farmers Home or by state government prior to these young progressive governors coming in and bringing in African Americans and women and other people of color, to get in there and help make those programs work for people, to get them jobs and training and education and businesses.  And over my life, I feel good that I've got friends and communities that I, that I feel like I've made a difference in their lives, not because I was smart or anything, because I was, I was given the, the responsibility.  I, I, I've been given a lot by having the opportunity to be raised by a great family and be educated and so I felt like it was important to give back.  And I've done that on the government side, and, and I'm now doing it on the private side.  And I would like to do that for the rest of my life, to help bring people who are outside the mainstream into the mainstream so they can be productive citizens, whether they be women, blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asian, gay, lesbian, you name it.  Everybody needs an opportunity to, to, to produce and to contribute.  And I think that's what I've been able to do in Arkansas, in Washington, D.C. and around the country.
Story_ID: 11298
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about running for political office yourself?
Speaker 2: I have.  I've thought about it.  I really enjoy working for, for elected officials.  I've had the opportunity to work for Walter Washington and for Dale Bumpers and Bill Clinton and David Pryor and all, I think, progressive politicians.  And they have inspired me several times to run.  I never have.  I might do it one day before I'm finished with, with productive life.  I believe it's a high, it's, it's a high calling.  It's a special responsibility, and you've got to have people out there to do it.  And, and I feel like I can--because of my commitment and my experience that I could, I, I would do a good job.  And who knows?  It may happen one day.
Story_ID: 11299
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently, looking back?
Speaker 2: I can't think of a thing that I would do differently in my life, except more of what I've done.  I've been very happy.  I've been very fortunate, and I'm very thankful for everything that's been done for me by people I've worked for and I've worked with, and that's inspired me and will continue to, to inspire me for the years to come.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who was unselfish, who always tried to find a way to help somebody else, who always tried to find a way to make a friend, rather than an enemy, who always tried to find a way to do good, rather than bad, and who had an attitude of being an eternal optimist in trying to make, to make good things happen.  And I, I--maybe I can paraphrase the words of a great African king said, "Our work and deeds are for some who are dead, a few who are living and many more yet unborn."
