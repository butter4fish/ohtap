Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.

Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good one.
Story_ID: 95407
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's side, but separately, and then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Margaret Gretchen Drew and Davidson.  So, and Drew is her maiden name, Davidson, her married name.  M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, Gretchen, G-R-E-T-C-H-E-N, Drew, D-R-E-W, and Davidson, D-A-V-I-D-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 18, let's see, November 18th, 1918 in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  Where did they originate?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, not very far.  Really, only to Chicago.  I know she, as a child she lived a little bit in New Jersey, spent some childhood days in Grand Haven, Michigan which is how I happened to go back there in the summers some time.  And then she was in Detroit [Michigan] by the time she graduated from high school and for a few years before that.  So really, that's about as, you know, as far back as I can go on my mom's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what--did you know her parents?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother.  In fact, that's her picture, I can show you a picture of her up there later, my grandmother.  My grandfather on that side died when I was, I think I was maybe four.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Pansie, (ph.) Pansie Drew.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Richard Drew.
Speaker 1: And, now, did they live in Grand Haven before Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: They, no, I think they lived in Grand Haven after Chicago, and then they lived in Detroit, you know, in their later years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your--now, is there a--can you go back any further than your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't know anything about your grandfather's parents or your grandmother's parents?
Speaker 2: No, un-un.
Speaker 1: Or where they came from--
Speaker 2: No, never heard anything on that side.
Speaker 1: Or if they have an origin in the South or anywhere like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they probably do (laughter), but I don't know.  I just don't know anything about, beyond my grandparents.  I don't know of anything now (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know because he died when I was so young.  I don't know what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't think my grandmother, as far as I know, all the years I knew my grandmother 'cause she didn't die until I was a young man.  But I always knew her just to be a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she didn't have to have a job or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, she might have, but I never knew.  If she did, it was--all of the years that I knew her from a child growing up, she was just a homemaker, and she often took care of me and my cousins.  But I don't know of any work outside the home she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, well--are there any stories from your grandparents that are passed down about life in Chicago--now, did they live on the South side of Chicago, the West, do you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know where they lived in Chicago.  Well, I guess, you know, 'cause I'm not sure if they lived in Chicago very long either.  I'm not sure how long they lived there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do think it was on the South side.  But I don't recall which neighborhood on the South side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95408
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: So did your mother [Margaret Drew Davidson] actually grow up in Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 1: Well, she was born there.
Speaker 2: Okay,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But I don't think she lived there a long time because I know she went to elementary school in Grand Haven [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I know she went to high school in Detroit [Michigan].  So I don't know at what age she actually left Chicago, but I think she was pretty young.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, there are--and I do have, I mean I remember some things about her childhood, from what she told me about growing up in Grand Haven.  And then, and a little bit about growing up in Detroit, you know, things--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --like, well, in Grand Haven, Grand Haven is a lovely, small beach town on Lake Michigan.  And they're very few black people there, even now.  So her family was one of the few.  And I recall her talking about--there's a lighthouse that sticks out into Lake Michigan.  And I recall her talking about diving off of the lighthouse, you know, climbing up the lighthouse and diving into the lake.  And, you know, her--I don't think she did, but her brothers would go skiing around there.  And I recall her, you know, talking about taking ballet lessons and I think she went to Northern High School in Detroit.  And so I know a little bit more about her youth in Michigan, but not so much in Chicago, well, nothing about Chicago, really.
Speaker 2: Okay, so she went to Northern High School in Detroit?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So did she have any--did she talk about what her aspirations were in school?  I mean did--
Speaker 1: Well, no, I remember she was, I remember my grandmother saying she was a very good student.  But she didn't go to college, I think for financial reasons.  And she worked as a, she worked for Wayne County in Detroit, basically for all her working life that I know about.  And she worked as a, kind of like a bookkeeper, did accounting, kind of work for the County.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, are there any interesting stories about your mother's upbringing in Detroit, things that she--
Speaker 1: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --what it was like, prior to World War II, you know, basically, pre-World War II conditions in Detroit, 'cause she must have been there when they had the big riot in 1943?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  And I do recall them, I do recall some stories about the riot and about, what was this doctor's name?  There was a doctor whose house was basically attacked--
Speaker 2: Right, right, I know exactly who he is and I can't think of his name either right now.   Doctor--
Speaker 1: And, so I recall them talking about that, not so much that they were there.  I mean I don't think either my mother or father were there at the time, but I do recall them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Dr. [Ossian] Sweet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Sweet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I do recall them talking about that.
Story_ID: 95409
Speaker 1: And, you know, I have a picture of my mother [Margaret Drew Davidson] and father--it's right at the bottom of the stairwell here, staircase, along with my aunt and uncle that was taken at a club in Detroit.  And you can see how dressed up they are.  And it was like they were, you know, just out for a night on the town.  And--
Speaker 2: I think the name is Club 666 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly (laughter).
Speaker 2: Which is, you know, a biblical mark of the beast--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I don't know why they named it that.
Speaker 2: I guess it's to emphasize that you're gonna--a lot of dangerous things, you know, or this is serious nightlife rather than--
Speaker 1: Right, maybe (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --it's not church.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.  But, you know, one time--when I go back to Detroit, I like to go back over Labor Day because like Chicago, that's when Detroit has a Jazz Festival.  And it's a big outdoor Jazz Festival.  It's great, and they also have, you know, people talking about the history of the music.  And one of 'em, I went to one of those sessions, and they were talking about, you know, the Club 666, along with other clubs.  And so I guess this was a pretty nice spot, and it's, and, you know, particularly, you know, for black Detroiters at a time where, you know, even Northern cities were still really segregated, if not by law then by--in fact.  And so, and I know that mom liked to dress up.  She made clothes and, and, you know, so even when I was kid, I remember my mom and dad going out to fancy things with, you know, a tuxedo.  Like my father owned a tuxedo.  He was a bus driver.  And I've never thought about buying a tuxedo.  But he owned a tuxedo, and they would get dressed up and go out.  And so I imagine, before I was around, they probably did a lot more of it (laughter).
Story_ID: 95410
Speaker 1: But in terms of just stories about her [his mother, Margaret Drew Davidson] growing up, it's, you know, I just recall her saying things like how she took ballet lessons or how she, you know, she liked to swim and would go, like I said, diving into Lake Michigan off of the lighthouse and things like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did she, so as far as you know, she didn't--did she ever share an aspiration that she had that she didn't fulfill like, I mean that she wanted to go to college for, and couldn't do--
Speaker 1: No, I only recall her talking about having done some, I think some sort of like cosmetology work or training.  But I never heard her say anything like, you know, I wish I could have been a lawyer or a doctor or anything along those lines or what she might have taken in college.
Speaker 2: Now, was she from a large family?  Did she have--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were seven kids in the family.
Speaker 2: Okay, and did any of the rest of 'em go to school?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  Yeah, I think some of them did go to college.  I'm not sure just how many though.  I think my aunt, like went to Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] for a while.  I don't know that she graduated.  I don't know that any of 'em--I don't, I can't say that any of 'em graduated from college.  I think probably, at least a couple of 'em went to college, but I don't know that any of 'em graduated from college.
Story_ID: 95411
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Just, and, all right, well, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's--well, it's the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, Joe--Joseph Taylor Davidson, Sr.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He, his date of birth is May 27th, 1912 in Homer, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, Homer, Louisiana.  Now, did he grow up there too?
Speaker 2: He grew up some in Louisiana, but I'm not sure when he left.  I know he graduated from high school in Hot Springs, Arkansas.  So when they exactly moved from Louisiana to Arkansas, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure how old he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hot Springs, Arkansas.  That's where President [Bill] Clinton is from, near there or--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he spent some time there.  He's actually, I think from Hope, but he did, I think he did live in Hot Springs for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how far back can you go on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I talked with my grandfather one time, and if I recall correctly, I think he, I think he told me that his father--I guess it would be my great grandfather, I think was a slave in Georgia.  And I think that's the slave owner's name, if I recall correctly.  It goes back a long time.  I'm trying to remember this.  But I think the slave owner's sir name was Davidson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I do recall that my grandfather talked about, you know, driving a wagon, I think, in some oil fields in the South.  And then he--but he, until he retired, he worked as an elevator operator in one of the big hotels in Hot Springs, which is a resort town.  They have a lot of--well, they call it Hot Springs, and they--you can literally see some hot springs bubbling out of the ground there.  And they sell, you know, a lot of bottled water.  And people go there for the baths.  And so, he worked as an elevator operator in one of the big hotels.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Judge, just like a court judge.
Speaker 1: Judge Davidson?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I wonder if they belong to a Judge Davidson at one time, you know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Possibly, (unclear) (simultaneous), possibly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting.  And do you know your great grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Her name was Rochelle Davidson.  And I don't really know much about her background.  She died when I was just a kid.  And I just--she was a tall, thin woman.  But I really don't know, really don't know much about her background at all.
Story_ID: 95412
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, so your father [Joseph Davidson, Sr.] finished high school in Hot Springs [Arkansas].  Did he have any stories about growing up he shared with you?
Speaker 2: Well, let me think.  No, I guess I just recall him talking about doing things like playing with other kids and I think he was born in Homer [Louisiana].  But I think he spent some time in his childhood in Mendon, Louisiana.  And so I remember just him, you know, talking about playing with some kids there.  But nothing stands out in particular.  I think that, I think in high school, I think he was--I think he would give speeches.  He talked about being an orator sometime.  So I guess in high school, he would give speeches.  He went to Philander Smith College, I think, for maybe two years.  That's in Little Rock [Arkansas].  I don't know what he took though.  I don't know, I don't know what he majored in or what he hoped to do had he graduated from college.  But he did have a year or two at least at Philander Smith.  Let me think.  Yeah, I guess I don't recall any good specific stories.  They'll probably come back to me after you leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, did he serve in World War II?
Speaker 2: No, he said he had, they rejected him because of his--had flat feet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a--did your--I suppose your parents met in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: So I'm thinking--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, as far as I know.
Speaker 1: --so is there a story about--what were the circumstances that led him to move to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Oh, just part of the migration, the black migration from the South.  He just came to Detroit for a better job, better opportunities, moving North.  I don't know why specifically Detroit.  I did have an aunt in Detroit, but I don't know who got there first.  So probably one followed the other.  I'm just not sure who was there first.  And he was a bus driver, and I think he was, I'm not sure if he had any work before that, but certainly, for all of my life--and I was born in '49' [1949], he was a bus driver in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so did he--so he went to Philander Smith [College] for a couple years after high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So that'd make him probably about 20.  Now, did he--is that when he came to Detroit?
Speaker 2: I think he was in his twenties.  I don't know the exact age, but I think it was in the twenties--in his twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that'd been in the 1930's, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I guess, if he was born in 1912, and he was 20, that would '32 [1932].  It seemed like, I had the impression it was after that.  But I can't say for sure.  I can't say for sure when he got to Detroit.
Speaker 1: You think it was closer to the War period?
Speaker 2: I have the impression it was closer to the War [World War II] period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So maybe he was in his late twenties.
Story_ID: 95413
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, is there a story about how your parents [Margaret Drew Davidson and Joseph Davidson, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I never heard that story, so I don't know (laughter), probably is.  Yeah, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But they--do you know when they got married?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, I think they, I think they eloped to somewhere like Indiana, somewhere in Indiana.  I think that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a reason for them having to get married in Indiana?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause your mother didn't have a father around with a shot gun or anything, so--
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: --or any of that kind of thing.  So,--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know, I don't know why they did that, but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they got married in Indiana.  And so, do you have older siblings?
Speaker 2: Only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were born in 1949.  So--
Speaker 2: But I do know that I had a, I guess I had a sister, but I think she was stillborn.  And that was something that my mom never talked about, but I was just going through some papers one day and found the birth certificate.  But, yeah, but, no, I was an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 95414
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' [Margaret Drew Davidson and Joseph Davidson, Sr.] personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, their--how they walk, talk, their opinions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, that's an interesting question.  I guess, I guess in some ways maybe my mom, not in all aspects.  Certainly, she liked to travel, and I like to travel.  I think that, you know, I guess--yeah, that would require some thought.  That's a good question now.  The, I think that--you know, I guess, I think in some ways my mom was, in some ways, perhaps more open minded, and I think I'm probably more like that than my father was.  And, you know, I suppose it's a, I suppose it's a blend of things.  I mean my father used to talk about how he likes, you know, he likes to still feel, be youthful and still kind of play and have fun.  And so I feel like, you know, I feel like that as well.  I think that, I think that my father might have been more, a little bit more race conscious in some ways than my mom.  And I think I may have gotten some of that from him.  But he also, but, you know, he was also much more cautious in many ways, and I'm not talking about the race thing, but my mom was really so much more adventuresome in some ways.  I mean like when I was a scout, there was a week-long camping trip that my mom--it was fine for her if I went on it.  But my dad didn't want me to go on it because he was afraid that the, you know, the scout leaders, I guess wouldn't watch after me closely enough 'cause they had all these other boys.  Now, the next year, it was the same trip, and he did let me go, I guess because everybody came back, all the other friends, my friends came back with all these merit badges (laughter), and talking about how much fun they had (laughter).  And so I guess, so, you know, he loosen up in that way.  But, you know, he seemed to be in some ways, in my view, overly protective.  And so my mom wasn't like that, and I don't think I'm like that, you know.  So I guess I got some things from my dad and some things from my mom.
Story_ID: 95415
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's--well, certainly one of my earliest, I think was my mom and dad separated when I was just a toddler, and then they later got back together.  But I--and perhaps because it was kind of a, you know, traumatic situation, I can--it seems like I can remember the day that my mom was moving out of the apartment that we lived in.  And so that would certainly be one of the earliest and maybe "the" earliest.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and you would have been what, three?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I was, I could have been three or four, certainly no older than that and probably, probably young--maybe three.  I mean I can remember also now that I think about it, I can remember bouncing on my grandfather's lap.  That would be my mom's dad.  And that might have been even earlier because I hardly knew my grandfather because he died when I was so young.  So that is one memory I have of just kind of sitting on his knee, you know, going like that.  And so that's--and that was over a--my grandparent's house where they moved from.  I mean that's really early in my life.  So that might be even earlier than the other one I mentioned.
Story_ID: 95416
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, can you describe the neighborhood--now, did you grow up in one neighborhood or did you move, did you all move around a lot?
Speaker 2: For the most part in one neighborhood.  I mean from the time I was eight years old until the time I left home, I was in one neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what was the name of it?  Did it have a name?
Speaker 2: What was the name of this neighborhood?  It was--oh, God, it's gotta come back to me.  It's something "Park", but, you know, and--was it Martin Park?  In Detroit [Michigan], neighborhoods weren't identified by name to the extent they are say, like in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], certainly, where I spent ten years or even here in [Washington] D.C.  But I think it was Martin's Park (laughter), but like, nobody--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ever, hardly ever used the name.  There's a few neighborhoods that are kind of known by their name, Palmer Woods, Sherwood Forest.  But my neighborhood had a name, but nobody ever used it.  And now I can't even think of what it was (laughter).
Story_ID: 95417
Speaker 1: All right, so you lived in Martin's Park [Detroit, Michigan], you think it was, and--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: And what were the main streets going through where you lived?
Speaker 2: Well, this is near the University of Detroit, in Detroit's northwest, Six-Mile, it's also called McNichols, I lived like a half a block from that, between, say, Livernois and Hamilton were a couple of big streets.  It's near Palmer Park in Detroit.  We used to walk up to Palmer Park to go ice skating.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so can you describe the house you grew up in and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in a house, had a nice large front lawn.  This is by the time I was, like I say, I think we moved in this house when I was eight.  And this was when my mother and father got back together, after having been separated for a few years.  And so we moved into a house on the Northwest side, and I remember it had a nice, a fairly good-sized lawn.  And this neighborhood, you know the tree box, what we called this the tree box here, you know, the grassy area between the sidewalk and the street, here in [Washington] D.C., it's, I guess it's only a couple of feet wide.  But in Detroit, it was probably 15-feet wide (laughter), so it was big.  And we had a side drive, and which is one thing I miss.  A lot of houses in Detroit have side drives probably because it's an automobile city.  We, you know, we had a--there was a group of friends on this block called, we called ourselves the Inverness Gang.  And we weren't like a street gang.  It was just a group of friends, you know, boys and girls.  And we would--and we're still friends, at least a couple of us still keep in touch with each other.  You know, and we'd just do things like play hide-and-go-seek under the street light and go in each other's basements and dance.  I mean we really had a good--you know, my wife thinks it's almost like an idyllic childhood (laughter), you know.  And, you know, everybody lived in a nuclear family then, at least on that block.  And it was, it wasn't integrated racially because as we moved in, all of the white people moved out.  But it was integrated in terms of, by class, like my folks were working-class people, like I said, the bus driver and the, and my mom was, did accounting work or bookkeeping work for the county.  But across the street and one of my good friends, even till today, they're--her mother was a teacher and her father was a principal.  And another guy I grew up with down the street, his father was a doctor, and so it was an interesting--it was a good mix of folks in that way.  You know, and I can remember things like cutting the grass and the smell of the grass, and one of the good, great things was, this is when you could still burn leaves, you know, in the fall, a lot of trees on the street.  And you'd rake the leaves into the street, and then set 'em on fire (laughter).  And there was, you know, it just had that, the smell of Fall and playing in the smoke, you know.  It was kind of like, kind of running through the smoke.  Then it seems like the smoke would follow you, you know.  This was some of the stuff we'd do as a kid.  And, of course, being in Detroit, like Chicago [Illinois], we got plenty of snow.  And so I can remember, you know, just having a lot of snowball fights.  Like on the first big snow of the year, a friend from down the street and I, we would just go out like at night, and even on a school night, our parents--it was almost kind of like a ritual, just let us go out and just play in the snow, and have a snowball fight.  It was just so pretty, make snow angels.  We had a good time.  And I lived probably a half mile or so, maybe a little bit more, from the University of Detroit.  But at the time, the University of Detroit had football games.  And it was really something just listening, kind of the roar of the crowd in the distance, you know, and I could just--it was good, you know.  It was--you know, it was just kind of, that was part of the sounds of growing up.  I was in the scouts, you know, basically, all my youth.  And these, the scouts, 'cause there's a group of us, of about seven, who are--we're still close.  We all live, you know, in different cities.  Only one is still in the Detroit area.  But we still keep in touch, you know, from, these are from like elementary school friends.  And so there was, you know, there was a bond there that developed through scouting and also through our fathers who were active, you know, active parents in the scout troop.  And, you know, that kind of, that kind of parental involvement really made a difference in our lives.  And so, you know, between my friends with the Inverness Gang and the scout troop, you know, it was really a pretty good, pretty good childhood, certainly better than a lot of kids had then or now.  No question about that.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, what specific interests did you have growing up?  What did you like, you know, to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was a safety patrol boy.  I was a captain.  I was, first sergeant, then lieutenant, then a captain in the safety patrol.  I mentioned scouting.  I liked to go camping, still like to go camping.  The, with my friend son the block, I would, you know, there were empty lots, a couple of vacant lots down at the corner.  It's not like they were houses that were, been torn down.  It's just that nothing had ever been built there.  And we'd go down there and play ball.  So either football or, you know, some little form of baseball or climb a tree down there or--there was even a couple of billboards.  And we could, like back-to-back billboards, and we would climb up and between 'em, you know.  We just had a lot of fun just--and riding bicycles, and, you know, like I mentioned, playing hide-and-go seek.  And so, and when this Inverness Gang, as we called it, you know, it was like I said, it was boys and girls.  So we'd go in each other's basements and dance and, and so, you know, we had a great time.
Story_ID: 95419
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Well, tell me about school.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Patton Gill Elementary in Detroit [Michigan], and then about eight years old, as I mentioned, I moved to this other house, and I went to Hally.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Hally?
Speaker 2: H-A-L-L--is it E-Y?  I think it's H-A-L-L--I think it's, and I'm not sure if it's an E-Y or just "Y".  I guess I can look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's--I think it's H-A-L-L-Y.  It's now a middle school in Detroit.  And, and so it was really at, you know, it was Hally where I became, that's where I became a safety patrol boy and took violin lessons.  You know, so it was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Patton Gill, I guess you--did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, kindergarten, probably through third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I started Hally in the fourth grade. I actually, I think I went to third grade at Patton Gill while still living in the new house 'cause I didn't transfer over immediately.  And so I think I started fourth grade at Hally, but after having lived in the neighborhood for already a year if I recall correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Hally from fourth through eighth?
Speaker 2: It was just, it was fourth through seven, so--
Speaker 1: Seven, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it went to junior high for seven, for eight and nine, eighth and ninth grades at Post Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, Post Junior High School.  Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Well, let me think.  I think I liked history.  I liked Civics, and I wasn't crazy about math and science. I didn't do well (laughter) in those.  But I think I liked--and I'm in elementary school, I liked reading and probably the social science classes.
Speaker 1: Now, did you make good grades in school?
Speaker 2: I made good grades in elementary school and I guess decent grades in high school, but nothing spectacular.  I mean was better in things like history and civics, and not so good in chemistry.  And probably just so-so in French (laughter), but good in English and, yeah like I said, civics, history and social studies.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any favorite teachers in school, I mean going all the way back to grade school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to recall the names though now.  I remember certainly in high school, a Ms. Snell was the least favorite.  But let me see (laughter), yeah, I remember some good teachers, but right now, I can't recall their names.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you know your least favorite was Ms. Snell?
Speaker 2: Snell, yeah, she was a math teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was huge.  She was way overweight.  She had a funny sneeze, she'd go: achoo, achoo, achoo, achooooo (laughter).  And she didn't explain things well.  It was just--it's not that she was particularly difficult or hard, but in my view, she just didn't have a, just didn't know how to teach.  And, and so she kind of sticks with me (laughter).
Story_ID: 95420
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when growing up, now, did you, were you influenced by the media growing up, or to what extent I should probably ask?
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember, I can remember just as a little kid in elementary school watching newscasters on television and thinking that I can do that, or I will be able to do that.  And so, yeah, I was, for some reason I was drawn, kind of like to the news even then.  And I would lay on the floor looking at the newspaper.  So I don't know how that started, but just something in me kind of drew me to the news, both on television and in the newspapers just as a little kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you grew up during the time of a lot of big national moves.  There were - the STEM Education Movement and the, when Sputnik went up--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and the whole thing around the seven astronauts and all that.  Did you pay any attention to that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean I can remember we would take our transistor radios to school to, well, I really specifically remember that for the, during the World Series, but also during space shots, you know.  We might be paying attention to it as a class as a whole, but I can remember, you know, trying to listen to those kinds of things on our little transistor radios when, you know, when John Glenn was going up into space and Allen Sheppard.  So, yeah, that was big news, and we definitely paid attention to that even as kids.
Story_ID: 95421
Speaker 1: Okay, and Civil Rights was a big deal too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Civil Rights was a big deal, and, you know, I went to, you know, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s famous, "I Have a Dream" speech was actually previewed in Detroit [Michigan] before he gave it here.  And I went to that speech with my father.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us--set that up for us.  Now, where was that?
Speaker 2: That was on Woodward Avenue and we walked down Woodward Avenue.  I don't remember where we began, but Woodward Avenue is the main drag in downtown Detroit.  And I think the march ended up in Cobo Hall which was the Arena at the time, Cobo Arena, like where the Pistons and the Redwings played.  We didn't go into the arena, but we marched a little, you know, along the street with them.  I'm not even sure if Martin Luther King actually went into the arena, but they were, you know, way ahead of us, so we couldn't (unclear) see him.  But, you know, there were just thousands and thousands of people.  And Detroit was a, Detroit has a very important part like in the history of the Civil Rights, and Black Liberation Movements.  I mean when you think about it, Malcolm X did a lot of--well, he was born in Lansing, Michigan.  The first masque of the Nation of Islam was in Detroit.  The Republic of New Africa started in Detroit, the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement which was an important kind of independent labor movement that was in Detroit.  And Detroit has--
Speaker 1: And they called that DRUM, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, DRUM, yeah.  And because, I think Detroit was such a union town, it had benefits that were beyond the financial benefits for the working-class people of Detroit, and for the black people of Detroit.  And that is, I think it helped show people how to organize.  And these organizational skills, you know, had an impact on the political activity of Detroit.  And the fact that people had decent wages because of the union also meant that they had, they then had kind of the wherewith all, and that might just be the time, even in some cases to participate in some of these activities because if you're just on a survival budget, all you can do is just think about working and getting that money.  But if your wage is enough that you have some free time, and then you also have the political inclination, and that's in part fueled by all this union activity, which is clearly like a political activity, union activity is.  And then it had these spin-offs in Detroit.  So Detroit was a, you know, was a pretty political town.
Story_ID: 95422
Speaker 1: And also it was Motown.  I mean I can remember just being very proud as a kid, growing up where all of this music was coming out of.  And I'm still a huge Motown fan, you know.  It was just, you know, it was like everybody said they knew somebody who was with Motown (laughter), whether they did or not, I think (laughter).  But it seemed like everybody had a cousin or somebody--or at least they claimed to have a cousin with Motown.
Speaker 2: So Motown begins really, they started making records when you're about nine, I guess, right, in '59 [1959], '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in the late '50s [1950s], when they started, and so I was, I would have been 10 in 1959.  And I guess it was about then, yeah.  It was probably about then.  And then they, you know, started kicking off and getting some hits in the early '60s [1960s].  And so, I mean it was, I mean I can remember walking to school.  We would dance one day a week in gym in elementary school.  This was at Hally Elementary.  And I can remember, you know, songs like Smokey Robinson's "Shop Around" which is one of his earliest hits, you know, we were dancing to that and the flip side was "Who's Loving You", you know.  And so this was back when I was still in elementary school.  And so that had a, I mean the whole Motown scene had a strong influence, you know, on me as a kid.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you know anybody who performed with Motown or--
Speaker 1: I didn't know anybody--
Speaker 2: How close could you get to that relationship, you know, how many people away?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, I think it was a few at least, although I was told that, on the street, two streets away from me, that Gladys Knight and the Pips lived on that street.  It was LaSalle.  I never saw 'em there, but I was told that.  And I was told that two blocks away also on LaSalle, that Jackie Wilson lived down there, but I never saw him either.  But, no, so I didn't really know anybody but I was, a lot of these things, like I was told, and I believe it, that, like Stevie Wonder, I went to Post Junior High, and there was a Fitzgerald, I guess it was elementary.  And I think that Stevie Wonder apparently went to--at least I was told he went to Fitzgerald.  And I think they had some, apparently, they had some, you know, courses there for, I guess, blind children.  I'm not even sure that's true.  But I'm not sure, you know, how much all this other stuff is true.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I've heard that, a friend of mine's brother actually went to school with him.  And he's not blind so there was some kind of--he was in some kind of an integrated situation where the blind were--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with the regular students.  So I don't--
Speaker 1: I don't know, but in any case, you hear about all these things, but I didn't really have any first-hand knowledge of any of 'em.  So I didn't really know anybody who--later, actually, I knew somebody who worked for Motown, but it was after I moved away, but not as a kid.
Story_ID: 95423
Speaker 1: When you were in high school--now, you went to Northern High School, right?
Speaker 2: That was my mom.  I went to Mumford High School.
Speaker 1: Oh, Mumford, that's right, okay, I'm sorry.  Mumford, okay.  Mumford, okay, so at Mumford, now, that's in the neighborhood, right, where you grew up?
Speaker 2: It was a neighborhood school.  It was probably a couple of miles away, but, yeah, it was the neighborhood high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, what as Mumford like?
Speaker 2: Mumford's a blue school.  I think they tore it down, and they're building a new one (laughter), but everybody recognized it as a blue school.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means it was painted blue.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Kind of light blue, and it had a driver's course out in front which a lot of people thought was ugly 'cause usually we have like a lawn in front.  It had a driver's training course in front.  But Mumford was good.  I was, you know, I became Student Council President, and I was the first black Student Council President and treasurer and vice president before that.  And--
Speaker 1: So, was the school integrated or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum, certainly when I got there.
Speaker 1: So what was the percentage, you think?
Speaker 2: Well, it was shifting.  I think when I got there, it might have been, I don't know.  It might have been like maybe 40 percent black.  By the time I graduated, you know, it was then, it was probably 70 percent black, just guessing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I had a good time in school 'cause like I said, I was very active in the Student Council.  And that's where--well, it was actually in junior high where I developed my interest in--well, it was in junior high where I decided I wanted to be a journalist.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  Now, you're in--at Post Junior High School, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I just had a, I had an eighth grade journalism class instead of English.  I mean it substituted for kind of like the English class.  I don't know how I got it.  I don't know, maybe I was at home when they asking for it.  But I'm not sure.  Maybe I was just assigned, but I just enjoyed, you know, I enjoyed it, and I worked on--I enjoyed writing these newspaper stories.  I can remember at one point we were putting together--there were two journalism classes, and together we were working on a paper.  And (laughter) I wrote a story about--two of us wrote a story about a particular subject.  And I remember picking the other person's story to go in the paper because I just thought it was a better story.  And I remember the folks thinking that this was weird, that I would choose somebody else's story.  But I guess it was just, I guess it was just the beginning of really taking journalism seriously, you know.  And, you know, and I was a decent writer in high school.  I remember having a teacher who we had to write a 500-word composition every week, and when I got to college, you know, I was a better writer than a lot of kids because of that kind of, that kind of training and I guess, perhaps, because of my interest in journalism that I took that, took it seriously.  But had a good time, and--had a good time in high school.  I didn't, you know, I played sports, but I wasn't on, like any varsity team (unclear).  But I remember, remember great times going to the basketball games and, you know, just becoming so enthusiastic, you know, about our high school teams.  It was just a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Did Mumford win anything or did they--
Speaker 2: Mumford had a good basketball team.  I remember we went to, went to some state, you know, state tournaments.  I mean we never won the really big ones, but we won like, certainly one at the city level, and did go to the state, I guess, for the regional or state championships; probably the regional's.  I don't think we got all the way to the state's championships.  But, so it was good.
Story_ID: 95424
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Is there a particular teacher that taught the journalism course that you remember that, whose name you can remember now that made it interesting?
Speaker 2: Hum.  I can see this guy's face.  I can see, I can see both the junior high teacher's face, and the high school teacher's face.  But I can't think of the name at the moment.  But they were, you know, they were both influential, I think, in my interest in journalism.  And then also, I can remember an Econ-teacher.  Again, I can't remember the names for someone reason, and a Civics teacher.  And, you know, I think they all, you know, I had--all of those classes helped develop my interests in current affairs, you know.  So I was, you know, so I was, you know, I was in Current Affairs Club.  I was in a Black History Club, in addition to being deeply involved in Student Council, wrote for the paper a little bit but not much because I was so busy with Student Council.  But, yes, it was a good experience in high school.  I had a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember any of the issues on Student Council?
Speaker 2: Well, I certainly remember a point where--this is before I was President.  There was, you know, the school was changing racially, and there was a time when the--and the Student Council was largely white, except for me and a few other black people.  And so they wanted to know how to, what they could do, I think, to get more black people on Student Council.  I don't think I had any answers.  I don't think I really, I don't think I really had any good advice.  I mean I don't know like, why I chose to get on it as opposed to other, and other black kids didn't.  But it's, you know, it's one of those, probably one of those kind of things where there weren't more black kids because there weren't more black kids there (laughter).  You know, there's, you have to kind of get a critical mass.  There'll be a few, but until you get a critical mass, then others don't kind of feel like coming, for whatever reason.  I guess, I guess I never felt restrained by the critical mass thing.  I mean if it was something I was interested in, then I was gonna try to pursue it, and it didn't--
Speaker 1: So, do you think some of the black students were intimidated by the fact that the majority white students (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They may--they could have been, yeah, kind of didn't see it as, maybe they didn't see it as a black thing or whatever.  You know, whereas for me, I kind of went with my interests and didn't let that get in the way.  So, you know, just like I went to the Black History Club 'cause I was interested in that, and I went to the basketball games 'cause I was interested in that.  Well, I had this interest in being on Student Council, so I went.  And the fact that there weren't many other black kids there didn't stop me, but I guess it did dissuade others from doing that.  I can remember, you know, after a football game, there was a fight, and that wasn't uncommon because this was, fortunately, then, folks only fought with their fists, you know, unlike today, it seems like.  But the two rival schools, and there was a, it was a fight at--it was a home game, football game.  In fact, one of my good friends who, unfortunately, died a few years ago, he was in ROTC, and he somehow got jumped even though he was at the home school.  But, and so, you know, as a member of Student Council--I might have been president them, I, along with someone else, went to the other school's City Council to apologize, you know.  And so, you know, we kind of took our civic duty seriously.  And so I thought all of that was, I thought all of that was good training.
Story_ID: 95425
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any particular teachers at Mumford [High School in Detroit, Michigan] that you remember that, you know, were mentors to you or set a good example for you?
Speaker 2: There was a guy named Ralph Carter.  And I'm not sure, I don't think I ever actually took his class, but he was the guy who led the Black History Club.  And, and, you know, he was, you know, he was instrumental, I think, in helping to develop my sense of, my appreciation for black history and in the sense of kind of independence as a black man.  So he was, I think he was helpful in that.  There was a guy named Mr. Parello (ph.), I think his name was.  I don't think I ever had him for a class either, but he had a, he was, had kind of like a Jazz Club.  And I was interested in Jazz, along with really a number of my scout bodies, you know, at an early age.  In fact, we would take the bus to go to Jazz concerts at the Detroit Institute of Art.  We were too young to drive, but we would all just get on the bus and go to these Jazz concerts, you know (laughter).  And there was a Jazz concert, and so this guy had a Jazz Club at the high school.  So it was good.
Story_ID: 95426
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, when you were in high school [Mumford High School in Detroit, Michigan], there are a lot of big, political events, history-making events going on.  When you're a freshman, the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And that was just before you started high school, I guess, I would think, yeah, '63 [1963], August of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, 'cause I graduated from high school in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So March on Washington, Malcolm X is assassinated in '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: When was the Black History Club formed?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  If I graduated in '67 [1967], it must have been in, you know, '65 [1965] or '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, and did they actually call it the Black History Club?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As far as I recall, yeah.  I don't think it was African American.  I think it was, I'm pretty sure it was Black History Club.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm thinking about Negro 'cause we were Negroes until--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).  Yeah, I think it was Black History Club.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, well, that's progressive--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: --when you consider other cities and I'm from Dayton [Ohio] and we were Negroes until--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --until '67 [1967], '68 [1968]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know what you mean, but I think Detroit whereas I have mentioned, Detroit was pretty progressive.  I can remember going to hear folks like, oh, let's see, folks like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Toure] and [H.] Rap Brown.  They would come to a church called, well, the minister was Albert Cleage--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the Church of the Black Madonna.  And, and folks from, like the Black Panthers from Alabama, you know, not the Oakland Panthers, but the Black Panther group that started in Alabama.
Speaker 1: The Black Panther Party, the political party, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they would come to this church to speak.  And so I can remember going to hear these folks in, I guess high school and college.  And so it was, yeah, Detroit was a pretty progressive and pretty political town when it came to, you know, black political issues.  And so, yeah, I'm pretty sure we called ourselves the Black History Club (laughter), but that might be, you know, part of the whole, part of the whole scene.
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know all of the, the Henrys were important in Detroit, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Milton Henry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And also his brother.  They were very heavily involved, and basically the founders of the Republic of New Afrika.  And Milton Henry, he was actually from--they were actually from Pontiac, Michigan which is just up the road, not too far from Oakland University [Detroit] where I went to undergrad.  But they, Milton Henry was a, you know like a well-known Civil Rights or, and defense lawyer.  I've forgotten his brother's name now, but his brother--
Speaker 1: Is that Hayward Henry?
Speaker 2: Haywood?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think it was Haywood.
Speaker 1: Hayward or Haywood.
Speaker 2: Richard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But in any case, in--
Speaker 1: It could have been Richard.
Speaker 2: --his brother became basically the leader of the Republic of New Afrika, I think after his, after Milton died.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so was your father involved in the Movement activities?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean he kind of supported it, but I don't recall him being a part of any organization or going to the meetings or anything like that.  He, like I said though, he did take me to this, you know, to march with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], along with 100,000 other people along Woodward Avenue.  So I guess I can say that we marched with Martin Luther King.  Of course, we couldn't see him (laughter) because he was so far ahead, ahead of the crowd.  But we marched with him (laughter).
Story_ID: 95427
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, now did you have a, were you aware of any black journalist in Detroit [Michigan] when you were growing up?  I mean who were the most visible black journalists?
Speaker 2: There was one guy on television, a guy named Bob something.  He was short, heavy-set and walked with a very pronounced limp.  But--what was Bob's last name?
Speaker 1: Was he a commentator on TV?
Speaker 2: No, he was a reporter.
Speaker 1: Reporter, news reporter.
Speaker 2: But when I was in high school, I was, I went to the Detroit News as part of, it was either Scout Day or maybe it was Eagle Scout Day.  But in any case, you could pick a profession and, you know, you could go to work with somebody from that profession.  And so I went to Detroit News and hung out with a sportswriter for a day.  He wasn't, he was white, but I think there was, there might have been one black reporter and one black photographer at the Detroit News when I was in high school.  And then I joined the Detroit News.  I mean I started working there as an, as a copy aide.  A lot of times, in fact, they were really called Copy Boys, but I wouldn't call myself boy.  And when they would yell, they would "Boy", and I wouldn't respond (laughter).  I'd wait until they go copy (laughter).  But, so this is, by the time I was--that was between, that was probably between sophomore and junior years when I became a--of college, when I became a copy aide at the "Detroit News".  And then I think they had one black reporter, and one black photographer.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, that would have been--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And my boss who was in charge of the copy aides, he was also black.  And that was about it.
Speaker 1: That was in '69 [1969] or so?
Speaker 2: That was probably, let me see, yeah, I graduated.  So in the freshman year [college] would have been '68 [1968], so it probably would have been about '69 [1969], maybe the summer of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Either then or the summer of '70 [1970].  I'd have to double count, but either one of those.
Story_ID: 95428
Speaker 1: Now, back to Mumford [High School in Detroit, Michigan], was--well, when you were a senior, ready to graduate from Mumford, what were your prospects?  Had you, did you have counseling about college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We, there was a college counselor, and, you know, they brought in recruiters from different colleges and so we would talk with people from different schools, primarily state schools.  And through the [Boy] Scouts, the Scouts took us on trips to, you know, two or three colleges in the, you know, like [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] and maybe Oakland [University, Rochester, Michigan] where I went.  I'm not sure about that.  But, and also as Scouts, we would usher at football games.  And so that also got us on college campuses.  I mean we ushered at State, Michigan State and University of Michigan and the University of Detroit.  I definitely remember doing, you know, ushering as a Scout at those games.  So, you know, we were exposed to college campuses, and, you know, it was kind of assumed that we would go to college, I think.
Speaker 1: So you end up going to Oakland College--
Speaker 2: Oakland University--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and, how did that, you know, happen?  How did you pick--
Speaker 2: How did I pick Oakland University?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, I think Michigan State [University] was my first choice, and, but they wanted me to go to summer school so I could do some, I don't know, remedial or catch up something.  And I didn't wanna go to summer school.
Speaker 1: So did, now, I'm thinking--correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm thinking that your math scores may not have been so--
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: --high.  Did you take--
Speaker 2: Probably a good chance of that.
Speaker 1: SAT or ACT or something or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I may have done okay.  I think I did okay on those, but, you know, like I can remember, I was so glad to get a "C" in chemistry, I didn't know what to do.  So the math and science scores probably didn't help.  But anyway, they wanted me, they admitted me, but they said, look, we want you to come up here in the summer.  I said, I didn't wanna do that.  So I went to Oakland University, obviously, also admitted me.  They limited me, I think to 12 credits the first year instead of 16.  I think at Oakland we, each, almost every class was with four credits.  And so--
Speaker 1: Now, was it difficult to get "A", to get--I mean did you need any aid to go or did they give you a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Financial aid?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: No, I think my parents paid for it that first year.  Now, at Oakland, I became, I ran a tutorial program.  This might have been in, starting in my junior year.  I worked some--
Speaker 1: Well, let's not get that far ahead.  Let's just--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let's start at the beginning of Oakland.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I also was telling you, you asked me why I chose Oakland.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I started, I think I applied also to University of Michigan.  I don't recall hearing from them, whether I got in or not, although later, when I thought about transferring, they told me I had been admitted.  And I didn't even realize that.
Speaker 1: So in any case, I chose Oakland University, and I got in this thing called Charter College, which is kind of a small--the idea was to kind of have it a small college within Oakland University, which, in fact, itself was small.  At that time, it was only like 3,000 people.  And like I said, I was, you know, it was a very small campus, certainly to State, Michigan State [University] or University of Michigan.  But it felt good, and, and so that's why I ended up going.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you aiming at becoming a journalist when you attended Oakland [University, Rochester, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to be a journalist like I said, since junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as a result of spending that day at the Detroit News with this sportswriter and talking with them, the journalists there, I knew that I didn't really have to major in journalism.  And Oakland University didn't even have a journalism course, not one class when I went there.  But, you know, I learned from talking with those journalists at the Detroit News that you needed to know how to write, and you needed to know, give some basic knowledge of the stuff you're writing about.  And so, and they kind of just basically said, you don't really need the journalism classes.  And, you know, so, you know, I went to Oakland University, and I paid attention to my writing.  They had a writing clinic that kids who really couldn't write would be referred to, but I referred myself there, not because I was, anybody told me I needed to, but because I just wanted to be a better writer.  And, you know, and I took classes, I focused like on political science, even though my degree is actually secondary ed and social studies, but I really focused on political science classes because I was interested in kind of knowing more about what I would end up writing about.
Story_ID: 95430
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, did, were there any black professors in Oakland [University]?
Speaker 2: Very few.  There was, this one lady who taught African Studies and only kind of as a result of I think some of us protesting the lack of courses in that.  There was a guy named Carl Gregory who actually I saw last year.  He's an economist, and I'm not sure now if I ever had a class with Carl Gregory though.  But there were a few around, and, but very few, but Carl Gregory was the one that, you know, black students would talk to.  So even though I didn't have a class with him, you know, we got to know him.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: He was an econ prof.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what about Harold Lawrence?  Was he there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Harold Lawrence, no.
Speaker 1: Harold G--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, there was a Dewitt Dikes.  He taught Black History.  I almost forgot about him.  So, yeah, and I guess there were no, I mean there were a few others.  I'm sure I didn't know all of 'em because even thought there were only a few, there were enough teachers there that you didn't know everybody.  And so, and there was a guy named Manny Pearson.  He was in charge of a program, I think it was called "Project 20" or something like that, that did bring students to campus, you know, black students, enrolled them and helped them out in different ways.  I wasn't a part of Project 20, but, you know, I got to know him because he was one of the black administrators.  And a lot of the other black students, even perhaps most of the other black students, certainly a number of other black students were part of this Project 20.  And so they would have programs, and I might go to their programs and stuff like that.  So I got to know him.  But then he was, he was like kind of the guy in charge of getting black students on campus, students, not just visitors.
Story_ID: 95431
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have--I guess I should have, maybe I should have asked this earlier.  But do you remember the transition in language from when we started calling ourselves black instead of Negro 'cause that happened when you were in high school or last, latter part of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, I guess I don't really remember it specifically.  It seems like I can remember more about the difference between black and African American, although those still co-exists together.  But from Negro to black, I don't know.  It seems like I should remember that better than I do.  But, yeah, I guess I'm not sure when it happened.  I do, I certainly, I remember--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's something that I guess was officially sanctioned by the media at some point because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then when Walter Cronkite started call us black, you know, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I don't--there's a, we did it first, but I just, I'm thinking around '65 [1965] it starts and then it doesn't really catch full hold until '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's probably, that's probably true.  But I don't know--well, you know, I mean it was around the time that, you know, people started talking about Black Power, Stokely Carmichael started talking about that.  I guess James Brown, "I'm Black and I'm Proud", I guess that was in the '70's [1970s].
Speaker 1: No, it's '69 [1969], yeah.
Speaker 2: That was '69 [1969]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: "I'm Black and I'm Proud".  Well, and I guess that was part of it too.  You know, there was the Nation of Islam that, I don't know, maybe it was Mike Wallace dubbed them--I don't know who dubbed them the Black Muslims, but I remember there was a TV program, and I think it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That "Hate" (unclear) (simultaneous) produced.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was that on CBS?  Was that with Mike Wallace?
Speaker 1: CBS, Mike Wallace.
Speaker 2: I think they were called the Black Muslims in that program.  You know, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But they called Black Muslims too.
Speaker 2: Oh, did they call, yeah.  And so yeah, I mean I guess it was in the late '60s [1960s], mid to late '60s [1960s], you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I--when you were discussing being a--having a position of copy boy at "Detroit News", who refused to being called "boy", you know, refusing to be called boy, (laughter), that's part of that era--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: You know, that's the traditional name for the position, is copy boy.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.  And it was, you know, and I could get away with it too because there would be, at that time--it doesn't happen at newspapers this way anymore, we had a bench, and there might be three, four of us sitting on this bench.  And somebody would yell, boy, and I would just stay seated, but somebody would get up.  So it didn't become like a big issue because there was usually somebody else who would respond to "boy".  And so it's not like I would sit there and someone would get angry with me for not responding.  But I mean I consciously wasn't responding because of what they said, and I think people got that message.  But it's not like I ever got in trouble for it because somebody else was there to respond.  And I think we did, me and maybe one other, the guys there probably did talk with some of the editors and saying, you know, we will respond to "copy", but not to "boy" (laughter).  And so people started yelling "copy".  I mean it became--we didn't have to in a sense--well, maybe it wasn't overt protest by not responding, but we didn't--in some ways, it's not like we had to make a big deal of it to make the point, you know.  It was just, I think while we did have some conversations, I think with some editors about it, it was more the action of, you know, you know, what they had to say in order to get us to do something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 95432
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  So were you part of a black student organization on campus [Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, well, in high school, we didn't have one then, but we did have like the Black History Club was kind of about as close as we got to it.  In college though, yeah.  Yeah, we had as--was it the Black Student Alliance, I think we called ourselves the Black Student Alliance.  And there was this, some, a smaller group of, I think only black male students.  We got together from time to time.  We would talk about trying to put out a newspaper or something, and it never really went anywhere.  And, now, the group I ran though, it was both black and white students.  I ran this group called "Pontiac Oakland Educational Tutorial Assistance Team" or something like that.  We called ourselves POETAT.  And we would have, we would bring in black elementary students from Pontiac, Michigan to campus which was in Rochester, Michigan, bus them in.  It was like a four-day a week program, and then for two days, say like a Monday or a Wednesday, they would come to campus.  And on Tuesday and Thursday, we would take buses and go to their schools and tutor them there.  So this was like four days a week throughout the school year.  And I was basically, I basically directed that program for a year or two.  And, but, yeah, we were, on campus I was part of the black student group.  We took over a cafeteria, you know, and a lot of--but we, I mean I was, I'm still, frankly, impressed with our goals.  We just, we talked about things like having an African Studies program, but we also demanded such things as having an ambulance on campus that would be for everybody.  You know, it wasn't just, our demands just weren't narrowly focused on, you know, quote, unquote "black" issues.  They were also focused on some issues that would make life better for campus generally.  And I remember one of 'em was--Oakland University at that time was fairly isolated.  It was kind of out in the country.  And I think it started when some, I think a black, female student somehow got hurt, and I might not be recalling this correctly.  And so we ended up taking over the cafeteria, you know, a whole list of demands.  But one of 'em was like have an ambulance on campus.  And so it was, I mean I thought that, I was proud of us, in fact, because it was like, this is serious business about making campus life better generally, in addition.  And, of course, I think things like African Studies courses make the school better too, generally, in terms of its academics.  But those were things that clearly we wanted as black people, whereas the ambulance was something like, you need to have this because people get sick, you know, on campus, and we're isolated.  So, yeah, I was a member of, yeah, I was definitely a part of those organizations.
Story_ID: 95433
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, but your major was political science?
Speaker 2: Well, officially, it was secondary ed and social science, but that's because of the old thought at that time, you know, if you have a teacher's certificate, you have something to fall back on.  But really, I was interested in political science, and that's the stuff I focused on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so anything significant before we get you graduated?  What about the professors there?  Any, did you have a favorite--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, there was the one--now, this one professor, I do remember.  His name was Roger Marz, M-A-R-Z.  He was, he taught political science, and I had him for Poly-Sci 101 and probably two or three other classes.  And he impressed me because he seemed like he knew everything without referring to notes.  He never lectured with notes.  And he just seemed like he knew all of this stuff without any notes.  There was one point when somebody, somehow the Red Cross came up, you know, and totally unrelated, you know, to the subject of the day.  And he started talking about the history of the Red Cross.  I mean I was like really impressed (laughter).  Like, how does he know all this stuff?  So he was influential.  There was a guy named Alfred Lessing, who was a philosopher and I had him for philosophy and, you know, he was, he was good too in terms of, just kind of helping me kind of learn how to think, you know, and just kind of thing about things.  There was a guy named Dr. Burrell, who I had him for, it was basically Psychology 101.  And I can remember him talking about, in the context of race in America, how if, you know, it was one of those analogies like, if one group of people are held back for years and decades, and another group of people--and the analogy was like a race, and they're at the starting line.  But this other group is held back for all those years, and then someone says, "go" or shoots the starting gun, with the pretense that everybody's starting the race at the same time, without any appreciation that one group has been forced to be at the back of the pack (laughter) over all these years.  And then you're saying, okay, well, you all get to start the race at the same time so it's a fair race, you know.  And so he, and now this was a largely white class 'cause Oakland University was overwhelmingly white.  And so even though I think his message was to the white students, and he was a white professor, you know, it also helped me kind of crystallize a lot of, a lot of my thinking about how America worked in terms of black folks.  You know they wanna say that, you know, everybody has an equal shot, but they might only look at everybody starting the race at the same time, but everybody's not at the starting line, you know.  Some people start the race much further back.  And so he said things like that to help, and just helped me kind of appreciate things, you know, in terms of the social dynamics of, of living in America.
Story_ID: 95434
Speaker 1: And it was, you know, it was a very interesting time to be on, to be on campus.  It was, we, you know, we lived on a--one of the rooms, at least one of the floors in my dorm, you know, it got, I think the police raided it twice because of people smoking dope or raise or growing dope or something and strange characters on the floor.  I can remember, you know, I can remember interacting with the gay, some of the gay dudes on campus.  And for some reason, I always just interacted with them without, I mean it was just, they were just some other, just some other dudes on campus.  They were clearly gay.  I mean they weren't trying to hide it very much.  And--
Speaker 2: They weren't organizing any kind of--
Speaker 1: No, they weren't organized, but, you know, my roommate and I, and my, another friend of ours too, it was, I mean fortunately, we never--I think about it now because in terms of writing the beat I cover now, I sometimes have to deal with issues involving gay federal employees 'cause they don't have, they can't collect the full benefits that other federal employees can if they're married.  And for whatever reason, I was fortunate enough not to have, not to have been burdened by homophobia like some of my friends were.  And, but I can, I mean I think about that from the times, when just thinking about, with these folks on campus.  But it was, yeah, I had a good time in college, I mean because I was running this tutorial program, and, you know, it was just, you know, the first time for a lot of stuff, you know.  And it was, you know, it was a very political time, and so it was, you know, it was a very important kind of growth period.
Story_ID: 95435
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so when you graduated from Oakland U [Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan], you had graduated as the outstanding male graduate?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this implies, I mean so what all did you have to demonstrate to--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was, you know, it was a combination of leadership and academics, and I think that my, 'cause I was director of this thing called the Pontiac Oakland Educational Assistance Team.  And, you know, as I explained, it was a tutorial project involving poor children, largely poor children in Pontiac.  And so I think that was the leadership piece.  And, you know, my grades were decent enough, you know, I--it was a thing that I probably graduated--I sort of had a better GPA in college than in high school.  I think it was like in the low three's or maybe 3.4.  It probably wasn't any higher than that, probably low three's.  So my grades were good enough, and my, and I was, you know, I was, you know, I had, I showed these leadership things.  I would, you know, get invited to different meetings with different administrators and things like that.  And, and so, you know, they recognized me for those activities and the academic achievement.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was this award presented at graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was at graduation.  They gave you a medal.  And Detroit News ran, you know, they had a story about me, and my picture in the paper.  And even last year, there was a, there was kind of a reunion of, not exactly a reunion because it's not like we were ever really together, but all of the Wilson Award winners, were brought together at Oakland University.  So there's an outstanding male graduate and outstanding female graduate.  And we're called the, there's just the Alfred G. Wilson Award, which I got, and the Matilda Wilson Award which the women get.  And the Wilson's, particularly Matilda Wilson, donated a lot of land for the school.  So they named these, you know, each year an outstanding, two outstanding graduates get, you know, honored in their name.
Story_ID: 95436
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now is this when you get the fellowship to the Washington Journalism Center?
Speaker 2: That was, it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971]?
Speaker 2: --shortly after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, let's see, I graduated, I think, I guess in April of '71 [1971], and then I went to work as a full-time reporter for the Detroit News.  But I was able to get a fellowship to the Washington Journalism Center that started in September.  It ran September through December of '71 [1971].  And so I came here to Washington, and that was a good session.  I mean it was a session where we--how many?  There might have been a dozen of us, a dozen young journalists.  And we, maybe 15, a few, I don't remember, certainly fewer than 20, but 12 or 15, I think in journalism. And we would have sessions with government leaders, journalists and just, and we ended up getting a certificate in Public Affairs reporting.  So it was basically giving us an introduction into how Washington [D.C.] works.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are there any memorable stories from that fifteen weeks?
Speaker 2: Ah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And had you ever been to Washington before?
Speaker 2: Not for an extended period of time.  I think I visited once when I was a really young child.  But I didn't really know Washington.  But I drove here.  I had a little Karmann Ghia (laughter)--it's long out of production, and got an apartment on 16th Street.  And, you know, I can remember just really kind of learning about how it works and we had a session at the Office of Management and Budget.  And I remember we were kind of critical about something the president was doing, and we're asking these management and budget people why don't you do this or do that.  And we clearly didn't understand that they worked for the president.  It's not like they were an independent group of people.  And so it was just kind of learning how this place, how this town works.  I learned the importance of lobbyists, I mean because these lobbyists know a lot about the subject that they're focused on.  I understood and got to learn how they really play a big role in writing legislation and developing policy.  You know, in terms of just kind of being here, it was, you know, it was my first time living away from home, outside of living in a dormitory, which is almost like a transition period.  But, you know, I had my own apartment.  So I had to fix my own food, you know, such as it was.  I've never been any kind of cook, really.  And so it was just a lot of, you know, frozen food and stuff like that.  But it was the first time really living on my own, outside of college, like I said, it really, you know, you're not at home, but you're really not on your own (laughter) really, until you really get out.  And this was in a totally different city where I knew very few people.  And so it was, you know, it was a good, it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 95437
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is during the Nixon [President Richard M. Nixon] administration, you were in town, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess it must have been.  Let me see, the Nixon administration, yeah.  Yeah, I guess it was.  It had to be.
Speaker 1: Richard Nixon's first term, they had like a Democratic Congress and a Republican president, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Vietnam War.  Now, so what did you think about the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was, I filed to be a conscientious objector.  And I remember sitting at the dining room table filling out all these papers.  And I had to get all of these letters of recommendation and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why I had to explain why I didn't wanna kill people.  It seems like it should have been the other way around.  It seems like if you're willing to kill people, you ought to have to sit down and write a long essay explaining why you're willing to kill people.  So I thought that was, I thought it was just upside down.  I still do.  But I also was very prepared to go to Canada, and I had made up my mind.  A friend down the street, he was drafted, and he refused induction, you know.  He was supposed to take a step forward, I guess to signify you're in the [U.S.] Army.  He refused, and the FBI came to visit him.  But they didn't do anything.  So in a sense, I had, he provided reinforcement.  But I was never called 'cause I had a very high number.  You remember, they had the lottery in those days.  And my number was like 340-something.  So, but I also remember the first lottery, and everybody was around the TV and paying attention.  And I was so sure, I was so confident in my decision not to go into the Army that I wasn't even paying attention.  I obviously found out what it was.  I think my father [Joe Davidson, Sr.] called, but, to tell me.  But, so in any case, you know, I think I had filed, I probably filed CO [conscientious objector] papers by that time.  And so, yeah, I mean that it, the War in Vietnam definitely had an impact because like most other people in that generation, certainly in the college, and I was very much against the war.  And, and so it was, yeah, I mean it definitely kind of played a role in my development, my reaction to it.
Story_ID: 95438
Speaker 1: Now, there are two things that happened, I didn't ask you about, and I feel stupid for not doing it now, but in high--when you were in college, Dr. King [Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in 1968, April of '68 [1968], so--
Speaker 2: That was very, yeah, I--one thing I clearly remember about that is, I remember hearing the news and sitting in my room just totally stunned.  And some of the white kids on the floor were having a water fight, you know.  And that really, to me, indicated a difference in black America and white America 'cause I was devastated.  And, you know, these other kids on the floor were just having a water fight.  I mean it was like, it was like it meant nothing to them.  And I, and so, it clearly showed how, you know, I was apart from them.  And, you know, I was, I just couldn't understand how they could be so oblivious to the fact that Martin Luther King had been assassinated.
Story_ID: 95439
Speaker 1: Were race relationships at Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], fairly easy or did the black students stay by themselves, keep to themselves or how did that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it was some of both.  I mean I had, I had a couple of good white friends, but most of the black students ate together, and socialized together.  And, you know, but still there were some, like I said, I had a couple of white friends.  And so it was, you know, there was some mixing, but a lot of self-segregation too, on the part of black students.  I mean we would just, all eat at the same tables and stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can remember at one point (laughter), it was this thing about open housing.  And we had one professor, a guy named Shelly Applebaum, who was very active in trying to get an open housing law in Birmingham, Michigan, which was an affluent suburb.  And so that was a big deal.  That passed, and he came into like this assembly and everybody gave him a standing ovation, I think except some of the black students.  And he later asked why, but what I told him was, you know, they told people to stand (laughter), to give you a standing ovation.  It wasn't like organic (laughter).  And furthermore, we knew that the open housing laws were primarily to make white people feel good, that black people weren't moving to Birmingham or Bloomfield (laughter) (unclear), 'cause these were really affluent suburbs.  I thought it was good that it passed, but nobody expected that, any of the--it was definitely better that it passed than had it not passed.  But those were victories for white liberals, you know.  They weren't victories for black people.  And so the white liberals on instruction stood and gave him a standing ovation.  And the black students appreciated it, but we didn't feel the need to stand and give him a standing ovation.
Story_ID: 95440
Speaker 1: Another thing I didn't ask you about which I think we need to bounce off of a little bit, was the riot in Detroit [Michigan] in '67 [1967], I guess, just as you were coming out of high school, going to college, I guess.  Is that about the right time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was '67 [1967].  I was, I can remember I was working as a, for parks and recreation, Department of Parks and Recreation.  And there was some sort of like, summer theater in the park, just a local park.  And so I was there, just helping out, I guess helping out with the crowd, or just doing a little bit of something.  I wasn't part of the theater group but more of the parks and recs staff at that particular park, and we circulated.  So it wasn't even like a regular park I was at.  But I can remember my mom and dad diving to meet me.  And I had my own car, but they came over to meet me because the riot had broken out.  And they just wanted to make sure I got home safely.  And, you know, the riots happened on, or kind of started on really down the street from the church I went to, on 12th Street.  And it started in a, you know, The Blind Pig, which is what in Detroit, they call an after-hours club.  And, you know, I can remember just seeing smoke, and I can, you know, from fires and jets flying low overhead, and [U.S.] Army, you know, vehicles and soldiers, you know, riding around in jeeps and stuff like that.  So it was, you know, it was a hell of an experience, yeah, yeah, it really was.
Speaker 1: Was there property destruction where you lived?
Speaker 2: No, not where I lived.  But--
Speaker 1: Was it like mostly on the East side or--
Speaker 2: It was, no, well, like 12th Street wasn't on East side.  It was mostly, right along 12th Street.  Twelfth Street was also on the West side, but I lived more on the Northwest side as opposed to what they would call the West side.  And so it was more in what you would call the West side, I guess.  But like I said, it was in the neighborhood around my church, right in that neighborhood.  And I think also some along the East side too.  But, so, yeah, I mean it was, you know, they had to call in the Army.  I mean it wasn't,  not just the National Guard, but they called in the [U.S.] Army (laughter), you know.  So, in some ways, I mean it speaks to Detroit's involvement with, you know, black politics and Black Liberation Movements, and kind of radical black politics too, although, obviously, these kinds of things happened in cities all over the country during that period.
Story_ID: 95441
Speaker 1: Okay, I was gonna jump back to 1971 where (laughter), you're in the journalism center here in Washington.  So, this was like, this 15 weeks you spent in--was it mostly in the summertime or--
Speaker 2: No, September through December.
Speaker 1: Oh, September through December, okay.  And what, were there other black participants in this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they were, they tried to make it fairly well integrated.  There was one guy named Jerry Mondesire [Jerome W. Mondesire HM], who I still keep in touch with.  He was, he went on to become a journalist, and then he worked for Congressman Bill Gray for a while.  And now he runs his own newspaper in Philadelphia.  It's called the Philly Sun.  It's like a black newspaper.  It comes out on Sundays, I think, and a few others whose names I don't recall, and I don't keep in touch with them.  And so there were, I don't know.  There might have been, you know, it might have been a third black.  I mean they made a, I think they made a point to try to have a good representation of black folks in that program 'cause like I said, there were only 12 or 15 of us.  And there was a black assistant director, who, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so there was a, there was a guy named Julius Duscha who was a former Washington Post person who was the director and then a guy named Art, Julius and Art--I've forgotten Art's last name.  But he was like a veteran black reporter.  And he was the assistant director.  And so, yeah, they--and, in fact, I think, the way I learned about this, I think it was a little announcement in some black publication.  It might have been JET or somewhere.  So they definitely made a point of having--
Speaker 1: Maybe, you think it might have been Black World or Negro Digest?
Speaker 2: It could have been, but I think it--I don't think it was because I had--my mom first saw this announcement.  And I don't think she, she wasn't into Black World or Black Digest.  But I don't think, well, it might not have been Jet.  In any case, wherever it was, they put, I think it was in some black publication, they'd put a little announcement about this Washington journalism fellowship program.  And so, and so, you know, yeah, I was accepted.  It was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 95442
Speaker 1: So, so back in Detroit [Michigan], now, you were at the Detroit News for, from--
Speaker 2: Well, I was at the Detroit News as a full-time reporter, I guess, from--well, I think I started in May of '71 [1971], having graduated in April of '71 [1971].  And then I had a leave, so I was still actually at the News--I wasn't on the payroll.  I had an unpaid leave, but I was still considered part of the Detroit News from September through December of '71 [1971].  Then I returned and I think I left in, I think I left in August of '72 [1972] to go get a graduate degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to the University of Michigan, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --to get a degree in public policy, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell us what our motivation was here?
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to the Washington Journalism Center, I really became aware of the importance of economics in the development of public policy.  Now, I still wanted to be a journalist, but I wanted to know more about public policy.  And so I thought about going to the University of Michigan to get a Masters in public, in economics.  But when I went there, and I talked, I must have been talking with somebody in the economics department, and I told him what I was interested in doing, and I told him I was interested in being a, still being a reporter, but I just wanted to know more about public policy.  He referred me to the Institute for Public Policy Studies, which I had not heard of before.  And I went and talked with them, and they gave me, you know, a full ride for two years.  And so this was a program, it wasn't public administration, but it was really more about the development of public policy.  And so I got my Masters in public policy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was in Ann Arbor for two years.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have, who was your advisor?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't recall those names too much.  I thought the Institute was, you know, it wasn't as good as it could have been.  I think, I think places like the University of Michigan, you know, ride on the research that their Ph.D.s do and not on teaching.  And so I liked Ann Arbor more than the University of Michigan (laughter).  And so, maybe that's why I don't really remember too many of the professors.  In fact, I remember one that, who was--now, I'm actually forgetting his name, but he was chairman, I think, of the Council of Economic Advisors under Johnson [President Lyndon B. Johnson], I guess--or maybe not Johnson.  It might have been Johnson.  Anyway, he was a big name in economic circles.  But he really wouldn't talk with us about his practical experiences.  It was all like book learning, all theory.  And for me, that symbolized the University of Michigan.  You can have these folks who are giants in their field, but they're not, might not be very good teachers.  And, and so, you know, I'm glad I went there.  I'm glad I have a Masters in Public Policy, but I also thought it could have been a much better program in terms of, you know, for what I wanted.  It might have been fine for what other students wanted.  But the fact of the matter is, it was a program designed for people who are going to become practitioners in the area of public policy.  I mean like a lot of those people would go to work for the state government or federal or local governments.  They weren't going there just to get a Ph.D., although eventually they started a Ph.D. program, and then teach and become theoreticians.  The people who were there when I was there, at least, they were going there to become public policy practitioners.  And I thought the program could have been geared much better toward that.  And so that's a long way of saying that, I guess that's why I don't really key in, into any of the professors there because I didn't get that much from 'em.
Story_ID: 95443
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, at the--when you're in school, you're not reporting for the Detroit News then?
Speaker 2: I did, I did some freelance work, but just every now and then, you know.  Like I would, I got like on, say the press release from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And so I think at least once or twice, I did some stories that were probably based, a story about some research that maybe a professor was doing.  I think I did a story, for example, on something to do with bats, that some professor there was doing some research.  You know, it was a kind of an interesting subject.  And so I did get that in the paper, you know.  I can remember though, I'll tell you.  This reminded me of it.  When I was at, I was Oakland University [Rochester, Michigan], and we took over the cafeteria, you know, I had already been working at the "Detroit News" in the summers, and they wanted me to report on it.  And I felt so conflicted because I didn't feel comfortable reporting on this takeover that I was a part of.  And not just for journalistic reasons that I was part of an activity and they wanted me to take, to report on it because obviously, there's a journalistic conflict from that, but there was also this kind of racial consciousness conflict.  I didn't wanna feel like I was in a sense kind of telling on my compatriots or something.  And I think I actually tore up my press card, you know, out of this sense of, because of this sense of conflict.  And I didn't write about that takeover.  And, you know, in retrospect, I probably could have in some ways, I mean I could have talked to like the other black student leaders and said, you know, this is what the Detroit News wants me to do, you know.  And they have been fine with it, you know.  It's not like I was pressured not to talk to Detroit News.  They may have welcomed it (laughter), may have welcomed that kind of publicity.  So, and I could have talked to the Detroit News about, you know, it's really not appropriate for me to report on this 'cause I'm a part of it.  So there were probably ways I could have dealt with it, but, you know, I just--it was just a, you know, it was just an internal conflict for me, you know, for a couple of reasons; didn't have that problem and nothing like that developed in grad school.  And, you know, so I did write some, you know, just basic feature stories, just, you know, while I was in grad school for the Detroit News.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 95444
Speaker 1: Yeah, representation's always an issue in reporting, like who do, you know--I guess if you go, when you go to the black community, you know, who you represent or think you're representing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum--
Speaker 1: --is important.
Speaker 2: There can be an issue.  And also, this is mostly in undergrad school, but I'm, but not only during then.  I was, well, actually, after I got out of school, I was with an organization called Project BAIT, Black Awareness in Television and Radio.  And we had a, we had five hours on the NPR affiliate in Detroit, WDET, five hours on Saturday afternoon, and a TV show on Channel 50, which at that time was Kaiser Broadcasting.
Speaker 1: This is David Rambo, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know, David, huh?  Oh, good.  Yeah, David is very--and he's still doing, keep in touch with him occasionally by email.  And that's where Lois, where I met Lois Owens who later lived in Chicago [Illinois], who was involved in that puppet troupe for a while.  But, you know, I was, I focused on initially reading African news on the radio program, and then I joined the TV folks, and, you know, we would wear dashikis on the air, and we'd interview people and do African news, not just African news, but a kind of black-focused news.  And, and so that was, you know, another kind of expression of black consciousness and also the use of my journalistic skills.  So I was able to marry the two there, and so that was good.  And when I moved to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which I guess we'll get to later, I also formed a black chapter there, and had a radio program in Philly.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you know Ron Scott?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I still talk--I saw Ron a few years ago, but, I guess I saw him here for the Million Man March, but I talk with him every now and then, every few years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you ever write anything for the Detroit--what is it the Detroit Citizen, the Michigan Citizen or the--
Speaker 2: The Michigan Chronicle?
Speaker 1: Chronicle, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in, really in high school, I think I wrote a few things for them, just things like related to what maybe students were doing or something like that, maybe two or three articles.
Story_ID: 95445
Speaker 1: You were with Detroit News until '82 [1982].  Is there anything significant that happened?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't at Detroit News until '82 [1982] 'cause I moved--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Philadelphia in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Oh, did you?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, yeah, so after I--like I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I guess that was probably in August of '72' [1972] [sic, 1974].  And that was the last I worked for the Detroit News.  After I got my Masters, I couldn't get hired back at the Detroit News.  They had a hiring freeze on, and I would have gone back to the Detroit News, but I had to look elsewhere for a job.  And so I ended up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the Philadelphia Bulletin in '74' [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a now defunct paper, right, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It went out in the '80s [1980s], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '82 [1982], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do at Philadelphia Evening Bulletin?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a good time.  Philadelphia is a good city.  I enjoyed living in Philadelphia, got married while I was living there.  But it was from--I got married to a woman, not my current wife, but I was married to a woman who I actually met through Project Bait who was also, she was getting her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.  But in any case, at the Philadelphia Bulletin, I did some general assignment, but my first real beat was working in neighborhoods, the neighborhood beat.  And so that allowed me to learn Philadelphia and really appreciate that this is a city where neighborhoods mean something.  Everybody knows the name of their (laughter) neighborhood in Philadelphia, unlike me in Detroit when, you know, you only know the name of a few neighborhoods.  And the neighborhoods have different characteristics and so my beat was just writing about these neighborhoods.  It was a great beat, you know, it went all over the city, just really talking with people about neighborhood kinds of stories and doing neighborhood profiles.  But then I went to City Hall, and I was a City Hall reporter for a number of years, eventually was City Hall Bureau Chief.  I can remember one time I think in line to be a City Hall Bureau Chief, and they brought in somebody over me, and I really was seriously thinking about filing a discrimination case.  But then this guy bombed so much that they pulled him out and they did make me City Hall Bureau Chief.
Story_ID: 95446
Speaker 1: And this was when Rizzo, you know, Rizzo was in office, and--
Speaker 2: Frank Rizzo, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so, you know, between the time when I was covering--before I was Bureau Chief, I was covering City Council, and I was covering Rizzo and others, and then after him, after he left as well.  But I mean it was (laughter), covering Philadelphia City Hall was a riot.  I mean sometimes you talk about, you know, how the, you know, rights on the council floor, and you mean legislative fights.  In Philadelphia, the members of the council had fist fights, you know (laughter).  And there were a couple of occasions where it was like a little mini-riot in the City Hall Council chamber.  And not just from protesters, but from the members of council duking it out.  Abscam, you know, big political scandal that involved a lot of East Coast politicians.  It was really centered in Philadelphia.  They go the City Council president, got the majority leader--
Speaker 2: So what was Abscam?  Was it--
Speaker 1: Abscam was a situation where the FBI agents posed as some Arab sheiks and were trying to bribe political officials.  And they got people in New Jersey, maybe New York, but certainly Philadelphia and New Jersey, got a number of folks on tape taking money.  There was a, there was one, I think he was in the state legislature--well, no, I guess maybe he was a member of Congress at that time.  He, a guy named, I think it was Michael Myers or Marty Myers.  (Laughter) His famous quote from being on tape was, what was it, "Money talks, bullshit walks" or something like that (laughter).  And so that's how he became known (laughter).  But they got several politicians in Philadelphia and New Jersey, you know, on tape, taking money.  And so it was a very volatile time to be in Philadelphia because Rizzo, of course, he was just a racist politician, you know, he was in, he was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, his statute that's out in front of Philadelphia City Hall--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --a very, great big--with his hand outstretched,--
Speaker 1: Right, so--
Speaker 2: --like he was the friendliest guy in the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, I mean he, you know, he tried to run for a third term against the charter, and he really tried to kind of, yeah, kind of arouse, I think, racial tensions to help bring out his base.  He lost that, fortunately.
Speaker 2: There was another fellow in the news during those days, a guy named Tony Imperialli (ph.) or something.  He had like a vigilante group--
Speaker 1: Tony Imperalli, I don't recall that.
Speaker 2: You remember him?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing something about that on "60-Minutes".  But, well, at any rate, it was--Philadelphia had a lot of racial tension.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was, you know, strong, ethnic neighborhoods, you know, among the white population.  And, of course, the black folks in North Philly and South Philly and West Philly, and I mean it--so it was, and, you know, and this strong kind of, you know, Black Nationalist and Pan Africanist crowd too.  And so Philly was a very dynamic city in a number of ways.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 95447
Speaker 1: Now, you taught at Temple [University] too during this time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught at Temple.  And, but I taught--my class, I did teach on campus, I guess, maybe one semester.  But I thought, I think more often down at their downtown extension.  And there you had a lot of working people, a number whom really I don't think had any interest in being journalist.  They maybe wanted to know how to write memos better (laughter) and stuff like that.  Yeah, but so, it was just in the downtown office building.  So in that, for those classes, I really didn't get a sense of the campus very much.
Story_ID: 95448
Speaker 1: Now, one of the icons of black journalism, Chuck Stone [HM]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in those days, and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --he's somebody who had a national presence, and what was your relationship with Chuck Stone?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we both are founding members of the National Association of Black Journalists.  He was the first president and very instrumental in founding it, as was Paul Brock [HM] 'cause they kind of, together kind of brought a number of the rest of us together.  The, you know, so (unclear) my relationship with Chuck was okay, but I thought, he wrote some columns that were, and which for some reason he really dumped on Claude Lewis, if I recall correctly.  It seemed like for a while his columns just took, started taking a vicious tone.  And Claude Lewis was a columnist, a black columnist at the Philadelphia Bulletin.  And I remember just mentioning that to Chuck, how I didn't like that or something to that effect at a meeting.  And that kind of cooled our relationship, and also, within NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], we passed a rule early on that you could only be, going to be president for one term.  And it was also, it was clearly aimed at Chuck at that point, and, because he had really--you know, we felt like he had-- I remember there was a time when--there was a show called "Black Perspective" on the news, which was a national show on PBS, done out of Philadelphia.  It was a Meet the Press-type format.  And Reggie Bryant and Acel Moore [HM] produced the show.  And Reggie was the host.  I remember Chuck trying to undermine that show, and he later got a show on PBS that was, kind of took that place, took the place of Reggie and Acel's show.  And so a number of black journalists were kind of turned off by that activity.  And, but later we became on good terms, I mean I--decent terms at least because I thought, you know, I was definitely part of those who voted essentially against Chuck in limiting the presidency to one term.  And I didn't regret the vote, but I felt we went about it in a way that was more personal than it needed to be and that the vote should have been more on principle than personality.  And so I later took Chuck out to lunch to explain that to him and to say, you know, basically, I was sorry it went down the way it did, even though I thought the objective made sense.  But it didn't need to be focused on him as an individual.  And so, you know, in later years, you know, we were cool.  But I didn't really see him that much, just every now and then.  He really wouldn't come to NABJ very much.  But he has been back, but just not frequently.  And whenever I saw him, you know, we'd be good.  And so, you know, the relationship with Chuck, you know, had its ups and downs, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I always, you know, I certainly respected much of what he did as a journalist 'cause I thought that he would try to, I think--you know, he definitely had his ear to the ground in the community, you know, to the point that it, probably became most famous for fugitives turning themselves in to Chuck, you know, these folks who were on the run from the cops would turn themselves in to Chuck, and he would escort 'em to the police.  And so clearly he had the confidence, I mean he did this a number of times (laughter).  And so clearly, he had the confidence of the people right down on the ground, if you're gonna, you know, you're going to have people coming to you to turn themselves in.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  There was a fellow in Chicago [Illinois] who had a similar kind of reputation.
Story_ID: 95449
Speaker 1: But, any other black journalists in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that we need to talk about from that period?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, a good friend of mine is Elmer Smith.  We covered City Hall together.  I mentioned Acel [Moore HM] and Reggie, Chuck [Stone HM], Jerry Mondesire [Jerome W. Mondesire HM] was there then.  He's still there.  There were some folks on TV, Malcolm Poindexter.  There were some other folks.  I guess I can't really recall at the moment.  Of course, on the radio, not journalists, but people like Georgie Woods and Mary Mason.  They were communicators and very powerful forces within the black community in terms of, you know, they would have morning kind of talk and music shows and people would come on the air and, you know, talk about various political and community activities.  So they were very important communicators, although (laughter) they certainly weren't journalists, but they were (unclear) [damn good] communicators, you know.  And a lot of, you know, a lot of disc jockeys, you know, played that role in black cities.  They had a guy--a woman named Martha Jean McQueen in Detroit [Michigan] who kind of played that role, you know.  And, yeah, so, I mean and Philly was, Philly was good in a number of ways like that, and it was a--the Philadelphia chapter at the time was called "Association of Black Journalists," it was really instrumental in forming the National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that came first before the national association in Philly?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because like Chuck was president of the Philadelphia association.  And the, you know, basically, the founding documents of the National Association were based on the Philadelphia, like bylaws.  So, yeah, Philadelphia was definitely instrumental in the development of the National Association of Black Journalists.  And I was the president of the Philadelphia association--this was certainly after Chuck, you know, a few years after that.
Story_ID: 95450
Speaker 1: And, well, one thing of note, are you familiar with the case Mumia Abu-Jamal [born Wesley Cook]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, when he was accused of shooting a policemen, Office [Daniel] Danny Faulkner, he was actually president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists at the time this happened.  And I was the incoming president.  And so a lot of the fall out basically fell on me.  And it didn't just fall on me.  I mean I took it all on myself to--'cause still I wasn't president yet, but so the, whoever the vice president was could have done some of these things.  But I, I liked basically organized us to, organized a defense fund for Mumia.  And, you know, took a very active role in--well, we never claimed that he was innocent, but we like really did things like pushing for a fair trial and trying to raise money for his defense fund and, you know, things like that.  And so that was pretty, that was also a very interesting time because, you know, it--some journalists really didn't want to be associated with the association at that point because here was the president of the association having been arrested and later convicted for killing a police officer.  So it was a very difficult time (laughter ) for--
Speaker 2: What year is this?  This is in the '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in the '80s [1980s].  Let me think.  I can, and certainly I can find exactly, but I was, well, I was still at the [Philadelphia] Bulletin, so it had to be before '82 [1982] because that's when the Bulletin closed.  It was probably, it might have been '80 [1980].  I don't remember the exact year, but it was probably around 1980 [sic, Abu-Jamal was convicted in 1982].
Story_ID: 95451
Speaker 1: Okay, another thing is the election of [Reverend W.] Wilson Goode [HM].  That took place in what, '84 [1984] or so [sic, Goode was elected in 1983 and took office in 1984]?
Speaker 2: Let's see, election of '80 [1980].  Well, I was still in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] 'cause actually, Wilson Goode at one point offered me a job.
Speaker 1: Wilson Goode being elected Mayor of Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, so that also had to be--I left Philly in '84 [1984], so that might have been, he might have been elected around '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any reflections about the election of Mayor Goode had just finished with, I guess with Frank Rizzo?  Was there anybody between Rizzo and Wilson Goode?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, Green, a guy named Bill Green [William J. Green, III].  And I also covered him as a reporter.  But, you know, in some ways, I have more memories of a guy named Charlie Bowser running for mayor.  He was also a black guy.  He didn't, I think he must have been running when Bill Green got in.  But in any way, that was an election that really galvanized, you know, like the black community in Philadelphia.  But he lost, and then I think Bill Green came in.  He had been a member of Congress, and I was still covering City Hall, and then, you know, it was just a very--Philadelphia is just a very political town, very political town with, you know, kind of Chicago [Illinois] was a "machine" town in those days with your committeemen and your ward, I mean your ward leaders and then on a lower level, the committeemen.  And, you know, these were like, kind of like bosses (unclear) literally, and they had their little fiefdoms, and you had the committee chairman would be the political boss along with the mayor.  And so, you had that whole dynamic which we really didn't have in Detroit [Michigan].  And so that was, you know, covering Philly was a very interesting time, I mean because this was during a period when we had the community development block grants, and the Feds, I got a lot of great stories out of the Feds because like the, they were always on the Rizzo administration for not spending money in North Philadelphia.  I mean Rizzo, you know, Rizzo was a pig.  I mean he was (laughter), he could have been, you know, if he weren't Italian, he could have been some sheriff down in Alabama (laughter).  And but he became mayor and basically still had the same attitude.  And so--
Speaker 1: I mean the dynamic of this is the finest thing--correct me if I'm wrong.  Government, you know, doles out the block grants to the cities, but the, it goes to the city government--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --to then disperse to the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have different projects in the neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: So they may ask for the money under one pretext, but once they get it, then--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it could be used for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they, and so the Feds would always claim that they weren't, that the Rizzo administration was not adequately spending the money, you know, basically to help poor people.
Speaker 1: And these are the poor black people in North Philly?
Speaker 2: Yeah, largely.  I mean it wasn't, the money wasn't solely for North Philly, but that was the most needy part of town.  And, you know, I got a lot of good stories because I was basically the only reporter who would go to, I guess it was HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and ask for any documents.  And they would periodically write these letters, you know, to the city government, explaining the short comings in the city government's program.  And I would just, you know, I would just ask, you know, have you had any communications with the city?  And I'd probably have to send a letter to the Feds or basically a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act], but it's pretty simple.  And I'd go down there and I'd get the letters, and I'd have a great story because they would lay this, all this stuff right in the letter.  And but, you know, that was the way that Rizzo's administration rolled.  I mean they were not, they didn't care about black folks anyway (laughter).  They had a few token black folks, and they wouldn't even treat them well.  I mean it was really a, (laughter) it was really incredible, you know.  But it was a good time to be in Philly for a newspaper reporter.  At one point, we had four daily newspapers in Philadelphia, which was, nowadays, boy, it's hard to find.
Story_ID: 95452
Speaker 1: So you, by the time [HM Reverend W. Wilson] Goode was elected, you were with the Enquirer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was with the Inquirer.  I wasn't actually with the Inquirer very long.  But, yeah, I was with the Inquirer for a while he was mayor.  And also, he was managing director of the city under Bill Green.  That's when I got to know Wilson Goode because he was, as managing director, his job was kind of it says.  He was basically over all of the city departments.
Speaker 1: And so this wasn't, this was his ascending to a position, not--it wasn't like a popular grass-root movement like it was with the, with [Charles] Bowser, right?
Speaker 2: I think that's probably fair.  I think he did have, he clearly had the support of the black community and the community as a whole.  But he kind of, but he had been appointed, you know, to this high position in city government and then used that to run for mayor.  And, you know, I never thought that Wilson Goode had kind of the same level of people skills as somebody like a Charlie Bowser or many of the other politicians, people like a Hardy Williams, who was a state rep or really a David Richardson, another state rep who was really, you know, right down with the people.  Wilson Goode was more of an administrator.  And then he ended up burning up a neighborhood.
Story_ID: 95453
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that's, that's interesting.  Now, this is the MOVE event you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, as a, from your vantage point, what happened?  What happened because we've heard, I've heard different stories about what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, by the time that happened, I was here in Washington [D.C.].  I had been in, I was in Philly for another MOVE confrontation.  This was when [Frank] Rizzo was mayor.  And the city ended up tearing down the house that they lived in which certainly was better than burning down the whole neighborhood (laughter), which you know [HM Reverend W.] Wilson Goode did.  But I did go back to cover it.  I was working for the Wall Street Journal, and I went back to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to cover this issue with the neighborhood going up in flames.  And, you know, he had a, he approved the police department dropping some sort of incendiary device, essentially a bomb into the MOVE house.  Now, you know, I think it was supposed to be like a big teargas thing.  I mean I don't think it was supposed to set the house on fire.  But I'm not clear about that at the moment.  But it did set the house on fire.  And it then spread, you know, to many other houses along the block.  And I don't recall why, but they basically let those houses burn down.  I guess, I think their official reason was, there were still people in the MOVE house, and I guess they were afraid that these MOVE people would shoot even at the firemen, and which was--could have been a possibility.  But in any case, the bottom line is, this fire started after the police dropped this device into the MOVE house, and caught it on fire, and the fire was allowed to spread, you know, through--I've forgotten how many houses, 15 or 20 houses on the block.  And, of course, the people were outraged.  I mean it was, I mean I, it's still unimaginable to me that they would then reelect him.  I don't know how you can elect somebody, a mayor who's gonna burn down a neighborhood.  But they did.
Speaker 1: I think there was some confusion about what actually happened 'cause when we talked to him, if I recall correctly--this was back in 2002, he said that someone in the police department or fire department, you know, did that without his authorization.  That's what he, what it was--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember that.  I do remember him saying at a press conference, if I had it to do over again, I would do the same thing.  And I was so glad I didn't go to work for him 'cause I wouldn't have been able to stay, you know.  It was disgusting.  It was disgusting.  But, yeah, that was, I can remember going back and writing about that and the first lead on my story was that this was the first bombing on American soil since Pearl Harbor.  But I didn't stay with that lead because it seemed--I talked to like some military historian, and there might have been some totally unknown case.  It wasn't something I could be absolutely positively sure about.  But it, you know, I still probably could have kept the lead had I said this was something like the most notable bombing on American soil since Pearl Harbor (laughter), and it really was.
Story_ID: 95454
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, well, tell us about going to Washington [D.C.].  Now, you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, let's see, how did I get to Washington?  Okay, after the [Philadelphia] Bulletin closed, I joined the Philadelphia Inquirer, and I worked for the City Hall, City Hall Bureau Chief, when it closed, and proud to have the front-page story on the last day of the Philadelphia Bulletin.  But then I joined the Inquirer, and that was also good because, I mean good for me personally 'cause a lot of people were without jobs, and they didn't hire, obviously, they couldn't hire everybody.  But they hired me very quickly, and they assigned me to City Hall.  And so, you know, I definitely took that as a sign that I had, that they appreciated my skills as a journalist.  But then a paper started up called the National Leader, which was a national black weekly.  And that started up probably--I think I joined the Philadelphia Inquirer in February.  The National Leader started in, I think around May, and I had a story in the very first issue, which is something else I was proud of.  And then in the fall, in September-October, I was asked to become managing editor of the National Leader.  And, you know, we really were trying to make a first-class national, black weekly paper, which still doesn't exist.
Story_ID: 95455
Speaker 1: Okay, my name is Larry Crowe, interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Joseph Taylor Davidson, J-O-S-E-P-H, T-A-Y-L-O-R, D-A-V-I-D-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a federal diary columnist at the Washington Post.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is, what, March 1, oh, yeah, it's sequester day, March 1, 2013 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And we're at your home, right, in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And we're finishing up an interview that we started in January of this year [2013].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 95456
Speaker 1: And we left off with you on your way to the National Leader, 1982.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been working at the Philadelphia Inquirer after the Philadelphia Bulletin closed.  And I was, I was covering City Hall at the Philadelphia Inquirer and a colleague and friend of mine who had been one of senior editors at the Philadelphia Bulletin had become editor of this paper called the National Leader which was a new paper, a start-up.  It was a national, black weekly.  And it was an attempt to create, you know, a quality journalism product for a national black audience of the type that we didn't really have then, and really still don't have, I don't think.  There were certainly magazines.  There were Jet and Ebony, of course, and Essence, and, you know, those were all fine products for what they were.  But we were trying to create a national, black weekly newspaper.  And so after I'd been at the Inquirer for a few months and actually wrote an article for the initial issue of the National Leader which I think came out in May of 2000--May of 1982, Claude Lewis, who was the editor invited me to become the managing editor of the paper.  He was, and, you know, I was, I was intrigued, wasn't sure at first I wanted to do it because any time you go to a start-up from an established paper like the Philadelphia Inquirer, which by the way had won several Pulitzers.  It really was a very good paper at that time, you know, it was a risk.  But the idea of really being able to serve the black community directly as managing editor of this paper which I felt really was attempting to fill a great need, a great journalistic need within the black community, I just found that very attractive.  And I realized the risks, but I was willing to take it, and I--and so I left the Inquirer and joined the National Leader.  And, you know, it was never really funded adequately.  But, you know, we subscribed to, at that time, UPI was, you know, was competition for AP [Associated Press].  So we subscribed to United Press International, our news service and photographs.  And we would get their copy, and I would often try to write it so that it had a slant that made stories more relevant to the black community.  So, for example, when the unemployment figures would come out, the black unemployment rate was always kind of deep in the story.  Well, I would just rewrite the story to put the black unemployment rate in the lead, you know, to make whatever stories I could more relevant to the black community.  And some stories were obviously already about black-related issues.  And we also had, we also had freelancers.  And so we would commission stories.  And our hope was to really eventually move away from wire stories and have our own staff as the paper grew.  But the paper really didn't grow, and (laughter) and, in fact, it went out of business after a couple of years.  And it was, you know, it was a very good experience though.  I mean it was a very good experience for me, you know, in terms of my journalistic development and in terms of being able to feel like I was really serving the black community, at the same time, performing at a high level journalistically.  And so those things were very important to me, and so, yeah, it was a very important experience.
Story_ID: 95457
Speaker 1: Is there any, any one story or a couple of stories that you remember as being the highlight of your--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I can remember--well, I can, I can--this is an example, I guess, of how we try to, you know, quite frankly and honestly, spin the stories in such a way that it made sense for our audience.  We did a story about black mayors taking over a number of cities at that time.  And it was at a period when there was still a number of cities where they were just having their first black mayor.  And so, the artist drew a, he was drawing a sketch for the cover.  And the sketch was of, basically, kind of depicting the cities in the form of, kind of a broken-down house because it's true that a lot of the cities that were being, that, where they, a lot of the black people who became mayors were taking over cities that were, you know, in some trouble financially.  And when I looked at it, I thought that really what we wanted to do is, we wanted to put a more positive spin on this.  And so in stead of just having a sketch of a broken-down house to depict the city that these--the cities that these mayors were taking over, I had him, you know, change the sketch so that the black mayors were like the carpenters and the roofers, and these people fixing up the house.  And so that definitely put a different spin, you know, on that story.  I can remember when the United States invaded Grenada, and we had the artist draw a picture of a big eagle representing the United States and in its clutches was this little, tiny island of Grenada.  And the slant of the story was that this was, that the United States really had no business going against this little country in the Caribbean that posed absolutely no threat to the United States.  But they invaded it because the United States government, the [President Ronald] Reagan administration at the time, didn't like the ideology of the people who were in, who were running the country at the time.  [door bell ringing] That was just the mailman.  Do we need to stop?
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was Maurice Bishop who is--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who actually campaigned in the U.S., I mean he came over and did an extended tour to try to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --present his case.  I know he was on a lot of different talk shows and--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And it was quite controversial at the time because of his political platform, his ideology, and the way the [President Ronald] Reagan administration basically went after him, eventually to the point of invading the country.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he spent a lot of time trying to be, do some kind of P.R. relationships over here to make sure, I mean to illustrate that he wasn't so dangerous--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know, and that the island needed help actually.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And it was--
Speaker 2: No, so we were, so we depicted that as just really an act of aggression on the cover.  And so we were, I mean we were clear that we were trying to present a high quality, journalistic product, you know, for the national black community.  But it also had, you know it have a, it did have a bit of a slant.  It wasn't, it was ideological.  It wasn't polemic.  It wasn't, you know, Muhammad Speaks or anything.  But it did a slant that deserved--that was designed for, you know, a national, black audience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we had discussed like [HM Reverend W.] Wilson Goode in Philadelphia where you were actually a reporter.  Now, what was the national leaders' take on [Mayor] Harold Washington in Chicago [Illinois].  He was one of the new black mayors, and I think the first one elected in a city that was a (unclear) majority white.
Speaker 2: There were, I mean our article was basically--and I've never an editorial about it, but it was kind of, it was, you know, I think our articles at that time, I won't say celebrated his election, but certainly noted it prominently.  And I can remember, in fact, one of my first, the first time I went on NPR [National Public Radio], it was to talk about--I was national, I was at the National Leader, but it was to talk about Harold Washington's victory.  And so it was really something that was, that people, black people, in particular, around the country were very proud of.  And I think our coverage reflected that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in 1983 when he was elected, yep.  So, well, the National Leader, so those two years at the National Leader, I guess, is about right around--
Speaker 2: Yeah, about two.
Speaker 1: Two, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it may have been--you know, from '82 [1982] to '84 [1984], but it may have been closer to 18 months, you know, 'cause by the time, 'cause it was kind of late in '82 [1982] when I joined it.  And I think, I think it went out of business early in '84 [1984].
Story_ID: 95458
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you're in Washington, D.C. at this point?
Speaker 2: I moved to Washington in '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, but that was--moved to Washington in the, I think in the fall of '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you move to Washington to take a job or to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I moved to Washington to work for the Wall Street Journal.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was, well, part of the way it happened, I think, you know, I was a Pulitzer Prize juror and, twice, and one of those years was '84 [1984].  It must have been '83 [1983] and '84 [1984] or '82 [1982] and '84 [1984].  But one of 'em was in '84 [1984].  And the panel I was on was chaired, I think, by the person who was then the editorial page editor of the Washington Post, I mean, I'm sorry, the Wall Street Journal.  And I also had a friend that I knew from Detroit [Michigan] who at that time was working for the, for the Wall Street Journal here in D.C.  And so between the two of 'em, I kind of got my name in the mix at the Wall Street Journal.  And I got a call inviting me to apply.  I was very surprised, and, 'cause I wasn't a reader (laughter) of the Wall Street Journal.  And I wanted to move to Washington 'cause I was interested in national and international affairs, interested in government.  And I had two job offers at the time, in Washington, one for Knight Ridder which at the time owned a lot of papers, including two in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Detroit Free Press at the time and numerous other papers, Miami Herald and one from the Wall Street Journal.  And I actually took the Knight Ridder offer, turned down the Wall Street Journal, and Al Hunt who was bureau chief basically called me up and changed my mind.  And so I ended up coming to the, I ended up coming to the Wall Street Journal, and I think it, you know, ultimately, was the right decision.
Speaker 1: So what was the aspect that changed your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, part of it, I guess, was just the personal appeal, you know, Al Hunt is not a guy to, you know, you can easily say no to.  And, you know, he's one of these journalistic powers in D.C.  And I think I just really appreciated you know the interests he took, the time he took to talk me into coming.  You know, I mean it's--a lot of times if things are close, and an individual from one of the organizations makes a direct personal appeal, that can make a lot of difference, you know.  I think political candidates find that out too, which is why going door-to-door still can count in elections because it's the personal appeal that can make a difference.  And so I ended up going to the Wall Street Journal.
Story_ID: 95459
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, now what did you, position did you take at the [Wall Street] Journal?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a number of different beats.  When I first got there, I was covering education and health issues.  I later covered housing and then I went to South Africa, and even while I was doing some of these domestic agencies, I went back and forth to South Africa a couple of times at least.  And I, I was posted in South Africa for about a year.  It was in '91 [1991], a little bit of '92 [1992].  And then when I came back from South Africa, I covered the Justice Department.  And I also did some campaigns during the election years.  I followed [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson in 1988.  And so that was quite an experience, of course, and some of the smaller agencies, I think the, what is the consumer protection--I've forgotten the full name of the commission.  It was a Consumer Protection Commission that I covered, covered FDA for a while.  But it was a number of domestic agencies, plus South Africa, plus the Justice Department.
Story_ID: 95460
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were you in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released?
Speaker 2: I actually got there just like a couple of days afterward.  My plan was to be there when he was released, but by the time, from the point they announced it to the time he was released actually happened so quickly that I got there a couple of days after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first trip, however, was in 1986, which was before he was released.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], isn't that when the student uprising took place in some place, Soweto?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very hot.
Speaker 1: Steve Biko and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that was in, no, that had to be before that.  I think that might have been, was it '76 [1976]?  I think it was before that 'cause it wasn't that year.  But it was still very hot, it was very hot.  And so, yeah, I was there then, and I went to an ANC conference, African National Congress conference in Tanzania and maybe in '87 [1987] or something.  And then I--but then I, and then when Mandela was released, like I say, I got there two or three days after he was released, but covered that, you know, went, covered everything that surrounded that and interviewed him at his home in Soweto, along with a number of other journalists.  I mean it was in a small group, the way they were doing it, a small group of journalists were interviewing him 'cause it was so--people from all over the world.  And so I stayed and wrote about that, and then went back in '91 [1991] and lived there.  I was posted there as a foreign correspondent till the first part of '92 [1992].  And then I went back for his election [Mandela], and I stayed there then for like two or three months.
Speaker 1: This is like '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and been back, I guess, two or three times since.
Story_ID: 95461
Speaker 1: Okay, so any reflections about South African society in comparison to African American life here?
Speaker 2: Well, and I've become very fond of South Africa after all of these trips, and, you know, I think it's an amazing place in many ways, which is not to say it doesn't have a lot of problems 'cause it still does, but it's, nonetheless, I think an amazing place.  You know, one of the things that impressed me, you know, certainly when I was there the first time was, you know, how serious the people were about freedom and liberation.  It reminded me of the Civil Rights Movement, you know, in the United States.  But these folks had to totally disband a form of government and then create a new government.  It was quite an undertaking.  And they did it with such a sense of purpose and sense or principle that it was, it's really just an incredible story.  In fact, I just interviewed, in February of this year, a guy named Frank Chicany [ph.] who was one of leaders of the movement, who'd been jailed and tortured.  And he was here in [Washington] D.C., and I interviewed him and talked about some people we knew in common.  But, you know, the will and the strength of the South African people in their liberation movement, I think it's just very, very impressive.  And so it was, that whole South African experience had a very strong influence on me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the movement there is similar to the movement here--I mean the feeling of the movement?
Speaker 2: Well, in some ways.  I mean, you know, it's, I mean if you look at some of the history, for example, one of the first movements or acts that [Nelson] Mandela was involved in, back in the early 1940s was a bus boycott.  And when you think about, you know, Civil Rights history of the United States, when you think about an early action, it was the bus boycott with Rosa Parks.  And so, yeah, when you learn about that history, you can see some of these, some of these connections.  But like I was saying, there's also clearly some differences because in the United States, black people had the Constitution on their side, even if it was a struggle to get that Constitution interpreted as it should be.  Still the Constitution was on the side of, of not just black people, but on the side of democracy for everyone.  And so that led to the Voting Rights Act, and it was on the side of, basically, of human rights, which meant that, you know, segregation couldn't withstand the Constitution, eventually (laughter).  Obviously, it took some time for that to happen, but eventually, the Constitution essentially overruled the type of Apartheid and the type of racist system that prevailed in much of this country, and all over this country in various degrees.  In South Africa, it was different because the Constitution and the entire governmental structure, not just in practice, but also in theory, was against the black people.  I mean it was, they carried racism to bizarre levels.  I mean in the, they essentially said under Apartheid, that they didn't have a race problem because they didn't have black people who were citizens of South Africa.  They created these little Bantustans, you know, these little homelands.  And so even if you lived, say outside of Jo-Burg [Johannesburg], all of your life, theoretically, you were really a citizen of like the Siskei (ph.) or Transkei, these remote places where they could say that you were a citizen, and they're totally make-believe countries that South Africa created within the boundaries of South Africa.  So that the South Africa regime could say that these black people were really citizens of another country so therefore, they didn't have rights to vote and everything within South Africa.  And so in South Africa, they had, you know, they have what they would--called at the time, the Grand Apartheid and the Petite Apartheid.  And Petite Apartheid was more like Jim Crowe, you know, it was segregation.  But this Grand Apartheid was the notion of the Bantustans.  So they essentially defined away a race problem by defining black people as citizens of these make-believe countries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I thought they took it to bizarre levels.
Speaker 1: So having a pass, just like having a passport, to leave your country to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --go into, you know, to where the jobs were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was, and so, obviously, the people of South Africa, had a whole nother level of, of conflict and oppression to deal with because they couldn't simply go to the court and say, you know, under the laws of the United States, we are being treated unfairly, and we demand that the Constitution be enforced, and so we can be treated fairly.  You know, that argument didn't mean anything in South Africa because the Constitution and the whole government wasn't, I mean there was nothing there, not even in theory for them.  So they had to replace all of that.  It's amazing really.
Story_ID: 95462
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you followed, you did some reporting on the Justice Department, you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I covered the Justice Department.  That's when I came back from South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, and followed [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson's campaign in 1988?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, Jesse Jackson's campaign in '88 [1988], there wasn't the same kind of expectation that he would, you know, do anything phenomenal in '88' [1988], as I remember as it was in '84 [1984], but it was still significant from a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I, he was never really expected to win.  But I think that the 1988 campaign, you know, certainly, he certainly generated a lot of activity, and generated a lot of attention.  He generated a lot of enthusiasm among black people, among white people.  I can remember flying into a remote Indian reservation in Montana.  And so he generated a lot of interests and a lot of activity and enthusiasm in '88 [1988], but clearly, he wasn't expected to win.  But he, but the '88 [1988] campaign, I think, was very, you know, I thought it was a very good campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, I think it was, that was the campaign where George Herbert Walker Bush ran against Michael Dukakis, I think, in the general election eventually, you know, after--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, it was Dukakis, yeah, it was '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 1: So what was the highlight of that campaign as far as you're concerned in terms of Jesse Jackson?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the, I think a highlight was seeing the kind of reaction and the level of enthusiasm that he generated at his rallies and how people, particularly black people, but not only black people, were just so happy to see him and to wish him well and wish him support.  It was really kind of energizing to see that.  And, you know, he did a lot with a little bit of money.  I mean if you, you know, if you could say how many votes he got her dollar spent, he probably did better than (laughter) all of the other candidates.  And so I think in that re--that came from this enthusiasm that he was able to generate.  And so that's one of the, I think, lasting memories and impressions from me, is just how he could really fire up people and get them excited.  That was, I mean it was, it was good to see that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tend to remember him sort of dominating the debates even--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, he did on different occasions.  That's true.  Yeah, I mean he clearly would, you know, I can remember there was some foreign policy debate, and he talked about how, you know, they talked about this place and that place without ever talking about Africa, you know.  So he would--one of the importance, I think, of his campaign is that he raised issues that wouldn't have been raised otherwise.  And so I thought that it was, I thought it was good.  Obviously, he's a, he had some flaws, I think, as we all do and some of his flaws became very public.  But, but I thought that, I thought that '88 [1988] campaign was a real, kind of energizing experience for much of black America and many other people as well.
Story_ID: 95463
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you were at The Wall Street Journal until 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what happened in '97 [1997] that you, that you left The Wall Street Journal?
Speaker 2: Well, now, this is from my perspective.  I mean they basically, we got a new, a different bureau chief.  And for whatever reason, you know, things stopped clicking.  It really stopped clicking for me.  And, you know, it was--Al Hunt was no longer the bureau chief.  And, you know, I guess, honestly, I'm not sure.  But it was clear that my time was up there.  And they made it clear that my time was up.  And so I left and began to do--well, I was already teaching at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I had taught at Howard and at Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], journalism, did more teaching, but I did more journalism consulting, journalism training.  And after a while, I also--oh, and I did, well, not too long after I left, I did some consulting for Rainbow/PUSH.  I edited magazine and a newsletter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the whole thing about leaving The Wall Street Journal was, you know, it was, I guess I felt like it was a real, kind of low point because I felt that I was treated unfairly.  But, you know, you know how things happen.  Things turn around, and now it's, you know, like the Washington Post now I think is a much better fit for me.  And so had I not left The Wall Street Journal, I might not be in the position where I am now.  So things have a way of working out.
Story_ID: 95464
Speaker 1: All right, so Wall Street Journal.  Now, you left in '97 [1997], and that was like three years after the Republican Revolution in Congress where they took over Congress and put the heat on the [President Bill] Clinton administration, and it was like three years before the Monica Lewinsky scandal and all the, you know, the impeachment and all that other stuff.  So there's a right-wing surge in Washington, political circles, and how--was the Wall Street Journal, how did they position themselves around that?
Speaker 2: Well, on the news side, it was--let me start this way.  The editorial page was very supportive of Republicans.  It's always been a very Republican and very conservative editorial page.  But certainly when I was there, there was no attempt to influence the news coverage, and, in fact, sometimes there were reports of tension between the Washington [D.C.] bureau and New York, you know, over different aspects of coverage.  But there was never any attempt to influence what we wrote from a political point of view.  And there were times when our articles, the articles that, say I might write about education or health care, certainly differed in approach or in tone than the editorials.  Now, I mean I wasn't writing editorials.  I was writing straight news, but clearly the kinds of things that we presented didn't necessary go hand-in-hand, and often conflicted with the kinds of information you get on the editorial page.  And so we would just, you know, write various stories about what, you know, to illustrate what was going on.  And so it might be about, I might be writing about Medicare or I was going around the country to look at schools.  I remember going to South Carolina to write about a school district there, just to illustrate what was going on in education.  And so it was, you know, it was, you know, it was very--obviously, it was kind of an interesting time in Washington.  All times in some ways (laughter) are interesting in Washington.  But, but the conservatives were really kind of, they were feeling their oats, as we used to say.  And [President Ronald] Reagan, of course, was a, he was an enormous influence and still is, even in death after many years, enormous influence on the Republican Party.  And so they were, you know, they were feeling good.  But it, in a sense it just gave us, you know, more to write about, even if on an individual level.  We didn't particular like their policies.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So there isn't any particular incident that caused you, except the new--the leaving of Al Hunt and the new supervision--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is, yeah, it was basically, I mean leaving the, leaving The Wall Street Journal for whatever reason, they seemed like that, after Al Hunt left, they were just not at all satisfied with my work.  I honestly don't, I mean I honestly can't pin it down more strongly than that.  But, you know, they gave me a good amount of money to go basically, and so, I took it (laughter).  And, and then I had some good experiences after that.  But I was also anxious to get back in the newspapers 'cause I really, you know, I kind of identify myself as a newspaperman.  And I don't know how much longer (laughter) they'll have newspapers around (laughter) to be able to do that.  But, no I identify myself as a newspaperman.  So after I had, you know, done a number of things, like I said, doing some consulting and worked for the Joint Center for Political Economic Studies where I edited a magazine, you know, I was glad to go back to the newspaper business at the Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were telling me off camera that you did some consulting with Rainbow/PUSH--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You were on the news, "All Things Considered", "News and Notes" and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did a number of things for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Teaching, you know, at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did a number of things on NPR [National Public Radio].  I was, I did, well, I did, like before I moved to D.C., I was, I did commentaries, more or less regularly, on "Morning Edition".  And then after leaving the Wall Street Journal, I then did more stuff again for NPR.  I really didn't do much of that for NPR when I was at the Wall Street Journal.  But I did some commentaries for "All Things Considered", and I was on a program called "News and Notes", you know, doing political analysis and analyzing news and, you know, continue to do stuff for NPR from time to time.  I was on "Tell Me More" recently, you know, and Michelle Martin's show.  And so [cough].  Excuse me, and so, yeah, I did a number of things like that.  And I was doing the editing at Rainbow/PUSH, actually kind of recreated one of their magazines.  They had a magazine that really wasn't very good, and so I kind of redid the magazine and then edited the magazine and edited a newsletter.
Story_ID: 95466
Speaker 1: And then eventually I went to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, how did the position at Joint Center come about?  I mean what happened?
Speaker 1: Well, the--when I was at the Wall Street Journal, there was a woman in New York named Denise Dugah [ph.] who wasn't on the news side, although she did have title of, I think, publisher of the "Asian Wall Street Journal".  And then she went to the Joint Center as VP for Communications.  And she, you know, she wanted me to come in and do their magazine.  It was really kind of more like a newsletter, but we called it a magazine.  And I had first said, no, and part of it was, at the time, my mom was living with me here.  And she lived here with me for the last, I think it's six years of her life.  And it was easier for me to work at home, you know, doing consulting.  But she died in 2001, and, in August.  And so after that, after that I thought that it--for whatever reasons, it seemed like I was in some ways, I just felt like I could do that job better at that point.  And so I took her up on the offer, after having turned it down once and gone--and went back.  And so it was a good, that was a good experience too, working for a think tank.  It was kind of a different, different vibe, you know.  And, you know, the Joint Center is an organization that has been very influential in the development of black politics in the United States.  It helped form the Congressional Black Caucus and a number of other organizations like that of, you know, black elected officials.  And I can remember a black politician, one of the few from Iowa, coming in to meet with folks at the Joint Center, and talking about how "Focus", which was the publication I edited, how it was like such a lifeline, you know, to him and black politicians out there in the middle of the country, you know, because in Iowa, they didn't get much in the way of black, political stimulation (laughter), put it that way.  And so they were very happy to get this, you know, this publication, from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies which really focused on black politicians and issues, social and political issues effecting black America.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you work closely with [HM] Eddie Williams?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, I ghost wrote, I would ghost write his column that appeared in the publication.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still keep in touch with him.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, him being the prime mover there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Now, you were at the Joint Center when the Pentagon was hit with the plane, 9/11, right?
Speaker 1: No, I joined in, later in 2001.
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001], okay, so it was after the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was obviously September 11, and I joined, I don't know, it might have been November.
Story_ID: 95467
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I know in 2002, you wrote the story about the Daniel Pearl kidnapping 'cause you had worked with Daniel Pearl?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, at the Wall Street Journal.  We were in the Washington [D.C.] bureau together.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the article's called "The Senseless Kidnapping"?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I wrote that for The Washington Post.  It was before I joined the staff, but it was, yeah, I mean, obviously, it was a senseless act.  And I was, I mean I was very angry at the people who did that, you know.  I mean it was, you know, it was a very--it's a horrible crime.  And Danny was a good guy, you know.  We played basketball together, and he was a musician.  He'd bring his instrument into the office every now and then for like a little office party.  So he was a good guy, so that was very upsetting.
Story_ID: 95468
Speaker 1: Now, when--I guess reporters, when they take assignments, there's a risk, there's always a risk that something could happen to you, I guess, when you're doing--did you ever have, incidents when--an incident where you were stationed somewhere and didn't feel quite safe?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I was in South Africa in 1986, I was detained for a short time by the police, and along--and this was, a state of emergency was declared, and they were rounding up activists, and I went to this kind of clandestine press conference in the township.  This was outside of Port Elizabeth.  And, you know, all activists were in disguise.  I'm pretty sure I was the only foreign reporter there.  And on the way out of the township, I was driving with a South African reporter, who--and we were stopped.  And I was, we were both held there maybe for a couple of hours, but then they let me go.  I had a U.S. passport, and they kept him.  They detained him, I'm not sure how long, but I think it was months or a year or something.  And so, you know, that was, that was a pretty scary time.  But, and as part of that, when I was--I was in the townships a lot.  And it was a time when people were (unclear) necklace if they thought you were a collaborator.
Speaker 1: Explain what that is?
Speaker 2: Oh, the necklace is when they basically pour petrol or kerosene or gasoline on an inner tube or a tire, put it over your neck and light it, and burn people alive.  It's horrible.  And I was in a Shabene, which is one of these, you know, kind of off-the-books nightclubs that they allow to go on in the townships of South Africa for the black people.  And they had these, in all these townships, they had these groups of these young black guys who kind of identified themselves as the enforcers of the community.
Story_ID: 95469
Speaker 1: So about the guys coming into the Shabene?
Speaker 2: I was in a Shabene, which was one of these, kind of informal, off-the-books bars in the black communities within the South African townships.  And this was during a period when there were, it was very tense in the townships.  A lot of, you know, the Army or the police would come through, and might arrest people.  I've seen 'em basically knock over these shacks, these shanty, in these shanties with these big armored personnel carriers, a lot of people throwing rocks, you know, at these armored personnel carriers, the soldiers and the police firing back.  It was a very tense time.  And there was also a lot of necklacing or at least some necklacing, which is the, you know, this horrible way of really executing people where a gang will douse a person or a tire with gasoline or kerosene and then set it alight and burn the people alive.  And so here I am in the, you know, this outsider, this American.  And they came up to me in the Shabene, this group of young, black men.  They were all over the townships really, kind of considered themselves the enforcers of what was right, I guess, trying to make, advance liberation but in their own kind of way.  And they said, people are saying you are with the CIA.  And, listen, I'm telling you, that's not what you wanna hear when you're in a Shabene.  This was not--and they basically called me outside to--and we started talking, you know.  And I basically talked my way out of it, you know.  And I said, look, whatever you have against the [President Ronald] Reagan administration, because the Reagan administration was in cahoots basically with the South African regime.  I mean Reagan considered those racists his allies, his friends.  I said, look, whatever you have against the Reagan administration, black Americans have that against it, plus the way he's treating black Americans (laughter) in the United States.  And by the time we got done, you know, we were friends.  One of these guys, next time he saw me, he actually gave me a kiss on the cheek, and so it was, that was a closer a call than I would necessarily wanna have again.  But, but, you know, and, you know, I didn't, my last trip to South Africa, I went over there with my wife, and I met some of the people that was with back in '86 [1986].  And they told me how, in some ways, they protected me, in ways that I didn't know about at the time.  And because it was a very tense time, but I had, I knew the political leaders, you know, the grass roots political leaders.  And so, you know, they made it clear that they had to, they protected me in ways that probably had I not done my homework, I might not have had because, I mean I went over there--before I went to South Africa, I stopped in Lusaka, Zambia and talked to the ANC [African National Congress], to let them know I was going to South Africa.  It's not like I asked their permission, but I wanted the leadership of the African National Congress to know what I was doing because there was, you know, there was a boycott against South Africa.  And, you know, I might have been a journalist, but clearly my heart was with the South African people, and the black people, in particular and not with the racist regime that was doing everything it could to keep these people down.  And so I went through Lusaka, Zambia.  I talked with the leadership of the African National Congress.  In fact, I went back the home of Thabo Mbeki who later became president.  He was like the chief information officer at the time, and a guy named Joe Slovo [ph.], who was, you know, kind of, a renowned white Communist within the ANC.  He came by my hotel.  And so I got to know at least on that level, at least a, I mean at least on an introductory level, the leadership of the African National Congress.  And it helped, you know, when I got to South Africa 'cause I got, I got in touch with the right people.  But that's not to say that everybody on the street knew who I was.  And so some of these young guys who were, you know, basically, like tasking their law in their own hands.  You know, they were suspicious of me.  Another time, I was at a gas station, and I looked up--and the gas stations in South Africa were just like in New Jersey.  You don't pump your gas.  They have people to do it for you.  So I was just sitting in the car.  And I looked up and the car was surrounded by these teenagers.  They weren't after me.  They were just gonna steal the car.  But, fortunately, an older guy there, he recognized that I was American, I guess he could hear my accent.  And I told him I was a journalist.  I'm trying to tell your story, and with his help, you know, he and I basically talked my way out of that situation.  So there were some tense times, no question about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like it.  So, I'm glad we had a chance to go back to that and get some of those stories,--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --those were interesting stories and gives a flavor to what was going on then.
Story_ID: 95470
Speaker 1: So Washington Post, 2005.  Now, you had done some writing for the "Post", some freelancing, right, you were saying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote an Op-Ed article, let me see.  I think I wrote just two or three pieces.  One was an Outlook piece, which is like the Sunday Outlook section.  It's like the, you know, the "think" kind of pieces (laughter), I guess.  I don't know exactly what you call them.  And so I had, I wrote, I think, one or two--I wrote the [Daniel] Danny Pearl piece for that section.  And I wrote another piece.  So at least one or--I'm not sure now if it was two or three.  It wasn't a lot, but two or three pieces before joining the "Post".  And I had done some other, I mean as part of my freelancing, I've wrote a number of Op-Ed columns, say for the L.A. Times, and the Christian Science Monitor.  So this was, this was all during this period after the Wall Street Journal and before the Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they liked your writing and just offered you a job in 2005, is that what it was?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had a friend who is now managing editor, a guy named [HM] Kevin Merida who, you know, kind of put me in touch with some of the editors there.  And, you know, I talked to him and met him at a National Association of Black Journalists convention.  And then I was in, you know, I was--so it was kind of like, I was, I made my interests known.  Kevin helped me make my interests known, and going back into newspapers and going to the "Post".  And so they invited me to apply for an assistant city editor job.  There was one that I applied for, but didn't get.  But then they said, but we want you for, we'd like to consider you for another job.  And I did take that.  And that was a job, at the time, they had a weekly publication called--well, they had a number of them, called "The Extras", and I was editor of the "District Extra".  But they had a number of different "Extras" in the suburban communities.  The "District Extra" came out once a week, and I was editor of that.  And then I became a, still as assistant city editor, I was editor or religion and education and that was at a pretty interesting time too.  It was at a time when Michelle Reid became superintendent or chancellor, she was called, of the D.C. schools.  And she was a very aggressive and in some ways, controversial and polarizing figure.  And so there was a lot on education news in the District.  I was also religion editor, as I mentioned, and the Pope came to visit.  And that was big news in D.C. for several days, and so that took a lot of planning.  And so, you know, I did well with that.  And then when a position came up as a columnist to cover federal government, federal employee issues, my editor suggested I go for it.  And when I did and I got the job and that's what I'm doing now.  It's, you know, it's a job I enjoy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's one reason I said earlier that, you know, while the whole situation with the Wall Street Journal didn't end on a good note for me, had that not happened, I might not be here now.  And that's the way things work out in life, you know.  Like they say, "One door closes, another one opens".
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you become a columnist at the "Post"?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess that's, it's going on five years.  I guess it was--
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007]?
Speaker 2: Two thousand--this is 2013.  It must have been 2008.
Speaker 1: Eight [2008], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was 2008 because it was the presidential election year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it would be, I actually started writing the column in August of that year.  So it'll be five years in August of this year.
Story_ID: 95471
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when did you win the Peabody Award?  And that was for an article about black men--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --and it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --first of all, I was part of a much larger team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a series that was in the newspaper about black men.  And then there was an online portion, which I contributed to in terms of an interview with Bob Johnson who was, you know, he was the founder of BET.  This was after he left BET.  But, so I did an interview with him about, you know, his experiences as the first black billionaire basically.  But then there was also an online portion that had video and audio.  And I think that's the part that won the Peabody, and I basically contributed a voiceover to that (laughter).  And so it was a small part of a larger effort (laughter), but I'm happy to say it was part of the larger effort that won the Peabody (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, that's still worthy.  So--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 95472
Speaker 1: But you became a columnist in 2008.  Now, this is an election year that's probably, I guess it'd be safe for me to say, this is probably one of the most exciting times in black news in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --history of our people, you know, that--
Speaker 2: For sure.
Speaker 1: --would be the race for president by [HM President] Barack Obama.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You know, being an exciting candidate like [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson was at first--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --to actually being a possibility of actually winning it--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --you know, which astonishes people today.  They can't, they're still pinching themselves.
Speaker 2: Well, that's true.  I can remember sitting in the newsroom--I was assistant city editor at the time, sitting next to the city editor, the day after Barack Obama won Iowa.  The city editor came in and looked at me and said, "Did this really happen?" or something like that (laughter).  And, it was a real turning point, of course, because a lot of black people weren't really on board with Barack Obama until the white people Iowa, you know, gave him a victory because people didn't think he could win.  You know, like this young, first-term senator (laughter) from Illinois.  I mean this is so improbable.  Why would anybody think he's gonna win?  But then when he won the caucuses in Iowa, boy, black people got on that train, and, you know, wouldn't let go.
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, what did you, what was your opinion then in 2007 when he announced and all that, I mean or 2008?  What was your opinion?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had actually spoken with him when I was at the Joint Center, when he won the Senate seat, did a short telephone interview with him.  And he was obviously, a very smart guy, you know.  At that time, I didn't expect he was gonna go on to be president, certainly not so quickly.  But I mean I think that I was enormously proud and happy and excited to see his progress.  So, and also surprised at first.  It's like I said, here's this unknown, first-term Senator from Illinois, a black guy.  I mean, you know, just forget about the fact that he's black for a moment.  These young, first-term senators just don't become president, you know, it's not the work the system works.  You pay your dues for a long time.  And, but, you know, the feeling was, you know, if he can win in Iowa, then maybe this can be for real.  And so it was, you know, it was an exciting time, and the excitement built, you know.  It just kept building, and it was a tense time too.  I mean, and if you recall when it got down to just Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, now, the Clinton's, black folks, you know, were in love with Clinton for so long.
Speaker 1: He was called the first black president--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I thought that that was really overdone.  But nonetheless, a lot of black people were in love with the Clinton's.  And, but then, you know, most of them moved toward Barack Obama, but still kind of respected Hillary Clinton.  But then toward the end there, there was a lot of tension between Clinton and Obama, and Bill Clinton said, you know, some very negative things, I thought, and this schism.  And it was a very, and even after Obama had the nomination sewed up, there were these, basically white women saying that, well, we don't know if we're gonna vote for him, you know.  And so it was a very tough time, I thought.  But, you know, all of that changed, and I mean he came through.  He won.  He appointed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, and, you know, as they say, the rest is history.  And now, they're best buds (laughter).
Speaker 1: And won another election again.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This year.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 95473
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 2008 was the economic nadir for this country, and what were the concerns of federal employees during that period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, federal employees have always been concerned with pay and benefits like everyone else. But also with the attitudes that people and politicians express toward federal employees, toward the federal government, and then by extension, and sometimes directly to federal employees because, you know, Republicans, you know, their mantra is small government, small government, small government.  And federal employees represent big government, you know, or certainly they are the ones who make the government of whatever size operate.  And so federal employees certainly felt that, and especially since, say the 2010 mid-term elections when the Republicans took the House, it felt that they have been targeted as kind of like piggybanks, piggybanks for the nation.  And so federal employees have been under a pay, under a freeze on their basic pay rates which was inaugurated which was started by [HM President Barack] Obama, although Obama never had any kind of the, never had the, what certainly feels like anti-federal employee rhetoric.  And so they, so covering the federal work force at that time when Obama came in was pretty interesting because federal employees had labored under the [President George W.] Bush administration, under a Republican administration for eight years.  And that administration had attempted to, in some ways, whittle down many of the agencies sin the government.  So there are different agencies that were, where federal employees felt like they really weren't allowed or encouraged to fully do their mission.  Agencies, for example, like OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is charged with inspecting work places around the country.  Well, you know, these work places, you know, basically, when they're inspecting things, they're finding things that might be harmful to employees and then cost the business leaders money to fix or regulations they have to follow.  And Republicans, basically being supporters of the business class, you know, allowed OSHA to kind of--it's still there, but it really was kind of just almost wasting away in terms of its ability to fulfill its mission.  And when I took over that beat, I heard these kinds of stories repeatedly in different agencies, about how federal employees felt they really couldn't do their mission because they didn't have adequate resources.  And so when Obama came into office, that changed things.  The Democrats really being more on the side of workers, and more on the side of government generally rejuvenated many of these agencies.  And the federal workers felt a much greater sense of mission.  And federal unions were strong supporters of the Obama administration 'cause like unions generally, they tend to support the Democrats.  And Obama came in and did a number of things that pleased the unions.  They weren't happy with everything, and like I mentioned, he was the one who actually instituted or proposed a freeze on basic pay rates which is now, I think in its twenty-seventh month.  So it's not like he was in their pocket, but he clearly did things that made the federal unions and federal employees generally much happier than they had been under the Bush administration.
Story_ID: 95474
Speaker 1: So I think that even as we speak now, I guess federal employees are under--in fact, today--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --is the day of the--
Speaker 2: That's right.  Today is March 1, and today is the day when the sequester of these across-the-board budget cuts begin to be implemented.  And one of the effects of that is going to be, unless things change within the next few weeks, furlough days, unpaid furlough days for federal employees.  And in some cases, the Department of Defense, for example, which is the largest department, you know, for civilians, alone, not even counting the military, they could be hit with enough furlough days to reduce their pay by 20 percent.  That's quite a hit.  Some other agencies, it might be 10 percent, and some agencies, they'll be able to adjust their budgets in ways that they won't, that the employees won't have to take furlough days.  So it can range up to 20 percent hit on their salaries, and so, yeah, they are very much under the gun again unlike probably any time before, and really because Congress isn't doing their job.  And so they're still, I mean as we speak, there's still time for Congress to act in a way that federal employees will not be hit.  But it doesn't look good at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what you were saying earlier, it seems to indicate there's a direct relationship between certain, I mean Congressmen urging that these federal agencies be cut back in terms of their resources and a desire not to be say, inspected by OSHA or the--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean clearly the Republicans want smaller government across the board.  And Republicans generally are supportive of businesses.  They want less regulation.  And so that means that agencies such as OSHA which inspects work places to find dangerous working conditions, those kinds of agencies are less likely to be supported by Republicans in Congress and Democrats, who, generally speaking, tend to be more supportive of the workers.  And so when you get these budget cuts--these particular budget cuts under the sequester, however, aren't just targeted toward agencies that Republicans might not be crazy about.  They're basically across the board with a few exceptions like the Veterans Administration is one notable exception.  But they're basically across the board.  And so all of these agencies, even the ones the Republicans like, like the Defense Department, are going to be hit.  And the Defense Department, I don't think there's any agency that's gonna be hit harder than the Defense Department.  And you see that, and one way to see that is in the way that the, is the severe hit that the employees of the Defense Department will take if the sequester is played out, you know, through the end of fiscal year in September.
Story_ID: 95475
Speaker 1: Okay, now, one agency I know that has meant a lot of African Americans is the Post Office [U.S. Postal Service].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And one time--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Post Office has its own troubles, quite apart from the sequester because the Post Office is deeply in debt.  They had a, they lost about 15.9 billion, almost $16 billion last year.  And they're on track to keep losing money.  And so they have, they have significantly cut back their workforce over the years from something like 800 or 900,000 people to something in the 500,000 range.  And so, yeah, they've had a lot of, they've severely cut back their workforce, and you're right, the federal, I mean the Post Office in particular was seen as a place, you know, years ago where black people could come and get a decent job with decent pay and decent benefits, the government, perhaps as a whole, but probably particularly, the Post Office.  And there's still a lot of black people in the Post Office, but they haven't done lay offs though.  They've done buy outs, but they've significantly reduced their complement of personnel.
Story_ID: 95476
Speaker 1: So today, I guess the biggest issue with federal employees would be this sequester and, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the biggest issue now, I think, is how many people will have to take furlough days and for how long a period of time.  And, in other words, how much money are they people gonna lose?  And we'll just have to see how it plays out because even though the sequester officially kicks in today, in terms of federal employees, they have to be given 30-day notice before they can be furloughed.  So if Congress, you know, gets its act together and passes legislation to prevent, that would essentially prevent the implementation of the furloughs, then these federal employees aren't going to be hit.  But as of today, the notices are going out telling people that you will be furloughed for "x" number of days through the end of the fiscal year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so those, I mean this is real stuff.  I mean there's been some speculation about whether or not the White House has been hyping, you know, this sequester situation.  And, you know, I can't speak to every program, but I can tell you when it comes to federal employees being furloughed, it's real, and these notices are going out telling them that they're going to lose days of work.
Speaker 1: It's not the boogey man, this something that's actually (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.

Speaker 1: So I know you do a, you try to do a thorough job on everything you write, but do you have a favorite article or an article that you're--I mean a column that you're most proud of, of the columns you've written for the Washington Post?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, yeah, that's an interesting question.  I, you know, I've written a number of articles about the unfair way gay and lesbian federal employees are treated because of the Defense of Marriage Act, which prevents the federal government from recognizing gay marriages, and obviously, still in most states, gay people can't be married.  And so you have these situations where even if people, even if a gay couple is married, they still can't, they still can't share benefits.  I mean, for example, I've written a number of cases about a woman by the name of Karen Golinski out in California.  And she's a federal attorney.  She works for the federal court system.  And she's a lesbian and married in California.  And she has filed suit against the government because she cannot share her employee, her work-related fringe benefits with her wife because even though she's legally married, the federal government, because of the Defense of Marriage Act [DOMA], does not recognize that marriage.  And, well, until recently, she couldn't.  She now actually can share because of a court case she won.  However, that court case didn't extend these benefits to others similarly situated couples.  It only applied to her individually.  And so still, the situation is, like for virtually everybody, every other gay couple, you know, they can't share their employee benefits with their spouse the way other married couples can, the way heterosexual married couples can.  And, you know, I don't think that can be defended.  And so I've written a number of columns about that and about the, you know, the position of the Obama administration, how the Obama administration at one point--it's gone through different gyrations about how they didn't like the law, but they were gonna enforce the law.  And now they still don't like the law, and they won't enforce it anymore.  I mean they've had these kind of, in some ways, it felt like they were tying themselves up in knots, and I've pointed out some of this in their columns.  And also about, you know, how, you know, the Republicans primarily on Capitol Hill, when arguing about DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act], would talk about how it was a threat to marriage, and I mean I'm married, and I can't for the life of me figure out how somebody else's marriage (laughter) is gonna be a threat to mine.  I mean it just does not compute.  And so I've written a number of columns about that.  And so I think that, I guess I would say some of the proudest columns, some of the columns I'm the proudest of are those that try to make a argument for human rights.  And I think I have a number of columns that do that.
Story_ID: 95478
Speaker 1: Also, Richard Prince [HM] who writes a column called Journalisms, which is a, it's basically like a trade column about journalism, but journalists of color generally, he pointed out how I'd written a number of columns about, you know, how black people, black federal employee, have been treated and in some cases discriminated against.  And so I think that, you know, I think some of the columns I'm proudest of are those that really look at how, say a particular individual has been treated unfairly, and then try to expose that, that treatment.  And sometimes something is done about that treatment.  Sometimes it's not.  But, you know, what we can do is, we can expose things.  We can bring those issues to light.
Speaker 2: What issue is, garnered the most positive feedback, I guess, or the most, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's those columns though that deal with pay (laughter), and pay, primarily.  I mean I've--and here lately, I mean the sequester is such a hot issue.  I mean I've written columns about how the impact the sequester could have, and I'm pointing out in my column how, you know, if federal employees have to pay cut because of these across-the-board budget cuts, it's gonna be on top of this two-year plus freeze on their basic pay rates already.  And so federal employees have already given basically in the name of deficit reduction.  And now with this, they're gonna be hit again.  And so I've done any number of columns about how essentially that is not fair, you know, talked to federal employees, talked to union leaders, talked with members of Congress.  And Congress recently, or the House recently, under the Republicans passed a bill that would extend this freeze on basic rates, basic pay rates through the end of this calendar year.  And I pointed out that it seemed like this was done in the heat of this discussion about the sequester.  It was clear that federal employees might lose pay because of this sequester.  I said, it seemed to me that even if the prudent thing was to continue the freeze because of budget issues, it seemed like the reasonable and decent thing would be to at least wait and see what's gonna happen to federal employees' pay because of these budget cuts, because if the Senate were to pass what the House did, and the Senate's not even gonna take it up, but under the House legislation, they could have their pay freeze extended and have (laughter) these 10 or 20 percent cuts.  And I mean that's one reason why, you know, federal employee unions aren't gonna support these Republicans because of stuff like that.
Story_ID: 95479
Speaker 1: And so, you know, I try to, I mean my column isn't like an Op-Ed column.  It's not an opinion page column.  It's a column that runs on the news pages.  And that creates, I think, a bit of a difference.  For one thing, it means I do a lot of reporting for my column.  Some of the columns you see on the Op-Ed pages, people kind of, kind of just sit back and give their opinion on something politically, generally, that happened.  But my column is a, it's a well-reported and a vigorously reported and a thoroughly reported column.  I put a lot of time into it.  And it's four days a week which is also unusual.  A lot of columns aren't four days a week.  Like the Metro columnists, for example, they run two days a week.  And so I put a lot of attention--a lot of time and attention and effort into putting, trying to produce a well-reported column, that is, that sometimes kind of just presents the news, but sometimes also with an additional edge because I am a columnist.  And I guess getting back to your question, those that I think deal with the human rights of individuals and in some ways that kind of point out the, the way in which federal employees can be under attack, seems to me and seems to many employees, by some members of Congress, you know, that's an ongoing story.  So I'm proud of those, proud of those columns too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 95480
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're still a part of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, very much so.  In fact, one of the things I'm proud of in my career is that, one, I'm a founder, and two, I've been to every single convention, which I don't know that anyone can say at this point 'cause we were founded in 1975.  So a lot of conventions.
Speaker 1: All right, now, what are some of the issues in NABJ now?  I know I referred before we started to a piece I read about a conflict that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, well, there was a--
Speaker 1: --around unity.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the biggest conflict, you know, in recent years had to do with whether or not NABJ would stay in an organization called Unity, at the time "Unity Journalists of Color", which was an organization of NABJ and also organizations that represented Latino journalists, Native American or Indian journalists and Asian journalists.  And a couple of years ago, the leadership of NABJ decided to pull out for reasons that had to do with finance and governance.  I thought the reasons were weak, and didn't stand up to scrutiny, but nonetheless, the leadership did decide to pull out.  And then I basically led a movement that tried to get NABJ back in to Unity, but to make a long story short, after NABJ pulled out, the, it accepted an organization of Gay and Lesbian Journalists to become a member of Unity, which for me totally changed the character of Unity because the name of Unity was, but no longer is, Unity Journalists of Color.  Well, if you're gonna have an organization of largely white, gay and lesbians, even though I fully support, you know, their objectives and goals, it clearly changes the character of an organization of journalists of color, you know, which represents people who still have particular issues, you know, with the industry.  And so, once Unity essentially changed and has changed its name because it--and appropriately so because it's not (laughter) an organization of journalists of color anymore, for me, it wasn't, I wasn't in favor of NABJ joining, basically, what then became a different organization.  From my point of view, Unity as it is now, may as well be like the diversity committee of like the Society of Professional Journalists.  And so it's, so it was a whole complicated thing.  I mean I was not in favor of NABJ leaving Unity to begin with, you know.  I fought for NABJ to get back into Unity.  Then Unity essentially changed the character of its organization, and once that happened, then I basically dropped my fight to get NABJ back into Unity--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because it wasn't the same organization.
Story_ID: 95481
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how else do you spend your volunteer time?  I know you--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't do nearly as much volunteer work as I once did, but (unclear) like when I was in undergrad school, I did, I had a tutorial organization that I headed.  But I do give, you know, I think probably most of it goes to both the national and the local chapters.  I'm also in an organization called the Trotter Group which was a, which is an organization of black columnists.
Speaker 1: Named for Monroe Trotter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, named for Monroe Trotter, and, in fact, just last night, a small group of us had dinner with [HM] Valerie Jarrett, a small group of Trotter's members.  And I'm somewhat active in my church.  I haven't been in a while, but I'm an acolyte.  I'm the, in the Episcopal church not far from here, you know.  And so, and my wife, you know, we have a good time going to plays and going to hear jazz, you know.
Story_ID: 95482
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back on everything you've done as a journalist, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I am certainly, as being a founder of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], that's a strong part of my legacy 'cause this organization has grown and has become strong and become a player in the industry, you know, over these years since it was founded in 1975.  And sometimes I have my difficulties with NABJ, but in some ways, it's kind of like, you know, since I'm a founder, in some ways, I'm like a parent.  And you know how parents sometimes have difficulties with their children, but they still love their children.  And so I'm very proud to be a founder of NABJ.  And so that's clearly a part of my legacy.  I think, I think my stewardship of the National Leader as managing editor is an important part of that legacy because we really tried to create a needed journalistic product for the national black community and one that is still needed.  And so that was an important part of the legacy.  I think some of my City Hall coverage in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], when [Frank] Rizzo was mayor who was antagonistic toward the black community, I did a lot of reporting about how he was not using federal grant money in poor black neighborhoods as it was intended, did a lot of reporting on that.  So that's part of my legacy.  I think clearly, the reporting from South Africa in '86' [1986] was an important part of that legacy, and the time I spent in South Africa was personally very, very meaningful for me.  So all of that is, all of that is part of it.  And now, I think, you know, writing the Federal Diary, which could very well be my last assignment, you know.  I could very well retire from active day-to-day journalism as a columnist for the Washington Post, writing the Federal Diary.  And the Federal Diary was eighty years old in November of last year.  It's been around longer than really the family that's owned the Washington Post now, purchased it, I think, the year after the Federal Diary started.  So this, so to be the Federal Diary columnist, you know, is significant because it has its own legacy.  You know, it's like the longest running feature in the paper.  And so to then be chosen to carry on that, it's not like just another assignment.  You know, it's not just, you know, someone that's covering education this year and someone else is doing it the next year.  It's part of the legacy of the Washington Post, a very important part of the legacy of the Washington Post.  So I'm proud to be the Federal Diary columnist.  And so this is another part of my legacy.  You know, and also I've taught at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] and Temple Universities, you know, really focusing on trying to encourage black students in the area of journalism.  I've conducted high school journalism workshops, mentored, you know, young folks in the profession.  And so I think all of this is part of my legacy.
Story_ID: 95483
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back again at everything, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it or--
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I've certainly had my, I've certainly had my ups and downs, you know, leaving the Wall Street Journal, the way that went down, that was a downer.  I don't know exactly what I would have done differently however.  And like I said, eventually, it turned out to be okay (laughter).  But I'm not sure what I would have done differently, kind of in the grand scheme.  Obviously, from day-to-day, I can think of any number of things.  I mean I can think of columns that I wish I had used another word (laughter) or something like that.  But in terms of like the grand scheme of things, I'm not sure what I would have done differently, which is not to say that I did everything correctly (laughter).  I'm just not sure what I would have done differently at this point.
Story_ID: 95484
Speaker 1: Okay, we always ask this question too.  Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very much concerned and frequently distressed by the level of violence in the black community, specifically young black men against young black men.  It's gone down quite a bit in recent years generally, although it's clearly still a big problem in Chicago [Illinois].  It's a problem in Prince George's County, right outside of [Washington] D.C., and it's still a problem, period, even if it's not as bad as it was years ago during the crack epidemic.  But I'm very much concerned about our, you know, young black men in particular, young black people, generally, concerned about the number of single parent households in the black community, generally speaking, a female-headed household with no father around.  I think these are very serious issues for us.  And it's an issue which, I mean one of my plans, frankly, is to spend much more time trying to work on that issue 'cause I think it's, I think it's very serious.  I think that--but that's not to say I'm not, I'm like totally pessimistic about the black community because I'm definitely not.  I mean I think that the black community, black people in this country really have an incredible story.  The way black people have managed to not only survive, but in many cases prosper and contribute enormously, you know, to the growth of this country, I mean in many ways.  I mean look at the arts, look at literature.  I'm a big jazz fan, enormous contribution to this country and to the world.  And in politics, you know, the election of [HM President] Barack Obama is something I never expected to see.  I was totally on pins and needles up, about his reelection (laughter) until like the weekend before the vote.  And so, I mean that's in my view a very positive step for the United States.  And so I have some very, I have some very serious concerns, but I also clearly recognize the many areas of achievement and progress.  And so, you know, it's, we still have a lot of, we still have a lot of work to do.  We still have a lot of, I guess, inconsistencies.  I mean, frankly, one of my pet peeves, and I'd probably get in trouble in some quarters for saying this, is I don't understand why in many ways black women don't seem proud of their hair.  Every time I see--and there was a woman on television yesterday who had on--and she was on MSNBC on national television, it looked like she had just some cheap, dime-store wig.  I mean it's just that, it befuddles me, you know, that you cannot see, you can hardly--it's almost impossible.  There's so few black women, say local news women who will have a natural hairstyle.  And they go for these extensions and these wigs, and that's, it bothers me, frankly, because I think that it's a indication that we and in this case, black women specifically, don't love ourselves as much as we should and as much as we deserve to and that the white beauty standards still is the one that commands respect in many ways.  And so that bothers me.  It really bothers me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was, this summer, remember the little girl, Gabby [Douglas], who was in the Olympics--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --who was criticized for not having a wig on or not having her--
Speaker 2: I know.  Can you imagine that?  You know, here's this, this young black woman, winning all kinds of records and just creating these incredible performances and people are cracking on her hair.  I mean how does that happen, you know, except that we don't accept ourselves enough.  We don't love ourselves enough, which I think is demonstrated in terms of fratricide on the street.  But it's also demonstrated in terms of, in wig-wearing women, frankly.  I would like to see us move out of that.  I mean it's not as serious as people killing each other, but it bothers me (laughter).
Story_ID: 95485
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about, well, let me pause just.  I didn't, I think I did this earlier, but I don't know if I did, but tell me, what is your journalistic philosophy, as a journalist?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe that, I believe that journalism needs to be, needs to focus on being fair and accurate.  And it's not that it's more important than telling the truth, 'cause I think truth telling is a very important aspect of journalism.  But the reason I focus on trying to be fair and accurate is, you can tell the truth but only tell one side of the story.  I think that in order to be accurate, you have to tell as much of the story as you can, you know, in a limited amount of space.  And, now, as a columnist, I also have some freedom to not only tell the story, but to put my edge on it, my spin on it, if you will, and I think that's totally appropriate too.  But I do see, I do believe that we have an important mission to explain what is going on to our audience, to expose wrongdoing or inconsistencies when we can and to generally serve our audience by informing them, you know, to the best of our ability.  And for me, that's a very important mission.  You know, I don't know if I wanna use the term sacred mission, but I consider it fundamental, very important and one that is a principled mission.  And I think we have certain principles that we, as journalists, need to live up to.  And I'm a big believer, as we all should be, I think in journalist ethics.  And I've taken a number of seminars on "Ethics in Journalism", and it's something that is not just in the back of my mind.  It's something that's very important to me, and I keep it in the front of my mind.
Speaker 1: You told the story, I think, off camera, about the young fellow [Jayson Blair] who was at The New York Times who--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had the ethics issues.
Speaker 2: Well, the story there was that I was in the first class of ethics fellows at the Pointer Institute which is a school for professional journalists in St. Pete [St. Petersburg], Florida.  And the, when we were there, the leader of the seminar noted that we were missing one person, and it was this guy from the "New York Times".  And then it turned out that he was the guy who got caught for plagiarizing.  And so it was kind of ironic, you know, we went, had he come to this seminar, maybe he wouldn't have gotten caught for plagiarizing.  But he was probably doing the plagiarizing when he should have been at the seminar (laughter).  So, you know, I think that those kinds of things really diminish the stature of journalism.  And I think every little thing, I mean I think, you know, even correction, you know, kind of undermines our credibility.  I don't think that any, you know, I don't think that any mistake--I'll put it this way.  All mistakes are important, some are more important than others, but all of them are important.  And when we make one--and the one reason they're all important is because when we make a mistake, it tends to undermine our credibility even if we quickly correct it, which we generally do.  Certainly, that's the goal, to quickly correct them, and I think that's a big help.  But people remember, like even spelling mistakes.  It doesn't have to be a mistake, in fact.  It can just be a spelling mistake or a grammatical error.  And that undermines your credibility, and so I spend a lot of time going over my copy to make sure that I don't have mistakes, but I've missed things on occasion.  I'm thankful for, you know, copy editors who have caught some of those mistakes.  But still mistakes have gotten in the paper, and that's very distressing for me.
Story_ID: 95486
Speaker 1: I just, now, this question just popped into my head, and I haven't asked it of everybody we've interviewed, but what do you think, I mean, our community is highly skeptical of what they see in the news.  And even though they may believe something one day, the next day, say, well, oh, I knew it wasn't really true (unclear) or they were lying to us anyway.  And, you know, there's so many conspiracy theorists, I mean what, you know, how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, to say, in some ways it's understandable, and some way, it's unfortunate.  I mean it's definitely unfortunate in all ways.  The way that I think it's understandable is that, the newspaper industry or the news industry in general, like so many other institutions in America has had this history where black people were either on the outside or ignored or portrayed only in negative ways.  And so, it's certainly better now that you have more and more black people working as journalist, but like other industries, for many years, black people weren't journalists, weren't in decision-making positions.  You'd have, I mean one common story among the, in the industry is that it was if, for years, many years, decades, black people didn't get married, and black people didn't die because in the mainstream media, you know, like on the wedding pages, for many years, there were no black couples.  In the obituaries, there were no black people.  And we did commit crimes though that were portrayed (laughter) in the newspaper.  And so the skepticism, even though things, I think, have changed in significant ways since then, you know, the skepticism certain lives on.  And there remains the satisfaction, like with the degree of coverage of things that go on within the black community other than, you know, crimes and things like that.  So that dissatisfaction remains.  And I think in many cases there's good reason for it.  And so the industry clearly has a job to do, and that's why NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] fights so hard for diversity because just by having more black people at a newspaper, you're gonna change the coverage.  And the more you have black people in decision-making positions, the more that coverage will change as well.  And so there's definitely been changes along those lines in recent years, but nonetheless, the skepticism, you know, remains.  I can remember years ago when the Washington Post--this was before I joined the paper, revamped its magazine.  And the first magazine came out.  It was a big deal, no like, no black people in the magazine.  This was in a city that's majority black.  And so it was like we were just totally overlooked, like all of us were the invisible men or the invisible woman (laughter), women.  And so that kind of stuff cannot continue.  And that would, there were demonstrations outside of the Washington Post.  And it was a very embarrassing period for the Washington Post.  And so, I mean that's not like during the times of the '50s [1950s] or '40s [1940s].  I guess that happened, I'm not sure now if it was in the '80s [1980s] or the '90s [1990s], but it was in relatively recent times.  And so I think there's definitely still work to do along those lines even though clearly, you can point to progress.
Story_ID: 95487
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us something about your family.  I know you've, you're married, and you have two sons or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm in my second marriage--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so by my first marriage, I have two sons.  Both of 'em are grown.  One is 33 and one will be 30 in April, and the one who will turn 30, we actually share a birthday.  And then my wife had a son by a previous marriage, and he, I think is 42, so he's older.  And he has a daughter, so we have one grandchild.  And so that's, and it's great.  She's three years old.  She was actually born on the 4th of July.  So she'll be four in, this year.  And so we like to say the nation celebrates her birthday every year (laughter).  And so it's, so, yeah, life on the family front, I think is good.  And my wife's family, she has--I'm an only child.  And my parents are dead, but, on my wife's side, she has a big family, and she has, what?  Three sisters and a brother, and her mother's still alive in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And so we go to Philadelphia, you know, to see the family, and then a couple of her siblings live in New York State.  And so it's, and so, yeah, the family is good.
Story_ID: 95488
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'll probably think of something later, when you leave, but I think we've covered just about everything.  And I think we certainly have covered NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] which is very important.  You know, I guess I would say that, I guess I would just say one more thing about NABJ and that is that I think one of the reasons I'm so proud to be a founder is because it has really provided guidance and training and a sense of community, which might be the most important thing, for now decades and decades of journalists, encouraged black journalists to get in the profession.  It has nurtured them, and so I'm very proud of what that organization has done over all these years since 1975.  And that's why it's, you know, one of the proudest things that I've been associated with in my career.  So I'm very proud to say I'm a founding member of NABJ.  And I think that that's the kind of thing that we as black professionals, particularly, black people in general, need to do which is to create organizations and structures that will help those who are coming behind us to find their way and to hopefully succeed.  And that's really what I hope to do more of, particularly as it relates to young black men.
Story_ID: 95489
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remember?  We're probably going over the same ground, but still it's--
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'd like to be remembered as, as really a loving father and husband.  I'd like to be remembered as a damn good journalist, and I'd like to be remembered as a black man who cared, who cares deeply about his people and who really made an effort to improve the lot of his people.  And so I think those are, you know, three areas, really, family, journalism and working to improve the lot of black people.  Those are three areas in which I would like to be remembered as somebody who tried to do his best.
Story_ID: 95490
Speaker 1: Okay, this is my wedding picture.  This was taken in Lake Tahoe, in Nevada, and it was in April.  We got married the day before my birthday.  So it was on April 25th, nine years ago this year, and you can see the snow-capped mountains in the background.
Speaker 2: And what's your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Dean, Bernadine Watson.  Everyone calls her Dean.
Speaker 2: And that's you?
Speaker 1: Yep, this was just after the wedding.
Speaker 2: This was taken in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I worked with an organization called "Project BAIT" in Philadelphia.  I did a program called the "Uhuru Sound".  And this was taken at the NPR station in Philadelphia, WHYY.  And so that was probably in the, well, I left Philly in '84 [1984].  So it was some time between '74 [1974] and '84 [1984].  I don't know when.
Speaker 1: HYY, the home of Fresh Air.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And so here it looks like I was dumbfounded by this guy in this long beard.  Of course, it was Santa Claus when I was just a toddler, but you can see that my mom really had me all dressed for it, some sort of plaid jacket on.  I'm sure it wasn't a jacket of my choosing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was in Detroit [Michigan], growing up on Inverness, walking out of our house with my father who was a bus driver.  I moved there when I was eight, so it had to be at some point after I was eight years old.
Speaker 2: And just one of my baby pictures.  I have no recollection of it being taken because I was too young.
Speaker 1: It'd be unusual if you did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so here's a progression starting with the same baby picture, and then the picture in the middle, I was at junior high, picture in the, leaving junior high in the ninth grade and then the high school graduation, wallet-sized photo.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, this, I think this was taken, I think it was taken in the '90s [1990s] when I was at the Wall Street Journal, and I was apparently on a panel or something, and I, 'cause I appear to be, I'm obviously talking into a microphone.  So I, apparently, it was on like a panel discussion or something.  And I don't recall the exact event.
Speaker 1: This is a scouting picture.  I was active in the scouts from Cub Scouts all the way through Explorers, and I'm still, I'm still close, you know, some of the people in that picture, we remained friends all of these years.
Speaker 2: And this is--
Speaker 1: Do you wanna name 'em, can you name them 'em?
Speaker 2: Some of 'em.  There's--
Speaker 1: Left to right, maybe start at the bottom.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's Charles Dillard-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Far left?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as you're looking at the picture on the far, in the lower left, there's Charles Dillard, and then next is Billy Garry [ph.].  On the lower right-hand corner is a guy named Billy Farmer [ph.], who unfortunately is deceased.  I can't think of the guy right in the middle with his mouth opened.  But the guy right next to me is Carlton Anderson, and that's me in the blue coat with the hood.  The guy in the back, you can barely see him, and his name is Allen Graham.  But Charles Dillard and Billy Garry are in the lower left-hand corners and Carlton Anderson, we still keep in touch.  And there're more people in that picture.  It's just cropped that way, and who are some folks we still keep in touch after all these years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my two sons, the, it's Jasiri who is, will be thirty years old this year.  He's the one we share a birthday together on April 26th.  He's on the left side of the photo, and the older one with the dreadlocks is Hakimu. He was thiry-three in February.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture with my mother, who as I said, lived with me for a number of years until she died in 2001 along with my two sons.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of, [phone ringing], some of the scouts that I mentioned who were in the other photograph, and like I say, we still keep in touch, and so I mentioned Charles Dillard was in one of those other photos.  He's there on the left-hand side.
Speaker 1: Here?
Speaker 2: No, the one who's kind of leaning over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Charles Dillard.  The next guy up is a guy named Chuck Anderson, and that's me, and then next to me is Carlton Anderson who was also in that other picture.  And then there's a guy named Bill Carter, Rodney Dryden [ph.], John Knowles, and a guy named Jay Watts, Billy Garry who's in other picture, and James Wilson.  And all these guys were probably in the other picture.  It's just that they were cropped out.  And then there's the scout leaders.  On the left, Mr. Anderson--it might be Carlton Anderson.  I'm not sure if his name was Carlton now or not, but Mr. Anderson, who died a couple of years ago.  Porter Dillard is in the middle, and then William Garry, Sr.  And a lot of us, a lot of us made Eagle Scouts together.  I mean we were, I think there were like maybe seven of us who made Eagle Scout together, and it was a, we had our picture in the Michigan Chronicle which is the black paper in Detroit.  And we remain, we remain good friends.  And this was kind of like a reunion in Detroit a few years ago.
