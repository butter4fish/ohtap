Our videographer today is Matthew Hickey, and for the next several hours we're going to talk with you about your life and your work and your place in history.  Now I know you've received some background information on The HistoryMakers, but by way of introduction let me just say that this is a video oral history archive that's housed currently in Chicago [Illinois].  We expect in the very near future, however, to digitize a lot of the interviews that we've been collecting.  We're going to reach the one thousand mark before this year is over--
Speaker 2: Oh that's great.
Speaker 1: --and there are plans already in the work to digitize four hundred interviews and make them available to students and scholars by way of the Internet, so we're very excited about the project and very happy that we'll be able to include your story--
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: --as part of the archive.  Now I want to start the interview by doing a little slating and I have some very basic questions that I'd like to ask.  First, if you could please state and spell your name including your middle name.

Story_ID: 210025
Speaker 1: I have a series of five really light and some people think silly questions, but I'm gonna ask them anyway and hope that we'll get a serious response from you.  First, will you tell us please what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: I would say seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Winter.
Speaker 1: Do you have--
Speaker 2: Win- winter is my most creative period, so that's winter (laughter).
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would say blue.
Speaker 1: And how about a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would say Lily Dale [New York], which is in New York State.  It's, it's a nice retreat that I go to every summer.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or a saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would say let there be joy.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much--
Story_ID: 210026
Speaker 1: Now, the first section of our three-part interview deals with your family background beginning with your childhood here in Cleveland [Ohio].  So, would you please tell me about your mother, what was here name, where was she born, where did she grow up, and what do you know about her background?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's name, maiden name was Jessie Beatrice Manease, M-A-N-E-A-S-E, born in Camden, Tennessee, and do you have date there by chance?  I have to, I have to look that--I don't have that date in front of me, but, but--
Speaker 1: Well we'll have some very detailed print materials--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that will be part of the archive as well,--
Speaker 2: Good, good.
Speaker 1: --but during the interview if you would just give us to the best of your recollection information about your parents.
Speaker 2: Okay, I would say January the 9th, 1900.  Died August, I think around mid-August 1993 at the age of I guess ninety-three.
Speaker 1: And she was born you said in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yeah Camden, Tennessee.  That's where I think she was born there and then she was educated at Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial] Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: And where's Tuskegee located?
Speaker 2: That's in Alabama, Tuskegee, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you know about her background and her growing up in Tennessee?  Did she share any stories with you?
Speaker 2: Well yes she was kind of not, not exactly orphaned, but, but semi-orphaned and she spent time in various locations and she was in a boarding house and sort of helping out with the boarding house.  And she did have a brother who was killed in the First World War [World War I, WWI], I believe.  And she did go to Tuskegee and excelled there.  She, she worked in the office and she--I remember she said she ate in the dining hall with the teachers, the special food.  She didn't have to eat the student food (laughter), she had the good food, which probably is good for me (laughter).  And she was very good at sewing at cooking.  I think she majored in home economics and was excellent in, in that capacity and when she was getting ready to graduate there was a request that came from Cleveland, the Briggs, a very rich family in Cleveland asked for a recommendation from Tuskegee to, to, to have a domestic person there for various activities, you know, cooking and sewing and that kind of thing, and they recommended my mother and she came to Cleveland to do that and she, she'd worked at the Briggs home I guess in the [Cleveland] Heights [Cleveland, Ohio] someplace for several years before she met my dad [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] and so that's, you know that's her background.  But, she was excellent in terms of home economics, you know.  I think it was a step up from, from maid to maybe just, maybe a domestic, general domestic person.
Speaker 1: Did you share any other memories with you about her Tuskegee years, as Tuskegee has such a special place in history of historically black colleges [and universities (HBCUs)]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I asked her about Carver--
Speaker 1: George Washington Carver?
Speaker 2: --George Washington Carver, and she said that he had a very light voice, a very high-pitched light voice and was not at all impressive (laughter) in terms of meeting him or, or talking with him.  Very soft spoken and very light and just, just didn't make much of an impression except that he was so brilliant.  He was a genius of course, and, and but in terms of his personality it, it was very laid back.
Speaker 1: So, here's this brilliant scientist on the campus of Tuskegee, but she was not impressed.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Was she aware at that time of--
Speaker 2: I think she was aware that he was doing, you know, useful things, but not completely, you know, and she said that the students were not that impressed at the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 210027
Speaker 1: Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was often at the center of controversy because it prepared women and men for vocations rather than post-baccalaureate studies.  Booker T. Washington, the founder, was concerned about preparing people for jobs and for African American women who chose to work outside their homes usually that meant domestic service.  Did your mother [Jessie Manease Adams] express any regrets about having been trained in that fashion or?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, she was, she was treated beautifully.  Everyone loved her, respected her.  She was, she was valuable in terms of what she did, and she lived very well there.  It's a beautiful home and she had beautiful accommodations, ate great food, again which is good for me (laughter) because mother was a very healthy person and she lived a healthy lifestyle, really healthy.  I might say that out, outside of birthing me she never spent one day of her life a hospital from, from the time that she birthed me to the time she died, never once in the hospital.  And she, she did have a few illnesses from time to time, but they were minor.  They were like maybe the flu or something, or some virus, you know, that's about it.  And so she lived a very, very healthy lifestyle and I I'm just grateful, you know.  And, and a happy life, and she made it happy for all of us.
Speaker 1: Now I know you said your mother was for all practical purposes orphaned as a young person, but I wonder do you have any information at all about your grandparents your maternal grandparents?  Did she tell you anything about them?
Speaker 2: Not too much, no, it's a little vague, little vague.  You know you have some information from the archives you can kind of look that up, you know, but I, I never really got into that with her too much on her side.
Speaker 1: And, and the archives that you're referring to, we should also state for the record for people who would like to do further researched beyond this interview that they're housed at the Cleveland Public Library [Cleveland, Ohio] in library special collections.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And are there other sources as well that people, that we may refer to?  Other archival sources?
Speaker 2: Besides the Cleveland Public Library?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: There is a small collection at the Center for Black Music Research Columbia College Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and there are a few pieces at the Western Reserve Historical Society [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And what city is that located in?
Speaker 2: In Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 210028
Speaker 1: May I ask now about your father--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that side of the family?  Can you please tell me what his name was?
Speaker 2: Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born and raised?
Speaker 2: He was born in Urbana, Ohio, which is near Columbus [Ohio] and Springfield [Ohio], fairly small town and very nice town.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you tell me please what his early life was like as, as to the best of your knowledge?
Speaker 2: Well, he went to the public schools in Urbana and got good grades.  He went to the service and attained the rank of second lieutenant, and this was the First World War [World War I, WWI] and was honored for, you know, various things and was very well thought of, very well respected.  In the archives, there's some articles about his, his being honored in coming back and being honored there in Urbana.  People very, very proud of him.  He really excelled, you know.  He came to Cleveland [Ohio] and got into the postal service, and I remember he was a mail carrier for a while and then he worked his way up to the parcel post section, then to the, the scheme, throwing the scheme of the mail into the various slots and went on up to a timekeeper, which was the next step up from being a superintendent.  And he was offered a superintendent's job and turned it down because of I guess he just didn't want that responsibility.  He wanted to remain where he was.  He didn't want the, I guess the pressure that goes with being a high administrator.
Story_ID: 210029
Speaker 1: You were telling us just a moment ago about your father's [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] experiences in the [U.S.] military, a native Ohioan, but serving in what some historians have called the Great World [sic. Great War], World War I [WWI].
Speaker 2: Yes, World War I.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit more about that.
Speaker 2: Well he, well he was elevated to second lieutenant at that time, and which was very, I think, rare for, for an African American to, to serve in that capacity and he obviously was very talented, a good leader, had a good head on his shoulders, and, and was honored by the City of Urbana [Ohio] when he came back from the, from the war.  He didn't do a great deal of talking about that experience, I just happen to know it's a fact, it's a fact, you know, but he didn't talk about that too much.  And I do know that he worked in the post office and this was during the [Great] Depression era too where there was a lot of hardship and in the postal service we, we never experienced that Depression you know, and, and I never did.  I always had enough of everything.  He started out as a letter carrier and then, then parcel post.  Then he was inside working with the scheme throwing letters, and the finally timekeeper and, and he retired I think as timekeeper.  He was offered a superintendent's job, which he felt would be a little bit too much pressure, greater responsibility, so he didn't take that, but he, he remained as a timekeeper, which was a nice inside job.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said your father attended public schools in Ohio in his hometown [Urbana, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did he also attend college?
Speaker 2: He didn't attend college per se, no he didn't.  However, he was sharp.  He, he read all the classics.  Like all the great books I would say that he might have read maybe 50 percent of the great books, and, and knew about, you know, he could quote [William] Shakespeare and John Milton and he had Dante [Alighieri]'s 'Inferno' and 'Paradise' [sic. 'Paradiso'] here and there were large volumes that had [Gustave] Dore's lithographs and they were here at the house and he was a music lover, opera, symphonies, ballets, and he loved vocal music.  He would always talk about the great singers, [Enrico] Caruso and [John] McCormack and [Ernestine] Schumann-Heink.  You know he, he knew all this and loved it and he instilled that in, in me too as did my mother [Jessie Manease Adams].  They were wonderful that way, but he was a very skillful person.  He also did a lot of civic work.  He founded the American Legion post here [Cleveland, Ohio] on, on, here on 105th Street, that branch, and he was a Mason, elevated to 33rd degree and, and had a street club.  He was the president of the Kempton Street club, so he was really very civic-minded.

Speaker 1: Okay, now when did your parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] meet and marry?
Speaker 2: They married, well I would say they met just about a couple of years before I was born--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I would probably say around 1930 and married in 1931, and I came along in 1932, end of 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay, are you the only child Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams?
Speaker 2: Only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so we don't need to ask about siblings.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were there other cousins, however, in the area [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes there were, there were.  Yes, but actually as an only child I learned how to get along by myself and there's was advantages and disadvantages.  Certainly I would have liked probably to have had brothers and sisters.  On the other hand, I was showered with all of my parents' resources and support and they really took care of me and so I really have no complaints whatsoever about coming up as a child.  You know, I had a happy childhood, all the support, good food, had wonderful home life, accommodations.  It was a wonderful neighborhood, had great playmates in the neighborhood.  It was just, it was great.  I have no complaints.
Story_ID: 210031
Speaker 1: We're here in Glenville [Cleveland, Ohio] now in the family home, but is this the same home that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came here about two years before I went to elementary school, so I've been here quite a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, and for your school days in Cleveland [Ohio] what schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: Started off in Miles Standish Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio] and then to Empire Junior High School [Cleveland, Ohio], which is very close here, and then to Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  That would be the so called old, original site of Glenville, Parkside Drive--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or Parkwood Drive I think it is.
Speaker 1: I know you said you had a happy childhood in your parents' [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] home what about your school days?  Where they pleasant as well?
Speaker 2: Yes they were pleasant, yes very, very pleasant.  I, I had nice classmates, many of whom I kept in touch with.  We have a class reunion from Glenville and just a couple of years ago we had a reunion and the, the, many of the students from elementary school were there for that reunion.  We went through the three schools together and the class kept in touch with each other and so we have active high school alumni class reunion.
Story_ID: 210032
Speaker 1: I wonder in your elementary days [at Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] or either the Empire [Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio] days, were there teachers who were especially influential in your young life, either in, in the music or in some other area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can remember there was a Ms. Kimmons [ph.], who was my junior high school music teacher who was, was quite supportive of me.  And I had been taken piano lessons since I was four years of age and that was just really very young, and my, my parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] just wanted me to start off doing that.  I think they wanted to give me something cultural to do rather than just to be out playing on the street, and they kept me busy.  They, they, I had a Plain Dealer route and a news press route and a shopping newspaper route and my music lessons, which was piano and I was being taught by a teacher that lived two houses down, Dorothy [E.] Smith, who was a violinist in the Cleveland Women's Symphony [sic. Cleveland Women's Orchestra, Cleveland, Ohio], and she started me off on piano and I remember I had to practice forty-five minutes a day, which is a long time.  However, as a child I, I really didn't know it was a long time.  I didn't, and I didn't know there wasn't anything else better to do than to practice.  And when I was called in I would be out there playing, it was time for practice.  The clock would be sitting there and I would, I would practice my music and so, so that was--they gave me a background for, for piano. Then when I went to junior high school, the, the students knew I could play, but the music teacher didn't know 'cause it never came up.  And one time I remember in, in a class a student said, "Well [HistoryMaker H.] Leslie [Adams] can play," and she, "oh no he can't," and they, and so she challenged me to play.  So, I went up to the piano and I played a popular piece, 'Golden Earrings' and she was amazed that I could do this (laughter).  But, I had been taking lessons for all this, all this time and so she had me play on some programs in the assembly and so that was my junior high school experience.  And then when I went to senior high school [Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio], my high school choral teacher really utilized my talents.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Howard Tucker was music appreciation and choral music and a wonderful musician.  He, he instilled in the classes a very wide repertoire appreciation.  He would bring in these big 78 albums of, of [Johann Sebastian] Bach.  For example, 'The B Minor Mass,' [sic. 'Mass in B Minor'] 'The St. Matthew Passion' and he would play those, we listened to it.  He would bring in the [Ludwig von] Beethoven symphonies.  He'd bring in very operatic arias and along the bulletin boards he would have the Columbia artists line up, the photographs of that.  We heard Lily Pons, Marian Anderson, Jascha Heifetz, Paul Robeson, Gregor Piatigorsky, Fritz Reiner conducting, Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], all of those kind of things and then the students would like to bring in pop music and he would welcome it.  And at that time, the pop music consisted of Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, artist Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, you know that kind of thing.  And, but he would, he would play, he would always finish off with something popular, you know and so he really was, was very, very influential in my life.
Speaker 1: And when you were a student in the Cleveland [Ohio] schools did you aspire to be a professional musician or were you undecided at that point?
Speaker 2: I was undecided.  I, I knew I just loved it and, and that was the center of, of my life I would say.  I also enjoyed going to movies, well who didn't at that time, because there was television and radio, but even a radio my interest was very much musical.  There was one program the Fred Waring program ['The Fred Warning Show']. Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians that would come on at noon, and I remember getting out for lunch at, at Empire and I would literally race home all my might to get, to, to hear, to listen to on the radio, to hear the end of 'The Fred Waring Show' and so I was very, very much into that, you know, into good music.
Story_ID: 210033
Speaker 1: It's your senior year in high school [Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and I suppose you had some choices to make about whether you were gonna continue at the post-secondary level, but how did you make that choice?  Did you have some help from your parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: I sure did.  I had help from John Howard Tucker.  He kept telling me I ought to go to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and major in music, and in my junior year in, in high school I started studying voice with him.  He, he taught privately in a studio downtown [in Cleveland, Ohio] on 9th Street, and I would go there for weekly voice lesson and I would also sing solos with the choral club and we do conc- you know programs in, in Glenville [Cleveland, Ohio].  And he just felt that I needed to continue that and, and I, I loved it.  I loved music, so he said I should go ahead and major in music, and I should go to Oberlin and so he kept saying that to me.  He put that bug in my ear early on, so when it came time for graduation, hey, what else am I gonna do, you know, and my, my dad wanted me to be a doctor for obvious reasons I'm sure and you know make a lot of money, but once I said I would like to, to go into music, they said, "Well that's, that's what he wants to do," and they, they went along with it, you know, and they, they both loved music.  They absolutely loved it, and neither one of them was musical per se.  They couldn't play or sing, but they loved music and good music, so they, they went along with it.  I, I felt very fortunate to, to have that support.  You know so often you hear about opposition, the parents not liking this or you can't, you can't make a good living and so forth like that.  It was none of that, they went right along with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think, I was very luck, very, very lucky.  I think I was lucky, may, maybe they were the parents like I was supposed to have, you know because all through my schooling they were supportive of me.  My teachers were supportive and, and they were good teachers, good instructors.  There was not a single weak link in the entire chain of teaching.
Story_ID: 210034
Speaker 1: I heard you use the term good music, and you said your parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] really loved good music.  Was there bad music in the 1940s in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh no, that was just you know, I would say good music is you know, it depends upon who you talk with, but I would say at that time the, the music was, was varied.  The, the, I was, it was total, it was, it was pleasant, it was melodic, tuneful, soulful, and so called classical music, which I'm not a particular lover of that term, but, but you know, but the classical music in the sense of historical music they appreciated that, going to operas.  They went with me to the, to the operas and there was a time when I was going down to public hall for a whole week of operas, every single one of them, you know, which was, which was sometimes twice a day in the afternoon and evening and so I was very much into, to so-called classical music as well as popular music.  I love popular music, I mean just, you know, so my, so my appreciation was varied.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did go to a lot of movies.  I enjoyed movies and kind of, I would say--I can't say I specialized in any particular sections, you know, but, but I do a lot of still a lot of movie going and movie watching to a certain extent and have a little bit of a hobby about writing movie commentaries during my ca- career.  I have founded some film series that I keep to myself.  People don't know that, but in, in college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and even at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] I did film series, wrote reviews, formed commentaries and, and organized the film series and this is not necessarily music this is all, all kinds of films, foreign, domestic, you know.
Story_ID: 210035
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams at the end of the last segment you just started to talk about the end of your high school days [at Glenville High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and the beginning of your college experiences of the music and the great love for movies that continued throughout your college years, but can you talk in some detail about your experience is it Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh sure yes, yeah.  Well, my high school teacher [John Howard Tucker] encouraged me to go to Oberlin.  That involved an audition, of course, because Oberlin was kind of a tough school to get in and there were two factors:  one was the financial part of it.  The other was the talent, the qualification.  Once I decided for Oberlin, my father [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] and mother [Jessie Manease Adams] were behind me and they were gonna make it work.  They were gonna get the funds and you know encourage me and support me in this.  So, it was an interesting period.  I knew the Korean War was, was ongoing and my father worked on the draft board, volunteer, and he said that when I graduated, which was January 1951, that they were drafting young men from high school that were not going into college and he thought that it would be to my advantage, I didn't want to go to an [U.S.] Army, to go, try to get into Oberlin right then and Oberlin had a semester program which started in the fall rather than in midterm, rather in January and so actually I, I would have had to had a special entrance to Oberlin if I'd gone in January and Mr. Tucker encouraged me to go and audition even though the, the, the year had begun in September.  So, I, I went, my parents drove me up for my audition and I sang art songs, I, I played--let's see the audition was for, Daniel Harris was the teacher, vocal teacher at the time.  I auditioned for him and I played for Emil [Charles] Danenberg who was the piano teacher there and then I took a theory exam.  And the theory exam consisted of dictation where they would play a tune on the piano and I would have to write it, what I heard on, on manuscript paper, and I had never been asked to do that before.  In fact, I, to back track a little bit, I actually tried to take theory, the Cleveland Musical Settlement [sic. Music Settlement, Cleveland, Ohio], when I was in high school and they said you can't take theory unless you take Dalcroze Eurhythmics first and Dalcroze Eurhythmics first is the movement around the room to music with your body, okay.  I really didn't want that.  I wanted theory and which I think is rather rare for a student to actually want, crave theory, but I did, and I was not allowed to take it.  So, I had that disadvantage and when I went to Oberlin they asked me to write this out, which, which I had never been asked to do before.  They played the melody on the keyboard, and I was able to motorize my fingers that the notes that I heard I know what, I knew what finger I would play, press the key down to get the tone, so I was able to hear that and with my fingers I knew exactly where to put, put the note on the staff and I had been doing some of that from the beginning from age four because my first piano book there were some pages that had blank staves on them and I started filling in the little notes and imitating the tunes and the composers that I would have practicing and so I was and through high school I did a little arranging and composing, so it was completely new, but I had never been asked to do that particular activity.  So, when I was asked to do that my parents were in the room and they allowed my parents to be right there.  My mother said she knew I couldn't do it (laughter), I couldn't pass that exam.  However, after it was over a week later I got a letter saying I was admitted to Oberlin, so I obviously passed (laughter) and so I entered in midterm and everyone that I would meet other students would say, "I didn't know that you could do that."  I didn't know they allowed anyone to come in at midterm, so I found that that was a very unusual thing--
Story_ID: 210036
Speaker 1: --I mean, I didn't know it at the time, but from what I was told that this was not the policy of Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] to admit someone after the year had started, and it was a little difficult because coming out of, of a high school environment and then suddenly in a whole new environment with, with people who had already been there, they had been established, they had gone through the three months, four months or orientation and there I was coming in fresh it was a little challenging, but I adapted and so I had voice with Robert [P.] Fountain, this was two lessons a week.  I had two piano lessons a week with Emil [Charles] Danenberg.  I had music education courses, and I had, I did have Dalcroze Eurhythmics with Enda Holland [ph.] who, who was expert in eurhythmics and a great deal of theory, music theory.  And then I elected composition.  I took a composition class with Herbert Elwell, which was wonderful.  I absolutely was in heaven with that class, and the first assignment was to write a song and to, to and he'd show us how to scan the text, for the accents, the up beats and the down beat of the, of the line, where the bar line would fall, the meter that the text would fall into triple or duple and these kinds of things, how to do the melody and so forth.  And the first song I wrote was from the Bible just I think a passage from the Bible, I think psalm or something and played it.  And he played it and I sang it.  It was a song, you know, and I, I was in heaven.  It was absolutely thrilling for me and the class, you know, hearing it and then complimented me on it and everything.  And Herbert Elwell I might mention was the critic for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the music critic at the time and he taught at Oberlin too.  So, this, this was a wonderful experience for me and the conservatory itself was, was a very thrilling atmosphere.  It was in the old building, not air-conditioned so that in the warm weather they would open the windows of the practice rooms and you could hear the sound from blocks away, the combined sound, all this, all these people practicing and singing and playing instruments out the window, this, this--(unclear)--sound (laughter) coming from Peters Hall, but it was alive and thrilling, you know, and these were, these were students practicing their assignments and, and you go from down the hall look in and then see this, somebody is playing tuba here, somebody is singing here, somebody is playing the piano, somebody is playing the violin, you know, this was, this was the old Oberlin Conservatory [of Music, Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] alive with music and it was a sound like none other and Oberlin was dominated by this sound because you could hear it for a block away.  It's just the sound of music (laughter).
Story_ID: 210037
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So technically that's the beginning of your work as a composer?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That first piece from that class [at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] you described?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now how did you come across that text?  Was that of your choosing to choose some from the Bible other than--
Speaker 1: Yes, I think maybe he said, he [Herbert Elwell] might have suggested to take a passage maybe from the Bible.  I think it was a psalm or something like that.  Turn away mine eyes was I think the title of it, you know.  So, he kind of helped us to you know, to get something that you could handle, you know.  I couldn't be too long and, and it had to be something that we felt we could, could scan and would work as a song and, and he, he really set up some criteria for me that I used throughout my career, you know, not too long and another thing was immediately recognizable or understandable from the listener's stand point because it's not a poem that you could sit and study it's a song that you hear the words and to me you got to understand what the meaning is instantly.  It can't be something you gotta think about because there's no time in music to think about it.  You've got to hear it and understand it right on the spot and that's what I've always tried to, to do, to communicate and so therefore I guess what is set up is a criteria for simplicity, not complexity, you know.  If, even if, if, the concept may be complex and the meaning may be complex, I think you can think about it and you can, you can pick it to pieces, but when you hear it the words have to be understood and you have to and you can't, you know, and that's, and that's something I've always used to, to this day.  So, that, that is, that was a good beginning for me, you know.
Speaker 2: So when you composed that piece, were you already familiar with the songs through religious training or through reading in the literature of the Old Testament?
Speaker 1: Somewhat, but not, not a great deal.  Some, you know, I went to Sunday school (laughter).
Story_ID: 210038
Speaker 1: Was the family active in the church?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] was Methodist and my mother [Jessie Manease Adams] was Baptist (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: And you were?
Speaker 2: --and they, they, they put me in to the cradle in, in Antioch Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio] as a kid.  So, I grew up in Antioch and I would, I would go to, to Sunday school and to, to church at Antioch.  My dad would go to St. James [AME Church, Cleveland, Ohio], the [African] Methodist [Episcopal (A.M.E.)] church and we, we would drove over together.  He would drop us off, then he would go to Methodist (laughter) and we go to Baptist and then he would pick us up and come home (laughter).
Speaker 1: At that time was Antioch at 89th [Street] and Cedar [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: Same, same place yeah.  The minister was Wade Hampton McKinney, and the choir directed was Mrs. [Ruth Berry] McKinney, who was his wife and she did real anthems, wonderful sound, wonderful sounding group there, wonderful choir and did a lot of classical anthems, you know, and spirituals and it was a great sound, just beautiful, gorgeous.
Speaker 1: Well you get the music on the weekends as well through the church?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 210039
Speaker 1: Now I'm wondering again with your experiences at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] which had traditionally been associated with the Congregational church was there any kind of chapel program or weekly activity that brought all the students together for musical activities?
Speaker 2: There was, there was a chapel, it was called a chapel weekly and it was required at that time and it was really nonreligious I would say.  They, they had, they had speakers on various topics, but, but it wasn't like Bible-based or anything like that.  It was, it was more social and artistic-based.  I think [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham came.  Pearl Primus came you know and would do a dance program.  Different speakers would come and, and address the, the so-called chapel it was called, you know Infin- Infinity Chapel [sic. Finney Chapel] and, and it was required and it was part, I guess, of Oberlin's de- decision well the students ought to be cultured, have some cultural experience, you know.  And at the time, pe- people just went along with the program because that was, that was the program and there was no opposition to it particularly.  The opposition came in the '60s [1960s] when the, when revolts came in the schools, but at that time in the '50s [1950s] those were the post war years, Korean [War], post Korean, you know, and [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower period, which as you know historically it was after the Second World War [World War II, WWII] people was se- settled down.  They were optimistic trying to rebuild their lives and servicemen coming home and so forth and so on and it was, it was, it was a nice period, you know, General [Douglas] MacArthur, I think, was doing his thing.  In fact, and in fact his, his avocation speech was, was broadcast while I was there in the dining hall they turned it on, all soldiers never die speech, so it, it was just a very relaxing period and I, and I was not particularly interested or involved in the political scene.  I really didn't know what was going on too much.  Oberlin, I always think Oberlin was in a way like Hollywood, a world into itself where you were doing your own thing and the outside was just something you might glance at a headline or something in the paper, but you're so involved in, in your own world of preparing your lessons, preparing whatever project you would, may be studying involved in that world and it was a world.  It was universe unto itself that was not even affiliated with the, with the town of Oberlin.  In fact, there was so, so called demarcation between the so-called townies and gownies that there was very little interaction between the town people and the college people.  The college was just a world unto itself and it was, and we had enough work to do to do our next day's assignment that was what we were thinking about.  That we're not concerned about the outside world per se, you know, too much, especially in music.
Story_ID: 210040
Speaker 1: You know among students of history, Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] has this reputation for being very accepting, very tolerant, that goes back to even the 1830s where I believe it became the first college to accept African Americans and women in the decade of the 1830s.  Did you find that it was as warm as accepting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the 1950s as well?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I might just mention that in terms, of terms of being accepting my folks [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr. and Jessie Manease Adams] brought me up to not feel too much difference between peoples, and I, I think this was a conscious thing.  At the time, I didn't know it was, but I, I just thought that's the life is, but, but I grew up in a totally integrated community, totally integrated schools and went onto a totally integrated college.  And when I say totally integrated I mean when I think back there might have been maybe 10 percent African Americans there and there's some, some Asians, 10 percent--
Speaker 1: At Oberlin?
Speaker 2: --at Oberlin, 8, 8 maybe 8 percent than the 10 percent and everyone got along beautifully as far as I could tell and I, I just excelled.  I mean, I mean just people were people and you know and I was brought up that way because as far back as I could remember, you know, I was involved in people, all kinds of ethnic background.  There was no difference whatsoever.  The first difference I ever experienced was going to the movies when they started doing socially conscious film, like 'Pinky' and 'No Way Out' and that kind of that.  That was the first I, or maybe a few things might have come up in maybe in, in church.  The minister might have mentioned a few things, you know, and I knew there was a Civil War, but it was, that was just history and didn't mean that much to me, so you know, but that was my orientation, you know.  I just completely I guess idealistic (laughter).  It, it was incredible really, but that's the way I was brought up and the one time I heard my mo- mother mention to someone this was when I was an adult, you know, that they made, that she and my dad had a conversation.  They made a conscious decision that they were not gonna dump that stuff onto [HistoryMaker H.] Leslie [Adams] (laughter), that they were going to just not do it.  They were going to just let me be and, and to let me think that everybody was like I was experiencing them and I had like next door my neighbors.  We, we go to the park together.  We'd go to, Euclid Beach [Park, Cleveland, Ohio], to the zoo [Cleveland Zoological Park; Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Cleveland, Ohio], you know, and they'd come here.  I would go there.  It's no difference whatsoever eth- ethnically speaking.  So hey and I had a kind of an increasing childhood and that formed the way I viewed the world, and it's still with me.  And I think it helped.  I think, I think that's the way the world should be viewed.  You know, that the, the other thing it is, that's the false world.  It's, it's the division, that's the false.  You know I think I've got, I've got the truth, and the truth is within my heart and my parents allowed me to experience that and to see that, you know, and I'm so grateful, so grateful for it, you know.  I can't say enough and express enough gratitude.
Speaker 1: So, the Glenville [Cleveland, Ohio] that we see today then, which is about 99.9 percent African American. Very different--
Speaker 2: Very different.
Speaker 1: --from the Glenville you experienced as a child.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 210041
Speaker 1: What are some of, I'm wondering now as we talk about your, your childhood and early adult years, what are some of the sights and sounds and smells that remind you of the old Glenville [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh Glenville, well--
Speaker 1: The old neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, I used to walk to school from here, which was, which was kind of nice, brisk walk, and would walk with various students that I would see coming.  We would, we would, we would enjoy going down the various streets, 105 [105th Street] and onto, onto Parkwood Drive.  It was a school that was, that was equivalent today of college.  They, they had Latin, French, German.  I took Spanish.  I learned the typing there, social studies, history, literature.  In English literature we started off reading 'Beowulf.'  We, I read a '[A] Tale of Two Cities,' [Charles Dickens] that was one of our assignments, 'Macbeth,' [William Shakespeare] the Poe.  We read Edgar Allan Poe's work.  We even read 'Madame Bovary,' [Gustave] Flaubert's 'Madame Bovary' and, and it was, it, was, it was, the discussion was at a very, very high level.  I will say that I from high, from elementary school [Miles Standish Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] I was not in major work.  I was in the regular sections, so I always thought of myself as an average student, you know, I mean myself, myself impression, you know, that the major works pe- people were sort of special and you know.  And there was one student, Herbert Kinds [ph.] was a very, very sharp, brilliant student.  He used to be in class.  He used to hold his hand, pop his hand, his elbow with his hand so he wouldn't have to raise it to, to high when he, 'cause every question that would ask he would put his hand up and everyone looked up to him.  They thought he was a genius and so forth.  But, as it turned out, you know, he, he didn't, he has not made, he has not fulfilled the role we all thought, and, and, and in the case of many so called bright students and major work, many of them have done okay, but they, but they didn't you know, they, they didn't shake the world (laughter) and society like we thought they were going to.  So, the, the IQ I, I found is not necessarily the absolute indicator of success in life.  It's, you know, it's, it's, it's not bad to have a high IQ, but that doesn't mean that one's going to be, be the creative kind of, you know, person that we all, we would like to think of.  So, but back to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], it was, it was a very rich environment ac- academically.  We talk about the music.  There was physical education and there was science, American history, world history, just, just a very, very vibrant academic school.  And when you left Glenville [High School, Cleveland, Ohio] you had the equivalent of a college education today.
Story_ID: 210042
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams you've described pleasant experiences, seemingly throughout the academic year and perhaps the calendar year, but I wanna ask at this point about holidays either at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] or at home.  What were those like for the Adams family?
Speaker 2: They, they were filled with, with, guests coming in for dinners, entertaining friends and relatives in, in the home and going out to their homes, cousins that lived in Cleveland [Ohio], and there was also a tendency to pop call on people unannounced, which is almost unheard of today, just, just a Sunday afternoon and, and a holidays get in the car and drive over to X, you know place, ring the doorbell unannounced having not called even, you know.  But, it was kind of a small townish atmosphere because now, now days we just, we don't do that.  We, we, we don't pop in on people.  We phone first or make appointments (laughter) well in advance to make sure that that's on their schedule, so, that's, that's quite, you know, that was quite different in those days.  You know it was, it was, that might have been part of, like a turn of the century kind of a thing, you know, just, just very, very relaxed, you know, and everyone on Sunday was dressed up and there was nothing to after dinner to go to someone's home and they might even if, if they hadn't had dinner invite you to their table to, to have dinner with, with them.  There's plenty of food, you know, have, put up, chairs, three more chairs or whatever, so it was that very relaxed kind of, of experienced and a happy time, you know, very, very happy and, and people were genuinely pleased to see you.  When they opened the door, they were delighted to see you standing there and it's just a different time.
Speaker 1: I know you said earlier that your mother [Jessie Manease Adams] had this a very special training because of her Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] experience in domestic science with the cooking and the sewing and I'm wondering what Christmas was like in your mother's household?  Was there lots of baking going on?
Speaker 2: Lots of baking, yes, and there was always a Christmas tree, lots of presents, and Santa Claus would come to visit, you know, and, which was amazing to me, you know.  And when I was real young it was just I'd come down and there would be these presents under the tree and I though wow where did they come from?  And one time there was a bicycle, you know, I thought what how could he get that bicycle down the chimney, that big thing, I just, amazing to me.  And, and then later on I would try to stay awake to listen, you know, are they gonna really come, creep down the steps and put that there themselves?  But, I would fall asleep and sure enough the next morning I would wake up and come and peek, there it was, you know, like how did it get there (laughter)?  So, Santa Claus was very much a part of, of my childhood I would say and it was, it was a delightful.  The tree was beautiful and, and, and I always enjoyed unwrapping the presents and the gifts and everything, a very magical time for me.
Story_ID: 210043
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams, at the end of our last segment I had said we would talk this time around about your moving from the world of, the, the academic world into the world of work, but I've reason to believe now that maybe that wasn't an accurate statement that maybe you were already familiar with the world of work before you graduated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I, I was a temporary postal carrier, letter carrier during some summers and winters while I was at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], and this was to help my tuition to contribute to the fund.  However, while I was actually in school I never did have to work, ever, and I think that's wonderful support from my parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] that they, they allowed me to concentrate completely on my studies and not have to go to wait tables or go and sell things in stores or whatever students were doing.  Many of them were working in the dining halls and that kind of thing.  I never had to do that, but during the breaks I would I would take the, you know, the sub-jobs as a letter carrier and, which, which was appropriate because my dad was right there in the postal service and --
Speaker 1: So you were a letter carrier in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: In Cleveland.
Speaker 1: So you'd come home for every break?
Speaker 2: I'd just come home.  I'd live here you know at the house and, and go, go.  We would go together and I would, I would go out delivering mail during the Christmas holidays and then occasionally sometimes the summer times as well, and that contributed to the tuition, which was very high.  Oberlin was one of the, the highest tuition schools in the, in the state at that time and I just think it's wonderful that they managed to support me through this and without too much scholarship to help either.  I don't know if did have a scholar, I don't think I had a scholarship.  It was entirely my parents' support, so I feel very, very fortunate.
Speaker 1: So, were both your mother and father working during your college years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother started a little job as a, as a crossing guard for the school, for Miles Standish [Elementary] School [Cleveland, Ohio], and that was during the Second World War [World War II, WWII] when, when they, they used to have all males doing that, then they, when they started they took on females and she was one of the first and she just kept, she, she did that for about fifty years (laughter).  She, she had the longest record of any crossing guard, but it was, it was healthy.  It was easy to do, and it got her out of the house, walked to the corner, guard the kids in the mornings, after, and afternoons, and, and lunchtime too.  At first it was, it was three times a day and it was, it was a nice walk.  She got her exercise, fresh air, all kinds of weather, toughened her up, and this is during the winter time, raining weather, you know, she would, she'd get out there and walk and all the kids knew her and loved her.  And she first started out at East 88th [Street] and St. Clair [Avenue], then she was transferred to Parkgate [Avenue] and 93rd Street.  And she went through several generations (laughter) of kids, but that was, it was a wonderful period of time and, I appreciated all those experiences.
Story_ID: 210044
Speaker 1: Let's talk for a few minutes then about moving into that next phase of your life, graduating from college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and then beginning to work as professional musician and educator.  When did you finish up at Oberlin?
Speaker 2: In, in June 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your first teaching position?
Speaker 2: Well, right after Oberlin I decided I wanted to have a little bit of experience in New York City [New York, New York] and it just, it just seem appealing to me, exciting, you know, romantic and all those kinds of things, and I went there with, really without very many contacts.  My cousin on my mother's [Jessie Manease Adams] side, I think third cousin was in the acting profession.  His name was Frederick O'Neal and if you look him up in the history books and theater books you will find that he had a great deal of experience.  He was in motion pictures as a character actor, and he started the, I think the Negro Ensemble Theater [sic. American Negro Theatre] in, in Harlem [New York, New York].  This was the same theater to which Sidney Poitier went to audition and when, when Poitier went to audition having read--(unclear) or some, something in the paper about the, the ensemble theater, it was Fred who auditioned him and told him he needed more experience and his accent was too thick, you know, and, and Poitier agreed with him and went and dropped his accent and came back and re-auditioned and got accepted.  So, Fred was, was a fine actor.  His films, one, one was 'Pinky.'  He did design production.  He, he was in 'Take a Giant Step' on Broadway.  He was in 'The Winner' by Elmer Rice, which toured Cleveland [Ohio].  I saw him at the Hanna Theatre [Cleveland, Ohio] on tour in 'The Winner,' Joe [sic. Joan] Tetzel  and Tom Helmar [ph.] in Elmer Rice's 'The Winner,' and Fred played a lawyer and had a brilliant second act speech that went on for some ten minutes and the--(unclear)--applauded and I felt so proud.  And he came to the house right after that for dinner and he was sitting there and he--Fred had charisma to burn, I mean it just like a charismatic person.  His presence was, was magnetic and later in his career he became the successor to Ralph Bellamy as president of Actors' Equity of America [sic. Actors' Equity Association], a position he held for several years and this was the Actors' Equity, the entire thing, you know.  The great, a great personality and he ended up being in AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] in an executive capacity there.  Anyway that he, he was someone that I really look, looked up to and, and revered.  He helped me to get established a little bit in New York and I would got there for dinners to his home with his wife, Charlotte [Talbot Hainey], who is my cousin by, you know, on my mother's side by marriage and I did not have many contacts there and I did whatever I could do, and it was really very, very romantic--
Story_ID: 210045
Speaker 1: I mean, I--short periods of time, short order cook (laughter), typist, clerk typist.  Then I ended up with, with playing piano for ballet classes, the June Taylor School of Dance [New York, New York].  June [Taylor] had just won her Emmy for 'The Jackie Gleason Show.'  She had it sitting there on the desk as you come in, and she had a full ballet roster of classes and I was, I would play for those classes and I learned a lot about ballet (laughter) and about improvisation because a lot of times the teacher would come and do a little combination and I would look at it and then I would play back for that combination as the students would, would do it.  I learned how to balance it so that it would flow with the movements and could stop on time (laughter), so I learned a lot about ballet.  And then I started studying privately first with Robert Starer who was at Juilliard [School, New York, New York] at the time and Vittorio Giannini was at Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  I started concertizing my music on radio and, and getting artists to sing at first recitals.  I also had a revue at Steinway Hall [New York, New York] and then finally Judson Hall [New York, New York].  One of the pe- people in, in my first audience was [HistoryMaker] George Shirley a tenor--(unclear)--at that time and African American tenor, I have to say--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But that was pretty much my beginning work thing.  There's was one time when I was like, like a sub-clerk typist for an agency.  They would send me out and I, I did learn my typing at Glenville [High School, Cleveland, Ohio], so I did my typing assignments and, and had nothing to do with music, that was, that was just it you know and I lived first in mid-Manhattan [New York, New York] and then 73rd Street near West End and then 160th Street in Washington Heights [New York, New York] and then down to the Lower East Side [New York, New York], you know, a walkup apartment, which the first two was with, with someone; last time was by myself.  And I had a piano there and I would do a lot of composing in my own apartment, and so that was my beginning work.
Story_ID: 210046
Speaker 1: So, were you teaching at all at that point in your career?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right after New York [New York], I did get a teaching in Linden, New Jersey, and this was something that my folks [Jessie Manease Admas and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] wanted me to do.  They wanted me to get music education, you know, to have something to fall back on, an old expression.
Speaker 1: So, did you have a double major in composition and music ed [education] or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: From Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: And this was purely because to appease my folks, you know, they, they just could not see me making it as a full-time composer without some teaching okay and I was just grateful to be able to, to major in music, so I went along with the program, you know, I had no problem with that and I enjoyed the teaching.  I've always enjoyed teaching, you know, and so that, that, the junior high school was a wonderful experience and it was not too far from New York City, but I did live there in Linden and had choral classes and music appreciation classes and general music you could say.
Story_ID: 210047
Speaker 1: Now this might be obvious to some people and I'm gonna ask this question anyway.  What was it about New York [New York] that really attracted you to the Big Apple?
Speaker 2: I think the, the excitement of it all, the thrill of, of being in a big city like that with so much activity going on.  While I was at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] if I could backtrack just a little bit, I did sing with the Oberlin College Choir for four years under Robert Fountain, and, and for the spring breaks we would take a tour literally of various locations throughout the region, the country and we'd play or give concerts in the churches and some auditoriums, mainly affiliated with Oberlin, some kind of contact with Oberlin.  And four of those occasions we went to New York City to give a concert in [The] Town Hall [New York, New York], which was considered the top concert hall in the country at that time and each time we got rave reviews from the New York Times and the Post and they, they loved the concert choir.  It was a great choir, and so I got my taste of it then and each time we would go to New York then we would be housed in different locations and we would have time to go around and do sightseeing and so I was just, I was intrigued by New York.  It was like a challenge, you know, to, to go and I wanted to go in mid-Manhattan.  I didn't want to go in the suburb.  I wanted to be right in the heart of, of things, so that's why I ended up working and interacting and getting my whole New York experience.  It also had, had that mystique of being the center of culture at that time, which, which was quite a bit, you know, it was perceptional.  It may have not been, but that's the way people kind of perceived it to be and the way I perceived it to be at that particular point in time, so it was a challenge for me, you know, like if you can make it in New York you can make it any place kind of a thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's what the song says.
Speaker 2: I, I think that times have changed today, but at that time it was pretty much, you know, it was New York and then L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] on the, on the West Coast, so those two places were the, so I chose New York.  And I, I did all right there.  I did very, very well, you know, I, I had I would say maybe a couple hundred performances of my music there.  It was, it was a wonderful experience, and, and I value it.  It gave me a perspective for, for other parts of the country.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't a starving artist?
Speaker 2: No I was not, no, no, I did all right for myself, yeah.  I've always done all right for myself (laughter).
Story_ID: 210048
Speaker 1: How long then did you keep the [teaching] position in [Linden] New Jersey and stay in the New Jersey, New York area?
Speaker 2: That was for one academic year.  Then, there was a request for my services here at Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio], and Fred O'Neal [Frederick O'Neal] was the contact for that and they had contacted him and he recommended me as associate musical director.  There was Helmut Wolfus [ph.] and Ben O'Frank [ph.] were the two art people there.  Ben O was director.  Helmut was the musical person and they needed someone to be an associate to them.  So, I came back from Linden and started at Karamu.  I was there for one year and I played the shows every night, some, some of the musicals and opera.  They, they had short one-act operas there and scenes for operas and also while I was there I went on a tour, Karamu's only European tour.  Before and since they had not done that.  And it was doing two one-act operas in English, 'Little Red Riding Hood'--(unclear)--and 'Sweet Betsy from Pike,' a parody course opera, and I was the onstage pianist, co, co-pianist with Helmut Wolfus, and it was Germany, primarily Germany, Berlin [Germany], Dusseldorf [Germany], Heidelberg [Germany], Stuttgart [Germany].  We also went to Paris [France].  We were there in Paris for three days sightseeing.  We went to Switzerland, Ireland, Dublin.  So, it was a wonderful tour.  It was, it was about seven weeks, and, and we would send notices back to, to Cleveland [Ohio] and, and we would have the notices in the papers about what we were doing and it was, it was a wonderful experience.  That was my, right after New York [New York], that was my next biggest assignment as associate musical director at Karamu House.
Speaker 1: So is that still in the 1950s or are we moving into the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: In the 1960s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the late part of the '50s [1950s], and no this was in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: And were the Jelliffes [Russell Jelliffe and Rowena Jelliffe] still here at that time?
Speaker 2: No it was right after the Jelliffes had left I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now--
Speaker 2: Olcutt Sanders was, was the name, executive director at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the founder was Russell and Rowena Jelliffe.  I think they left in 1963.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they retired.
Speaker 1: Okay and then Mr. Olcutt comes.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay and so that's the beginning of your residence--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Karamu?  Okay.  And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there for a full season.
Story_ID: 210049
Speaker 1: Then, I really felt that I wanted to, to pursue my master's degree and so even while I was at Karamu [House, Cleveland, Ohio] I was sending out letters to various schools to be accepted as a master's candidate and I got a call from three institutions and I chose California because I'd never been to the West Coast and it was just another experience that I wanted to have.  So, it turned out to be Long Beach, California.  I had a friend who was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], so I spent the summer in L.A. and then went to Long Beach for my, the beginning of my master's work and that was the California State College at Long Beach [Long Beach, California].  It's now University, California State University in Long Beach.
Speaker 2: And was that a productive year as well?
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: I'm assuming a one year master's program?
Speaker 1: It was one year plus, a little, a few more months--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah and it was very productive.  I got into the college choir there.  When, when, when the choral director saw my background, he approached me in registration and asked would I sing with the college choir and I, I did, and I ended up being a section leader for the alto section and also he had me to conduct in concerts too, two, two numbers.  And he had me billed as associated conductor, which was, I was only a student, I mean I don't know where he got that title from, but he, he was probably very proud of me, I think, and wanted to showcase me.  Frank Pooler was his name, was a very fine choral director, task master so to speak, but he, but he produced wonderful choral presentations.  And then I studied composition there.  In fact, my major was comp at, at Long Beach and Leon Dalon [ph.] and Robert Tindell [ph.] were my maj- were like major teachers of composition at Long Beach.  And I took all the courses, the, the music history, and I did all the assignments and I also had a great interesting experience.  My, my roommate in the dorm turned out to be a studyholic.  I mean he would do nothing but study.  When I would come in, he would be studying.  And I would hesitate to turn on the radio for fear of disturbing him, so I would study too, and at the end of that first semester I received a 4.0 average.  He, he received a 3.5 (laughter), but I always say if it weren't for him I probably never would have really realized my potentials.  'Cause I didn't know I really could do that.  I never thought of myself as a straight A student.  It, it was not my perception of myself, you know, but, but because of the environment which he created I ended up really digging into the assignments and, and doing them to the best of my ability and focusing.  That was the key thing.  I really focused even more so than Obe-- at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] my time was divided my, my curriculum and my extracurricular activities and I did a whole lot of extracurricular like I conducted, I composed, I arranged for the Mummer's Club, which was a student organization there.  I was in opera and lab, all different kinds of extracurricular activities, which were wonderful and very successful.
Story_ID: 210050
Speaker 1: And I might just mention a footnote I did conceive and direct and act in a production, non-musical production called 'An Eight O'clock Meeting,' which featured two professors of English and students, one of whom is Tony Musante who went on to do a lot of professional work in films and, and theater, a very fine actor, but I conceived it and directed it.  One time only, just one performance only and that was--so, I'm, I'm just mentioning that, that, that I could have brought into theater if I wanted to, and I could also have gone into writing if I'd wanted to, but I wanted to focus in on one thing, you know, I wanted the people to think of me in one way, so I, I totally uttered down.  I don't talk about it too much, but I, but I still write.  You know when I'm not composing, I'm writing, I write movie commentary on the Internet under an alias.  No one knows who it is for the movie database, you know, and I do that all that time.  You know I have about four hundred of those commentaries on there right, right now, you know, and it's just a sideline that's, it's creative and it's enjoyable and when I'm not doing the music I think I like to balance it off.  I don't want to get too, too much into just on area and just become fixed in that one thing.  I want to be able to be flexible, you know, and do other kinds of things as well, so that's, you know that's, but, but I just have to mention that as a sideline though.
Speaker 2: Was that theater piece conceived at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] or?
Speaker 1: Yes Oberlin--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --my senior year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah it was, sure was and actually it might have been into my junior year 1954 into my junior year.  We put it on and it was, it was about ninety minutes long and it was, it was a long piece, but it was, it was tight, very tight, and I remember having several run-throughs in which the actress would say the first lines and the end lines of their various selections just to have the, the timing right and the lighting so they could go through it and get fluid on the lighting cues and the timing and the walking and entrances so you know and I read Edgar Allan Poe's a '[The] Tell-Tale Heart' was one thing, I did a solo on it and we had Thurber [ph.] and Dickens [ph.].  These were all excerpts you know, and I got the idea from, from Professor Sellers [ph.] who was Canada and who was my English teacher, and he had such an eloquent delivery of the, of his text that he was presenting, the 'Iliad' [Homer] and 'Odyssey' [Homer] and all.  He would start off reciting this you know and I thought what a wonderful delivery.  I want to use that some kind of way and I just thought what if I do this.  What if I had a program of just read it, readings, you know, staged readings and different people sitting here, people on stools, people coming in and like conversationally and then I arranged Vachel Lindsay's 'The Congo' poem for a co-ed speaking group and percussion and that was the finale of this.  And, and four readers on stools and music stands, lights on them, a co-ed speaking group of twenty doing various kinds of sounds in rhythms and a percussion, usually, mostly African drums percussion instruments doing and so that was the finale of this.  Unusual, you know, and it was all metered out like a score and so that's what gave me the idea was Mr. Sellers re- beautiful readings of his text, you know, and so I just turned it into a theater piece and it was a packed house, one time only.
Story_ID: 210051
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm wondering if this love that you described for the theater and for that drama and of the oratory--when you started to compose for the stage, for opera, combining the music, and the great storytelling.  Was that in California?
Speaker 2: That came later on.
Speaker 1: Oh, after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --after the Long Beach experience [at California State College at Long Beach; California State University Long Beach, Long Beach, California]?
Speaker 2: --right, yeah.  For my, for my Long Beach, my master's [degree] thesis was a concerto for piano and orchestra in three movements.  That was my big project there.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was the title of that?
Speaker 2: Concerto for piano (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: And when did you finish up at Long Beach?
Speaker 2: That, '65 [1965] I would say, '64 [1964], '65 [1965] and when I finished there I had a contact actually in Raton, New Mexico of all places.  Fellow I met there who, who was the director of a group called Kaleidoscope Players.  Raton is small town outside the Colorado border line, 7000 feet elevation and my friend started a theatrical group that did touring there and he, he was also a promoter and he, he, he sort of an agent for different shows, you know, and he had a summer stock company at the Shuler Theater [Raton, New Mexico] in Raton, which is a major theater of, of the community and he would do different presentations there during the summer time.  He asked me if I could come and do a show with him.  It was 'The Fantasticks,' the famous musical 'Fantasticks.'  So, I came and I was the musical director for that, taught everyone the music and played the piano for, for the presentation with a little bit of percussion and I was off stage, behind the stage okay, and it was a good cast, wonderful production.  And while I was there the superintendent of schools came and asked me would I be interested in a position in the schools there.  Well, I had nothing especially to do, except I did have to complete a few more weeks there in Long Beach and so I was able to go to Long Beach finish up there and then come back and do, start in the schools in Raton, New Mexico, so that was my next big thing.
Story_ID: 210052
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams, I did want to ask again more about your teaching and composing, but also about changes in the American society with the Vietnam War era and during the civil rights era also.  I wondered if you were touched personally by either one of those movements with the anti-war movement or the Civil Rights Movement in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, in- interestingly I would say not too much, you know not directly.  It just, just in terms of being aware and seeing things on television and so forth, but I, I can't say that I really participated per se.  I did an arrangement of 'We Shall Overcome,' however, and, and that was one, one thing that I probably would not have done that was, that was the, the song that, that they sang and they marched, you know.  I arranged that for a four-part a cappella choir and solo.  And in terms of the social activism, I guess that's, that's really not for me to do per se; however, I do it in different ways, you know, like maybe artistically, you know, I would say.
Speaker 1: So, you're in a very conscious way in the 1960s then--
Speaker 2: I was conscious yeah.
Speaker 1: --using those things perhaps in some of your work?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, um-hum.  And then I did the 'The Righteous Man' cantata based on [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] or dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King later on, you know, that was one, one thing you know.  I appreciated King very, very much.  I, I thought that he was at a very high level of consciousness.  His, his vibration was very positive, and I got, I got that from King.  I also got that from [President] Abraham Lincoln as well, you know, very, a very strong positive vibration which I is I guess metaphysical (laughter).
Story_ID: 210053
Speaker 1: May I ask again please about your experiences in [Raton] New Mexico. You had alluded to those in a previous segment--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but was that like, teaching in that environment?
Speaker 2: This was New Mexico, yes--
Speaker 1: New Mexico, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) New Mexico, yes, right over the as you cross Colorado into New Mexico, Raton it sits upon on 'em like a mesa, 7000 feet elevation.  It was interesting because, because they call it the air-conditioned city.  It was always about 75 degrees and, and no, no winter per se and always beautiful and fleece clouds and on the hill you could see the mesas there, which is little plateaus, you know, mountain plateaus.  The, the assignment I had was vocal music in the junior and senior high school.  And it was an interesting experience because when I, when I came back, after I finished my master's degree [at California State College at Long Beach; California State University Long Beach, Long Beach, California], I, I completed that it was close to October the, the sessions.  School had begun in September, so they allowed the school to begin before, well not sure before I got there, but the classes were already in sessions and there was a lady who was the professional accompanist who sort of took those over until I could get there.  So, I think that was very nice of them to, to do that.  And when I arrived, there were a lot of students in those classes that, that really did weren't, weren't that interested in, in being there--(unclear)--you know I guess administration thought it was easy way to get, get rid of some, put 'em into music and that kind of thing and so I, I met with them the first week and then I went home and I though okay if I'm going to make a success of this and I'm going to be happy doing this, there's going to be changes that will have to be made.  I don't know how they're going to be made, but they were going to have to be made and so I knew I was there, they wanted a good core program and I knew that in order to do this I would have to have students who were interested in, in, in singing and many of them that were there were not.  It was like, it was like a glorified study hall.  So, I made the decision that I would have to really audition them.  I'd have to voice test them.  I call it voice testing and it would have to be done systemically.  It would have to be done very, very accurately, very professionally and I did feel I had the support of superintendent of schools, not necessarily the principals of the schools of the junior senior, and senior high schools who had a different kind of consciousness, but, but the, but it was the superintendent who asked me to come here in the first place and he was in charge of all.  So, what I did was simply to start voice testing every student that I could possible do.  First, the students that were in the classes and they were, they were not particularly interested in singing per se, but, but they were, it was not called music appreciation or general music.  It was called chorus, choir, that was the name, name of the course, so I decided well if, if that's what the course is and that's what I'm here for, that's what it's going to be and so what I did is to, to rank order the students according to certain criteria, vocal range, qualitone, quality, reading ability, reproduction of pitches and so forth and so forth, hearing and so forth and I also went beyond the actual students that were in the classrooms to other students in various parts of the building that I would see in the hallway, have you, do you sing?  Would you be interested in singing?  Would you be interested in getting your voice tested?  And so I got this, this, this list of students that was extensive, into the hundreds, and since there was only one el- one junior high and one senior high in the whole town that put me in touch of all these students.  There was, there was nowhere else they could go except to these two schools and so as I say I rank ordered them in terms of each criteria.  I also sent daily reports to the superintendent of schools as to what was going on in those classes.  Every day he would get a report, exactly what I was doing and if there was no learning going on, there was no learning going on, it would just be a study hall, you know, while I voiced tested, so--
Story_ID: 210054
Speaker 1: And then I made a recommendation, a proposal that these students are qualified to be in the choir and these are borderline, these, these are definitely not you know, so in mid-semester in, in as late as November before anyone knew what happened out went students and in came this, this new group of students and the town [Raton, New Mexico] had never heard of anything like that.  They didn't know it could happen.  It was inconceivable anything could happen like that in November, but it happened and in December we put on a presentation in the Shuler Theater [Raton, New Mexico] of Christmas music.  It was very beautiful, and people were very impressed with, with the choir.  How I really did it was to teach every class the same music, junior high and senior high throughout the day and then I would have auditions, having had this special group, I would auditions in the classroom.  They had to get on a little box and stand and sing their parts, okay, and at the end of that I would write the names of those who passed on the board, and they could see the standards, you know.  They would re-audition, but, but only the ones who could get up there and sing got on, got on the board.  So, the--I ended up calling all of the students who passed that audition in, in class audition after school for a rehearsal and it was gorgeous.  They started singing 'Panis Angelicus' of Cesar Franck--(unclear)--are blessed.  It was so beautiful.  They started looking around.  They couldn't believe their own sound they were making.  All the parts were beautiful, in balance, gorgeous tone, and there were equal junior high as well as senior high in, in there, which meant that the twelfth graders had to respect the seventh graders standing next to them, and they did because they realized that they were producing and so this was in December when this, when we revealed this choir.
Story_ID: 210055
Speaker 1: And then another turn up or shake up came in January when I made certain recommendations and got more people and others went out, others came in, and again we had auditions in, in the classroom and we put on a spring pop concerns and a musical, 'My Fair Lady.'  We did 'My Fair Lady' there that floored the whole community [Raton, New Mexico].  And we did our spring concert just for the choir.  There was a photographer there that took a picture, wrote an article.  I didn't know about it.  It turned, it was in the front page headlines of Raton the next day, you know, about this concert, which was only done one time and so it was really a very beautiful sounding group and I, I sort of got my how you say approach to working with choirs that, that way you know, which, which was, which was an unusual approach I would say and I've used it ever since then.  Mainly more of a group singing, sing-along approach rather than a technical approach.  All the technique is there, but we, I very seldom talk about technique, just you know, just sing along, we go through the piece and sing along, go through it and enjoy it, have fun and relax and just, just have fun, you know and you end up with gorgeous, gorgeous performance, you know, and maybe little technical stuff here and there thrown in, but as a sideline, but not as a focal point.  In other words, we're singing from the hearts, not from our minds, you know.  We're not singing from or heads up.  We're singing from our hearts upward out.  It comes from within out, and, and also the warm-up session is never omitted.  There's always the vocal leads at the beginning and the vocal leads is always a tenth interval which warms up the whole voice very quickly and then I always, you know, emphasize the, the warm-up and I think and I think of the whole rehearsal as a warm-up.  They think the vocal instrument is a very slowly speaking instrument and needs time to warm up, and I had seen very many conductors who would, who would get very demonstrative and throw all kinds of kind of tantrums because the tone wasn't there and so forth.  Well, the tone wasn't there because they hadn't warmed the group up.  That was the reason the tone wasn't there and they, and also they were looking for perf, technical perfection again before the group was warmed up, and I found that by going through say you start out with a number and all kinds of mistakes in it, get off the number and go to the next and the next, and the next, and the next.  After singing ten numbers, go back to the first one, all the mistakes are gone.  How did it happen?  We weren't even rehearsing the number.  How could it be that we, well the answer is because they warmed up and they got focused, okay, and didn't even work on that number and I also decided that the rehearsal period in many programs is much too long.
Story_ID: 210056
Speaker 1: Some college programs have rehearsals that in fact, a whole semester is nothing but sitting there rehearsing and then you put on your concert and it's over in an hour or an hour and a half, you know, so the whole thing has been rehearsal, so whenever I do anything I always make sure that we go out into the community and do presentations.  Go to Kiwanis Club or the Rotary [Club] or some church or something and sing periodically, you know, often, so we have the experience of communicating that music, not just sitting in a, in a, in a classroom or rehearsal hall rehearsing it, you know, so I got a little carried away with that (laughter).
Speaker 2: No that's fine and I'm, I'm wondering since you seem to be describing--(unclear)--really enjoying these classroom activities, but there is also time away from composing, so were you able to balance the two or did the composing suffer?
Speaker 1: The, the, the, the, there was not too much composing in Raton [New Mexico] in that particular period, no there was not.  However, at the end of the Raton school year my contact there wanted me to be a musical director for a musical called 'Lost in the Stars' that was going to tour the country, a six months tour and they were going to bring in some New York artists for that particular presentation and I, and I jumped at the opportunity.  You know, when, when, when you're young I feel you need different experiences, not just get in one place and stick there and I had no idea that I would be in Raton for too long, I mean, you know even though it was an extremely successful year I wanted different experiences.  So, I did accept that and LaVerne Hutcherson came down from New York to sing the lead role Stephen Kumalo in, in 'Lost in the Stars,' Lucia Hawkins.  LaVerne Hutcherson by the way was on the soundtrack of Porgy, I take that back, of, of, 'Carmen Jones.'  He was [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte's voice in 'Carmen Jones.'  So, you would hear, see that movie LaVerne Hutcherson was the one I was working with, you know, and he, and he had a gorgeous tenor voice.  In, in the soundtrack of, of Jones, he had to sing sort of half voice because they didn't want Belafonte to be too operatic sounding, so he had to tone, tone that voice down, but in a, in a few--(unclear)--like the flower song you can hear him come out this gorgeous powerful tenor, magnificent voice, and so in, in 'Lost in the Stars' he had many occasions to and opportunities to do that and it was six months.  We, we were touring for six months, which is a long time to, to travel and a lot of this was one-night stands and this I had never done before and again I wasn't doing too much composing then, but I, I did, I did learn from that, you know, it was theater and I was on the stage.  I was the on-stage pianist and they set up the sets.  They were rather, rather, you know, representational pieces that they would use, but the piano was always on stage and I would, I would, I was the orchestra for, for that and, and we, we played different states, different major cities.  In major houses, we were reviewed professionally and as well as maybe, maybe a few smaller, you know, sites and, but it gave me a sense again of theater, of drama, and timing.  So that, that, that came right after Raton and then, then while I was doing the 'Lost in the Stars' we played Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida].  While we were that [HistoryMaker] William Foster, the director, the dean of the school of music, came up and said there was an opening coming up would I be interested after I finished (laughter), and I said yes.  So, right after I finished the, the final performance which was in--(unclear)--Pennsylvania, I came home for the holidays and then we went down to, Rat- to, to Tallahassee, Florida for--(unclear)--I was there for two, I think trimesters or something there you know, and while I was in, in Tallahassee I thought now is the time to per, to think about my doctorate work, okay, you know, and I wanted it to be in composition and so I wrote to [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] and went up for an interview, was accepted, and so when I finished there in Tallahassee I went directly to Columbus, Ohio, and started my doctorate work in composition from Ohio State.
Story_ID: 210057
Speaker 1: And are you teaching and also working towards the doctorate in Columbus, Ohio, or were you able to concentrate once again on your studies (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was able to concentrate once again.  However, I did have a church job.  My advisor was giving up a job at the Unitarian church in Worthington [Ohio], which was just right outside just a, just a few blocks actually outside of Columbus and in, in the same bus line as [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], you know, on High Street, North High Street and so I, I did take that position.  I did the choir.  I had an accompanist.  I stood there and conducted and that was for that year while I was at Ohio State, you know, and it didn't take that much time and I did all my studies and, and it was a very fine experience at the whole Ohio, Ohio State period.  It was very, very fine, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Mr. Baker [sic. HistoryMaker H. Leslie Adams] tell me you get to the doctoral studies you've had a number of diverse experiences in very different environments--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the West Coast, the Southwest, historically black college [and university, HBCU] at Florida [Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida], and then back to the Midwest with Ohio State University.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy them all or did you have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I did, I did, I did, were all, they were all wonderful experience, they really were.  Yes, I, I did and at Ohio State I took a variety of subjects including philosophy, philosophy music, and I thought wow you know when, when, when I went into that class I thought where has this been all my life, you know, I, I just, the kinds of things we're talking about here are the kinds of things I thought we should have been talking about in an elementary school, you know, the origins of man, his ultimate destiny.  I think wow you know, this is great and Henry [L.] Cady was, was the teacher and he was, he was very philosophical and spiritual and just--it was just wonderful.
Story_ID: 210058
Speaker 1: I also had a teacher Keith [E.] Mixter who taught notation to 1300 and introduction to bibliography it was called, two of the toughest courses I ever took in my life and it, that sharpened me to in, in many ways.  It, it, it showed me what I could do to pursue a topic to get an answer and, and how, and how tenacious I could be to, to toward getting that end, to getting to the library, get on the phone call the library, and now go on the Internet, you know, and anything that, any answer that I want, you know, and the reference books, what, whatever sources, you know, and that was part of that, that bibliography course.  He would, he would give us five questions, for example, to, to answer by the next time we met and one question might have been in 18 something Charles[-Valentin] Alkan wrote a string quartet is this published and where can it be obtained.  That might be one question of the five.  Okay, so who is Charles Alkan?  Is he American, is he English, is he Austrian where you know, is he French, who knows.  So, we have to first find, and he's not a well-known composer so we'd have to dig out our references to find, try to find who he is and then to find out his works and how do you find that, where do you go.  It got us into to the stacks of the library of [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], which is one of the, one of the greatest library collections in, in the world, I think, it's just magnificent, in all kinds of languages and it, and then to pursue that, to go to, to take the steps to find, where you finally have to arrive to find out that answer.  It might take if a class met on a, on a Thursday and the next one's on a Tuesday, it might take 'til maybe Saturday evening before you find out that one question and you have four more questions to go.  Well, that's your whole weekend right there and so it was just a, a very challenging course and Keith Mixter was of the old school, you know.  I don't think he realized how tough his course work was.  You know it was just, he'd had just being doing it and that's the way it was, you know, and so week after week I, I kept expecting him to left off that, that we were gonna now be able to go out on the weekends like other students and go to the movies or to have fun.  It never let up the whole semester.  I couldn't believe it, and I didn't know that I could apply myself to, it was like, I call that basic training in the service, you know, you--beyond the point of endurance almost, you know, trying to find these answers to these questions.  And that was just one co- course.  The other course was notations 1300 which, which was the reading about the old manuscripts that the, of nums [ph.] of musical notation from origins from the first civilization to 1300 and that's where the cutoff point was 1300 and how these systems changed over the centuries and, and you know in various parts of the world, mainly Europe, and then to be able to transcribe these.  Like you would look in museums the early musical writings, all this funny notation.  That's what we were (laughter) dealing with.  Wow, I thought wow you know this is a whole new world, you know, and Mixter was right in it.  He was, he was living it.  He was a real, real professor of the old school, and there was something about his integrity and commitment and reality that was so appealing to me and so inspirational to me that I said you know something this is what I, this is, this is the attitude I wanna have to, to, of excellence, of achieving excellence and I thought you know I may never use this material again per se that I'm learning from, but the attitude I value, you know, and he's still on my mailing list by the way.  He's, he's now retired from, from Ohio State, but of all the teachers I had, I had Keith Mixter is the one that, that I value the most I would say.  And it wasn't about composition, it was about an attitude toward achievement I suppose and so I just had to throw that in (laughter), very inspirational for me.
Story_ID: 210059
Speaker 1: Why don't we talk about inspiration for just a little while?  I know a couple of segments ago you'd mentioned metaphysics and you've mentioned throughout our discussion the importance of good teachers and role models, but basically today as a composer where would you say your inspiration comes from?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, first all I think maybe I believe in something like destiny that, that you know.  I don't think that, that it would, that my parents just happen to be my parents [Jessie Manease Adams and Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.].  I think that some kind of way there was something that was already pre, pre-destined some kind of way and all through school how the doors were always open for me, how I was always able to not only, not merely survive, but to thrive.  You know I had excellent teachers, not a weak link in the, in the whole, from elementary all the way through graduate school, you know, excellent teachers who, who, who knew their subject and who taught it well and who had an interest in me and so, so all that's part of, of that background, of that support, you know having the support, you know, and today a fan club.  Can, can you imagine, I mean a classical composer having a fan club means again support, you know, and since I don't have brothers and sisters I have dear friends who are supportive, you know, and provide the, the social, you know, the, the support systems and people I can call up on the phone or go to see and we can go out, you know, it's just, it's, it's really very, very gratifying and all of this is, is as an only child, as a single person who's never married I'm here in a studio by myself.  I can walk into an empty motel room and be just as happy, just in paradise, you know, so that that's part of this, I guess, the, the being alone and yet not alone, having, knowing that I have friends, deep friends and teachers who are supporting me.

Speaker 1: And so you had already reached that level of consciousness in your, at the time that you were completing your Ph.D. work [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say so.  Yeah, I was on that road (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah to the one that they call the terminal degree--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which didn't terminate you, you're still smiling (laughter) so obviously--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you had thrived once again.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When did you finish up your Ph.D. studies as we approach the end of this segment?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was in '73 [1973], yes.
Speaker 1: And the topic again for your Ph.D. work, your dissertation?
Speaker 2: The topic it, it was in, it was problems of composing core music for high school youths.  It's like a music education topic you know, but I did end of composing several pieces, all of which were published and performed.
Story_ID: 210061
Speaker 1: All right, Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams we were talking just a moment ago about your work towards you doctorate and at [The] Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, and again you're describing difficult work, but rewarding experiences there and so I wanted to ask again when are you finishing up your requirements for the degree and, and what's next on your agenda at that point?
Speaker 2: Okay, well in, in my period in which I finished my course work per, per se I was then to start on my dissertation work and my advisor who was the one who got me the job at the Unitarian church was from Kansas and he said there was an opening in the education, school of education department, University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], would I be interested in going out and trying out for that and what I could do then is to write my dissertation while I'm there, rather, rather than elsewhere, and it usually takes a little while to do the dissertation and I could, I could be teaching while I am doing that work, so I thought well I, I would do that, so I flew out there, took an interview and came back, didn't know what the answer was.  They had several others to, to, to see as well and end of two weeks I got the word that I had got the job.  So, I went out to, a Lawrence, Kansas, and began my teaching out there on the faculty in the school of education and in the school of fine arts.  In education, I had a voice class.  I had conducting, choral conducting, a methods class, supervision of, of student teachers in the field.  In school of fine arts, I had the concert choir, which was a group of about eighty-five voices and it would present concerts at the end of the semesters.  And so I also was doing a lot of composing on the side too, during weekends and evenings and I got a lot of different things finished, a lot of different, like the sonatas and choral pieces, art songs, and had some performances different, different places.  My piano concerto was done at the University of Kansas for the [Special] Bicentennial [Celebration] Concert and it was very successfully, very beautifully performed.
Speaker 1: Was that the master's thesis or a different--
Speaker 2: That was the master's thesis--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --yes there was, yes, right, yeah, yeah, it was, and it was a beautiful performance, very, very successfully performed and received.
Story_ID: 210062
Speaker 1: Like I said, I was in charge of the concert choir which meant a concert, major concert at the end of each semester, that's two a year, and I was, I was there [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] for four years, so it's eight major concerts, which means eight major repertoires and, and also it would be a combined performance with, with, with other choirs and orchestras and so I'm preparing the works, major works for that like [Wolfgang Amadeus] Beethoven 9th ['Symphony No. 9'] and so forth and then I also was invited to be the conductor of an ad hoc group, the University Wives Chorus, and that was a very, very beautiful concert.  We did the Benjamin Britten's '[A] Ceremony of Carols,' female voices--(unclear)--so forth and then for the regular concert choir it was, it, there were major works that we did.  We did [Johann Sebastian] Bach cantatas and things with orchestra, with chamber orchestras and things for our concerts and I, I proceeded to carry out my philosophy of taking the choir out into the community, not just doing one concert in a whole semester, but we would, we would go into the community for different occasions.  Several churches had us as, as guests for their, guest choirs for the, the morning services and the choir sounded wonderful.  It was, and, and they loved doing it and I also had quite a few students and faculty to perform my music.  I had an all [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams concert there too I might say.  Now during that time I met a writer from New York.  I would always come back to visit friends in New York and he said he had an idea for an opera, a libretto, and we talked about it and I'd always wanted to write an --(unclear)--because I feel, I felt it was a combining of all of the various, you know, the kinds of instrumental and vocal and drama, dance, all that thing, and so that the fusion of the art so to speak appealed to me quite a bit and so I said you know I would really like to do this.  And it came at a time in which, which I was getting ready to finish up my dissertation, which I did.  I took defense of it, passed it, and at the end of that period I thought you know well I've finished that, I've got my degree, I came back to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and marched in the processional in graduation and everything.  Much to my mother's [Jessie Manease Adams] delight, she, she thought it was just wonderful and it fulfilled her dream.  She always wanted me to get a doctorate she said, so part of my getting a doctorate was motivated by her to a great extent.  I don't know if that I would have done that on my own or not, I really don't.
Speaker 2: Was your father [Harrison Leslie Adams, Sr.] still alive at that point?
Speaker 1: No, he, he passed in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'cause I know you had mentioned earlier that he always wanted you to be a doctor too.
Speaker 1: Yes, a medical doctor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a different kind, okay.
Speaker 1: No, he passed while I was still in New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah, so, but my mother was thrilled with that.
Story_ID: 210063
Speaker 1: And so I went back to Kansas [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] and I had a few more, three more years before I could take a sabbatical.  I though, hm, that would be interesting, so I--
Speaker 2: So you're tenured faculty?
Speaker 1: I was tenured faculty yes--
Speaker 2: At University of Kansas?
Speaker 1: Yes, and I want on and continued to, to teach there and compose, you know, and I had, kind of had a feeling some, in the back of my mind that maybe administration would be a way to get more time to compose.  You know, I thought that this would be an interesting--I would be involved with classroom teacher.  I know it would be more office work and then I could have more free time in which to compose.  Well, for my sabbatical leave, my assignment was a symphony in four movements and it was, it was something I was very pleased to do and I had written to the Rockefeller Foundation for a position at, in Bellagio [Italy].  They had a center there in Bellagio, Italy, as a matter of fact, and it took a year for them to respond, but they, re- they wrote back and asked me would I just want one room.  I said yes.  And so I was accepted there, and the arrangement was that I would, I would pay my, my plane fair round trip, but everything else would be provided.  The, the, the, accommodations, the food, everything, you know.  So, I thought well that's, that's a nice arrangement.  So, I, I did that and I was able to get over and at the time I was kind of interested in the work of Michelangelo.  I had seen that movie 'The Agony and the Ecstasy' in widescreen.  It was CinemaScope or--(unclear)--, you know, it was so, so beautiful and at the time I got so excited about Michelangelo's work and the Sistine [Chapel, Vatican City] and all that kind of thing.  So, I said I can combine this and make a tour of Michelangelo's work and go to Bellagio and do my residency there.  So, I arranged my schedule so that I would arrive in Rome [Italy] and then go to Florence [Italy] and then to Milan [Italy], that's with the major of works of Michelangelo, so, so I got to see the Sistine and you know and David and the Pieta and you know and the Moses, San pie, San Pietro in Vincoli, the, the Church of St. Peter in Chains [Rome, Italy] and also go to see where Michelangelo spent a period where he was in exile.  There was, there was fighting going on and so he retreated to this room while, while the fighting was going on and while he was in there he sketched on the, on the ceiling and on the walls while he was there, you know, and I remember being so, so close.  I said wow, you know, in, in this room there, there's his sketch you know preserved and I thought, I thought it was very exciting and, and, and in Rome it's like a new city built on an old.  For example--(unclear)--and they say and that's where Mark Anthony [sic. Mark Antony; Marcus Antonius] gave his speech, you know in, in favor of Julius [Caesar] and I thought it's still there (laughter).  It's very exciting and so I got all that out of my system and then went on to Bellagio and it was thirty-five miles about north of Milan.
Story_ID: 210064
Speaker 1: And it was interesting when I was in Milan [Italy] they sent a limo [limousine] all the way from Bellagio [Italy] to pick me up and drive me all the way to see Bellagio, which is a beautiful drive, which, which I couldn't appreciate too much because the driver was speeding all the way around curves as I, I understand Italian drivers do.  But, when I got to the, to, to the entrance it was on a hill and a villa it was, it was [Grand Hotel] Villa Serbelloni [Bellagio, Italy] and they, there was a guard at the gate made, made some kind of you know exchange of words.  As we drove into the, the, garden the whole staff was lined up just to greet me.  All of the--(unclear)--and the maids and the cooks and all may, maybe twenty-four of them lined up there.  Wow, (laughter) what a nice gesture that is.
Speaker 2: They treat their composers well--
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: --in Italy.
Speaker 1: --yes, so I was there for, for about a month working on my symphony first movement, and it was a wonderful experience.  I, I still have some pictures I took just out the window.  It looked like something from a travel log photo, so beautiful.  Lake Como and Lake "Lago" came together and we were right there at, at the tip of that on the hill from all over Bellagio you can see the villa sitting up there.  It was, it was a princess or something villa at one time historical which the Rockefeller Foundation took over, and they had various conferences that, that were there.  A study and conference center they called it.  But it was, it was a wonderful experience of being on my own doing, doing my own thing composing that, that symphony.  It was just, it was great, just beautiful.  So, again very, very fortunate.  So, that was during my sabbatical leave--
Story_ID: 210065
Speaker 1: When I came back to Kansas [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] they put me into an internship program for administration and it was a program that had been set up to benefit "minority" quote unquote candidates that they wanted to get more minorities into the administration and I, and so it was a valid program and I enjoyed.  I was assigned to the school of fine arts [School of the Arts, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] and School of Education [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], then to the endowment department, and I would assist the deans and the rectors in various things and attend meetings, meetings of all the deans, and, and the chancellor would be there, the vice chancellor and I would see how the inner workings and the discussion and everything.  And I finally concluded the end of that period that administration probably would not work for me.  I thought it would give me more time and I found out from talking to various people that not only would it not give me more time, it would probably mushrooms so that it would be a lot of meetings, a lot of paperwork, and then I said how does, how does this fit into my composing, you know, how can I get this done and I wanna do this opera, how am I gonna do this, and so I thought about it and I had been talking a long time for many years that I wanted to be a full-time composer.  Not only wanted to be, but I was going to be, saying one time I'm going to do this.  And so when the time actually came about it was, it was in 1979 I, I knew I wanted to write this opera, how am I gonna do this.  So, I made the decision that I would, I would leave the, the university and draw a double bar, step out on faith, and do it, become a freelance composer, you know.
Speaker 2: And for the non-musicians the double bar is the end of the piece.
Speaker 1: That means end, end of the piece, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The end, the end of that movement, the beginning of the next movement,--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you have a chapter, you know, the beginning of a new, a new chapter and it, it--and I also theorized that well this business of security is, is part mental too and so that, that I you know, it's, it's how I perceive the world, you know, and, and, and how, how am I gonna do this.  I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna step out and you know I had a feeling that this was my destiny anyway and so I did it, you know, and I, I wrote a letter of resignation and it took, it sat on my desk for a couple of days and I finally went into my chairman and sat down and told him my decision, and he said okay that's what you want and so I left there and came back to Cleveland [Ohio] as a full-time composer and that's what I've been ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 210066
Speaker 1: Well, that's the decade of the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was 1979, right.
Speaker 1: Okay '79 [1979] leaving Kansas [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes leaving Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay and starting this new movement--
Speaker 2: New movement yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: In Cleveland, yep I came, came back here and I started working on my, preparing to work on the, on the opera.  However, I did apply to an artist retreat in Saratoga Springs, New York, called Yaddo, Y-A-D-D-O, and it has a lot of poets, a lot of writers, a few, you know painters and sculptors and probably just one or two composers at any given time, and it's ongoing, and it is, it is a place that was, was the home of the Trask family who were poets and, and they, they left the legacy to have it as an artist retreat so to speak, you know.  There're not too many in the country.  The MacDowell Colony [Peterborough, New Hampshire] is one, Yaddo is, is the other one the ma- as major artist retreats and so I went there to start working on this opera and it was a great experience literally a cabin in the woods where you, where you, you have your, your bed, your refrigerator, you know, table, drawing board, you now, very simple and your panel and they, they bring your, your lunch in a lunch basket and set it at your doorstep so you, you can go to breakfast if you want to in the dining hall, but then, then the lunchtime they bring your lunch and you know it's simple, consists of sandwiches and fruit and vegetables and so forth, you know, and then dinner you go to the dining hall, you know.  And if you want to go back and continue working as I always did, you go back to the studio, so, so it was, it's a wonderful experience, wonderful opportunity to, to be there isolated.  It's definitely not the real world, but it, but for this purpose it, it works very, very efficiently.
Speaker 1: Now this opera that you've been referring to, which work is that?
Speaker 2: It's called 'Blake,' and, and it, it would, libretto is by Daniel Meyer, the late Daniel [E.] Mayers I'm sorry to say, who based it on an idea he got from a novel by Martin Delany an African American writer of the 19th century and it dealt with a fictional character and he took that idea and sort of adapted it to his own, you know, storyline and it turned into a four-act opera that worked for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 210067
Speaker 1: All right, and we had just started to talk about the opera 'Blake' and my question was related to the storyline.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay. It is a story of an African American who is a slave in the deep South just prior to the Civil War, John Henry Blake and his wife Miranda and there's a son little Joe and Blake is because of his intelligence and, and skills elevated to like head steward of this plantation and as the beginning of the story we find that he is talking to his comrades about a freedom plan, which is really emancipation kind of, of a project and he is be about ready to be sent off on a journey for, for the master of the plantation, Major Stevens, who is head of the plantation to, to bring back some horses from another state and while Blake is gone his wife Miranda is given away as a gift to a visiting couple from South Carolina and that dramatically is the, is the motivating focus for, for Blake.  He decides that he is going to start to instigate this plan at the same time that he is gonna search for Miranda.  But, before he goes on this, there's a confrontation between he and the Master Stevens which, which leaves Stevens strangled and expired and Blake a fugitive and--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were telling me about the storyline for 'Blake.'
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, and so, so Blake ends up being a fugitive from justice and he ends up in the dismal swamp and Miranda in the meantime has escaped and with the help of some Quakers ends up at that location trying to, to relocate with her husband and dramatically what happens is that some shots are heard and they, they find a woman.  They go to see who she is and it turns out to be Miranda, so there's a very poignant reunion between Blake and Miranda just as word comes that Fort Sumter [Charleston, South Carolina] has been fired upon.  The Civil War has begun and that the slaves are going off to march, you know, to, to join forces with [President Abraham] Lincoln and so there's a bitter sweet ending for, for Blake.  The death of Miranda, you have the hope for freedom symbolized by, by the beginning of this, this great Civil War and so that's the general, you know, story of it.  But, it really all about freedom really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: More about freedom than it is about bondage.
Speaker 2: Okay, and when was the opera completed?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 2: All right.  Are we gonna see a full production of that soon?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  I look forward to making some announcements in the near future.
Story_ID: 210068
Speaker 1: Now that decade of the 1980s, that's when I was introduced to the music of Dr. [HistoryMaker H.] Leslie Adams and largely because of my association with the folks in Accord [Associates Inc., Cleveland, Ohio],--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so, can you tell me or tell all of us about that organization, how it came into being, and the role it played in sharing your music with the community?
Speaker 2: Well, Accord was, was a way of, of identifying with the community really through, through my works actually and the focus was upon H. Leslie Adams' music and it, it took different forms and it, it, it helped other artists that we brought in, different performers, and put on presentations, some of which were my own music and others were not.  There were other musicians involved, so it was a combination of different artists coming in and different composers being represented and we did different presentations down at the music hall, downtown, in Liberty Hill Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio] auditorium and so forth.  So, it was, it was a very, very fine organization.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was that founded?
Speaker 2: That was about '91 [1991] I would, no wait I'm sorry.  That was in, in the '80s [1980s].  I would say around '80 [1980], '80 [1980], '82 [1982], '82 [1982] or '3 [1983].
Speaker 1: So before the completion of 'Blake?'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and as I recall for the performing arts series, most of the performers were African American, so was there a focus on African Americans in the arts?
Speaker 2: Yes there was, yeah, yeah, and the reason for that was because the, the foundations felt that this was a "void" in the community.  That there, that, that other organizations that existed before Accord were addressing different, you know, specifics and, and they were, they were very, very oriented toward filling voids.  If, if one could come up with a project or program or organization that would address an area that was not being attended to, they would have more information to support, so that was the reason for it, for that, you know, and, and certainly the lack of African American artists you know being brought in to perform and composers being represented that was a void in the Cleveland [Ohio] area at that time, so they decided they would, they would fund and support the Accord Associates.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you think that Accord was successful--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in achieving those goals?
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Sharing the music?
Speaker 2: Um-hm very much so, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how long was that organization active?
Speaker 2: I'd say maybe about ten years or so.
Story_ID: 210069
Speaker 1: Now who's handling the promotion of Dr. [HistoryMaker H.] Leslie Adams' music today?
Speaker 2: Well, I am president of an organization of creative arts and that is dedicated to promoting and disseminating different works with a focus on, on H. Leslie Adams and it simply is, you know, sort of a clearing house for getting the, the music out there as a nonprofit organization.  We have a person who is doing some, some copy work and, and publishing.  We have a retailer, distributor, and people can, can call in, write in, email the creative arts directly or they can go to Educator's Music [Lakewood, Ohio] and get an order form and order music scores and, and recordings from Educator's Music, which is on the west side or Lakewood Detroit Avenue and, so it's very useful in that way.
Story_ID: 210070
Speaker 1: I guess there are a number of things that we could ask, but at this point in time, I'd like to ask about state of the arts here at the beginning of the 21st century.  You've described a number of really diverse experiences, multicultural certainly from the earliest years of your life and working in various environments all across the length and breadth of the country and now you're back home in Cleveland [Ohio].  I'm just curious about your feelings about the arts in general whether or not the society is supporting them perhaps at the level that they should be supported, your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, I would say that a major shift occurred in, in this country I think it was about 1957, was that when Sputnik [1] went up, something like that.  Remember that year '57-ish [1957] around that time, late '50s [1950s] when Sputnik went up, up until that time the schools had been primarily liberal arts oriented with, with languages and you know music, fine arts, you know.  After Sputnik, the, the attention focused more on technological studies and the country went into a kind of a, a beat the Russians [sic. Soviets] mode, you know, because of the response of I guess the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], to this Sputnik.  That was, that was the satellite that went out from Russia [sic. Soviet Union] okay, and, and it was kind of everything was to, to advance the country in a, in a technological manner rather than, you know, artistically, manner and so that made it a big shift in, in the curriculum and a lot of courses that were offered phased out, choral music, general music, band, orchestra, dance, all those kinds of artistic things were kind of phased out.
Story_ID: 210071
Speaker 1: All right Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams, can you tell us please your thoughts on public support for the arts and what can or should be done about that?
Speaker 2: Okay, well you know I have not been in that mode particularly that, that much.  I used to send in applications to High Rights Council [ph.], National Foundation for the Arts [NEA], different foundations and I decided that I was going to be more independently oriented and I, I really kind of closed myself off a little bit in my own little world of, of, of creativity.  Some kind of way the universe has, has taken care of me.  How, don't ask me (laughter), but I, it, it's, it's, I think I'm, I think I'm living my destiny kind of, you know.  I'm, I'm doing well, I'm healthy, I'm happy, and I, I'm not that socially conscious in terms of a lot of detail.  For example, I, you know I'm not an avid newspaper/magazine reader, but things that are important I find out about, you know.  Now, now I do have the satellite system here and there is one station that I look at the FSTV, Free Speech Television [sic. Free Speech TV].  That's the only one that I look at.  On, only, only news that I get is from that, and I think it is superb.  I think that is what is the real truth and what's really happening on that's on that channel.  The others I think are, are influenced and even tainted by big bucks monies and, and so they become political and, and slanted so the Free Speech TV is what I look at.  I don't--I have not applied in many years to any of the other, you know, the foundations or councils or any of that, you know, I'm just, I've been independent in true sense of the word.  But, by closing myself off, it, it has the advantage of, of my getting into myself and going into my heart center more and metaphysically they call that the "God Space," the center, you know that, that, you know.  And I'm amazed at how things happen and how things are developing.  Here we are sitting here you're okay, you're, you know about me and I don't do a whole lot of promoting.  I don't have a manager at the moment or you know.  I do have a fan club who gets the word out and I do have a website, hleslieadams.com, H. Leslie Adams.net.  People can, can follow my work alone that way and, and that's a domain name or they can just type my name in the subject and it will, it will bring up these, these various things on the Internet.  But, in terms of the actual following along the various developments with governmental support I'm not that, you know, in, interested in, may, maybe because I realize that there's a, there, there are political overtones to it and it really depends upon who is on the boards at any particular time and their particular preferences and inclinations and I don't want to be under that kind of jurisdiction--
Story_ID: 210072
Speaker 1: I want to express myself from what I sincerely feel like expressing at any particular point and not having to please anyone, you know, not having to write a report or a proposal which includes a budget or any, any of that, you know, but simply to, to make decisions as I, as I feel them to be as it comes to me and so, so I really, I guess I'm maybe a maverick I don't know (laughter) in that sense that I want to seek truth as I see it to be, as I see it to be and to express that and, and it's a great deal of joy in that and I like beauty and I like beautiful melodies.  I like beautiful tones and, and harmonies that are soothing and pleasing to me and, and it's based upon everything that I have assimilated, all of the, all of the various kinds of music, it all comes together and, and it sort of like just, just,--and I used to worry about style what, style is it.  Then, finally I decided well I have a point of view and whatever I now say I have enough experience not only living, but composing that whatever comes out is going to be the style; that is it.  So, people will begin to say they recognize [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams and, and so I think that I'm delighted when that, when that occurs, you know, because I'm not thinking about it from a, from a historical perspective per se, but whatever comes to me, express what's inside, bring it out, and feel good about it and, and basically I guess I kind of use myself as a guide, as a judge, you know, I, I, pleasing myself, you know.  And, and it's not about them 'cause I don't know who they are and, and I can't think about that and compose and create at the same time, nor can I analyze and create at the same time, can't do both.  Creating is one thing.  Analysis is something completely different.  So, after it's finished, maybe I can talk about it--(unclear)--, but while it's happening I'm searching for what it is, trying to find, find it.  And, and constantly sometimes I'm amazed that what's coming out and sometimes I can hardly believe what's happening and I go with it, keep going at it, and finally I said ah that's what it is, that's what it supposed to be.  I might be halfway through it before I realize that (laughter), and then sometimes when I finish a piece I look at it and say oh now I can polish it by means of dynamics, you know, polishing, shifting the dynamics or, or phrasing something that's a fine, fine-tuning you know and then once I polish it then I can fully appreciate it.  It's more of like in the rough, you know, it's kind, sort of a stone in the rough and after you polish it up, then, then you really can see what it is and appreciate it.  So, it's, it's a very exciting experience for me, but it is very, very personal, you know, and it's, and it's just me and that's another thing that's just very exciting is that, that it's, that I'm not, it's not a group effort.  It's a singular effort and I would say I'm a, I'm a single act (laughter) and I'm, I'm at my best when I am by myself, not on a panel with others, not in a group setting tossing off ideas, you know, but expressing what I wanna say at any given point just as I said.  That's when I'm at my best.  I'm more comfortable that way, I'm happy that way, and that's the way I've always been all my life as an only child and as a single adult.

Speaker 1: For others who might aspire to be maverick composers too (laughter), be those independent voices in the music world, is there any sage advice that you would offer to them at this point in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I think they have to feel that they have a talent for it and, and, and then what, after that comes the training.  I think there is some training in, in, involved with what I'm doing.  Now, if, if I were you know into like hip hop or you know R&B or something then, then it, it probably could be more spontaneous, you know, 'cause there are, there are a lot of people out there that are doing very well, extremely well not being able to read music at all, and but having a wonderful ear and a gift for creating this and this is more performance.  Now, when it comes to composing, there are a lot of different techniques that are coming along with computers and keyboards and they can, can improvise and do things, you know, and put things together that way and create, compose that way without having to formally read notation.  I happen to come along in which formal note reading was part of my, my background.  Now, that doesn't mean it's gonna always have to be that way, you know, and, and, and art is very individual anyway.  You know who, you can't prove it.  You can't, you can't prove anything in art, so, so when I was talking about good music.  What's good music?  Well, it's good to me, but it may not be to someone else.  Now, everyone doesn't have to like [Johann Sebastian] Bach (laughter) and many don't, you know, but Bach is my hero, you know, and I'm very happy to have back as my hero.  That doesn't mean that applies to, to everybody and I could understand that.  It depends upon your, your, your background, what you're exposed to, whether you're going to look at things from, from somewhat, you know, intellectual or, or understanding the technical aspects of it or whether it's gonna be just impro- improvisatory expression as it comes, you know.  All these things are a part of art and so you know I'm open to all this, you know.  I don't, I don't think though that certain volumes not, not talking about the quality of the, of the music or the, or the beat, but when something gets too, too loud that the, that it can affect the hearing, that, that and it has nothing to do with music, it has to do with acoustics.  When something is constantly, you know, beating against that eardrum, I think the eardrum is rather sensitive, a sensitive apparatus and, and some, some people that go around with the boom boxes either plugged into or in the, in the cars I think are gonna suffer hearing loss if they have not already suffer some hearing loss and as they get older it's going to come out and, and it's not gonna be very pretty and a happy state of affairs.  So, that's one thing I would say, you know, that the sheer volume--I can think of some artists that I know, some pop artists that already have suffered hearing losses from constantly bombarded by overwhelming sound.  So, you know, that's something that needs to be looked at rather carefully I would say.  I don't know where the music is going and who knows it might go back to music of the '40s [1940s] I don't know, one day (laughter).

Speaker 1: And as we conclude, I just wanted to ask why it is that you feel so comfortable at this point in time, and I'm assuming that you are comfortable because of the archive that you've put together and because of all of the energy that you've invested into organizing these materials to make it possible for people to really understand what your life's work has been about.  How have you reached that level of comfort and why were you so gracious in allowing us to come into your home today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm always pleased to be able to share verbally as well as with my music, and most of the time it is with my music, so this is a rare occasion in which I actually talk about myself and my work.  But, I, I feel that philosophically that, that it's like a--(unclear)--that, that life is a blank tablet upon which we create our experience, our, ourselves.  We make the decisions.  Make the choices.  We call the shots and I, you know, philosophically I don't necessarily believe in divine intervention I don't think that it's possible.  I think that there is, that, that doesn't make any sense.  That we are the ones who address our, our own problems and our own situations and set up the, the roadmaps for, for, for our destinies and for our experiences.  You know I don't happen to believe in victimization.  I don't think there's such a thing as a victim.  I think there're only volunteers.  I think that we, you can, when we scratch the surface of a victim we, we find cause.  We find the contribution that that individual made to his own or, or her own demise or, or success, you know.  I believe in reincarnation.  I believe that we go into different stages and we keep coming back until we get it right, then we move on.  I believe in, in total freedom of, of expression and I don't believe in misinterpretation of scripture, which I think is unbiblical scripture, plus all the other ancient books in it, the text that are so much a part of our lives, you know, and so much emphasis is placed upon these text that we consider to be divine and they're not.  They're works of human beings and the keyword, the tag line that is used is whatever revealed.  Well, I don't know how they would reveal, but, but someone made a decision they might want to put this into, into this volume and not only that there are committees that debated what they were going to leave out like, like reincarnation and astrology.  I think it was Constantine's council, heated debates, you know.  There were translations, retranslations, scribal errors, and alterations of text and you get all this put together and then you present it as though it is from on high and it's not.  It's just, it's, it is I think fallacy, and we, and people, people believe it.  They believe this.  We take, take this and we treat it literally.  At this particular moment in history, we have so-called fundamentalists who believe every word in this particular document is the word, the work from God, whatever that means, and it's, I think it's a fallacy and I think it just has held back society and it's continuing to hold back society.
Story_ID: 210075
Speaker 1: I think we're in a spiritual dark ages right now, and it's, and maybe two hundred years from now this, someone's looking at this tape they'll know what I'm talking about.  Right now, this probably sounds very, you know, audacious, you know, but they'll understand that right now we are in the midst of a time in which people are, are talking about a constitutional amendment for gay, against gay marriage.  It is, you know, just a joke and I prob--I don't think it's going to happen, but I think that the abolishment of the attitude, the anti-homosexual and bisexual attitude, the abolishment of that is the healthiest thing that has happened since the beginning of civilization.  I think it is a magnificent movement, and I think that it is going to escalate that gays are not going to take it anymore, that they're not going to, they're going to continue to press forward.  In terms of abortion, I think that women's rights are going to, to be the issue.  It's not about someone telling, trying to control them anymore, that the woman has a right to be in charge of her own body and whatever happens to her up until the time of the first inhalation of the, of, of the baby, you know, that, that at that point the, the responsibility of the, the citizen shifts then to the infant, but until that first inhalation occurs it's women's responsibility and, and right to make that decision.  These are, these are contemporary issues that are, are a silly and frivolous and have no basis whatsoever and I'm very proud to go on record by saying that.  I'm very proud to, to support all forms of, of homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender, and as a matter of fact I made a presentation at the gay community center, gay/lesbian community center a few months ago and I did that to make a statement.  Who we are is not what we think we are, what we say we are, what we believe, but what we do and so by not doing that I, I made a statement to myself and life is about me that I believe this and I, and I made that statement.  Okay, that's in my record and I'm proud of it.  I also have a collection at the Western Reserve Historical Society [Cleveland, Ohio] in the lesbian/gay archives.  I'm very proud to have that there and so you know whatever else one wants to think is their business, not mine, I don't care what they think.  That's my affirmation and I'm proud, proud to have that, and maybe a one hundred years from now or two hundred years when people are look at that, they say hey he was, he was with us, you know.  I'll make a prediction this is 19- 2004, I predict that within seventy-five years gay marriage will be commonplace in America and within seven generations worldwide.  And that is the most encouraging thing I can think of.  And when that occurs, there's gonna be a whole shift in how people relate to one another.  All this cold competition, this domination, this need to control, this, the business of not caring, of relating to one another, you know, and, and right up to combat.  I think that, that one reason for, for the, the combat throughout history has been essentially repressed emotions and those emotions are sexual basically, frustrated men and women.  Women have allowed themselves to be controlled by, by men and, and the men have, have been repressed in their emotions, in their sexual emotions, motional drive, and that comes out.  An, emo- an emotion cannot be repressed, it's got to come out and it's going to come out and it does come and it comes out in ways of combat, cold competition, dysfunctional relationships, drugs, substance, all, all of it, alcohol, and it, it stems from the repression of people saying this is symbol, this is wrong, don't do this, don't do that.  All that nonsense has got to stop, it just gotta stop.  And when it stops, it's gonna be a whole shift in attitudes toward one another, you know, and it's a very exciting period, you know, I'm thrilled to see it happening, you know, thrilled.
Story_ID: 210076
Speaker 1: And that's the way I see life.  I, and I feel that we are divine and that we are a part of this God has sort of been coming back home, you know, it's like shooting off and coming back, you know, to the source, you know, and as we approach the source, you know, and the closer we can get to that source the happier we are.  It takes as much energy to be unhappy as happy, so why not hey, why not be happy (laughter) and, and you know, and forget about what another person's thinking about us.  It doesn't make any difference.  You know it's their business, that's has nothing to do with us, you know.  Going, going ahead and pursuing our dreams and our goals and, and, and I choose to pursue happiness and joy, you know, and, and love.  In my music I try to express that in my music.  I try to express beauty and peace and harmony, love, all those things that I feel are, that are desirable.

Speaker 1: Well, Dr. [HistoryMaker H. Leslie] Adams I wanna thank you again for your, your willingness to go on record with The HistoryMakers in sharing your philosophy of life and the details of your life story so far.  But, I would be remiss if we left here today, since I'm in the living room of a composer and there's a piano to my right (laughter) if I didn't ask you if you, if you might be willing to perform one of your compositions?
Speaker 2: Wow (laughter).
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be long, or maybe an excerpt from, from something--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --if not a short composition.  Would you do that?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think we might have to shift the camera, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --let's take our mics off and we'll do that.
Speaker 2: (H. Leslie Adams performs one of his compositions)

Speaker 1: This is an original photographer's photograph of my grandfather Isaac [ph.] L. Adams.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this very handsome man is Harrison L. Adams, Sr., my father (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: This is another picture of Harrison L. Adams, Sr., in his Second Lt. First World War [World War I, WWI] uniform.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay this, this is Harrison Leslie Adams, Jr., [HistoryMaker H. Leslie Adams] myself at the age of three months taken here in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay this is a very young picture of myself photographed by Allen E. Cole in his studio, just probably eight or nine months old.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This is myself probably in elementary school fourth or fifth grade photographed by Allen E. Cole in his studio, nice, nice photographic portrait.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay this is a portrait of my class at Miles Standish Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio] and those are all my dear classmates and I am right here second one from, second row, the top at the end.  That is me, and some of these are still part of the alumni class of Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  They went all the way through Glenville with me and are still very much part of my life.
Speaker 2: Ready.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is my junior high school class, Empire Junior High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  My dear classmates and I am located the last one to the right top row up here in a dark sun tan and slightly heavy too.  I had, I was eating well in those days.  They say that Capricorns get younger when they get older; I believe that.  Some, some of my younger pictures look like an old man.  I'm younger now than I was then (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is a picture from my probably high school days, and it's probably on my street taken outdoors and just below me is my mom [Jessie Manease Adams] who is in her crossing guard equipment.  She started when she was I would say it was '40s [1940s], right about forty, '43 [1943], 1943, and she continued through the '80s [1980s], so she was one of the longest crossing guards in the history of Cleveland.
Speaker 2: All right, ready.
Speaker 1: Yes, this photograph is of myself.  It's a formal studio portrait and I'd say I was done in the '80s [1980s] here in Cleveland, Ohio.  It's one photograph that I've used many times and still use when they ask for black and white photo and I probably should get another one made soon, but anyway that's, that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a photograph that has been used for publicity to promote the two CDs, the 'Love Rejoices: Songs of H. Leslie Adams,' and then the '12 Etudes.'  'The Love Rejoices' came out in 2001 and the '12 Etudes' came out in 2004, both on Albany Record[s] label and so we use this, this photograph as a, like of a poster in record stores and it attracts attention to, of people to the composer of these songs and piano pieces.

Speaker 1: This photograph features the various soloists who performed in a concert of my art songs.  The program was entitled Songs of H. Leslie Adams.  Maria Corley is the accompanist for that and here I am next to her and the various student performers.  This was at Millersville University [of Pennsylvania] in Lancaster, [sic. Millersville] Pennsylvania April 9, 2002.
Speaker 2: And then we go down to the bottom and these are faculty people along with Maria Corley, the pianist and myself, Maria Corley, myself, and this is Jean Berlin, a voice professor, who was professor of these students, voice professor, and Buddy James, who is the head of the music department at Millersville University.

They're all composition students, and I addressed seminar that afternoon and here I am along with them.  This was taken April 1, 2002.
Speaker 1: Then we move down to below that and we see a photograph of, also from Tufts University.  James John, who is the choral director there, he conducted my choral work.  I'm sitting next to him and then next to him is John McDonald who is the chair of the music department there, and the program was entitled, Program of Vocal Works of H. Leslie Adams at Tufts and these are some of the singers who participated in that and that was taken April the 2nd, 2002 and the work that was performed that John, James John conducted was 'Hymn to All Nations,' a choral piece for a mixed choir piano.
Speaker 2: In Detroit, Michigan, this was the same season that the previous residencies took place, and this was at the Central Region Conference of the NANM, National Association of Negro Musicians at the Renaissance Hotel in Detroit.  We have Brazeal Dennard the conductor of his own chorale called the Brazeal Dennard Chorale.  Shirley Verrett a former Metropolitan Opera [(Met) New York, New York] mezzo-soprano who sang leading roles at the Met for many years and I'm very proud to be standing with them in this photograph taken April the 5th, 2002.
Speaker 1: Above this is another photograph from the Tufts University with James John who conducted the University Singers in my 'Hymn to All Nations' April 2nd, 2002.  It was a good performance.  That's the reason everyone is smiling.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
