S. Gluck: I was curious about what kind of ties you had with the  college faculty at Huntingdon, the problems, if any, that you had as a  single woman in that sort of situation, as a beginning member of the  faculty, and, professional kinds of commitments during that period.  Maybe we can start with that; with specific things in 1929-1934 that  we have yet to cover.  Stone: When I went to Huntingdon it was after a final summer quarter  at University of Chicago. And one link between Chicago and Alabama was  the visit to Montevallo of my former schoolmate, Mrs. Myra Callis of  Tuskegee. Her husband, Dr. Callis, was with the Veteran's Administration  in Tuskegee and she wanted to observe our child welfare pnogram, probably  with a view to setting up a parallel course at Tuskegee Institute. She  was a very able woman. My colleague) Dr. John Steelma~ helped introduce  her as a descendant of a noted free Negro family and she spoke at several  classes. But the college decided that she couldn't eat in the diningroom  where I usually had lunch with students, but would have to be served  in my office. And that's where she had her lunch, to my great embarrassment.  She handled it with considerable aplomb.  SG: Well, did you have lunch with her then, in the office?  Stone: Yes, in the office.  2  SG: Some students also, or just the two of you?  Stone: No, just the two of us, because we didn't know how students  would receive this.  SG: So Mrs. Callis just stayed for a few days then?  Stone: She just stayed one day and went back that night, so we didn't  have to provide sleeping quarters for her.  SG: Was that deliberate; or, I mean, had she planned on staying?  Stone: No, she hadn't planned on staying. She had planned just that  much of a trip that would get her back by train to Tuskegee ~ But it was  a startling thing to me, though I should have understood, that the reaction  in the . . . I think perhaps the students might have accepted more  readily than the authorities, such as the head of the dining-room. Our  president was a very liberal man, Dr. 0. C. Carmichael, who was an Oxford  graduate and very broad-minded. But I suppose I didn ' t appeal to him  about that.  SG: But it was mainly that you didn't expect the same sort of  attitude? Was that it?  Stone: That was it. But I could understand the resistance and  complied, hoping that Mrs. Callis, whom I got to know a good deal better  when I went to Washington during the fortiesjunderstood.  So, through the social work organizations, college groups, and  YWCA meetings, I got somewhat involved in liberal and radical programs,  especially race relations.  You asked about faculty colleagues. There were several younger women  who shared my enthusiasm for either fine arts or current events. We  enjoyed forums, concerts, and plays together. -.  * I met her train in Calera and because she was a woman I could have her ride  beside me on the front seat of my car, This was according to the racial etiquette  of that period of history.  3  Katherine Hardeman, a very liberal person in the physical education  department and I became interested in international approaches. She  explored Gandhi-ism, going out to India as a physical ed teacher under  the auspices of the Presbyterian church, while I became interested in a  shorter trip to the countries I had not visited in 1923 and '24, which  included the Scandinavian countries and Russia, a very forbidding place in  the 1920's. I also wanted to return to Vienna. When I had been in  Vienna before, Sigmund Freud was a controversial figure but I had studied  Freudian psychology at U. of Chicago meanwhile. And so it was with what  was called the International Student Hospitality Association that I spent  a few weeks in 1931.  By the way, it was not in 1931, but after I'd gone around the world,  that I got interested in the sharecroppers. I mistakenly thought it was  earlier.  SG: I had the sense from the last interview that the taking the  students to the visit of the sharecroppers' meeting on that Sunday was  after the Russian trip.  Stone: It turns out to have been after 1933. It was my last year,  Rheba (McCain Tuggle) said on long distanc~ She became my assistant;  just after her graduation in 1933 and following our Michigan experience  in the "School on Wheels". Three of my former students went - Agnes  Whetstone and Minneola Perry in addition to Rheba. Rheba and Agnes met  me for part of the summer program in Michigan. But didn't accompany me  to Washington where I worked with Farm Research, Inc. in preparation for  the School on Wheels.  SG: You had mentioned that you thought there were two groups of  students who were there at different times.  4  Stone: Well, Minneola Perry came later and stayed on in the winter.  And then I rejoined her and Jerry Ingersoll whome she married, during the  Thanksgiving holidays at a meeting of the farmers groups in Chicago. This  was a large national meeting of tenants and sharecroppers and small  owners with a token southern delegation. I recall that Minneola Perry  Ingersoll was there, because she spent her first few years after graduation  in labor organizing.  Now I have never really been interested in industrial unions. In  Chapel Hill we did try to help the Burlington textile workers that were  on strike. But my heart has been in [laughter] agriculture and with rural  groups. Although I liked having Lucy Randolph Mason talk about her  exciting work with labor unions when she came to William and Mary to  make that talk.  SG: Well, what was that convention like then? That was to sort of  update what was happening with the farm workers?  Stone : Yes. The Middle West farm unions were the most active and  articulate but there were sharecroppers ' union representatives there, and  that was my area of interest. On the closing day industrial unions joined  in the rally.  SG: So it wasn't basically a rural organizing conference?  Stone : Yes, but with industrial labor support.  SG : Well, do you remember anything about that conference?  Stone: No. Only that delegates were given places in people ' s homes,  so they didn't have to go to hotels; and that I stayed in a worker's  home for the few days that I was there. I didn ' t stay through the whole  conference; I went mainly to talk with Minneola and Jerry, and to see  what the sharecroppers' union representation would be like.  5  SG: Do you recall what the black and white representation was?  Stone: I know that they had both races throughout the conference.  But that was the way labor was organized, except in the South. It came  to be organized with black and white in the mines, you know, very early in  Alabama, because they found that the way that their wages were kept down  was that there were four layers (I've told you that): the white men, the  black men, the white women, the black women. Four levels, and if white  men didn't accept the Negroes' wages, then the Negroes would get the jobs,  so they decided they'd better stay together and have one set of wages. It  might make them feel better temporarily to have a higher wage than the  black man, but it didn't make them feel better economically [laughter]  in the long run to be pushed down.  SG: This conference, then, would have had representatives from the  Alabama Sharecroppers' Union and the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union? From  all the various farmers' groups, in other words?  Stone: Yes. Reading: "Farmers' National Committee for Action"  Nov. 1933 : 702 delegates from 36 states with a major goal to break down  antagonism between farm owners and farm wageworkers. In large convention  hall at the close thousands of industrial workers attended and cheered."  There were stirring talks about organizing and working together. And it  was still the Depression period; the Depression wasn't solved, as you know,  [laughter ] until the war came.  SG: But the people who had been involved in the School on Wheels  didn't hold any more workshops or anything?  Stone: No, no, no. It was only Minneola who stayed on. She never  did come back South. In time she and Jerry lived in Brooklyn and held  prominent positions, he as a publisher and she on the Board of Regents of  6  New York City's University System.  SG: So that was probably in the winter of 1933 then? 1934?  Stone : Yes. It would have been the winter of 1933-34.  SG: And then it was after the School on Wheels that you became  involved in Highlander , rather than before?  Stone: Yes. Highlander was organized in 1 32, and I have correspondence  with Myles Horton referring to our having met in Chattanooga in 1932.  However it was in 1934 that I became involved, maybe through Kester of the  Fellowship of Reconciliation.  SG: And he somehow got you involved in Highlander?  Stone : Well his voice was added to that of Myles. I had letters from  both Myles and Jim Dombrowski who was first with Highlander and then with  the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and its offshoot, "Southern  Conference Education Fund." Later he came out here to make a talk--he  had been crippled by the assaults of southern "union busters" in Louisiana.  He remembered me and I remembered him, you know [laughter].  SG: What became your connection, then, to Highlander? Had you  visited there?  Stone: Oh no, I was never in Highlander until I went in 1972. I  arranged money-raising visits by Myles in Los Angeles, in Portland, Oregon  [laughter ] and various places. I felt akin to Myles Horton's point of view.  As far as I know he didn't become either a Socialist or a Communist. He  had been, you know, at Union Theological (as Howard Kester had), and then  he moved from radical religion into this program of helping people organize  on their own what they needed. That's been the method of Horton all the  time.  7  SG: So your focus was primarily in terms of organizing programs for  them when they spoke in the community in which you lived, in other words?  Stone: That's true, I was one of many who assisted. And I've  endorsed Highlander; the last few years I've sent quarterly contributions  rather than annual ones, because after visiting there &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; I felt that  they were doing what Commonwealth tried to do but failed in the community.  They had chosen this Tennessee place (a large residence near the Horton  home). It seemed to me that Myles knew Tennessee, he knew the people and  he did work in the community. It puzzled me that in some way he had not  won the support of neighbors, so that when the KKK and those other  reactionaries set upon the School he might have been able to get the  protection of the local people. I have heard that Commonwealth failed  utterly in winning community support, because they seemed to be a little  condescending toward the locality. That's what I've read; I don't know  that to be true. And I thought that Horton would never do that, that he was  never condescending. He was always folksy and at home with many people,  and with the community. And so I couldn't until I read Erskine Caldwell's  Deep South: Memory and Observation quite understand how that had happened.  But I stayed [laughter] faithful to Highlander through the Knoxville  period when they got attacked again. It may very well be that when you've  got people like the KKK [laughter] and what we used to call the "rednecks"  that you can expect anti-black behavior. But apparently it was not just  poor whites who were violent. Since reading Katharine Lumpkin's story  of the Grimke sisterst I've found that back in the eighteen hundreds the  wealthy planters including illustrious families such as the Grimkes were  sometimes very cruelo Angelina Grimke couldn't stand the cruel beatings.  * Lumpkin, Katharine D. The Emancipation of AngeA\r Grimke, Chapel Hill,  U. of N.C. Press, 1974  I  8  She heard there was a speci al punishment house. In the book you let me  have I read for the first time, anything as gross as having a pregnant  woman lie in a hole dug to protect her child while they flogged her. And  that one person was severely punished because she lost her child from work  in the fields; it was her fault assumedly that she lost it. They wanted that  child as a slave, you see. Just a horrible thing. And in Gee's Bend some  time later when I was making my study one of the women told me that the  ll  overseer of an absentee landlord tried to persuade a Negro woman to be his  sexual mate. When she refused, he hitched up horses and tied one foot to  one horse and one foot to the other and split her wide open. Horrible thing;  I don't know how he could account for this to the absentee owner.  SG: What year was this in?  Stone : It was way back; it may have been in slavery times. It was  just the recall that I was given . I took a hundred interviews from people  ~ who lived in Gees Bend in 1942 after it had become a Farm Security project.  And the older members were recalling what had happened to them or their  ancestors; so I think that may have been in slave days.  SG : Now this was the work that you did in the &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ? This wasn't  the compilation thing?  Stone: No, the compilation was under TVA in 1933-34; this was my  later research.  SG: That was the one in the forties?  Stone: In 1942, yes, when I started that. But I learned a good deal  from that research of what happened in olden days. I found among Gee's  Bend people a tremendous sense of dignity and pride and freedom. They  had been field hands, and had not been taught the obsequious behavior of  house servants. Every now and then somebody would get frightened when the  9  children played with me so freely, and didn't seem to think they had to  kowtow because I was white.  SG: Olive, were you on the board of Highlander at all?  Stone: No, I was never on the board.  SG: Tell me about the group that acted as sort of the hospitality  group for the radical movement.  Stone: It was a hospitality group for a lot of people. We had one  person who came to Montgomery. Myra Page was her pseudonym and she was  both a novelist and a sociologist. (She and her husband had doctorates  from U. of Minn., I believe.) She went out to Commonwealth College; so  she stopped by to see if she could raise some money. And I gathered some  people together to hear her. So it was a hospitality group for people who  were going into the rural areas for sharecroppers' union work or for  peace or civil rights work in the South. People kept writing one or  another of us, "We'd like so much to be able to get, for instance, a  League for Industrial Democracy Lecture Series introduced in the South or  a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union." And they just never could  get a southern following.  SG: Well, Olive, how did this work? Did you invite people, or they  would be passing through and contact you?  Stone: They would usually write but sometimes just dropped by.  SG: And you were this contact usually? How did you happen to become  t he contact?  Stone: Largely through people I had met in my travels or my charities,  that is, causes to which I sent contributions.  SG: So word would just spread, then, to these other groups when someone  was going to come into the Montgomery area.  ..-  It  Ii lo  Stone: They would write and I would try to get groups together.  SG: You would, then, organize public meetings? Or would these be  rather small, informal?  Stone: Both small and large, the latter would usually be at the .  college with one or another organization to sponsor. For instance, I've  mentioned Jeanette Rankin whom I introduced to a YWCA sponsored meeting  in the Y Hut. (She later occupied the "Chair of Peace" at Brenau College  and a White Citizens Council investigated it as possibly Communistic.)  SG: Now would these programs be sponsored by the college, or sponsored  by the study group instead?  Stone: No, the study group did no sponsoring. It arranged in  private homes to see visitors or each other. Public meetings would be  sponsored by the Y.W.C.A. or some organization of the college maybe or  by community groups having literary or civic interests or programs.  [Machine interuptions]  SG: Would you put the people up, or your hospitality was primarily  in terms of providing a meeting place and a sponsor for the meeting?  Stone: I don't recall putting anyone up. I do remember getting calls  from all directions. For example, I had a letter from some actors who  had been on my Mediterranean trip in 1924; they had a stock company  (repertory) that played in New England, and they decided to invade the  South. They wrote me to know if I could help them put on a play at  Huntingdon College,which I did. I invited them to come and I took them out  to dinner [laughter] and had them in my apartment for after-dinner coffee  or something like that. The show was not a great success. I worked very  hard to get people to come out [laughter].  11  SG: [Machine interruption] Were you able to enlist support of college  groups, for instance, when someone came through for the sharecroppers?  Or, were those meetings done in a different way?  Stone: They were done more quietly, as I told you at great length.  The SCU was knownto be antagonizing or alarming. In fact, the papers had  been full of the fact that the Communists had come into the South organizing  sharecroppers' union--which was true. And there was a delightful young  man--who Bea tells me had more than one pseudonym. I remembered him as  Sid Benson, she as Ted Wellman. He once gave a Marxian interpretation of  a Haydn symphony. But he was an industrial rather than a farm organizer.  SG: Yes. He's the one that you said accompanied you with a group  of students to that meeting (of the Alabama Sharecroppers Union).  Stone: No. Sid/Ted came earlier. He must have gotten housing and  funding elsewhere. I saw him only 2 or 3 times. Rheba and other students  were not involved until after the 11School on Wheels". They had graduated  before the Michigan trip. Rheba, Agnes and I drove to Tallassee, Alabama  where Myrtice (who had also graduated the year before) gave us lunch and  went with us to a Sharecroppers Union meeting. A black organizer called  Jackson met us at the church to introduce us to members. It was a Sunday,  and we wanted to see what the sharecroppers were like and hear them talk.  And that's the only time that I was in there.  SG: So, Olive, when someone came through then for the sharecroppers  what sort of meeting would you set up for them?  ever  Stone: No group meeting was/ held with the farm organizer unless he  came once with Sid/Ted. And it would have been out of the question to have  a public meeting when the sheriff was trying to destroy the Union. We talked  ,,  12  about giving financial aid. And you remember that Rheba and I took money  to the Post Office. I assumed the cautiousness was because of the interracial  exchange. I have learned from Dale Rosen's thesis that he had to  dodge arrest and eventually had to flee to Birmingham after which a white  organizer took over his work and name. In time the white organizer had to  flee the goons.  You asked about other groups. The Rabbi had several groups that he  called "study groups". A nucleus of one of these expanded to include  other denominations and to meet an occasional visitor. I never met other  groups. I'm omitting a social club to which I belonged.  SG: So most of your social life was centered, then, on the college  community?  Stone: College community and a variety of community activities.  SG: During this period in Montgomery you had mentioned several times  the Powells, who had become your friends and helped to introduce you to  more radicial causes as well. Now what was their &#8226;  Stone: Their connection. They have been my closest personal friends  for 44 years . Through Jerry Ingersoll I met the staff at Farm Research,  Inc., which Web established prior to the New Deal. He kept it going for  some little time until WW II came when he got into War Production Board,  and later became (because he had legal as well as economic and sociological  training) a Labor Relations Board adjudicator before he went out to Australia  as a labor attach~ in the Dept. of State. Then after a short term in  the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he went back to university teaching.  What do you mean by "radical causes"? Both Alice and Web lived  abroad and studied abroad so they had European friends associated with social,  economic and literary movements. They were true cosmopolitans .  13  SG: But the Powells were in Washington; never in New York?  Stone: Alice stayed with the Little Red School House (nursery school)  in New York while Web found a Georgetown house and established Farm  Research. Earlier Web had been research director in the Pennsylvania  Department of Public Welfare, and had collaborated on a study with Ewan  Clague, who later became head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and  President of the National Conference of Social Work in 1951.  SG: It was part of the Department of Labor.  Stone: Yes, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was. At any rate, Web's  "Farm Research, Inc." published material on the farm crisis in the Depression.  So I met  SG: But these weren't still in Montgomery then, in other words?  These people?  Stone: No. Web Powell was never in Montgomery. As I have already  said, outside of Web's bureau I had found a single pamphlet on people  instead of land and animals. It was by a Duke U. professor. No one else  in the Dept. of Agriculture (under Pres. Hoover) ever researched the effect  of the Depression on human beings. After I met the Powells I stayed in  preparation for the School on Wheels in their Georgetwon home. They had  threea  I story home on Q Street, I remember it well. And several of us who  had been teaching at Columbia or other places had come together to discuss  the possibility of taking a school on wheels out to the middle West, where  the farm organizations were ripe for a constructive program. I don't  know why Webster Powell, who grew up on ifth Avenue [laughter ]  in New York, and whose parents had a vacation home at Southern Pines, North  Carolina chose farm research but he did.  SG: So your initial association ...  14  Stone: My initial association there was because of my research interests.  The TVA documentary study in 1934 led me to treasure, to hold in my mind,  the possibility of going on to either Write a book or to pursue Doctoral  study. Dean Abbott had offered me a scholarship, as you know, for Doctoral  study at the University of Chicago, but she agreed with me that it was a  good opportunity to take first the Montevallo then the Huntingdon position  beforehand. And I never got back to Chicago.  SG . So this is just the beginning of the relationship. The Powells  were not actually in Montgomery.  Stone: No, never.  SG: I see.  Stone: No .  SG: So it was a long-term relationship over the years?  Stone: Long-term. I met them first in 1932. Alice gave me the  sequence of Web 's activities and her own when we went last summer to Alaska  and I had her verify the date . ~ when they got the Q Street house. She's  always been in early childhood development, as a profession. They  established their own . schools until Alice got her Doctorate and had  a university laboratory for her use. She has, from the beginning, kept  her maiden name, Alice Coe Mendham. Web with the greatest ease and confidence  would introduce "my wife, Miss Mendham". Only very recently, when  she taught at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, did she  decide to be Mrs . Powell: Dr. Alice Coe Mendham Powell. It just made it  easier for such things as her work with Planned Parenthood etc.  SG: Well, Olive, what were your social ties within Montgomery and  the South during that period at Huntingdon?  Stone: To begin with in the college and through it and through fellow  15  alumnae in the community. I was introduced socially to some members of  the country club set and elsewhere but I had very little interest inthat.  I did play bridge and learned from my Montgomery experience not to let  them know at William and Mary that I played bridge, because in Montgomery  it was still a small enough city that it was difficult to accept one  bridge luncheon and not another. I liked social affairs and enjoyed them  to some extent; but too much partying is burdensome to a studious person.  I like to read. Don't you?  SG: So most of your ties were to old classmates then, in other words?  Stone: Heavens, no! I met legal, medical and other professionals.  I hope it doesn't sound invidious to say Montgomerians were delightful but  less cosmopolitan than people in the Upper South.  SG: Well how about the people in the study group , where did they  come from?  Stone: Professional people like myself with open minds looking for  fresh approaches to social problems - teachers, social workers, a Rabbi,  a journalist, a wholesale merchant, etc. - and finding few answers in such  traditional institutions as the schools, churches and courts. I've already  characterized them as liberals. And some of that little Montgomery group  (four of them) came up to Chapel Hill the latter half of the 1935 Summer  Quarter. We rented a cottage and lived together. They went to school-took  sociology and so forth. And at the conclusion we visited a labor  college in the mountains, sponsored by Frank Graham of U. of NC, as I  recall and others.  SG: Were there any faculty members besides yourself in this group?  Stone: No. I would invite faculty members from time to time.  SG: Did you detect no interest?  r,  ! 16  Stone: No special interest in social issues. Katherine Hardeman was  interested, but she went out to India where I joined her in 1932 for  3 months. She went out as a physical ed teacher and came back in 1934  to take nurse's training, and then returned to India. She was later in  the Massachusetts General Hospital until her retirement. And I see her  still.  SG: Was she the only faculty member whom you were very close to?  Stone: Close to on social issues.. No, Rhoda Ellison and others  with whom I've kept up all these years are highly congenial on literature  and art but they were not interested in social reform. They were interested  in Huntingdon and they were interested in artistic and intellectual  programs. They went to the Forum and to professional theatre productions.  SG: Now did you have to keep your activity, for instance, in this  study group somewhat quiet too? Did that present problems?  Stone: It was not secret at all. But the meetings we had with  visitors who were not there to hold public meetings, that part was kept  quiet, because we didn't want to endanger them. Most organizers of  unions only stayed briefly in order to rest a bit [laughter] and be  provided some money and clean clothes, to go back on the road.  SG: Well, how much money would a small group like that be able to  get together for someone like him coming through trying to raise money?  Stone: We just gave individually, and I have no idea what the others  gave. Some of them were quite well-to-do, and they probably gave generously .  I didn't [laughter ] because I didn't have much.  SG: I mean, so someone conceivably could have raised, maybe, a  thousand dollars?  Stone : I doubt that it would be that much. Well, a few of our group  were well- to-do; most of us were social workers or teachers or writers.  17  And poor Huntingdon had such an awful time during my employment there  raising money to pay off its mortgages that our salaries were out. (I  only read that in Ellison's history, I didn't remember it.)  SG: Well, Olive, did you have any problems as a single professional  woman?  Stone: I'm trying to recall that I might have, because recently one  of my young colleagues at UCLA, a person I admire and respect very much,  wrote a paper which she asked me to criticize; in which she was showing  that in soc~al work, most of the prestigeous offices and the highersalaried  jobs went to men. I said, "Jean (Giovannoni)~ this CAN ' T be true, because  look at all those wonderful women, the Abbotts and the Breckinridges, the  Jane Addamses and the Florence Kellys who started social work in this  country, and who studied in England with the Webbs and so on. They were  women; - there were a few men." I did go back through my old proceedings of  the National Conference of Charities and Correction, which later became  the National Conference of Social Work and of late the National Conference  of Social Welfare, and I said, "I do remember that when Jane Addams was  offered the presidency of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections  in 1909 many of the men came forward and said, 'Of course we'll be .glad to  read your presidential address.'" (And this had been necessary, incidentally,  when Dorothea Dix wanted to appear before Congress; some man had to present  her research on the mental hospitals. You will recall that that was way  back in the eighteen forties or 50's, wasn't it?) So when the men crowded  round and offered to read Jane Addams' presidential address she said,  "I think inasmuch as it has taken you this long to invite me, it cannot  be said that you acted in haste. I will deliver my own presidential address."  The men were a little shocked. I was aware of that point with Jean so  I challenged her, and I had to read her paper to see that she was completely  right.  18  SG: So professionally you didn't actually feel it? Not personally?  Stone: Professionally single women were in the majority but I had  other social contacts. Hence, I don't think I felt it personally.  Despite Jeanne 's findings I didn't sense as much rivalry in my  professional career as I might have if I had not had so many leadership  roles--e.g. asked to make talks or to hold offices. I was chairman of  many work groups, committees, and associations--was offered the presidency  of the large Washington, D.C. chapter of the National Association of Social  Workers; declined it because of the health of my third and last fiance,  the one who died just before I came out here.  But I was very often acting the "woman's role" when I didn't need  to--pushing some man forward and letting the man have the job or get the  credit for things, such as I did at Chapel Hill &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; unwittingly, as you  have pointed out. I mean, I wasn't conscious of that. But part of that,  when we get to Chapel Hill, was that I did not want to offend the U of  NC group by being "forward" or anything of that kind.  SG: In Montgomery as the Dean, did you have any problem socially as  being a single woman? Or were so many of the faculty single also?  Stone: Ah ha . No, I never felt self-conscious as a single person-- I  either had an escort (sometimes a confirmed bachelor!) or went in a small  group to evening affairs. I have become aware of my single status when  I have been asked, as happens occasionally, to break into a couples group  and I did not want to be a fifth wheel. But with the university pe9ple  here and at William and Mary and at Chapel Hill and elsewhere I was  frequently invited as a person to go to these mixed male and female affairs  and always--almost always--felt at ease. For instance, at Chapel Hill  (I don't want to get too far ahead of my story) Guy Johnson, who was a  19  great authority on Negro problems and history (taught anthropology as well  as sociology) belonged to a writers' group to which Paul Green, Phillips  Russell and a mixture of writers belonged. Guy was going to present  a paper on the Negro and he told the group he'd like to invite me as a  critic. The meeting was held at the Vances' home. Now Mrs. Vance had her  Masters in sociology and she should have sat in as a participant, as a  sociologist, but for some reason when I got there I was sitting by Mrs.  Vance and she started talking to me about the children's measles and about  housekeeping problems, and things that just sent me to the roof. And I  moved my position. Well, pretty soon Guy asked for my comments after he  had read the paper and Rheba got busy with social affairs--she had to  serve the refreshments--so that let me o:ff. But I have been made aware  from time to time that because so many women have chosen not to have  careers they don't always recognize &#8226;.&#8226; [laughter] and it never occurred  to me not to have a career, and wouldn't have if I had married any of  those At least, I think not.  Another example of contrasting preceptions of women's role occurred  also in Chapel Hill. One day, the maid in Dr. Mangum's home where I had  a room, brought calling cards up to me. The wives of two professors,  Mrs. Crittenden whose husband was in History and another, awaited me downstairs  in hat and gloves. They wanted to welcome me to Chapel Hill. It  was a gracious gesture but I was neither a professor's wife nor a professor-in  fact, had become so absorbed in my student role that I was taken aback.  This variation in role definition happens constantly. At UCLA the wives  organized first and called their association "UCLA Faculty Women". When  the women professors became numerous enough they had to differentiate their  organization through the title, "Association of Academic Women". Actually  many spouses have careers and if not employed by the same institution hold  20  equally stimulating positions. The point I'm making (nonetoowell) is that  men do not face the same problem. Perhaps the parallel for professors who  are bachelors, as a certain one close to me sometimes hints, is being  called on constantly to squire the visiting s i ngles no matter what the  age or to make up a fourth at bridge.  It turns out that that little study group in Montgomery was largely  women because they were unmarried, but there were a few husbands present  in the group. We didn't usually have more than eight or ten in all and  we met Saturday afternoons. I was not a regular attendant. Later some  younger men joined the group for example, George Stoney who came from  Henry Street Settlement in New York and had had journalisti c experience  on the staff' of Survey Graphic. More young men &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  SG : So many of you in the study group were from a social work  background?  Stone : Yes. It turned out that several got into the field if they  weren't already [laughter]. My impression is that Carrie Lee Cobb  (whom we called Arbadee for some reason), the daughter of an Episcopal  bishop, and Clotilde Brand, who was a Huntingdon alumna (though she was  a town student and didn't live on campus, and she was a Presbyterian instead  of a Methodist), were not in social work. I think they were teaching in  the school system of Montgomery. And then I got them interested in social  work, I suppose, and they took training and in time joined the state social  work program. I saw three or four of those men and women in Montgomery in  1971--not in reunion of the study group but out of personal friendship  which has endured.  SG: Well, Olive, there are a couple of more things that I think we  should cover in this Montgomery period. (These were from notes that we  made last time when we had to cut short.) One was, we wanted to talk about  21  the Southern League for People's Rights that C. Vann Woodward was involved  in in Atlanta in 1933 or 34.  Stone: Yes. There was one meeting, as far as I know no others, that  took place in Atlanta. Woodward, who was at that time with Georgia Tech,  and his friend Glenn Rainey of Emory came as did other professionals,  black and white. A friend and I stayed at my brother's apartment in Atlanta.  We got together to see what we could do about problems of civil  rights in the South, because the Scottsboro case was up as was the Angelo  Herndon trial. We adopted no specific action about cases but hammered out  general principles and goals. "Southern League for People's Rights" was  the title we gave the new organization, but it didn't seem to go forward,  as far as I know.  SG: How many people do you recall were at that meeting?  Stone: A news article says representatives from eleven Southern states-artists,  writers, teachers, preachers and other professionals.  SG: And that was to be the founding body?  Stone: The founding body. Then later I went on to Chapel Hill, where  I found that Vann Woodward was getting his Doctor's degree in history.  He and the Maclachlams helped me with the organization which we called  Committee instead of League--the "Southern Committee". And he and I  recalled having met in Atlanta; but I didn't pursue the matter further  because meanwhile I had spent the whole fall of 1934 after leaving  Huntingdon in the interest of doing an executive job with this Southern  League for People's Rights.  SG: In other words, this Southern League for People's Rights didn't &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  It was an attempt to form something that never got off the ground.  Stone: As far as I know. Except that I must have been commissioned  to promote its financially sound establishment.  22  Many people came to Montgomery during my last two years there wanting  to start programs of this kind in the South, but I had a hunch (such as  Odum did too) that it had to be southern [laughter]. Because there were  two things that were touchy questions in the South: one was race relations  and the other was Yankeeism. But I couldn't rally enough foundation money  to support me in that capacity, so I had to consider the combining of it  with research. And I did get ah Elmhurst Fellowship at Chapel Hill. I  didn't go to Chapel Hill until January, 1935.  SG: Oh, I see. And that's when there seems to have been two  conferences in there, too, somewhere before you went to Chapel Hill. There  seems to have been a Swarthmore conference following a Blue Ridge conference.  And in Nov. 1934 a bi-racial conference at Shaw University in Raleigh.  Stone: Oh, the YW ' s Blue Ridge Conference was just the usual thing  at the end of the school year.  SG: Where did your mother go, then, when you were leaving Hunt~ngdon?  Stone: She went to Texas to live with my sister--not to Dadeville,  our old home town, where she had stayedas paying guest in the home of very  dear friends, the Bulgers, during my summer absences abroad or in the North.  SG: Well, these conferences were &#8226; This Swarthmore conference  was  Stone: Yes. This was a race relations conference in which we had  twenty-nine famous Negro speakers in twenty-nine days. I 'd never met so  many important people in my life: E. Franklin Frazier, Ira Reid, Ralphe  Bunche &#8226;  SG : Oh, it was a very long conference.  Stone : It was a month's conference, yes. And we lived--it was summertime  and Swarthmore was not in session--in the dormitories there and held  meetings. Dr. Charles Johnson was co-director with a professor from  Columbia, Otto Klineberg, and dear Dr. Parks &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG: From Chicago?  23  Stone: Yes Robert&#183; Ezra Parks from Chicago was the main consultant.  And we all sat at his feet, more or less, because he was a wonderful man.  Though I cringed from one of the stories he told which was about having a  Negro nurse whom he regarded as a "mammy" [laughter]. And I didn't care  for that slant out of my new outlook &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; I had had a Negro nurse too  [laughter ] whom we loved very dearly, as well as other servants when I  grew up. And we hadn't questioned our attitude because we were &#8226;&#8226;. kind  [laughter ] . But it took some exposure for me, as it did for Katharine  Lumpkin (The Making of a Southerner), to become aware of my old stereotypes.  Apparently by the time I went to Swarthmore I had sloughed off so many  stereotypes that a fellow southerner, Prof. H. C. Brearley, of Clemson U.,  came up to say goodbye at the closing reception. Taking both my hands as  I stood there in evening dress, he said, "You are a lovely Southern lady  if I haven't agreed in the least with your point of view."  While we were in Huntingdon, for instance, Mother was asked to teach  a class of the nurse-maids who came with white children to Sunday School.  She report~d it with a great pride and a sense that this would please me,  that she was teaching the Negro nurse-maids [laughter ] . I said, "Well, I  think that's fine, Mother [laughter ] . I'm so glad that you're getting  acquainted with them [laughter ]." I had wished that we could have had the  Negroes in and ~ the Sunday School and church. Actually they may not  have wanted integration there--and don't to this day, in some instances.  They want to have separate churches, because they have a good deal more  control of the leadership posts.  SG: Like the women.  Stone: Yes.  24  SG: Was this conference, then, primarily an academic conference, this  SWarthmore conference?  Stone : Yes, it seems to have been. Because two years later--this was  in the summer of 1934--and two years later I had letters from Dr. Ralph  Bunche, who was going to be the co-director with Dr. George E. Simpson of  Temple University (the Quakers always had a black and a white person as  co-directors of the SWarthmore Institute on Race Relations).  SG: Oh, in other words, this was a yearly conference.  Stone: No, a biennial conference. And I had a letter from Mrs. Helen  R. Bryan, Secy., Institute of Race Relations, who was administrator of the  1936 session and from Dr. Bunche inquiring whether I would mind suggesting  professors in the North Carolina area to recruit other professors or  advanced students to come there. I said in my reply that I tried to  catch Dr. Odum, but he was a visiting professor at Illinois that quarter.  Dr. Vance was somewhere, and Dr. Johnson was in and out on the "Negro in  America" Myrdal study. But I did catch Johnson long enough for us to  complete the list (and it made three or four pages), of all the private  and public, black and white colleges and universities, and indicated the  professors who might be willing to do the interviewing for the SWarthmore  Conference. So that's the way they did it every session. I did make a  talk at a conference in Washington that Dr. Bunche and John P. Davis put on  at Howard University while I was at Chapel Hill.  SG: That was later, though .  Stone : That was in May 1935.  SG: Now this Blue Ridge Summer  Stone: So in Blue Ridge, I had gone as a student to Blue Ridge . I  had also gone to Winthrop, South Carolina to a student government meeting.  Thus I had not, like Katharine Lumpkin, been entirely in Alabama until I  25  went to graduate school. Instead, I had gone to South Carolina, had gone  to Atlanta to opera and symphony and to Blue Ridge as a student--and of  course to Europe and U. of Chicago. But they remembered me, I suppose,  from student days or else they'd kept up in some way. At any rate, they  wrote and asked if I would lead a workshop at the Blue Ridge YWCA conference  in 1934. And I had thought I would like to lead a workshop on unemployment  and economic problems and other Depression things of this kind, but the  students wanted to talk about marriage and family instead. I had to do  what the students wanted, I believed in letting them choose. We did bring  up economic matters--that it was a handicap for young people to have to  postpone either marriage or children. But I do have in my correspondence  a 1 tter from Miss Mears thanking me for leading the workshop. So I spent  part of the summer after leaving Huntingdon, in June 1934, at Blue Ridge  and then at Swarthmore. And then on to New York.  BEGIN TAPE II SIDE I  SG: You went to New York first to talk to the A.C.L.U.  Stone: Well, to get some money, yes. To meet friends who had  connections. I think I met Mary Van Kleek who was with the Russell Sage  Foundation. And I exchanged letters with Dr. Lathrmn who was with Southern  Labor Colleges. I had not met Hilda Smith before this fortieth reunion  of Highlander, where I met Jacqueline Hall.  SG: Well Olive, when did you decide to make the move and leave  Huntingdon? What was the motivation behind it?  Stone: Well, first of all the fact that I felt that Dr. Agnew was  having to take extra precautions to try to prevent any harm to Huntingdon.  He didn't ever tell me that some of the D.A.R.-type people would come out  and protest that I was the "Red Dean," you know. Perfectly ridiculous but  people kept asking me to talk about Russia. And by the way, I explained  11  26  the attitude that Russians had towards red as a color; that red was beautiful  and they used "red and black", instead of "white and black". But that still  didn't assuage the critics. I also was feeling that I would have to  suppress myself if I stayed on and honored the needs that I felt Huntingdon  justifiably had. President Agnew never would have fired me.  SG: And by this time you were becoming more involved in some of these  racial things and more progressive &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: Yes. I don't think that the sharecroppers would have been  any special issue, because I didn't feel that I needed to do any more than  I did for a very brief time there when the organizers were seeking  financial aid. But a good many people were coming into the South or  writing that they would like to come into the South and get progressive  programs going . While I was sympathetic, I didn't feel that I would help  their causes if I became known as the radical at Huntingdon. So it was a  conscious decision , I think, also I had gotten just a little restive  at Huntingdon; I felt it was rather parochial [laughter] in many ways.  Some of the people weren't; we had professors there from many parts of the  country: one from Evanston, Illinois; and others from, you know, various  places. And there was this lovely man from Copenhagen [laughter] . But  it was a provincial place, and I was spreading myself too thin.  SG: Now had you already decided, then, to go ahead with your Doctorate  at that point?  Stone: No. I had felt, as I wrote Dr. Agnew (and it's in the  correspondence here) that I was reluctant to go to a university for fear  it would cripple what I wanted to do in research by having me conform to  certain forms of the dissertation, and I wanted to do more field work. What  I had decided on was to use this historical study I had done on Alabama as  background for research on modern times. Through the TVA's beneficence I  27  had hired people to research the newspapers in the Ala Archives, I had  obtained some perfectly magnificent data from that early period; what some  of the newly-freed blacks were trying to do. They got suppressed, but they  were trying to do things~ At any rate, I wanted to use that and I wanted  to make a field study, which later the University of N.C. encouraged.  I went to Chapel Hill in January 1935, and in the first half of the summer  did my field research in Alabama.  SG: But when you left Huntingdon, then, you had no intention of going  for Doctoral study?  Stone: Not really or perhaps I should say not a settled intention.  I held it in the back of my mind, but I wanted to combine research with  civil rights work. I wanted to do it on my own if I could get a foundation,  but I didn't manage to do that.  SG: I see. So in other words, that summer you were looking for  foundation support both for the Committee for People's Rights and for your  own sociological research?  Stone: Yes. I got hospitality, such as being made a "Visiting Scholar"  at Brookings Institution, where I could use their library and where I met  interesting people. And I had a small grant for research at the Library  of Congress. I don't know what else I was living on in this time; I must  have saved a little money [laughter].  SG: Well, you had mentioned something about a Garland Fellowship.  Was that during that period?  Stone: I tried to get that, but I didn't succeed. Later the heirs  of the Garland Foundation became good friends, because they were supporting  Farm Research, Inc. The Garlands were very wealthy people and very homespun,  down-to-earth people of Scandinavian background. They inherited a  Charles large brick  fortune but/ "Barley" and Ursula lived in a simple kind of/home and brought  J  28  their children up in natural surroundings. He was a member of the trustees  of Farm Research and because of his background he loved farm life himself.  The family had a suburban place near Washington where we went from time  to time for talks and discussions . I didn't know when I was in New York  that I was to meet the Garlands later [laughter]. And I didn't ask them  when I did meet them to do any financing. I didn't know they had money  for individual research; I knew that they did support Farm Research and gave  large grants to ACLU and other progressive causes.  SG: Olive, the clippings that we looked at once before indicated that  you left Huntingdon to be the executive secretary of the League for People's  Rights. When did the idea of the League develop., and how did that happen?  Stone: Hmm. I've clarified this already.  SG: I mean, it was something you started, wasn't it?  Stone: Yes and no. I did not call the Atlanta meeting but I must  have had some assurance in Atlanta that there would be a possibility of  other chapters if we got something going, and if we could do it in the  South. I'm not sure where I thought I would have headquarters as  executive secretary; I think I planned to have them either in Atlanta or  the upper South. I hated to give up the deep South, and I stayed there  just as long as I could, you know. I felt in some ways problems were  gravest in Birmingham, Montgomery and Atlanta. However, Atlanta wasn't  a typical southern city; it was "civilized"--the Lester Maddox phenomenon  to the contrary notwithstanding--headquarters for so many national  organizations and businesses. But I felt that in some ways people recognized  the contrasts more in the deep than in the upper South. In Richmond the  liberals didn't have as much difficulty working with blacks or supporting  liberal causes. And Virginius Dabney, the editor of the Times Dispatch, was  very articulate about race relations and civil rights. He helped chair many  29  movements. And the Mitchells lived there; old Dr. S. C. Mitchell who  taught at Richmond College was an openly avowed socialist. His wife  sat next to me at a dinner one time. They had two dintinguished sons,  George (who was at one point with the Southern Regional Council) and Broadus  Johns Hopkins  (who taught at/ &#183; ). I may have told this little anedote about Mrs.  Mitchell.  SG: No, I don't think you have.  Stone: Mrs. Mitchell said to me in an aside, "Broadus is the apple  of my eye, but I wish he would not fret people so." [laughter] George  was more politic; he didn't rub people [laughter], fret t hem as Broadus  I BBli imore  did. So Broadus stayed in/ while George came to Atlanta later on.  SG: Well Olive, in other words while you were still at Huntingdon  you had the idea for this League or Committee for People's Rights, and  some idea that you might have funding. You left Huntingdon with the idea  that you were going to devote your time to that and also to do some of  your own research.  Stone: Yes. But I didn't have financing--only faith and hope.  SG: And then you left Huntingdon. When you went to New York was  to actually look for funding?  Stone: Yes, that was it. And by this time I must have known Katharine  Lumpkin and Dorothy Douglas.  SG: Do you recall when you met them?  Stone: I think it was after--I know it must have been after--the  trip around the world. Because in the summer of 1 31, after I came back  from Russia, I didn't stop anywhere in New York except to meet Norman  Thomas through Harry Laidler. Barbara Irish, a journalist with Fortune,  and I were met at the boat: I was met by my sister, and she was met by her  brother-in-law, Corliss Lamont, a Columbia professor and son of the Wall  St. banker. We introduced each other but paid no further attention there  30  except that I bought a book of his. I stayed with my sister briefly at  Coluf'9.bia in the Internati8nal Hpuse. She was getting her Maste &#8226;s in art.  SG: So that would not have been when you met?  Stone: No. And I didn't meet anyone else, and came on back to Hutttingdon  and began making talks that year.  SG: ' ell now, Katharine L pkin did not have the same sort of politiital  views and involvement as her sister, though?  Stone: No, it is my impression that they were at odds. with each other  at that time. Partly because, I think, Katharine's liberal views did not  ma&#183;tch Grace s &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; I never met Grace Lumpkin and knew nothing at first hand.  Katharine as of a calmer temperament and Itm sure was not a Communist. She  was interes d in labor studies, and she and Dorothy Dougla:s, a Smith prof  essor) and several other academic people established a labor research institute.  I have a letter from Katharine on the official letterhead in this correspondence  addressed to Chapel Hill. She was asking if I knew anyone who  would like to participate in the labor studies. Her sister wrote an excel-  1 ent novel, by the way , about the people who came down from the hill country,  from the farms; to work in the mills You probably krnow her novel, "To Make  ity Bread." I have it.  SG: So by the time you went to Chapel Hill you actually had met Katharine  Lumpkin.  Stone : Katharine and Dorothy Douglas. I'd met somebody who wrote a  book on the chaingang; Walter vilson &#8226;s Forced Labor in the United States.  I have the book . And I have many of Katharine's book$. She and I are fellow  sociologists and are congenial on many scores. Dorothy was an economist.  SG : So right in through this period is when you were getting steeped  more and more in some of the Negro causes and civil rights  3].  Stone:. I would not express it your way. My interest in race relation$  and civil rights arose out of my lifetime experience and I thought I had made  this clear to you.  SG: Now when you went to New York is when you talked to the A.C.L.U.  and decided that it &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ?  Stone: Yes, in 1934, the ACLU and several other such organizatio &#183;&#183; &#8226;  Earlier when I went to New York I was getting reference letters ,  as I've told you, to people in the Orient, inclucting  one to futur~Prime Minister Nehru of India which I couldn't deliver because  he was- in prison. But Katherine Hardeman and I did visit the philosopher  Tagore in his Pshram and learned how he was trying to liberize the  Caste System. India's barriers&#183; were not unlike those we had in the USA.  But the 1934 trip to New York had a different purpose. Among friends  who could suggest funding was orothy Douglas. I saw her following the Swarthmore  Conference--and I must have known her and Katharine rather well by t hen-with  because I went/ them to Backlog CamIP- (a Quaker Camp) in the Addirondacks and subsequently  joined them on other vacations .  I considered the Southern League for People's Rights already formed. y  mission was to take its principles and seek practical means for implementing.  I conferred with several Northern-based programs (correspondence includes Urban  League) but preferred an independent organization to a branch of an extablished  organization. Actually I was trying to cover all bases to see what I could  do about funditjg. A letter to President Agnew reports my final solution.  "My work here at the University of North Carilina is fulfilling  every expectation. I had known of the prestige of the sociology  department , particularly in the rural field , but I did not expect  to find quite such a high level of work all along the&#183; line."  Then I tell some~thing about Rupert Vance, Guy Johnson,- Lee Brooks, Odum &amp;  32  Ernest Groves. "When you have a little spare time I would appreciate it  if you would write Dr. Howard W. Odum, Director, Institute for Research in  Social Sciences, and express your pleasure that I have decided to tie up  my research project with a university of the calibre of u. of N.C. I  think it would please him. And besides, I believe he would be glad to  learn something of my work at W.C.A. (Woman's College of Alabama), whether  I left in good standing and so forth. It would be a good plan for you to  say that you advised me in the beginning to use my material for a Doctoral  dissertation, and to go right on for my degree. At that time I felt that  any academic affiliation would be restrictive, both of my research plans  and of a strong desire I had for doing something with a program of civil  rights. For instance, I have told Dr. O. of my interest in the latter."  I didn't want Dr. Odum to accept me as a student without knowing that I  had this background.  SG: Well then, Olive, when you couldn't get the funding for the &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: Then I told President Agnew, "As you may recall, the year I  came to Huntingdon [it was not called Huntingdon then] I was offered a  very enticing fellowship at the University of Chicago, and Bess Adams was  urging me to be her roommate there. However, I have never regretted my  decision to come to Montgomery. In fact, no more enriching years have I  had in a long time." And so forth. "For much of the real joy, as well as  the fine constructive value, I am indebted to you." And then I tell about  seeing members of the Huntingdon faculty in Washington and in New York.  SG: Well now, it was when you were not able to get the financing  for both the Committee for People's Rights and for your own research that  you decided, in that interim before January, to go to Chapel Hill for the  Doctorate?  Stone: And to apply first for admission and then for a fellowship.  33  However I hadn't really made up my mind about U. of N.C. until I went to  Shaw University, in late Nov. 1934. And the letter that came to me inviting  me to Shaw was from the International Student Service was forwarded from  Montgomery. Frances Henson said, "I have the pleasure of inviting you to  attend a very important conf'erence of about twenty-five younger Negro and  younger white leaders to be held at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina,  from 2 p.m. Friday, November 30 through Sunday, December 2, 1934."  The invitation tells who is on the committee, and it included such people  as Howard Kester [either he or FOR or the SWarthmore leaders may have suggested  me] and Dr. Ira Reid, who is the author of a number of books on the Negro,  and who taught both at Atlanta University and later at . Swarthmore or one  of the eastern colleges. He was on that American Council on Education  study of the Negro in which Franklin Frazier, Charles Johnson, and several  others participated. It was before the SWedish scholar Myrdal came over  to write the book, An American Dilemma, you know; Guy Johnson worked on that.  So I met a number of the SWarthmore people at the Shaw U. conference;I had  known Howard Kester longer than the others. And here he ' s called "Howard  A. Kester, Secretary of the Committee on Economic and Racial Justice."  See, he had made the shift by then. Then Mr. Henson concludes: "The whole  question of objectives in interracial work, as well as the inadequacy of  present organizations in this field, and educational provisions for the  Negro will be discussed freely." He adds, "I think it's desirable for  us to handle the issues without gloves. Out of our discussions we will  expect action to come." You see, the Odum point of view, I had heard,  was to discuss more than to act. Though, in a way, to act too; at least  to try to get people to sit down and listen to each other. Shaw University  was generously making it possible for us to obtain room and board at  $1.50 a day. [Isn't that charming?] And when it was found that I was in  34  Washington it was offered that Dr. Virginia Alexander stop and pick me up  and bring me to Shaw. And she did.  But the final decision to attend U. of N.C., if accepted, came after  I met John and Emily Maclachlan there at Shaw. John was getting or had  gotten his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of North Carolina, and  he was teaching at the Raleigh branch. ~ They seemed a little restive/ under  but , I felt ,  the regional emphasis/ &#183; under the concentation on it. However they liked  it and they admired Odum and Vance and Johnson very, very much. But at that  time they thought they'd better tell me [laughter] that civil rights  should be handled:. more cautiously than at Shaw because of the "Will  Alexander approathh"and because regionalism was the emphasis. Here I was  meeting some real graduates who had experienced Chapel Hill directly and I  became quite convinced from them that that would be the best place on  earth to go if I were accepted and could find a fellowship. So I conferred  with Odum about enrolling as a student. He invited me to come, and I did.  SG: I see. And then you decided that wherever you were going to  be, you were stil~ going to try to set up this Southern Connnittee for  People's Rights.  Stone: Yes . And I told Odum that I was interested in civil rights  programs, and that I had been active in this general area of southern  leadership for civil rights. And I think he liked my appreciation of the  fact that any "cause", to work in the South, should be southern. It  should not be superimposed from the outside, or brought in by strangers.  It was not so much the prejudice against Yankeeism as it was the fact that  Northerners might not understand--in short, a program should be indigenous.  And we agreed on that.  SG: Now what was your image of him exactly?  Stone: As a very famous man, and an awesomely able man. My, he was  brilliant! [laughter] He could read a page before you could hand it to him.  SG: But you saw him as definitely having a different, as being a  much more conservative voice in terms of the civil rights movement?  Stone: Yes, I did think of his being conservative. But I had great  respect for his scholarship. I had read several of his books and I &#8226;  liked two things about him and UNC that I didn't like about Chicago. He  knew and loved the South and he saw no conflict between social work and  sociology. At Chicago Miss Abbott and Miss Breckinridge had parted  company with sociology. Sociology had also severed connection with the  National Conference of Charities and Corrections when it decided to become  scientific. Actually there could be nothing more scientific than what Miss  Abbott and Miss Breckinridge [laughter] had us do in our research. However,  if I had gone there for my Doctorate I would not have had as broad an  opportunity. I felt they belonged together, the social sciences and social  work, and I have always believed that. Dr. Odum was strongly in favor  of social work. He helped found the School of Social Work and the Department  of Public Welfare, and wrote some of the books in that field. So there was  never any schism in Chapel Hill at all. I liked that. I took a minor in  social work but actually I had many courses in anthropology--it could have  been a minor, because I was interested in folk groups and anthropological  methods of research.  SG: But you mentioned several times your hesitancy because of his  conservative position and the caution that you had to use in terms of  the formation of the Southern Committee for People's Rights. Was he very  overt about this?  Stone: No, never, never. And neither were my other professors. And  I don't recall inviting them; I asked other people such as Paul Green and  Phillips Russell to involve Guy Johnson and Rupert Vance. Actually the  36  group was younger than Odum. He had been the professor of my professors.  See, he invited his most brilliant students to stay on, and brought in  other people. He had never expressed any &#8226; In fact one of the first  courses I took was a course under him, and he put me through the mill to  see if I could do it [laughter]: partly having m~ make sort of a  historical study of some of the eariler sociologists that I hadn't learned  about before coming to Chapel Hill. So I had a great time with him;  enjoyed it very much. But I had a feeling that since Vance and Johnson did  not join the Southern Committee probably it was not the thing to do. And  I think, on the other hand, that people in the humanities and other fields  were a little freer to work for civil liberties than someone in the social  science field, who would then be confused with the social worker. You see,  if you go out to improve conditions instead of study then, it was the same  old problem that was handled in Chicago by separation of sociology and  social work. On the other hand, the Chicago people like Parks believed  in having race relations conferences. . Parks taught at Fisk University.  In fact, he was a newspaper man, I believe, or taught philosophy until he  went to Tuskegee and met Booker T. Washington and decided to move to  sociology (and took a Doctors degree later in that).  SG : Well, I think what I would like to do is wait to really get into  the Cormnittee for People's Rights, so we don't start and then have to  interrupt it. So if we can wait 'til next time for that. But I would like  to ask you just a few brief questions, primarily in terms of &#8226; You  went back, then, and became involved in graduate school at Chapel Hill. You  were already in your mid-thirties. In those days it wasn't that usual for  someone of that age to be back in graduate school, w~s it?  Stone: No, I suppose not. But why not?  SG : Did you have any feelings about that, or problems?  Stone: No. Harry Moore was about my age as were sociologists who  came for refresher courses. However, Marnie Hegood, who became my  apartment-mate one summer was at least ten years younger than I (though  she said later that she didn't know there was thatmuch of an age  difference between us). Most of my friends [laughter], to tell you the  truth, have usually been younger than I; I find them more congenial. It  may be a little bit arrogant on my part to think they reciprocate. Today,  I enjoy my emeriti Briends but still have very good friends among those  who haven't retired yet : the Crescitellis, for instance, who are still  teaching, have been good friends of mine for these twenty-five years  that I've been in California.  SG: So you didn't feel in an awkward position being .&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: I didn 't; I'm trying to think why. In some ways yes, in  could have been  other ways &#8226; I think it/ &#183;.&#183; a little awkward that I came there as  an associate professor from Huntingdon. But it became clear very soon  that I had a lot to learn in sociology. It may have made my professors  who were my age and yom:iger (Vance is two or three years younger than I,  and Guy Johnson younger than that, I think--I think they were both born  in this century, and I was born in 1897, you know) feel that in a way they  should treat me somewhat "dff erently &#183; ~ - n [laughter], but they didn't and  on neither side were we the least bit ill at ease. I was invited to their  homes as the other doctoral students were on both formal and informal  occassions. I got selected out occassionally when no one else would be  but on grounds of subject matter, such as ethnic groups. And I just took  it in stride, and to tell the truth I've always loved the role of student--  never will stop studying [laughter]. I always called my professors  "Professor" until after I graduated.  38  SG: It seems to me like it would have been somewhat of an awkward &#8226;&#8226;.  I mean, you were really marginal.  Stone: Yes, I was.  SG: You were very much like them, and yet at the same time a graduate  student.  Stone: Yes, there was this situation. And the fact that I was a  woman in largely a man's world. I think I told you that Miss Jocher,  Dr. Katharine Jocher who taught courses as "Others" in the catalogue, was  a right-hand man to Dr. Odum. She put out Social Forces; she was in  charge of the Institute for Research in Social Sciences. Odum was the  titular head of both and the policy maker and planner but Miss Jocher  really did the management, the administrative processes in both the  Institute and on the magazine. She taught some courses in both social  work and sociology--one or two courses, not many--but they couldn't put  her in the catalogue except under the caption, "Odum and Others". I  think maybe social work helped a little in the policy change when it came  along as a separate school. It had to have professors who were teaching  casework and other methods and they tended to have the professional Master's  but not the Ph.D. and were almost entirely women. After a while Dr. Jocher  began appearing in her own right.  SG: So she was the only one on the faculty, then, who was a woman?  Stone : And Miss Herring, who was not teaching courses until my  second year there, or second summer. I stayed only from January ' 35  through the summer of 1936. I did my field research in the summer of  1935, first term. Then I went to William and Mary in the fall of ' 36,  and came back successive summers until I finished my dissertation and made  a second field trip to Alabama.  There was another smart thing on Dr. Odum's part. He got marvelous  grants from Rosenwald Foundation, from Social Science Research Council,  Inc. and everywhere, and set up this excellent Institute for Research in  Social Sciences at UNC. He could pay the full salary of people like  Guton Johnson, who was writing a history of North Carolina [that's Guy  Johnson's wife who had a Doctorate in history] and of Harriet Herring,  who was a splendid industrial studies person, and Katharine Jocher, who  was, as I said, the right-hand person. Finally Miss Herring taught a  course or so, but I don't think she appeared in the catalogue. She probably  did--but they've all retired now. Dr. Odum got around things that were  not technically acceptable.  SG: And what about among the graduate students? Were most of them  men?  Stone: Yes, a very large proportion of them were men. Bernice Moore  and Marnie Hegood and I were the only women, I think.  SG: In how large a graduate class?  Stone: Well, you see there were a lot of people who didn't go on to  finish their Doctorates. But we would have from twelve to fifteen  Doctoral students plus a much larger number of Master's. And I think now  they have far more than that; I'm not sure about size. Dr. Odum's department,  incidentally, was ranked in 1935 (I have the exact date somewhere else)  by the National Council on Education (whatever the accrediting body is) as  one of the five most distinguished graduate departments of sociology in  the nation. And it still is ranked among the top ten. It was, I think,  next to the top when I was there; I think Harvard was ahead. But it was  ahead of Chicago [laughter]. The five were: Harvard, Columbia, Chicago,  North Carolina and--what was the fifth one? Wisconsin? But it was ahead  -=-  4o  of Duke; considerably ahead of Duke, because Duke didn't have a distinguished  department then. So we all knew this, that Odum had brought good people  to Chapel Hill. He had the endowment, he had the research, and he had  a school of thought. It was, in a way, a popular school of thought, this  regionalism, because it was a method of solving southern problems more  positively than through sectional rivalries between the "wool hat boys"  and the "silk hat boys", or between, you know, the upper South and the lower  South, and the North and the South.  SG: So you saw it as being a positive social force, in other words?  Stone : Yes, I did see it as a positive force. I used it as an  organizing theme in one part of my dissertation.  I was in awe of Odum, and never felt as comfortable with him as his  own professors did. Though after I finished [laughter] I felt a little  more so when I would go back or would have occasion to attend (at sociological  meetings) Chapel Hill breakfasts or something like that. We would usually  have Miss Jocher [laughter] representing Odum. He seldom came to these  breakfasts or luncheons himself, you see, he had been president of the  American Sociological Society, and won all the top honors, and had received  all the honorary degrees from distinguished universities--in short, ran  in higher circles.  Actually, you know, I'm a good scholar but not a good writer. I like  it; there's nothing I like better than doing research and writing. But  I've lost the flair, I find in rereading articles I sent to the home  paper from Europe in 1923-24 were written in a much fraer and more natural  way. I now use too much sociological jargon.  SG : Yes. It's taken me years to get over that [laughter]  Stone : And I've got to try to do something about it, because I  41  dearly love to write. But between my perfectionism and my [laughter ]  awkward writing I don't get as much published as I should, and I feel  guilty about that.
