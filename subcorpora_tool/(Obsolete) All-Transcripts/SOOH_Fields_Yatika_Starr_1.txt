 Roberts. I   m interviewing Yatika Starr Fields for an  oral history project in an OSU Native American art course, and for the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Today is Monday, April 8,  2013. Yatika, first question, I just wanted to ask you to maybe generally  introduce yourself, and also when you do introduce yourself, maybe  what identifying traits or terms would you use?  Fields The terms for me, I   m an artist. I   m originally from Oklahoma, so an  Oklahoman. I lived in New York, a New Yorker, and Boston, a  Bostonian, and a creative person, someone who really enjoys and  respects nature and color and the beauty that   s in it. All of that can be fit  into the description of me, but overall just a creative person. I   m an  artist.  Roberts Where were you born? After that, what part of Oklahoma did you spend  most of your childhood?  Fields I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on December 3, 1980, at St. Francis  Hospital. We were en route from Hominy. That   s where my mom was  driving from, my dad and mom, to take me to the hospital. I guess I first  lived in Hominy, Oklahoma, in Osage County. Not too long after that  when I was really, really young, moved to Tahlequah, Oklahoma.  There   s a lot of memories there from when I was growing up and kind  of coming to life and realizing. I guess when you   re that young, those  memories that happen, your first memories that happen that stay with  you, so it was Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for that, the rivers and growing up  there. That was even before I was in kindergarten or first grade.  Then we came to Stillwater, and so I   ve been in Stillwater from then,  from first grade on up to high school. The rest is up on the East Coast.  That was me in Oklahoma, growing up here in those different places. I  had family all over the place, so a lot of traveling around and being  5  everywhere in Oklahoma and getting to know it pretty well. It was  Hominy, Stillwater, Tahlequah, and that   s pretty much it. I grew up  here.  Roberts Great. Your childhood in Tahlequah and Stillwater, Tahlequah, the  rivers, you mentioned, what did those environments, what effect did that  have on you growing up, and then also now as an artist?  Fields I think growing up, just the serenity, the sereneness of it, the beauty of  it, the birds, and the lushness of the lower Ozarks, clear waters,  skipping stones, catching crawdads, seeing the fish, it just made a big  impact, this peacefulness to observe. I   m really thankful that I grew up  in a place like that, as opposed to a noisy place like the city or  something. It kind of put this ease on me, I feel like, to look at things in  a different way, a different light. As far as me growing up and being an  artist, today I think a lot of these elements and those things still appear  in my works. They do. I know they do because I put them in there, and  it   s this lushness, this movement. You can find peace in it. That   s the  correlation to how I grew up in Tahlequah, how they play into my work.  I would say those elements, organic forms, and color, and the mystery  behind it all.  Roberts What is your earliest memory of art, wow you would define art, or  creative process of some kind? What is your earliest memory of  something like that?  Fields My mom is an artist. She is a sculptor now, but she did painting back  then, I   m sure. We were doing projects in the house, and I just  remember being oriented with it. It was just kind of always around. I  think my first memory of it, really, was when I was in Stillwater. This  artist came to our school to do a artist talk. He was this illustrator from  the Philippines, this children   s book illustrator. He did this demo in  front of all the students, these little kids. I   m sitting in the front row. He  just did a quick sketch of a character, and it just really amazed me that  he was there doing this in front of us. I was like,    That   s cool. I want to  be doing that when I   m older.    He can do that, and he can make a  living. I think that was my first memory. It   s not a fine art of painting,  but it   s illustration. It   s still the movement. He did it so quickly. It was  his profession. I think that was my first memory of an artist and a  profession. I think my first memory of art is going back to the rivers.  That   s art in itself, an organic art. That was my first memory of a  working artist, I feel like, here in Stillwater in kindergarten.  Roberts How has your Native American heritage influenced your identity and  obviously the work you produce today?  6  Fields It   s influenced my identity pretty thickly. It   s from Oklahoma. My  parents definitely made an effort to bring us in and to get us oriented  with the traditional values of who we are and where we   re from, and  know where we   re from, and know our families, mostly on the Osage  side. I was named in the Indian name in the Native American church on  my first birthday, then put into the I   n-Lon-Schka dances, the Osage  dances when I was pretty young, five or six. That happens every year,  so you grow up with it. You grow up knowing all these young guys and  see them become men like yourself. You see the tribe grow. You end up  knowing a lot through that and through the dancing. I   m happy that I  can leave and come back and still have that. There   s a place here for  me. It   s your tribe. It   s your traditions.  The dancing part of it, the movement, the aesthetics of it, the regalia,  the colors, those things play into my work with the colors. Even the  creation story has a big part in my work, too. The Osages have a really  interesting creation story, but all tribes do, as well. Those elements,  again, going back and seeing that mystery of creation, too, that plays in  there, creating my own space, creating my own journey, creating this  mystery, allowing people to free-associate with it when they come look  at my work. I don   t want to shove anything down someone   s throat or  make them see,    This is this.    You look at life, and then you make your  own judgment on it. Everyone does that, I feel like, on this earth. They  make this earth what they want it. You choose your own path. It   s kind  of just like me, painting. You can look at it. You choose what you want  to see, but there is some correlation to how I grew up and where I   m  from and the traditions that I know.  Roberts You mentioned your mom being an artist. Are both your parents artists?  Can you talk a little bit about how that played a role in the culture you  were exposed to growing up with their artwork?  Fields Yeah, like I said, they went to the Institute of American Indian Arts. In  the   70s, the   60s, that was a pretty big time out there for the  experimentation and exploration of Native American art, abstractions  and really laying down some groundwork for what we see today. T. C.  Cannon and there   s just so many of these guys out there. It was tough  times. My dad   s a photographer. My mom is a sculptor, works with  clay. I think growing up in Santa Fe, or being able to go to Santa Fe  every August for Indian Market with my parents and being around the  art and seeing it, it definitely eventually built on it.  When I was younger, I was just like any other kid. I wanted to play with  my Game Boy, and wanted to go skateboarding, and playing baseball. I  mean I wasn   t   I drew. I was always the kid that could draw in class. If  anyone wanted something drawn, you know,    Yo, Yatika, can you draw  7  this?    The class was going to enter a poster contest, and I would be the  one to design it. That was that, but I was just a kid, baseball, sports,  skateboarding. I didn   t really care too much about it. I knew it was  there. It was another part of me, but I was really interested in just being  a kid, I think, and playing sports.  I think high school and junior high, late junior high and high school,  that   s when I really started to make the push to look into art more. I  think it definitely affected me, knowing what was out there and having  already an understanding and one foot in the door a little bit, knowing  what was out there and the depth of it, I think. It definitely helped, and  it definitely shaped me to where my work is now, I think. To what it is  as to being an artist, a working artist, you have to work hard to do that.  By the time I was in high school, I already had a studio here in  Stillwater. As opposed to just a classroom studio, I had my own studio.  I was going beyond the efforts needed to be a high school art student. I  was taking my own classes and studying, myself.  Roberts You mentioned your graffiti art. I think probably many people maybe  are aware of that, or not. Having worked with graffiti art for a period of  time in Boston, can you talk about how those experiences have affected  or changed the evolution of your personal painting style at that time,  how you feel if it needed to happen for a certain reason, or what your  thoughts are on that?  Fields It definitely affected my work. It   s like, things happen for reasons, I feel  like. I don   t know what my work would look like if it didn   t, but it  definitely has a powerful, big impact on it. There   s no going back. It   s  like you   re infected with it or something. It   s going to carry with you.  You can   t shake it. It definitely changed my work. Movement, there  was a lot more movement, linear, more breakups and collage-y looking,  almost looking futuristic, if you like a futurist painting. It   s how cubists,  futuristic cubists, in that sense, breakups and forms and graffiti   you   re  kind of figuring out a piece.  What graffiti is, it   s an alphabet. It   s a form. It   s a style of writing that  only is really meant for other graffiti writers to see. It   s like a dialogue  within the group. There   s this hidden texture behind it, and those things  kind of played, but you   ve got to come up with your own style. You  have to be original. Do you want to make your graffiti rock the spot it   s  on, dance? Do you want to make it flex any area? You have to be really  creative and be inventive, which is good. That came into my painting,  too, oil painting, doing something different, but it gave me more of that  confidence to make those really big leaps that a lot of people might  have a hard time doing. It opened the door up to more imagination and  possibilities, even in the studio.  8  Roberts What are your main artistic influences today? I mean, I know we just  talked about graffiti as an influence itself, but, like, if you   re going to  begin a new piece or something like that, what   s your artistic  inspiration? Do you get it from everyday life, from your background,  maybe from everything? What would you say your main artistic  inspiration is?  Fields I think its life, what   s happening. It   s a visual diary for me, but it   s  what   s happening. Sometimes I   ll ponder and think about what   s really  affecting me. How do I feel? Is there something that I really need to  express? Then, I   ll kind of think of that for a while and maybe seek out  some images to use or figure out. It always comes from me, personally,  and it comes from what   s happening around me because it is a visual  diary. If I see something and something just clicks, like,    Oh, man, that  would be a good object to maybe start a whole dialog with because  there   s meaning behind it,    you do some research into things and start  figuring out new information for a new body of work. It   s pretty much  day by day, whatever is happening. If something appears, I   ll take it and  use it. Sometimes you   re just painting for painting, just to move the  brush around and see what can happen. It doesn   t all have to be so  serious for me, but also to keep my hand moving is pretty important. I  feel like by that motion, maybe something will come up for you, and  you   ll see something, like,    Okay, I like this. I   m going to work with  this. I want to figure this out. What is this I   m doing?    Something will  evolve. It   s day by day. I would say for me, what   s going on around me.  Roberts Now this question (I   m sure you   ve heard this) of being labeled a Native  Artist as opposed to just an artist often comes up in discussion with  those involved in the arts that have a Native American background.  How would you describe yourself and why?  Fields I am a Native American. I am an artist. I would describe myself as an  artist, and culturally I understand those things, as well. I   m just an artist  that   s aware of the American Indian art world. I do participate in it. I  also participate in the mainstream art world. Like a Chinese artist is  labeled a Chinese contemporary artist, and African American artist   .  Everyone has their own box, I guess, that we   re put into. I think that   s  always going to stick. I can   t change who I am. I wouldn   t want to. I  guess, in a sense, I   m always going to be called that. If I   m in New  York City where people really aren   t even aware of the American  Indian art world, then that doesn   t really exist for me there. It just  depends where I   m at.  Roberts So do you find that being in New York City is beneficial to your career  based on, kind of, the culture that exists there?  9  Fields I think so, yeah. I don   t walk around with this label on me. I   m just an  artist there. There   s all kinds of people there. It   s a mix. People don   t  even know what I am there. I walk around with this disguise of some  sort. I don   t know. You   re just an artist. People know you as an artist.  You don   t have to play up to a label. That   s what I enjoy about it. Like I  said, you know, I am a part of the American Indian world. When I come  down here or in New Mexico, I try to be all over the place. I try to move  around. I try to go to other countries and paint and meet other artists and  just be worldly, I guess. That   s what art is. You shouldn   t be stuck  somewhere. This is only from my own opinion and for me. That   s for  me only. I think it   s where you   re at, you know. I am a Native  American. I grew up that way, and I will forever be one. I will forever  be an artist, but where I will be an artist at, I don   t know. That is going  to change throughout my life. I   ll be known as Yatika, just an artist,  then I get to New Mexico, Yatika the artist, American Indian painter.  It   s going to change throughout my time.  Roberts I heard the OSU Museum of Art is about to acquire one of your pieces  entitled Renewal. Can you talk a little about the piece and the  connection OSU has to that specific painting? It   s one of a series of  paintings?  Fields It   s one of a series, yeah, out of three, and I painted it to honor the late  painter Harry Fonseca. I really admired his work growing up. Before he  passed away, I was showing in this gallery in Santa Fe: Chiaroscuro  Contemporary Art. They had the group show, the Indian Market group  show. I was a part of it, and so was he. I was really stoked and happy to  be in the same gallery and showing in the same exhibition as him,  although I was in New York and couldn   t make it down that year. I  think the following year, he passed away. I was a little upset and  bummed that I couldn   t meet him, didn   t get a chance to meet him.  Anyways, I really respected his work and wanted to do more with it.  He   s gone, and all his works still exist and is still circulating. A lot of it  is still in the Harry Fonseca estate. I wanted to say something. I wanted  to honor him and paint something that   s based off what he did. He did  these works called the Four Seasons. He did drip painting,  Jackson   Pollock-style, based on the seasons, so many drips to where when you  stand back, it gives that depth effect like you   re looking at a cherry  blossom tree in bloom, in different seasons, and differently at night and  in day and in the fall, utilizing colors and placement to create that  feeling of that season.  I really like that, you know, again going back to nature and whatnot,  using color to create a feeling and depth. I really gravitated toward  10  those. I wanted to use those, and when I was painting them in my studio  in Brooklyn where I lived, there was a cherry blossom in the backyard. I  remember I started them in the winter. There was snow on the ground,  and as the spring happened, I watched the cherry blossoms bloom as  these paintings did, as well. All these things were happening, like,     Okay, this is making sense. I should be painting this.    That   s what  these paintings are based on. Instead of dropping paint and splatter  paint, I actually went in and created the branches first, and then overlaid  the branches with all these blossoms, painting each pretty small  blossom to detail. It was a meticulous job painting it, but it was for  something.  When you   re painting, it   s like a meditation. You   re in the zone, and  you can paint for twelve hours straight just to bring it out. Paint, in that  way, from far back, it looks like it   s dripping paint, too, to create that  feeling, as well, that he had. In the painting The Renewal is kind of a  mixture of those two pieces. There was a cherry blossom, a day, and  then a night one, and then the middle one. The Renewal, which is what  OSU is going to acquire, is like a mix of those two pieces. Also this  drapery, this darkness is shrouded. What is underneath there? I don   t  know. That   s, again, up to the viewer for free association. It   s like I feel  like when there   s a death or something. Something   s draped over a  casket or something.  In our ways, you put a blanket over someone, and they   re buried. It   s  kind of like an end of an era, like when you move or something, you  drape something over it. You leave the house. I don   t know. There is  this   it signifies something. It   s a metaphor but with these really gold  paint emblems of beautiful fabric, too. That   s on there, too, with the  cherry blossoms. There   s still life in there. There   s still life that   s  happening, but it   s like looking beyond that life and knowing it and  what is underneath there. It   s this mysterious painting. That   s what  Renewal is. I had a chance, actually, a couple years back. Eiteljorg  Museum in Indianapolis had an exhibition. They picked that painting,  and it was displayed next to a Harry Fonseca piece.  Roberts How cool   Fields Yeah, it was really cool. The painting that he had was this really neon-pinkish  fade to red and blue. It really worked with that piece. They were  finally, like, together. It was like that painting was meant to happen at  that exhibition. It just all made sense. That   s how Renewal happened.  Roberts I   m sure we   re very honored to receive that. I guess a little off-topic,  can I ask what you   re doing when you   re not creating? What are some  of your other hobbies?  11  Fields Cycling, I love cycling. I   m an avid cyclist. In New York, I was a bike  messenger for five years, so that took a lot of my time up. It   s pretty  dangerous, and the money is not good at all. I enjoy that, riding around  the city. Pretty much, I   m either in the studio, or traveling, or seeing  friends, or going up to Boston and seeing friends. Pretty much all my  time is dedicated to art, creating it or going to talk with people about it.  Yeah, so a lot of it is that, or just walks in the park or something.  Reading. I don   t have a TV or anything. Maybe I   ll watch some films  on the laptop sometimes, but pretty much cycling and painting in the  studio.  Roberts I know you   ve worked with youth in the past, in various locations where  you   ve been. What inspired you to work with youth in your first sense?  Fields How did it happen? The work with youth kind of happened   there was  this thing called Pop Life, Doug Miles through Apache Skateboards  used to put on. He brought me into there. He still works with kids, too,  now. It   s the skateboarding culture. I think that might have been my  first real approach to working with kids and doing little mural  workshops, and having kids work with me. Through that, that led to  more opportunities. People are like,    You   ve worked with kids before.  Would you be interested in doing this?       Yeah.     After growing up a little more and being mature about it, I realized that  it   s important to work with kids. It   s important to talk with them. Every  kid needs that. They   re humans. A lot of time, parents don   t have time  for their kids. I know art isn   t like the biggest subject everyone is  jumping for and whatnot, but it is. I think it   s a good self esteem booster  and confidence booster. It   s good for the brain to think that way and  develop that way. It gives an outlet, an expression. I think the worst  thing people can do is hold things in and let it build up. I like talking  with kids like that and giving them some good counseling, I guess, on  that and talk with them about art and let them explore it and tell them  it   s okay to do it.  I know, like, when the artist came to my school and talked, that really  affected me. If I can do that to a few kids, then my job is done.  Especially in New York, I taught at a couple places that are kind of  rough. The kids enjoy it, you know. It takes them out of the mindset of  where they   re at for the day or whatever, and they can continue that and  practice it, maybe. Yeah, it   s happening. I work with kids, and I really  respect it. I enjoy it because it   s giving back. I think as the artist   s job,  for me, it   s part of my mission, as well as to talk with people and share  what I know.  12  Roberts The Yatika Fields Mural Workshop, which is currently being offered  here at OSU, is definitely an exciting and novel opportunity for many  art and music students. How did your role develop in that capacity?  Fields Well, I know it developed through my understanding of live painting of  murals and by participating in that style of painting in New York. Even  going back to Pop Life with Apache Skateboards, I think that   s where it  really started. There   s music, and then you   re painting to bring a  painting out. I   ve done it probably for the last six years. My knowledge  of it, and understanding, and creating something on the fly in a live  audience and environment, I think that   s how this project came to  fruition. It   s my knowledge and understanding of painting like that.  Being from Oklahoma, I   m sure, the Oklahoma artists, so that   s how  that came to be, I   m pretty sure.  Roberts That   s great. I have some questions about the live painting in general,  but to continue on about the mural workshop here at OSU, in general,  maybe, your ideal for that program, how did you hope to influence OSU  students through the experience?  Fields I wanted to open up that gap between art and keeping it in the studio but  also bringing it out to the public   s eye. Getting the students out in front  of the public eye, there   s a lot of things that OSU has. Sports, it   s a  public thing, so people get to know the students in that way. As artists,  we can do the same thing and be out there and showing what our talents  are, as well, to open up another door to the Oklahoma arts and do  something new, let people see that this exists and this happens.  Especially the connection and collaboration between music and color  and live painting, I wanted to get the students familiar with  collaboration and get to know someone, to bring people together  through it.  I know collaboration isn   t taught. There   s not a class. They don   t teach  that. They don   t teach music and art together. Those are things that you  could actually have classes with. This is just one particular class that  had that. It   s going to allow kids to look at their work maybe a little  differently, and look at the other person   s work differently, and maybe  collaborate more in the future on things, or maybe set up their own live  painting event here in Stillwater, keep things fun and moving. In the  end, I just want them to have fun and explore what they love to do in a  different way, do something and have something and create something  for them that OSU doesn   t offer. In this course, we did and to have a  performance with it. They can take what they got from it and hopefully  use it throughout their life in whatever way they want to with art and  creating.  13  Roberts I think anyone that participated in it or was there watching would attest  to the fact that it was very successful. Would you say that you came  across any challenges during the workshop itself, whether it being  communicating in the beginning from New York, or when you got here  trying to get a cohesive plan together? I   m just giving suggestions     challenges involved?  Fields One of the challenges was definitely being in New York and away from  students. I think whenever you   re working with people in this capacity  and this large of a group, it   s good to be there in front of everyone and  talking. It   s definitely harder over Skype and emails and Facebook. We  made it work, and coming here, it was good to finally get here and talk  with everyone. I   m happy that the panel was already being worked on,  giving students an idea and opportunity to work with the other peers to  get ready and understand the collaboration and who they were working  with early on. That was the big basic part of it.  The other, maybe just finding the right schedules between what other  students had. Scheduling conflicts, I think, was another one, trying to  get everyone together and working more. Then maybe the other would  have been, like, during the performance. The time went by quick, and it  was just getting everyone   it was everyone   s first time to do live  painting. It   s going to be what it wants to be. It   s going to turn out how  it   s going turn out. It was a pretty big event for a first time. When I first  live painted, it wasn   t that big. (Laughter) I had a little leeway. I felt  pretty strong, confident. I knew how these things work out, and then  going working and bringing the pieces out and whatnot.  That   s always a challenge, too, in itself, trying to create a composition  with what everyone did and tighten it up, go back through it. It was so  large, so that might have been it. I feel like we did a good job. I was  really happy with what everyone created, even myself, going through it  and pulling things out and figuring it out. The music students did an  awesome job, as well. I think everyone had a good time. I   m still  thinking about it. Between this mural that I   m doing now and that,  there   s a lot of information that   s circling in my head. I really haven   t  digested any of it, I don   t think. It was really cool.  Roberts Yeah, it was awesome. I had a great time. It was a really amazing  experience. Kind of going back to how you got to where you are today,  how do you describe that technique of live painting? A lot of people  maybe, especially from around here, don   t even know necessarily what  that is. I know   well, I guess start with that. How would you describe  live painting?  14  Fields Live painting is just being up in front of a lot of people or outside in a  park, just like plein air, like landscape painting. Usually, live painting is  at an event or function. There   s music, and there   s a lot of people. It   s a  festive time. People are watching you, so you   re working with a time  limit, and you   re working fast. You   re working with the energy that   s  around you. You   re creating a piece that   s reflecting that. A lot of times,  I know a lot of people that   I paint in a way to where it   s creating. I   m  searching for something. I   m figuring something out. I   m creating  something beautiful and fast, unique in an abstract way. I know in New  York, I   m one of the only painters that really does that. There   s a few.  A lot of people I know paint faces, something everyone can recognize  and know. They   re holding a picture, and then they   re painting from the  picture. I just totally let go and feel it out and have fun. It   s a challenge  more so in that way, utilizing the brush and making it perform its  movement, as well, to the strokes of it, creating your own music, the  elegance with which you paint, and your brush strokes. That   s my live  painting, for me, just building it and building it until it   s done, until it   s  over with. That   s kind of what it is. It   s a dance. You   re live  performing. You   re in front of people. I prefer doing that as opposed to  just standing there painting. I want to give something to the viewer, to  the people.  Roberts I think that   s great. I think part of what   s so interesting and unique  about that is the form of communication that audience is a huge factor.  Your performance of that painting is based on the audience that   s  responding, almost, just their presence there. You kind of want that  captive audience. One thing I had a question is, for example, like the  piece that we just created with OSU, now that it   s going to be installed  in a permanent facility, permanent area, how do you feel   since it was  live painted, do you feel that painting will forever have the memory of  that performance? How do you feel that now audiences will walk by it  in a fixed position rather than the one that took place on Friday? Can  you talk a little bit about (am I making sense)     Fields Yeah.  Roberts    the difference between a captive and a static audience.  Fields I   m glad it   s at the Seretean Center because whatever happens there is  music usually. People are walking out of there from a performance with  the movement still embracing them. These pieces will work really well  right there because these pieces are always going to have that  movement that was created that day. It   s never going to lose that. That   s  how it was created. It has that spontaneity. I think it   s going to always  carry that. It   s good that it   s in the Seretean Center because a lot of  15  performances have happened there. There   s music that still resonates in  there somewhere, and it   s going to echo off those pieces. It kind of  gives the Seretean Center a little more vibrant sound, I guess, when  there   s nothing playing on stage. I think it   s good that it   s there. It   ll  carry that. It   ll do what it needs to do on its own, I think. Those panels  are alive.  Roberts When was your first experience live painting?  Fields Probably a long time ago that I can   t remember it. Graffiti is a live  painting, just at night, live painting on a wall, fast, (Laughter) not  wanting to be seen, or be seen. That was my first experience with live  painting on an illegal note. In front of an audience would be probably  like in 2003, yeah, 2003, 2002, I think. That way there   s music and  people are watching. You   re creating toward the music. Yeah, that was  2002, I   d say. I   ve done them all over the place, all over the United  States. We   ve been to art battles. We went to Spain. That was really  fun. That was a really big stage, like, thousands of people one night. It  was weird because you   re painting to be seen and make strokes. There  was like an announcer speaker, like WWF in live painting. (Laughter)  It   s like the biggest stage for it, I guess.  It   s pretty unique and fantastic. I would   ve never thought being a  painter would take you there, I guess, to be, like, on a stage in a big  arena like a superstar or something, like,    Yeah, vote for me     It was  weird. I   m a studio painter, too, so I try to do that but then I do my live  painting, too. I don   t want to do my live painting way too much to  where it overpowers and takes away from the beauty of me just resting  in the studio and painting and figuring something out but not trying to  rush it because I understand live painting so much, you know. Just  know your limit, I guess, because I feel like it can be hurtful, maybe, if  you only do that. I know a lot of artists that do a lot of live painting to  where that is their thing. That   s what they do. That   s how they make  money. They   re live painters.  Roberts You   re just an artist that does   you paint, and it happens to be live  painting. How would you     Fields And studio. I think this is important. This coming down here and doing  this was important. It   s working with students. It   s not just about me.  It   s not just about me, live painting in front of an audience. It   s about  discussing it, talking about what   s happening here, opening up another  dialog with Oklahoma State in painting and the arts, so this is great.  This is more than just me and live painting.  16  Then, also, working the mural, too, I   m having a lot of time to sit there  and really work with that. That   s like a studio piece to me. I think as far  as me live painting, I don   t seek it out, like, every week. If there   s  something big that I feel like I want to do, or if I get invited to paint  here and I feel like it   s in my best interest to do so, I   ll do it. I don   t  want to go out every week. You can in New York. You can do that.  You probably will sell your piece that night, too. People see that and,     I   d love to buy that piece.    It   s not about that for me, just to create and  sell. I want to keep something wholesome with myself and painting in  the studio, and then go out and live paint and really work something  else out. If that makes sense, I don   t know. I   m very opinionated and  personalized with my own art, and I want to keep it for the wholesome  and beautiful thing and not throw it to the wind sometimes.  Roberts Definitely makes sense. I think that   s great. You   ve mentioned this other  mural a few times, just so we can get some more information on that.  You were commissioned to paint the mural, which will be opposite the  original mural inside the postal plaza, the new OSU Museum of Art.  Can you talk about how you   re approaching that task, when you were  first   you know, the research and inspiration, if you were given any  limitations, that kind of thing?  Fields I wasn   t given any limitations.  Roberts Awesome.  Fields I don   t know if that   s a bad or good thing. The piece, I know, we  discussed abstractions. We would prefer it to be abstract. I think we will  have no problem. (Laughter) The other painting on the other side is by  Grace  Lysinger  Hamilton. It was done in 1963, and it   s really a look  into Oklahoma at that time, maybe romanticized a bit. There   s plains,  there   s Native Americans in tipis, so it   s really not about Payne County,  I think. There is Old Central, the old library here that   s right there, I  think is what it   s called. That   s in the middle of the piece, so I guess  that   s Payne County, and the rest is Oklahoma in general. There   s cattle  and oilmen and homesteaders, and cowboys on horses. It   s a landscape.  There   s a blue sky at the top.  The piece I   m doing   when I do murals, I don   t prefer to paint figures  just because that would be eliminating a lot of Oklahoma. That would  be not discussing whoever is here right now, only key figures, and  that   s not what Oklahoma is. It   s the togetherness. It   s everyone, and  also buildings or whatever. I   m painting the new Stillwater, but it   s only  through the essence that I know growing up which is the colors of  sunsets, the color of that lushness that I talked about growing up in  Oklahoma, in northeastern Oklahoma, lower Ozarks, the flow of water.  17  What   s underneath us? Red dirt. The colors of the sky can be very blue,  a lot of really amazing clouds. Dark colors for night where you can see  the stars. Very bright colors, vibrant colors kind of like as you progress.  I think in modern times, colors are being used more often than they  were in 1963. There   s going to be elements I love using, since it is  Oklahoma. I   m not painting directly, like, a flycatcher, but little pieces I  put in there. The state  inaudible , what is a state and that bird? There  will be little rosebuds scattered around in there, as well. I want to do  gold in there, just the richness of the people. We   ve come a long way to  form something unique in Stillwater, as well. That   s that richness I want  to implant in there to celebrate everyone and not just a singular person,  even the tribes, everyone, Native Americans. It   s purely an essence  piece. It   s purely based on my feelings and what I   ve seen growing up  here through forms and movement and color, creating Oklahoma and  Payne County, but Oklahoma in general. I think that   s what that piece is  going to be.  Roberts Finally, if you were to look back and think about, I don   t know,  everything, just your childhood, everything, how you   ve grown up in  high school, (I know you had a lot of influences, and it   s really when  you started exploring art and researching and everything) then your  career today, do you think if you could have ever dreamt about how  your career would have evolved, do you think it was predictable, or do  you feel every day you live is a new adventure or something that   s not  one of those two options? How do you feel?  Fields I feel like every day is a new adventure. It   s a new path. You choose  your own roads. You make your own decisions, and they   re going to  put you somewhere. Good or bad, I   m thankful, for the most part.  They   ve been good decisions. I feel humbled to where I am. I feel  lucky. At the same time, I want to respect that and be healthy with it  and give back to that, work hard to keep it going. Life is challenging.  To be an artist is a challenge, as well. I feel blessed and happy and  thankful that whatever has happened in my work can be celebrated,  shared, and seen.  I   m pretty happy about it, and ecstatic. I think about it, but I   m going to  keep it going. There   s things to say. I want to be humble about it. I want  to let people know this isn   t just about showing and being stingy with  art and money or whatever, but it   s about sharing. If I can get where I   m  at now, then I   m definitely going to be giving back. It   s like, almost,  karma or something. I do believe in that. I want to keep it going. I feel  like, through me, working with students, too, is a good way to keep my  work going and teaching and letting it exist.  18  Roberts Do you have anything else you   d like to add that I haven   t covered with  a question, or something that you really feel is important to you, or  anything that you   d like to say?  Fields I   m just happy to be here working with students, and be at Oklahoma  State University, and be back in Oklahoma and Stillwater and creating  this mural here, and to have been part of this awesome project with  students in the music department, and to be able to share my work  through that. I   m happy that this could happen for the future of  Oklahoma State and the arts, too, the new museum they   re building so  the general public can see all the amazing works that   s in the collection  and understand the art here a little bit more. That is pretty much it, I  think.  Roberts Great. Well, thank you so much. It was a pleasure interviewing you.  Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.  Fields Thank you. I appreciate it, too.  -------  -------
