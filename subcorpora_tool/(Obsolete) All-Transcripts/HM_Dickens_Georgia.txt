Speaker 2: I don't really know, but she died about four years ago at ninety-nine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so.
Speaker 2: And she was born in West Point, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Yeah we're roughly 1900 I guess, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe.
Speaker 1: Nineteen hundred [1900], okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In West Point, Georgia, right?
Speaker 2: West Point, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family about the ancestors on that side?  How far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: I can back as far her grandmother.  And my, my grandmother her mother, Nelle Bryant was also born I think in West Point, Georgia.  I don't know exactly when they moved here, but then my great-grandmother I was named for her too the Georgia.  Now I don't really know where she was but it was my mother's grandmother.  But her name was Georgia Smart [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you suspect that she was from Georgia too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In that area of West Point.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories passed down from that side of family about what they were doing you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother, my grandmother's mother, I guess at that time possibly did some work maybe working in the homes you know for some people.  Other than that my grandmother the work that she did, she worked for the Regenstein's [Atlanta, Georgia] here and then the Haverty furniture stores [Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and are there any stories from, do they tell any stories about the end of slavery or Reconstruction, or any of that?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother who is Georgia Smart was twelve years old when the slaves were freed.  I didn't hear my grandmother talk too much about that era and my mother didn't either.  But when my great-grandmother would babysit us sometimes she would give us some stories about apparently it sounded to me like she was rather privileged at the time with them.  And she came to Atlanta [Georgia] to live with my grandmother her ma- her daughter because she was ill.  And she would often refer to the fact that it was not difficult as far as she was concerned.
Speaker 1: So she did domestic work you said--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or house work? And you suspect she was probably doing the same thing during slavery I mean or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she was twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, when they were freed.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother Georgia Smart, my grandmother said absolutely nothing much about that's the one, my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Did they have, have any other family stories they passed down, about?
Speaker 2: Not, not too many other than my grandmother always reminded us of how well, her mother that I told you was freed from slavery at twelve, took care of her and nurtured her regardless of what her chores were.  And therefore she did the same for us.  And I'm the oldest of four.  And my grandmother just brought it on she nurtured us, 'cause that's why we were staying with her while my father was looking for a church.  And this the time I spent with her at this home on--you know I told you about earlier.  But that had stories like--as I said when I was born, the Haverty's gave me this French provincial you know.  But they came here doing, well the great-grandmother came here doing the domestic work for while.  But my great-grandmother did not after coming here.  I don't know what year my grandfather [Henry Bryant] bought this, built this home, but she didn't work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandmother didn't work, you said?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother did this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290745
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Stella Bryant Smith] talk about growing up in any, did she tell what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother always said that her father [Henry Bryant] and her mother [Nelle Bryant] always provided most adequately for her and for her sister and it was just the two girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were not overwhelmed at all that they were in this gorgeous thirteen room house.  That he built when I was born, had built in 1920, it was just the norm for them.  I don't think they had too much to know about slavery time.
Speaker 1: So, they, they were doing fairly well, yep?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Your mother went to, she eventually went to school right?
Speaker 2: Spelman Normal [Spelman Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta Georgia].
Speaker 1: Spelman right?  Okay so she went to normal school that means that she?
Speaker 2: That was normal, Spelman was yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause as I said I was born in 1920 and I've forgotten, I, I can't remember what, what how old she was when I was born.  But she was like in her early twenties I would assume.  She and my father [Harvey Miles Smith] went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], he went to Morehouse with Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and that was his era and mine I guess.  And so they married, as soon as they were out normal again and--
Speaker 1: That's like teachers training right, that's a teachers training school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just two years see Spelman was normal before Spelman College two years.  That's what they were--they could teach after having been two years.
Story_ID: 290746
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Harvey, H-A-R-V-E-Y, Miles, M-I-L-E-S, Smith.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Really I don't really know, and that's a shame.  Now it's somewhere here in the records and if not there's a thesis they did on my family at one point.  It's over there I can get the accurate account.  But I just can't remember to save my soul.  He passed at fifty-five and I think don't, don't let me be too accurate.  But we had his funeral at Ebenezer [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], Daddy King's [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] church.  But he was fifty-five when he passed and I guess this was in let me just roughly say the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: So it's possible he was born around 1890 maybe or in the 1890s?
Speaker 2: Could have been if I was nineteen, twenty.
Speaker 1: Okay and now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well I had his mother Lizzie Smith and her mother oh I called her she was Katie [ph.] I can't think of her last name now.  But she was my great-grandmother.  And when we were living in Charlotte [North Carolina], with my father was pastoring in Charlotte, my great-grandmother on his side would always babysit with the babies.  They were all very, very--by the same token my father's father [Henry M. Smith] was also a minister.  They in Crawford, Georgia had a lovely big two story house.  And so I can remember my grandmother going over to Ms. Mendel's [ph.], who was white and maybe doing a few things over there.  But she didn't work 'cause my grandpapa had this church up on the hills they owned acres and acres.  And they had this huge two story house also.  And I just don't remember them doing anything.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination was your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, my grandfather was Baptist and my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, was your father a minister too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry I missed that, alright.
Speaker 2: He was, when he had a stroke, we were in Albany, Georgia last.  He had this stroke and he came here.  And he was also co-pastor with, sat at the pulpit let me say--no co-don't, don't say no co-pastor--but he sat until his death with Maynard Jackson's father [Maynard Jackson, Sr.], 'cause they were classmates.  But he couldn't talk so he would just go up and sit with them as a visiting minister.  But they buried him from Ebenezer, Daddy King's church.
Speaker 1: Okay now are there any stories from that side of the family.  About, about life in Georgia in the 19th century or in the turn of the century?  Or in that part of Georgia what was going on you know with?
Speaker 2: The one thing about when we were there visiting and then we would go stay with them in the summer.  My grandpapa had a buggy that looked which was a Cadillac like, like in that day.  But I said he had all this land but there was no difference in anybody there that we knew of.  Because all of them my grandmother, she was here and the other lady who was a dearest white friend of hers.  My brother played with her son and we played with you know the children.  And the same thing here at Haverty's [Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] with the Haverty children.  But I didn't know too much about anything that and all I knew was that they were doing okay you know.  Because really to tell you the truth at that time my father used to come down to visit.  And I could hear all over the whole thing, he was in there playing a big baby grand piano.  You know at that time so I think we're just sort of privileged or blessed for even that era.
Speaker 1: Yeah in that era you hear so many stories about the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] or other white groups taking (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father in Charlotte now when he was pastoring, that he had some problems with the Klan.  Because he was you know how Morehouse men are, you know full of this.  And Daddy King sort of referred to that often when they were together, and so he left that, left Charlotte for that reason.  And began to look for churches you know, in this area.  And he did eventually pastor Union Baptist [Church, Atlanta, Georgia], the old Union Baptist that's up here on Hamilton E. Holmes [sic.] now.  He was one of those former ministers.
Story_ID: 290747
Speaker 1: So you say your father [Harvey Miles Smith] was, he, he attended Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] when Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] was there, and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Yes, they were friends from the same area.  See Daddy King was from that area West Point [Georgia] and Athens [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh they were friends when they came here.
Speaker 1: All right and so they, they was your father he, he was probably a member of the National Baptist Convention and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, he, he 'cause he sang a little bit, his, his now era Reverend Baldus [ph.] as well and Daddy King and that was his era and his age group.  And he, my father I think at one time might have been chairman of the Baptist, 'cause know he had a choirs or whatever you call it.  He was very active with one of the organizations which was I think was, oh what did you call it National Baptist I don't know.  I don't want to say Sunday school but it's been so long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Training Union.
Speaker 2: --but it was similar.
Speaker 1: Okay, wasn't the National Baptist Training Union was it?
Speaker 2: I, I wouldn't want to say accurately because you know, there are persons 'cause one of 'em just died Esther [ph.].  But there are so many people who actually remember and know it and I'm sort of guessing when it comes to dates.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But I know he was over them.
Story_ID: 290748
Speaker 1: What were your parents' [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Miles Smith] personalities like, what do, what do they?
Speaker 2: Oh my gracious my father was truly a fun person, liked to joke.  And just on the cheer you know on the cheerleader's thing at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], in the band you know things like that.  But did like to talk and definitely I think rather people person.  Mother was a little more sophisticated and a little charming, very charming.  They were very, I considered very liberal.  Because, but, but they, we had rules, strict rules and regulations that we to following being preacher's children.  But I, I admired him so and my mother too.  And they both were just marvelous parents.  And I think my father--but he died very early.  He'd gotten a church down in Albany [Georgia], the same church that's historical down there now for the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] thing.  Mount Zion Baptist Church [Albany, Georgia] and he retired from that with a stroke and an aneurism.  It was so hot down there.  So we moved back here in '45 [1945].  And I've forgotten the year he passed, but like I said it wasn't too long.  'Cause he came here not being able to speak.  So he went to Tuskegee [Alabama] to stay awhile and he died there.  And then he whatever the year was and I, I was about to say it was in that drawer.  But I don't think I can remember, but he did come from Albany, Georgia, pastoring back.  And that church is on the historical thing for the King movement.  Mount Zion Baptist it was the first Baptist church in Albany.  Mother worked at Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia].  With you know the Her-, not Mr. [Alonzo] Herndon mother did remember at a, but at a point.  But he was not living when she retired.  And we've been here ever since back home.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who do you think you take after your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: My father, I'm not nearly as sophisticated as my mother.  Now my mother said, to show you, she said when my father would start his sermon I'd be sitting with her.  But I'd get up and go jump in his seat, you know.  What you know and sit there until he finished, and when he finished preaching--
Speaker 1: In the, in the pulpit?
Speaker 2: In the pulpit, five years old.  And she said one day I decided in Charlotte [North Carolina]--he pastored in Charlotte.  And I decided to come--he would take me to school--and I would decide with a little friend of mine five years old that I would not wait for him, so we didn't.  So we decided we were going to cross the river, the little lake, not a lake, the little stream.  So there was this huge tree that had fallen.  And I would, I decided I was gonna walk over the tree and fell in the stream.  I'm kind of you know like I think I know what I want to do and I do sometimes take over and take charge.  But that's the way he was.  So I was so hyper and not knowing anything about hyperness--my father called me Popcorn.  'Cause I was always doing this up and down.  And that's what he called but, I, I'm so much like him.  Now I don't favor him, I think I'm a combination between the two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but I have some of my mother's sophistication.  But really, like I told you, that I tell the girls all the time, I can't be made nervous.  You know that's my favorite saying from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] too.  They know exactly what that means.  But I, I too I think.
Story_ID: 290749
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two brothers, one is still, okay I'm the oldest, I have a brother the one you saw, he saw next door, he is two years, two years difference in all of us.  He is Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith] and he is Bryant, you seen that name up there before, Smith.  Name for my daddy [Harvey Miles Smith] and his middle name is for my mother's [Stella Bryant Smith] maiden name and Smith.  Now my bro- older brother finished Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] then he's a dentist.  Retired dentist and of course all the other things that go along with.  And a dear, dear brother, I'm two years older.  I have another brother [Dr. Calvin Miles Smith] that was a dentist, he passed about ten, eight years ago, younger but he dead.  And he has, that's the one with the bio-statistics that's his granddaughter.  And we all settled here and I have a sister [Stella Lewis] who's right around the corner.  She works for the Atlanta public school system [Atlanta Public Schools].  She was over a federal government project, Follow Through [Project Follow Through].  So there were four of us two girls and two boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 290750
Speaker 1: Do you have a earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my earliest childhood memory actually I think more centers more around when I was with my father [Harvey Miles Smith] and in kindergarten in Charlotte, North Carolina.  And I could remember I was always with him I preferred just going everywhere with him all time whatever he did.  So, if he was going to a prayer meeting whatever he was doing I was with him.  By that time my mother [Stella Bryant Smith] had this my, my brother [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith].  And so that's when this great-grandmother from Crawford, Georgia would come and stay.  And my earliest memory is crossing that water with that tree, over that tree, it was frightening.  But I realized though that my father and, and the nicest way that a father would do, really sat and told me how dangerous that was.  And, and the thing how important it is not to take upon myself to do some things without letting them know or consulting.  After then we came back here [Atlanta, Georgia] and was living all of this time now again (background noise).
Story_ID: 290751
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells, I used to always go with my [maternal] grandfather [Henry Bryant] out to his farm right here on Martin Luther King [Jr. Drive].  And the sound it was a stream.  And that water, I, I don't, I used to see this water in Crawford [Georgia], with my great-grandmother and grandmother [Lizzie Smith] my father's [Harvey Miles Smith] side.  And I'd go sit down at these waterfalls and just sit and play with the stone which you can see I like already still rather.  But that sight I means the sights that I love would just look at the fee, the surroundings all the time.  'Cause always with a lot with a lot of land.  Didn't like heights, didn't like water, but like to look at it.  Uh-huh and I was always with a lot of trees and things.
Speaker 1: What about smells?
Speaker 2: Smells I kind of liked the leafy, the woodsy and things.  I, I think that's really why I like earth tones so much.  'Cause I was always outdoors that's all I could do, stay outdoors most of the time.  And I used to see the moles in Crawford, Georgia, just running through the front yard.  'Cause you know long then you'd have to sweep with a brush broom and you wouldn't have any grass, was not too popular then.  And the moles would just move and move and move and I'd be in from Atlanta [Georgia], down there in Crawford with them.  I would take the broom and try to hit whatever this is, that's moving (laughter).  Poor moles I, I just felt sorry 'em once I found out, what they, what they were.  But I like, I like earth, earth tones, even in dress and I do.
Story_ID: 290752
Speaker 1: Describe the neighborhood you were raised in?
Speaker 2: Raised?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was raised on as I said Benjamin E. Brawley [sic. James P. Brawley Drive] now and Benjamin almost at the corner of Benjamin E. Brawley and Beckwith Street most of my life.  And that was all of the AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] people.  All my neighbors, all the people around me as far up there where the [Rufus E.] Clement's house.  The house is president AU house is now, but it was not all always there.  Because President [John] Hope as I told you stayed with my [maternal] grandmother [Nelle Bryant] and us until they built that house.  But I would always say I was in even in Crawford [Georgia] with the preacher what I thought were lovely neighborhoods and lovely people.  I think privileged a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A little bit, with education you know.
Story_ID: 290753
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe yourself?  Now you've, you've described yourself on, on some level to us as, as kind of a bouncy little girl always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, still bouncy.
Speaker 1: --Your father [Harvey Miles Smith] called you Popcorn (laughter) so.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, still hyper, they all call me, all the girls say don't know how in the world I'm gonna be like you when I get your age.  Because I am still maybe you would call it hyper, but it's my natural thing.  Uh-huh I'm just bouncing and as they say doing the electric slide.  Dancing I danced most all of my life.  I dance you know when the people came to England to help us, to look over there over there on Hamilton [E.] Holmes [Drive] I mean on Benjamin E. Brawley [sic. James P. Brawley Drive].  I would go to that, my brother and them would go to arts and crafts and then I went to dancing from six year old up through.  Then I would swim, through elementary school, then high school [Madison High School; Monroe High School, Albany, Georgia].  Then I came Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I dance and I'm still dancing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Always.
Speaker 1: So is, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I sa- I played the piano a bit, by ear being (unclear) and then I dan-, I danced.  I was in drama at Spelman and I danced and I was in the glee club and the choir four years.  Kemper Harreld and Willis Laurence James were my glee teachers.  So I've been in the arts the only thing I don't do is paint.  Never painted, I love the dancing, I love music and I do have an appreciation for the arts.  But I think I'm just, I would, I would say what you call energetic person, active I think that's a common word for it.
Story_ID: 290754
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to grade school?  What was the name of your grade school? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grade school?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Went to two schools I went to E.R. Carter Elementary [School, Atlanta, Georgia] and it was Chadwick [School] on Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus, C-H-A-D-W-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started at E.R. Carter.
Speaker 2: Carter.
Speaker 1: Elementary School and, and you, you lived over by the campus, right, Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, all the time--
Story_ID: 290755
Speaker 1: You said I think, I read or I read somewhere that one of your relatives built some of the buildings over there or, or.
Speaker 2: No, my father [Harvey Miles Smith]--well my [maternal] grandfather [Henry Bryant] and may have.  But I know he built some of the homes that are the same older style that you would find you know in the nineteen, what is it '20s [1920s] or before?  And I don't remember that and it might have been but, but you know as you said now I'm eighty-four so my memory's a little off a bit too.  But he was a builder with two of them Bob Wilson [ph.], old man Bob Wilson and the two of them.  And they built certain styles.  And you could see them, when if I could show you some of the older ones you know.  Most of 'em two stories with balconies, sleeping porch, stained glass, hardwood floors, everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think before we started you were talking about some of your neighbors--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there you know. Can you tell us you know, you know on tape now?
Speaker 2: Well, on Chestnut Street where the Whitakers [ph.] and the Wallaces [ph.] and Ms. [L.D.] Shivery, [W.E.B.] Du Bois friend.  And who else was along then, the, the Shorters [Alfred Shorter and Martha Baldwin Shorter] they had he, he had a business on Albany Avenue [sic. Albany Drive].  And his wife was a Metropolitan [Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] nurse.  And most of the people even they were homeowners, owned that all the way down to Martin Luther King [Jr. Drive] from Greenferry [Avenue] up there at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] all the way down, in the neighborhood.  And then most of them were professors that stayed on Beckwith [Street], places like that.  So we, that's, that's the neighborhood I was in with the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] professors and others who ma- may have taught school, mostly professional.  Uh-huh, all the way down on Beckwith even 'cause see up at the end of Beckwith you have the president's house.  And you know AU's building all those dorms there now.  But then the Dr. Yancey's [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.] family was right in front of Dr., oh who went into that house at first, [Dr. John] Hope.  Then after Hope was [Rufus E.] Clement and Dr. Clement lived right in front of them.  But that, that's the only way I can visualize or express what it was like.
Story_ID: 290756
Speaker 1: Now you were talking about the Whitakers [ph.], the Wallaces [ph.], the Shorters [Alfred Shorter and Martha Baldwin Shorter] or Shivers [sic. Shivery]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Greenwoods [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay Greenwoods, [Dr.] John Hope's family.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, now if you mean my full life, I think, I thought you said early childhood.
Speaker 1: Well early, in early childhood yeah.
Speaker 2: Early yeah, they were there.  See the, see when I when my [maternal] grandfather [Henry Bryant] built that house if I was born in '20 [1920].  I would assume he was there four or five years the way the house seemed to be to me when I kind of was early.  So those were the neighbors that were in that neighborhood that I could remember.  Oh the Allens [ph.] they were right around corner on Beckwith [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay and the Allens.
Speaker 2: And yeah Allens and Willis Laurence James lived closer to Martin Luther King [Jr. Drive].
Story_ID: 290757
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about some of your neighbors?  Some of these are pretty famous people, [Dr.] John Hope and [W.E.B.] Du Bois?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were very lovely people and the Shorters [Alfred Shorter and Martha Baldwin Shorter], Dr. Sh- Shorter had to two sons, one was a, both of them would were doctors eventually.  And I never shall forget being invited to a costume birthday party for one of the fellows.  And we were neighbor across the street.  I was older than he, but he was younger.  So my [maternal] grandmother [Nelle Bryant] had brought me this gorgeous clown suit.  Well they had a prize for the best looking suit.  I won it, but the honorary pitched such a fit I couldn't get the prize, yes he did even then.  So he grew up to be one of our finest doctors, but he committed suicide.  And his brother just passed not so long ago.  But the neighborhood we were all very close, everybody looked out for everybody else in the neighborhood, Greenferry [Avenue] down to Martin Luther King [Jr. Drive].  That's just how we, we knew every, everybody, everybody right around the corner on Beckwith [Street] the Allens [ph.].  Now I never shall forget when my son [Robert D. Dickens, Jr.] was a baby and he was just walking about two.  I went around to the Allens' on the corner.  He was real estate and a lawyer an attorney.  So his wife was always sitting the porch reading books swinging swinging.  They had a big old two story house.  We go upstairs to sit up and just play cards.  My son we thought the mother was babysitting, she was reading.  Next thing I know she was hollering up, "Come get Bobby.  He over in the fish pond," fallen in the fish, (laughter).  So we had all kinds of stories to tell, but they were all lovely and they were all like family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of 'em now like I told you when Ms. [L.D.] Shivery was down, she was our literary person.  She even kept her books in her bathtub, she read so many.  A bath tub I'll say, I don't say now the one she used.  But we always used to laugh about it because she was so literary.  But she was a widow at the time too, that Du Bois lived with her right on the corner of Beckwith and Chestnut [Street].
Speaker 1: Her name is Shivlery?
Speaker 2: Shivery, S-H-I-V-E-R-Y, Shivery.
Speaker 1: Shivery, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but it was a wonderful neighborhood to grow up in.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Dr. Du Bois?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your impressions of him?
Speaker 2: Like he was a very quiet person.  And all we knew just like the others that were went up and down the street, we knew him by name.  So the most I possibly had a conversation sitting on the front porch as he would pass.  "How are you Dr. Du Bois?"  It's just like the others that Dr. Willis Laurence James.  Dr. James I mean lived down closer to Martin Luther King.  So he would have to pass my house every day to walk up to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], you see.  And I Kemper Harreld, Dr. Harreld I don't know where he, I do know but I don't know his wife, his daughter [Josephine Harreld Love] just died and left an awful lot to Spelman College, she's a painter.  But it was a marvelous neighborhood and the neighbors were just like family.
Speaker 1: Do you remember Will Marian [Mercer] Cook, Will Marian Cook or [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook?
Speaker 2: Mercer Cook, but (unclear) Mercer Cook taught me French.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, at school, at here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was a friend of Billy Jeeders [ph.] at Spelman, she taught, you know.  But Mercer Cook was at, at Spelman if I'm remembering correctly and taught me French.
Story_ID: 290758
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Dr. Benjamin Mays?
Speaker 2: Well now Dr. Mays I didn't remember so, so much, when I was much younger, because we had gone to Albany [Georgia] before coming back here.  But Dr. Mays' first wife [Ellen Harvin Mays] he and his first wife, lived at my [maternal] grandmother's [Nelle Bryant], until they got some place available for them to stay.  But I'm thinking this had to be at a time when she, when he was really early Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] president.  He never stayed, well naturally Morehouse didn't get this, their home Dr. Massey's [HistoryMaker Walter E. Massey] in until late.  And so, [Rufus E.] Clement had AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] had the president's home before Morehouse did.  And you know Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] I think was the first that had a president's cottage you know 'cause we were founded in 1881.  But then I don't think, well when I got there Reynolds Cottage was there, which you know is all time from 1881.  But Dr. Mays I do remember from the interacting, from Spelman and Morehouse.  And close enough and involved with them to know when he was president, when he was also president of our Atlanta Board of Education.  Which I was starting out with, he was one of the best and of course Dr. Clement was too.  But Dr. Mays even those things he's telling those Morehouse men, the Spelman girls would just revere.  And we revered him I think more than any president we really known. Benjamin E. Mays.  Now Hubert--Dr. [Charles D.] Hubert was president during the time I think my father [Harvey Miles Smith] knows of that and he was an older one that we were so very fond of too.  But Dr. Mays was someone that we cherished the memory right now, about like [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Right, he's a you know right everybody I talk speaks about him like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just about like Martin Luther King.  But I don't remember being in that house when they were there.  'Cause Dr. Kalsum [ph.] the one, from a, taught religious, now he they he lived a long time while I did and helped me with quite a few of the problems that the dean didn't understand that I was doing.  And he would write the letters for me, when she decided she wanted to send me home for talking in the library.  And you know talking the library, see they were trying to get that library (unclear).  But back to, to your question I think Dr. Neighbored, I mean Dr. Mays was one we'll always revere.  But now I knew Mrs. Mays, the second wife [Sadie Gray Mays] better. Because she too was very active in the community, and appointed my younger brother as chairman over her board over the Sadie G. Mays Nursing Home [Sadie G. Mays Health and Rehabilitation Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was the younger one that passed Ralph and Benny Hills [ph.] father, was seventeen years when she was living, chairman of that board, Sadie G. Mays Nursing Home, but she appointed him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they were just a lovely, a lovely couple now that's his second wife, Dr. Mays' second wife.
Speaker 1: Okay so it was quite a neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 290759
Speaker 1: How did you like school, you went to E.R. Carter [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] first?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was that like, what was E.R. Carter?
Speaker 2: That was a part of Atlanta Public School[s], nice.  Don't remember too much about it except the principal was a friend of my mother's [Stella Bryant Smith] and very nice she had a niece and we grew up kind of you know being very close.  And then but Chadwick [School, Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] was lovely I never shall forget the day they declared depression [Great Depression] we were out on the campus playing.  Now it had originally been a school for the orphanage this, white lady Ms. [Amy] Chadwick, so it was Chadwick Orphan Home [sic. Leonard Street Orphans' Home; Families First, Atlanta, Georgia].  But being on Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus they must have the gotten that home and got what you might call nursery and early elementary school there.  And that's why it was just Chadwick I've got some pictures of that.  One of my friend's artist did that she was here for the leadership program my niece has and shows Chadwick and so it's all a part of Spelman's campus and it is now.  But this lady I think she came from England and established this early nursery, nursery school and early childhood on the campus for us.  Now what's happening in 1933 my father [Harvey Miles Smith] found this church [Mount Zion Baptist Church] that he wanted, I told it was in Albany [Georgia].  So from '33 [1933] to '45 [1945] that's a period where I was not on Chestnut Street, you see.  But you've gotten me through that period now you have 'cause see I went to high school in Albany and came back to Spelman in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when were in school did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: English, all the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the way.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I had an English teacher from England, Ms. Neptune in college.
Speaker 1: Neptune just like the god of the sea (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Neptune, N-E-P-T-U-N-E, Neptune, she looked out for me and she was adorable.  And I also liked Ms. Warwick, Warwick and I think is W-A-R-W-I-C-K, Warwick as my dance teacher.  And of course Kemper Harreld and Willis Laurence James were the chorus and glee club.  In elementary school oh I know there was a French teacher here Ms. Susie Cunningham that I kind of liked my freshman year in high school but then I left there and went to Albany, in '33 [1933].
Speaker 1: Okay so, went to, went to grade school here and?
Speaker 2: High school in Albany, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was Madison High School [Monroe High School] in Albany, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, Madison High (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What's that (unclear) lady used to run track, she was from here can't think of her name [Alice Coachman], she finished that school?
Speaker 1: Wilma Rudolph [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but that was right across from the parsonage.  And then there's another story about getting you up to Spelman, that's I was really almost salutatory [salutatorian] and was salutatory in my high school class.  And of course we finished in the eleventh grade, well at the time I was fifteen years old.  So, they couldn't let me come to Spelman at fifteen I had to wait a year, so I came to Spelman in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you graduated from Madison in, in nineteen--
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight [1938].
Speaker 1: No you graduated in (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, 'cause I went to over Georgia Normal [and Agricultural College, Albany, Georgia] what they call Albany State [Albany State University, Albany, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Georgia Normal then.  And Mr. Ho- well President Holley, was I think he was J.W. Holley [Joseph Winthrop Holley].  But anyway he was president then but, don't put, don't I'm going back to back too far now to put names, initials I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know his name was Holley, President Holley.
Story_ID: 290760
Speaker 1: So you were able to start Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '38 [1938].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now you alluded to maybe having some trouble at school because you're, you're kind of active?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, well yeah, one time we were all sitting in the library I was truly sitting on the sofa with my husband to be [Robert D. Dickens] and reading a newspaper.  And of course evidently Ms. [Charlotte] Templeton thought that was completely out of order.  I wasn't doing anything but talking we were chatting but reading the paper together.  So she sent my name to the Dean, Dean [Jane Hope] Lyons, well I told Dean Lyons said--ooh well gracious they were trying to get the AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] Library at the time.  So then she said okay I'm just gonna let you go down with your [maternal] grandmother [Nelle Bryant], while which was right down the block down the street.  Dr. Kelsey [ph.] was living with her then, so what did he do?  He wrote the note evidently saying how thought, how ridiculous he thought it was.  And so consequently I didn't have to go Albany [Georgia], where my mother [Stella Bryant Smith] (unclear) were at the time.  So I always give him credit for my not getting sent home from the campus.  But nothing other than that, no more than as you know, I was always into something talking.  And as my thing from Spelman says my senior year, Ms. Personality always, in court holding court.
Speaker 1: Always holding court.
Speaker 2: Holding court (laughter) all the time.
Speaker 1: Would you, would you hold court about the issue of the day or?
Speaker 2: Yep, holding court about anything.
Speaker 1: Anything?
Speaker 2: Anything. Always, now kind of giving my opinion about what I thought and most times the girls agreed they just said, "Oh Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens]" that's how I got that name too Gee Gee, on campus.  Well they kind of thought a lot of what I said, and they would always ask right 'til today.  All of my friends said heavenly father you would think I was a therapist, you know.  Older, in between everybody called family calling me what do you think, what do you do, I've gotta do. I, I guess that's just my calling.  Uh-huh, but I'm a people person, I love 'em.
Story_ID: 290761
Speaker 1: What's your organizational history?  Did you start, be, when did you start becoming involved in organizations, 'cause you've been involved in so many?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was with my grandmother [Nelle Bryant], my grandmother was the one, who's my mother's [Stella Bryant Smith] mother.  When I was young she would take me over here where Mrs. Coretta Scott King just moved from before she moved downtown Sunset [Avenue], that was the neighborhood center, health center [Neighborhood Union Health Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  My grandmother would take me, she volunteered and she would take me with her, to go to these places everywhere she went.  And then, and on now her name is on the plaque over there at that neighborhood on Sunset Avenue, where Mrs. King lived.  So I would look at her in the church Warren Memorial [United Methodist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] which is right up there by Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal church.  My father [Harvey Miles Smith] was a Baptist minister but we were not, we he hadn't gotten that church [Mount Zion Baptist Church] in Albany [Georgia] yet.  So my grandmother had us baptized in the Methodist Episcopal.  But when we went with my father, when he really got a church and wasn't hopping from one church to another, we became Baptist until today.  But I got my urge I guess from her, or in the DNA, because she was truly a volunteer person.  And I just and I, and I was close to her being the first.  Now she would always call me, her precious darling.  So therefore that's what I learned first, so I so I called her precious darling.  So my grandmother all the girls that was the cutest thing, I being saying, precious darling, well that was my grandmamma.  And so she sort of nurtured me, you know how they are about first children the other children stayed, so we had four bedrooms' upstairs and bath, so they stayed with my mother and father up there and I stayed with grandmamma all the time, it was like she had adopted me.  My [maternal] grandpapa [Henry Bryant] had a sleeping porch, it was the coldest thing sleeping out there, but I stayed with her.  But I also remember when she would take me, there was a friend who was ill, over there not too far Westview [Atlanta, Georgia] from Morehouse [College, Atlanta Georgia].  And she would take me twice a week to go over there and I would have to help her clean this house and everything.  And then some people the people from England had a rummage where they gathered clothes from.  I would have to go with her to sell those clothes or give 'em to the people who deserved them.  So that's what I did, and I just kept doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started at a early age.  Did, did you organize your peers too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  See now this is another thing I think a lot of people like with this [National] Black Arts Festival.  They will I think maybe some people say I may have leadership skills.  Now they do I can get a group together just about anything, you know, saying Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] says let's do this and so.  So I think that I got from my father.  Now people love be with him and join you know groups and things with him all the time.  What I did I extended mine a little bit more I think more diverse. Because I had this class in elementary school, I taught I told, that I was teaching humanities.  So I integrated in '79 [1979] they allowed children's theatre guild here.
Speaker 1: Now we don't want to get to far now--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: --but, but with this story, but we'll get, we'll get to that, I'm trying, let me, let's try to.  I was just talking about the early history of your organizing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Following my grandmother--
Speaker 1: --getting you, you know, how you got started?
Speaker 2: --following my grandmother.
Story_ID: 290762
Speaker 1: Were you a member of any organizations in college, did you?
Speaker 2: College?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just got through looking at them in that book I was in the glee club, I was in the English club, dance club and whatever they would prescribe.  One of them yeah I think those were the organizations that they had to offer.  And so I was in whichever ones you know that they had to offer on campus.  And it wasn't until after naturally that you being to get into other organization as you say you possibly want to get to later.  But I joined, the a, the average, now you we did not have sororities on campus, so I had to wait until I was an alum to join Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority].
Speaker 1: Oh I didn't know that they, they didn't have a sororities yet on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, later years too.
Speaker 1: --Hadn't they been started?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had them say at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], but they didn't have 'em at?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have 'em at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  See I finished in '42 [1942], they did not have 'em '42 [1942] and I don't believe they had 'em until maybe '50 [1950] something, I don't know how early they got 'em I've haven't even gone into that.  But I had to join a sorority when I after I finished.
Speaker 1: Okay now you majored in education, right?
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: En-, English okay?
Speaker 2: And minored in education.
Story_ID: 290763
Speaker 1: So what were your intentions when you were in school, did you--?
Speaker 2: At the time there was nothing we thought we could do but teach.  So therefore we tried to take it, take whatever we could for teaching.  And then after I got into it though, they didn't have the school social work and they didn't have public relations.  But I really changed before leaving Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and wanted public relations.  I would have had to go to, gone to Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  And at the time first of all, no, no that was after my son [Robert D. Dickens, Jr.] was born, the first thing I wanted was they were beginning to get to talking about school social work here.  Forrester B. Washington was the first president.  So anyway, I just figured I would teach that's what I thought and that's what I did.  Now that I know I possibly could have done one or two other things about as well.  But I enjoyed the forty years I taught.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so when you grad-, were graduating you were, you were intent on becoming a teacher, that was your intention?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, immediately.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, anything else about Spelman, before we leave Spelman?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Nothing okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not, not until I got back, after as a, as an alum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, that, that's then I really got into Spelman.
Speaker 1: Now did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh I didn't like that.  I wanted to do everything I did very naturally.  I did, yeah, I've been president of everything I'm in, but at that time I just, see my baby was young too.  And then see for the first ten years I did go back, they always have somebody come back to for tenth year celebration.  Well the girls called it would you believe ask me would I do the scripture.  When Ms. [Florence M.] Read looked up, that the president at the time, saw me fixing to read the scripture she says, "Oh no, not Georgia Nelle [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens]" (laughter) that's the least she would have thought that I would be doing would be reading the scripture for the convocation, for the first ten years.
Speaker 1: Well your father's [Harvey Miles Smith] a minister.
Speaker 2: And that's why the girls chose, me, but Ms. Read didn't know me as no preacher's daughter.  She knew it but she I was not, there were many other girls who could have read the scripture.  But I guess she said that was not necessarily my forte, but she was really joking, she was, she was really joking.  'Cause see I was into some of everything.
Speaker 1: I see, well when you, well you didn't get into a lot of trouble you just kinda, you were just busy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh my [maternal] grandmamma [Nelle Bryant] and nobody else, if I did I'd be in Siberia today, that's a known fact.  'Cause they didn't, they didn't, they you know to be going there and having to go through this was an achievement.  And you didn't give anybody any problems you know have family people because it was something to be able to go and so many too.  All my sisters and my two brothers [Dr. Calvin Miles Smith and HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith], my sister [Stella Lewis] all of us.  And we've done the same time for all the other children.  But you know I think it too, no I'm going back to DNA it started there.  But what enhanced it was this environment that I grew up in with all of these professors.  'Cause you see my brother and 'em they decided they wanted to dentist, but that's what Dr. [Benjamin] Mays did for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because until then we had preachers.  Now my aunt did marry a dentist yeah.  And my first cousin was a dentist.  But you know when my brother finished [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '43 [1943] even here there were very few.  He was one of the first younger ones--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to come back in '43 [1943] and so he took some of the older fellows' offices.
Story_ID: 290764
Speaker 1: So you graduated [from Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in nineteen--
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942].
Speaker 1: Forty-two [1942] and World War II [WWII] is going on now?
Speaker 2: Yes my husband [Robert D. Dickens] had to go Fort Benning [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now where did you meet your husband you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sophomore year, he was from Lakeland, Florida.
Speaker 1: All right now you, you all were together forty-five years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were married for forty-five years at least?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah he died in, in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my son [Robert D. Dickens, Jr.] was born in '43 [1943] we finished in '42 [1942], he was born in '43 [1943].  So he went to, to thank God to Fort Benning and during the war and stayed there worked.  But he soon came out and started work up there at AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] with the Guidance Center for the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].  And then he had just retired not yeah retire from the Atlanta [Housing] Authority [Atlanta, Georgia], director of housing here when he passed.  But see I taught forty years I started teaching here in '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Now where did you start teaching at?
Speaker 2: Young Street Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I finished up at Grove Park Elementary [School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 290765
Speaker 1: All right so well just a note the person we--I mentioned as the track star from Albany [Georgia] was not Wilma Rudolph [sic. Alice Coachman], so we're trying to think of who it is as we, as we continue to do this interview, it was not Wilma Rudolph.
Speaker 2: It's just about to come, almost.
Speaker 1: Now you're at Young Street Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia], Now did I mean how was, it did you like teaching?
Speaker 2: I loved it, 'cause I like the children dealing with the children.  It was difficult because during that time when I was at Young Street, we had what they called doubled sessions.  And that meant we taught, I may have gone to teach at twelve to four, someone else would have gone possibly eight to twelve.  And most times we had as many as forty-five students.  But still I felt and the children felt they said that there was something that we needed the earlier ones of us.  'Cause we were the therapist, we were social workers, we were the mamas, we were the papas we were everything to them.  And that's the way I felt about my students and then the boys say especially the boys.  'Cause I had a boy [Dickens' son, Robert D. Dickens, Jr.], you know I did so well with them.  And until today if I see 'em over there at that same school at Young Street.  I had a fella who's assistant pastor at Ebenezer [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s father's [Martin Luther King, Sr.] church.  He was my best tango dancer yes he was.  I had to choreographer the dances for three schools.  Reynoldstown [Atlanta, Georgia] which is south, Young Street and the school the name is leaving me right now, John Hope.  John Hope Elementary [School; John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] over there near the, Bap- near Georgia Baptist Hos- Atlanta Medical Hospital [WellStar Atlanta Medical Center] on Boulevard.  And that's right there in the King Center [The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] area, you know.  And (unclear) I would do the choreographing, the children would get the steps together and I'd put it together.  And we'd go on Ponce de Leon [Park, Atlanta, Georgia] and what they call Spiller Field and it's like a big closing school celebration.  And those were the things and that's my strong point and like I told you teaching the humanities.  And one of my students over here at Grove Park [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] they had a state contest and she won for the first prize.  Because from my class she did a [William] Shakespeare in the round and won.  So I just kind of like the arts.  And the children did not have a band, they didn't teach music, they didn't teach art we had to just to do it all.  And so consequently I think at those two schools, I know I was one that every time I got ready to have a program.  One such program I asked Ms. Alberta [Williams] King, Daddy King's wife to come because they had just done A.D. Williams School [Atlanta, Georgia] for her father [Adam Daniel Williams], just built it.  And I had me a program around him and them.  And I had dancing I had violin and a little artist.  So you see this was something the children hadn't done.  And that is how when I had my children getting season tickets to the theatre down there.  They, they sent someone out to find out who was this teacher over here at Grove Park School on Bankhead [Atlanta, Georgia] if you know anything about Bankhead.  That had children and parents coming to see the theatre in the day.  So they ask the area superintendent would he let this teacher come at eleven o'clock in the day and meet with them and I did.  And they, the superintendent did and I would go and that was 1979.  Now the children just had gotten arts, in schools at least we, music and, and with the music violin special violin teachers and we had some actually artist you do know in there with them.  Benny Andrews' niece was in my room.  I sent for Benny to come and you know demonstrate and just do with the children we were in a team teaching situation then.  And all the children in the part in the area he would come, and he did a lot of painting showing the children and discovered two or three little artists in there.  Do you know I left all of the work he did in the storage area, when I came back the custodian had gotten rid of it.  Now I could have had something from Benny Andrews an original.
Story_ID: 290766
Speaker 1: Let me make you this, just to backtrack a little bit.  When you first started teaching in the, in the Atlanta Public Schools were they segregated?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, very much so, a long time before.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us a little bit about the transition, what happened to desegregate?
Speaker 2: Okay, we that's what I'm trying to tell you, when we were segregated we had the largest classes forty-five or more.  We were all by ourselves that what we had double session, nobody did.  Many times the books that the other children used, we got 'em to use for our children.  But I've forgotten exactly how many years.  The main things that I remember too were that we had to so many children in our classroom.  Can you image forty-five that we had to work with and if it was double session half a day?  When they made the transition my brother's wife over here (unclear) was our one black supervisor Ms. Usher [ph.].  They seem to have, just to have put names in a pot of some kind.  Or she knew the teachers that she thought she'd like to integrate.  They sent 'em to these schools and we did.  Now do you know it turned out almost to be a transition that we as educators figured had been going on all along, you see?
Speaker 1: Now what year is this, when this was going on?
Speaker 2: Oh I can't remember that I've forgotten.
Speaker 1: This was '70s [1970s], '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: I, I retired in '82 [1982], so '60 [1960] or late '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we integrated.  But it's been going to only thing we knew we had a white superintendent.  So therefore we saw this then, we had this black super, supervisor.  But it was not too bad for us, it was so bad for the children.  'Cause they missed so much, they didn't have it.  As I said, it was end of '80s [1980s] when we brought art and music to them.  Now they're trying to think about taking it back from the public schools.  But the whole transition was a good one.  Only thing is so we came over here on Grove Park [Atlanta, Georgia], there were a lot of white people who lived on that street.  And we came on a Saturday to get settled, that's the only time I really, we really realized what was happening.  Because they took all their (unclear), we had WSB [WSB-TV, ABC2, Atlanta, Georgia] and all the folk there with news people.  And they skidded all the cars just kept watching us ours all day.  But they didn't, oh but then eventually set the school on fire.  Uh-huh, but we had changed to another school over here on Bankhead [Atlanta, Georgia].  We had go and, and can you see me getting off at five o'clock in the evening?  Yeah because and then because children hadn't been there since 12:30.  So it was, it was okay, well it was horrible in other areas, see I wasn't in bad, too bad a area.  And it was just rough you know but mainly for the children, it was bad they missed so much.  But we tried to make up for it, so it overworked us to death.

Speaker 1: You had started to tell us at one point about the Alliance Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia]. I think it was the, the Alliance Theatre yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Theatre, yeah at the High [Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia], at the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now when did that start and how did you get involved with the Alliance Theatre?
Speaker 2: By the, you know I told my children where I was teaching and I taught the humanities.  And so I had the children studying [William] Shakespeare and did the Shakespeare in the round.  And then they were going to this theatre with season tickets.  They never heard of a Afro American group coming to the theatre in groups and children, teachers bringing them.  My parents [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Miles Smith] used to fight over who was going be chaperone.  I introduced even them to it.  So then that's when they sent someone out to ask could I come to the meetings in the day and I did.  And when they met at night my husband [Robert D. Dickens] would take me and he would sit outside and wait for me to come back, I'm the only one.  So eventually they would 'cause you know we got [HistoryMaker] Kenny Leon just got through being director of the Alliance Theatre.  So that is how I did and that year I learned recently, was 1979 and this is just 2005.  But after then there was no major problem 'cause Coca-Cola [Company, Atlanta, Georgia] started sending the fifth level students to all of these arts.  You know they the art division, visual, I don't mean visual, all of the programs they started exposing these children to who had not been.  And then I had to coordinate again that for several schools.
Speaker 1: You were working for the [Atlanta] Board of Education in another capacity (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah but I, I and, and in another capacity.
Speaker 1: What was your title then? You were?
Speaker 2: Actually what did they call us, oh gracious those people who were in music, art and other than regular classroom, I've forgotten what they called it in that day.  But I think it was what did they call us?  Wasn't PE [physical education], no PE (unclear) but I, I can't remember it won't come to me now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the title at the board when you were coordinating these other arts programs?  When you were coordinating the other arts programs?
Speaker 2: At my school.
Speaker 1: Oh just at your school, oh okay you did have to--
Speaker 2: At my school, no, no, I was chosen like we did have a art coordinator in Mrs. Greenwood [ph.] that I worked under.  But if and then music we had those over there but you had the contact persons at the school.  So I had the drama, you know and that's what we would that was my area.  Now like I said my children ask for it then I guess I had the dance 'cause I had to choreograph for this whole area three schools.  To go down to Ponce de Leon [Park, Atlanta, Georgia] to this huge--right in front of Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] (unclear) there was a big old ball field called Spiller [Field].  And that's where the Atlanta Crackers used to play too.  That's where I had to take all of these three schools for these activities you know for like May Day, but it was at night.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of, now did you teach, modern dance or what, what kind of dance (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I taught modern dance and that's what I learned at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I taught it and I then I went to AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to learn to choreograph the dances.  In other words if we were doing the step right now, I'd have to figure out a theme, that's what we call a choreograph.  Getting it together and then I would get these schools, and if I wanted them to act like they were possibly doing maybe some sort of dance other than American then like square dancing.  Now I was pretty good at square, children never thought about it at that time, so therefore I did.  And then I would do my school, then I'd have to do another school and another school, then I'd have to put all of them together.  Now when I go to tango--like I told you with the fella at Wheat Street [ph.] assistant pastor--Ebenezer [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] I mean--I would have to go to AU.  And let the teacher teach me the tango then I'd come back and teach it to those children.  So you call that more or less coordinator.
Story_ID: 290768
Speaker 1: Alliance Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia], you, you're on the board of Alliance Theatre, right?
Speaker 2: No, I'm on the Community Relations Committee of the High Museum [of Art, Atlanta, Georgia].  I'm yes I'm just got my dues in, what do you call it, I am a member of the Alliance Theatre, I meant, the Alliance Children's Theatre Guild.  The Alliance Children's Theatre Guild, I've been a member since '79 [1979].  And what I did first was to take my children, my little classes to see the plays.  But then what we do now we have a Christmas House which is a fundraiser.  We get involved with the plays, ushering you know things like that.  So I go now to volunteer.
Speaker 1: Now is there any genre of plays that they do, that--are they noted for any particular genre of plays?
Speaker 2: Not particularly the Alliance's they had they that's who had the adults also.  See that's why I'm with the children's portion.  Now see that's where Phylicia Rashad is, any that where [HistoryMaker] Kenny Leon was Alliance Theatre.  But I'm the Children's Theatre, the Children's Theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh and then geared for children you can imagine.  All I can't even think of one name, but they have had the bigger.  It's really a big you know we're on the map with our Woodruff, the whole Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 290769
Speaker 1: Now the scope of your volunteer activity from just looking at your, at the information I have, I mean you seem as though you've volunteered just as much as you worked?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure did.  I did and I didn't find that too difficult because we it grew out of my work in a way, but when said that it may have been.  Well I told you now my first well my [maternal] grandmother [Nelle Bryant] was the first thing that started me volunteering.  When she was down there in Neighborhood Union [Health Center, Atlanta, Georgia] that's health though.  But after I would teach I would even have to come, would not have to come.  But then and then on Saturdays and Fridays and Sundays, we didn't have much to do, we couldn't go downtown too much.  So what we did, we just in the different organizations you know we would volunteer, as we joined them or as we created them.  Now some of them now like Gate City Day Nursery [Association, Atlanta, Georgia], I was on the board for Gate City Day Nursery which is celebrating its centennial this, this year.  And then while I was working naturally as I said, these social clubs beca- got to be involved.  But I stayed mainly with the Woodruff Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia], which was a theatre.  With the Gate City Day Nursery which is a hundred years old.  And any other civic thing I could get in.  I loved it, mainly civic and art.  So, I've been, in fact as long as I've started work I mean I started work in here '45 [1945], I have organized and volunteered till today.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Miles Smith] like instill like a, like a sense of giving back to the community?  I mean did they tell you that you had a responsibility to, to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandmother, like I told you, people that had the rummage sales up there at Rush Memorial [Congregational] Church on Brawley [James P. Brawley Drive].  Everybody would send something. My grandmother felt and would make us share, anything that we had.  And I'm always 'til today just anything, just like sending that tray out because the child you know lost her bro-, found her brother dead the other day.  When you're when he came in the driveway the caterer was bringing a tray and with all I had going here, I just had to remember her.  Because you know and she was Marie [ph.] that answered the phone, I mean that rang.  But my mother always taught the four of us that we would always share.  We shared until today we do, right now.  If there's a crisis like these children finishing these college what not.  My brother [Dr. Calvin Miles Smith] that's dead he didn't have to worry because we the three of us left feel that we, we it's our job to see that they finish.  And that they get the best.  And if one is doing a bit better than the other, we just automatically know that we help.
Story_ID: 290770
Speaker 1: So therefore I got that like I can go, well it's just sad, I'll go somewhere now and start working with a set of people I don't even know.  And before I know it here come the mother image again.  They always calling to vent, they always calling to ask what do I think about thus and thus and so.  And what are you doing can you have a guest so I can go with you.  It's I think two things the doctors says it is my desire to help and that the people have the confidence in what I'm trying to do.  But I love it and I think that the thing the part of my success is giving.  And that's what I've done and you know why?  I give of my time 'cause I do not have a lot of money to give, so I give time.  And I had Dr. Tatum [HistoryMaker Beverly Daniel Tatum] at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] to tell me this year, I said oh Dr. Tatum I'm so sorry, I just cannot give financially blah, blah, blah I'm a widow and alone and blah, blah.  She says oh Miss Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] don't worry about it your just being here is enough you know working with girls.  Well if I can go over there like I had to do for Founders Day this year (unclear), they had me watch walking six hundred freshmen over for Founders Day from Spelman to Martin Luther King [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Well they wanted me I'm the oldest ones, so they just felt my presence which I find is true.  The girls just love it, Ms. Gee Gee you go over there you think I'm they open the door, they they like you if you're older if you feel like you kind of fitting in with them a bit.  Yet in still, and I facilitate with the freshman when they come every year.  I have two little facilitators with me they always two younger ones, but when I get through you know who's telephone number they want (gestures).  Well you see I'm kind of trying to be hip with them you understand, I, I tell 'em as soon as I start I say girls you've been so charming and blah, blah I say but now I guess it's about time for me to tell you what [President] Abraham Lincoln and I did over here with Ms. [Florence M.] Read, and they just fall out.  Set the tone for it you know.  But they seem to love it they'll call can we go out to lunch?  Well when I get 'em to lunch I tell 'em what to wear and I tell which so needed about the etiquette what you're doing and what you're not doing.  And that little girl I told you going to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] they I said why is this napkin still on this table, you understand you you, where's napkin supposed to be?  This is the kind of thing you have to do with them and this is the thing, they will accept it.  Now they not gone to set accept it when you giving it to 'em in a lecture you know.  Why you wearing these things so and so and so, then again you when you go you got to look like you know what you talking about when you telling somebody what to put on.
Story_ID: 290771
Speaker 1: I want to backtrack a little bit to talk ask you about Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] family now you knew, you knew your father's [Harvey Miles Smith] a good friend of Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] did you know Martin Luther King when he was young kid?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause he used to come over to our brothers all the time.  See he was in his era, very lovely person.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was he like I mean what kind of?
Speaker 2: Martin was a joker and a kidder, now I'm closer to Christine [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] 'cause see Christine well we just interact together but (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Christine King Farris?
Speaker 2: Christine is his sister, yeah, yeah we were together the other week.
Speaker 1: Christine King Farris, okay.
Speaker 2: But Martin was a lovely person very sincere about his program sincere about what he was doing.  And he had us feeling like disciples you know.  But he still was a very calm, warm, and truly had people skills that you would have just loved.  He, he, he we feel he believed in his own teachings.  I, I just got through looking at Joel Osteen last night, another preacher down there in Houston [Texas] I love him he has a such a--he reminds me of the kind of he's not always saying 23 Psalms this or that, he gives you practical things to set I do like (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the one on 'Larry King [Live]' last night, yeah okay?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I love him, he's real popular.  But Martin was an okay a humble but brilliant carried himself with charisma, character no doubt.  Now he sincerely meant what he said whatever he said it and he could truly say it.  And awful good speaker and orator but came in the room with you now be just like anybody else you know.  Well when he just I never shall forget when Lena Horne came over there, he was running late naturally 'cause they had just been at the [Atlanta] Civic Center [Atlanta, Georgia] where she gave a concert for him.  So he was having to go somewhere rushing with [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Wyatt Tee Walker you that was one of his th- he was going somewhere out of town rushing you know to go from a program.  And he said Harvey [HistoryMaker Dr. Harvey Smith] I'm so glad you could do this for us 'cause I guess my brother let him come free.  'Cause the concert wasn't but twenty-five dollars, and so my brother had the red carpet from the front on up and tables all in this backyard over here.  Martin was so pleased he stayed with us until about twelve or one.  Now, now we stayed till two with Lena, because she was entertaining us so.  But he was just another person to everybody, we, we were really worshiped him.
Speaker 1: You said he was a joker when he was younger?
Speaker 2: Yes he was.
Speaker 1: What kind of jokes were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He tell, well now he would, when I said joke he would crack he might see you and say, "Well what's that you got on today, I see you in so and so" you know general things now I don't mean just tell any jokes or risque jokes.  But he was a person that was fun as well as serious.  He could be both (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A witty person.
Speaker 2: Very witty, very witty, he might say to Harvey, "Bring your (unclear) we gone fishing" see with all those hunting dogs he had out there.  And he'd make joke, "Man you can't do so and so and so" natural person, with all the genius he had and everything.  And you know, come to think about it now I'm thinking there are some people that never had the advantage to know him that well like I have and my family.  You know it's just amazing.
Story_ID: 290772
Speaker 1: Did you feel during--now you were teaching school when the Montgomery Bus Boycott happened.  And, and you know when the trouble went down in Albany, Georgia--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and then when they started riding the street cars here?
Speaker 1: --burning Birmingham [Alabama] right.  Did you have a sense of I mean did, did people around here have a sense him [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], of his growing stature in the nation at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes and revered it, oh yes, and res I mean to the utmost.  Almost like another human being, another being, he I'm here to tell ya now was so revered.  Some of us like with that boy I couldn't, but we sat at the Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] counters and was knocked off the counters because of his teachings.  And were believed in those people too, you know the school children.  But now I'm too old to sit at a counter to be knocked off the counter, at the time.  But now I never shall forget the day that they rode that trolley you know.  Got on that trolley down there on in the heart of town I wanta say Peach Street [sic. Peachtree Street] or Broad Street at that time.  But they got on that trolley and sat.  Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and I forgot who else was with him may have been Maynard [Jackson]'s father [Maynard Jackson, Sr.] or somebody like that I don't know 'cause he was a stalwart on Albany Avenue [sic. Albany Drive] and Martin and, and Reverend [William Holmes] Borders, all of those men they were strong.  And they really were in the program, and just like this in it.  And those schools up there just like that.  And that's where they do all of the marches.  But now who is that, somebody I was trying to tell you about was with them then too and Martin.  But know you know I don't have to talk Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], but and [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, oh my gracious.  Now I worked for John Lewis when he first ran for [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked for all the people when you know when they're running.
Speaker 1: Did you know the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people when they were started?
Speaker 2: Not too much I didn't for some reason, I, I knew them now and heard of them but I didn't, but now my younger brother [Dr. Calvin Miles Smith] was president of the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And so he was during that time and he worked with Ivan Allen [Jr.].  'Cause they had a barrier over there on Patton [Drive], wouldn't let us go down through the street.  And my young brother had hot line with Ivan Allen.  And during the time he was president and they did you know work together to get the barrier down you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so Ivan Allen was president was of, was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mayor, mayor--Ivan Allen Jr. was mayor.
Speaker 1: Oh, mayor, oh, he was mayor of?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Atlanta back in the okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You know Martin was just a regular, regular person as he was worked hard with his movement.  But Martin was just a down to earth reg-, no air, no whatever, he just a regular person with a mind with a genius and an idea.  Just like someone discovered General Motors car, that was his calling.  But he was truly a regular person.
Speaker 1: What do, where you surprised at all that he you know he rose as high as he did?
Speaker 2: We were not so surprised 'cause see Daddy King now I'm not kidding see and my father [Harvey Miles Smith] too over there they were like now we don't call them rebels.  But they we were kind of expecting it surprised that he was so ready you know.
Story_ID: 290773
Speaker 1: I was asking you about [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond you mentioned you, you helped his camp- you worked for his campaign (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah we worked, we worked.
Speaker 1: But and you've known his family for a long time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do know, we all do know Mrs. Bonds socially and whatever too.  And they was a wonderful, wonderful family. They too were what we call some of our what'cha call 'em intellects.  The intellectually kind as well as in, involved in the movement.  They were, Julian particularly I remember.  Now if I saw I'm, I'm, I'm now I don't mean the street vernacular but I wouldn't older I wouldn't a running buddy of Julian's but I respected and revered him very much, very much.  But I did teach one of the sisters, so I knew she was a Bond and but I taught her at that Young Street [Elementary] School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now did you ever--were--did you come up any under any pressure from the board of education for say working on campaign of a, of a Julian Bond.  You know I, I people didn't want to run (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, No, but see they knew this.
Speaker 1: --they didn't want to seat they refused to seat him right when he was elected?
Speaker 2: That's right but see the thing is Atlanta [Georgia] to me I, I say is a (unclear), just like [Governor] Lester Maddox used to sell the axe handles.
Speaker 1: Right to.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't selling us because we were too intellect to go to buy 'em in the area.  Now my point is there are just like it is now I disagree with a lot that going on now politically.  But we did we got together and we, we were bonded in what we believed in.  And that's all we do, could spend our time doing trying to undo that.  And of course we've had some ter-, but they were kind of of rough too not, not so much of the thing in Atlanta.  But like in Selma [Alabama] in all those place you know all the blood, we didn't have too much of that here.
Story_ID: 290774
Speaker 1: Now I forgot my parents [Stella Bryant Smith and Harvey Miles Smith] did tell me there was a race riot right in front of our house on Chestnut Street in 1921 [sic. 1906].  I was too young born in '20 [1920], but they were out there throwing bricks and carrying on ridiculously in front of my [maternal] grandmamma [Nelle Bryant] and grandpapa's [Henry Bryant] house 'cause it was a nice neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Now just to be clear a race riot in 1921, would have been the white community coming into the black community attacking right?
Speaker 1: That's it, that's it, yes sir.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's what were used to now in the news were black people you know have some kind of rebellion in their own neighborhood where they're burning their property.
Speaker 1: And, and it had to do with evidently something going on up there at that college [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so they were up and down, right up in there now.
Speaker 2: So the white, the people from the white community invaded the college (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes and they came out Chestnut Street which was from 100 Street up to Greenferry [Avenue] was all of us, college.  Nineteen twenty-one [1921] now I remember them telling me that.  Now I don't remember that see if I was twenty, when I was I mean was born 1920, '21 [1921] now they had to give me that as a part of our history.  I don't remember that they knew the exact the reason.
Speaker 2: Did you ever hear about the riot in 1910 I think it was that Walter [Francis] White writes about in his, his biography?
Speaker 1: Yeah you know Walter White as here you know the historian he live, he worked here for a while didn't he?
Speaker 2: Walter White he became a head, head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Yep, Yep.
Speaker 2: He was born and raised in (unclear).
Speaker 1: He was here a lot.  I don't remember now, may have earlier.
Story_ID: 290775
Speaker 1: Oh [HistoryMaker] John Lewis you worked on John Lewis' campaign too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah bless his heart and he has worked so hard he has given his whole adult life to the program.  And we, his wife is and we're friends naturally Lillian [Miles Lewis] but John we respect I do (unclear).  I worked with him we were right down, downtown at his I can't think now where the name of the street Spring Street I think it was, his office was there.  But you know one thing most of us have worked in all campaigns.  You know what like we go work for Shirley [Franklin] coming up I will I mean.  But everything that we've had going that's real, whatever some of us have worked in a, you know in the whole thing whether we were for the same candidate or not.  We worked in some capacity.  And I always call myself more of a volunteer not a paid person but volunteer.  But as I say John'll come back now and say my friend young play daughter who, Women Looking Ahead she interviewed and he autographed his books.  When he wrote that book and I have pictures with him you know autographing and he did one for me.  He, he appreciates and remembers those of us who worked with him.  Sometimes he'll tell 'em Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] worked with me when I first started.  You know that's what the girl did for our [National] Black Arts Festival the other day.  The girl who's an artist and over the Artist Rocket [ph.] [HistoryMaker] Stephanie Hughley had the two of us stand up.  'Cause we were with the whole thing at the inception, we're the oldest workers there.  When Michael Lomax had it we worked with him, when he star- started it.
Speaker 1: That was back in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, he something else.  I forgot we thirty-five, I think we're thirty-five, no, no, no that's my club group.  Yeah we're about thirty-five years old I think Black Arts Festival.
Speaker 1: Black Arts Festival?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was like 1970?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, could have been [sic. 1988].  But you know like I said it's too many of these things celebrating anniversaries I may be getting them confused.  But we, we have been and I, I have worked I'm talking about worked since the inception.  And Michael Lomax was (unclear) you know recognized those of us who have I don't mean just touched it, but we have worked.  Because I, I would be trying to get two hundred volunteers for before the 15th of July, for, for the artist month.  And we have had some, any artist you name they've been to this festival.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And still coming.
Story_ID: 290776
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well to, to I would hope I think we're pretty much, I think we're pretty much together as to what it's all about as far as we are concerned.  But I'm real concern about the poverty that we find in these community in abundance.  With our black fellas, boys, males I call 'em and the children who have to stay in these homes where they're doing all these drugs making all these drugs in the homes.  And then just, just dying some of them from them, nobody helping them leave this plight.  They are but it's very minute and so consequently I just hope economically education and I'll even say religion that we would just help ourselves get above even where we are today although we have come a long way.  I can tell you that at eighty-four, but I don't like the idea of hate to say it the hip hop and what it's done to the boys including my grandson.  And the, the boys don't have a, oh that they don't know how horrible that they is.  That they have chosen to dress with this long white tee shirt and those jeans here and the girls about the same.  I'm hoping if before I and we're doing something about it over at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] with the girls.  I hoping one day that they can get back to some of the things that we were doing which would bring a little more depth to their character.  I think, their minds are gone, their beautiful minds.  But it's just some things about living that they just don't think or care anything about.
Story_ID: 290777
Speaker 1: --Is there a difference you know what's a or would you des, do you detect a difference in the girls that go to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] now, as opposed to those who went in the past?
Speaker 2: A decided difference than those opposed to go, but we do the have changed.  Now when I went you didn't have a telephone in the dormitory you had to go to one building to use the phone.  We would have to have company from 4:30 to maybe 6:30, the restriction were different.  This is a new day we know that.  But I think that and I can say this they've always had marvelous students, good students, they've got so, six hundred we graduated this year.  And most of them were above you understand.  But there are some things that they do, that they're not quite I'll say etiquette, social or either I say sometime the femininity.  I just don't believe the girls are interested in the same thing they interested in their books.  And you know we just felt that we could move mountains, well Ms. [Florence M.] Read taught that.  You know Ms. Read told us you don't even have to tell your husband what you you make.  She didn't even think we should work, that's a new day.  And even what did I have to do why I married this Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] man [Robert D. Dickens].  I had to teach and worked at the Housing Auth- the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] in order for us to make it.  So I don't think that was too good a teaching you know and surely I be further now if I did, if I had put my sal-, money in with him you know.  But she taught independence, that's what she wanted.  She came to make Spelman another Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York] and that's what she did.  And it, it was good, because there are sometimes you would never find, most of us and I if finished in '42 [1942] there are few us kind of left around to be going over as models for the girls.  But you wouldn't find us sitting around as they are dressed now.  Well we couldn't do it, 'cause first of all we'd been sent home, you understand, but there's, is some good in the old and the new.  But personally I'd rather have had what we did for me than for them to allow some of the things that they have to allow on these campuses now.  Now a typical example is two girls were going to ING [International Netherlands Group] this investment company well we have some you saw a picture of the CEO in that book.  They went to a, an interview with jeans and a tee shirt this is 2005, they coming from Spelman.  So the little CEO is on the board with me for that magazine called me Mama Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens], what is this coming, give me their names she says oh no I'll take care of it.  Now what I, I knew that when I finished, that you don't go to an interview with jeans and a tee shirt.

Speaker 1: Some of it's defiance. Yes when I walked those freshmen over to Martin Luther King Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] for a convocation Founders Day.  We were in the spirit of our founders all white no jewelry I did, I did the same which no jewelry you know at this point I need all I can get.  They were loud talking. Two had on blue jean jacket with the white dress.  And I said to young lady, now they were defying me though, that's what it was.  But you know what I did, I just said, I say, "Young lady now before get to the chapel you're gonna have to take that jacket off, because you know we're not allowing but white dresses."  I've got anemia, no anemia and I knew it, but I said I surely sympathize with you but you have to do give it me before you go in.  Now she thought somebody and it wasn't but two that did it out of six hundred I said no cell phone, you know you're not supposed to have that.  Two of 'em marching together, two together they used call each other side by side now defy in a way, but I, I still acted as though I was in charge.  I didn't give her lecture about you you're uncouth or you this and that, I just let her know by telling what I thought she should do.  Now when we crossed the Westview [Atlanta, Georgia] up there and they were just hollering and screaming and the policeman says, "Oh madam, you got 'em under control they gave you all these," I said, "Yep."  So I just said to 'em girls now we're going to the chapel for a convocation, we're not going to Morehouse football field [B.T. Harvey Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia] for a football game.  They toned down, they respect me, I probably could tell 'em some of anything and they would do.  They came to my church Friendship [Baptist Church, Atlanta] where Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] founded and they were having Morehouse Spelman Day.  And I want you know they were in the church the girls with all je- you know they didn't have a suit, you know the look they got 'em.  'Cause you know they got everything they want, but they just don't know what to do.  And the parents are too busy trying to be their friends and won't tell 'em and that's why I agree with Bill Cosby 100 percent.  Somebody needs to be in control, I've got a great granddaughter and two years old right now she's already saying stop to me.  That's okay I need to stop sometimes but then you, you don't tell me necessarily what to do.  And you don't have to do what I say do, but then let's just you know get this thing together.  I told my children that in school, I said to them now children I'm the teacher and there is a hierarchy.  I'm the teacher, you the student, teach means teach, I'm supposed to teach you the whole skills.  And that's how you get them to respect you.  And I don't mind them these young girls over there calling me an elder, I love it.  Because if there anything oh Ms. Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens], oh Ms. Dickens we just do so and so.  And so when I tell them in the, in the dining hall you bending over and that's not the appropriate thing to do, when you're not fully clothed.  That's the way I tell 'em do you think they get up run out and tell me you don't tell me what, no they do not, yes Ms. Gee Gee.  Now they may go and do whatever they want, but I would at least told them and reminded them.  And we were at a private luncheon over there in the campus atrium.  And they had seniors going to med school and they were sitting up they hadn't finished their lunch the napkins were in a fan shape on the table.  And of course when they were through sitting up grinning having a ball with each other, napkin place I say young ladies have you finished yes Ms. Gee Gee, I said you finished, yes Ms. Gee, Gee I well what is this in this napkin still doing on the table.  Oh Ms. Gee Gee we're sor-, now don't you know we learned that in that dining hall we learned it 'cause Ms. [Florence M.] Read had somebody teach it to us.  You know they couldn't teach the men in my day, you know who taught my husband [Robert D. Dickens] table etiquette?  (Gestures) Know what I told him now you watch me and that's how our husbands learned, they too busy working.  They had to do part time my husband worked at [The] Varsity [Atlanta, Georgia], while he was in school here.  You know to help him pay his mother was dead grandmother taking care of him, he didn't have time to learn etiquette.  'Cause Benjamin E. Mays should have taught it to 'em, in a you know he know he made them men, in our day.  And so I said that to say you need a little of the old and little of the new.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on your life and all things that you've done you've received many, many awards.  And have been recorded several times we're not the first organization to record your story.  Is there anything that you would do differently when you look back on everything you've done?
Speaker 2: Yeah, surely oh there are some many things that I would do differently but.
Speaker 1: Any major thing?
Speaker 2: No I don't really think so, I really don't because I'm still just about doing the same thing and I could be a (unclear) out of everything I would sit here and almost blow my brains out.  If I didn't have all them invitations in there, that I don't know which way to go.  Including Sears [HistoryMaker Leah Ward Sears] being sworn in as a supreme court [Supreme Court of Georgia] judge in Georgia, but I mean but there good invitations.  There's still things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You talking about Leah Ward Sears?
Speaker 2: Yes, her mother's [Onnye Roundtree Sears] in my group.  But what it's so good to know to be a part of these things even my age because you see, got catching up to do.  I remember when these folks were my [maternal] grandmama's [Nelle Bryant] out there working for 'em, she come home and tell me all the things the ladies did, you understand.  Well and Ms. [Florence M.] Read, surely put that in us and so most of us are under thing it doesn't get any worst. Johnnetta [B.] Cole was just excellent at it, the men were okay.  But I don't understand why they would have a man at the women's school being the president.  But you had Donald [M.] Stewart and Dr. Manley [HistoryMaker Audrey Manley] now I don't say the girls there I kind of didn't bother during that time but I picked up with Johnnetta and I've been going ever since.  Audrey Manley and all of 'em but the girl ought to be girls and we want them as feminine as they can get.  So there's so of us around here who are in, you got be in your '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s] to really know I say, to know the Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And there were, we tried to make 'em ladies you got some girls but you got some over there.  Anytime you got five hundred almost six hundred finishing and above they are, their just in an age now that I wished we could 'em out of and the fellas too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Having worked with children all my life I'd, I'd that's, the one thing that I, I just, I just wish they could all of them could be exposed to even some of the things I've been exposed to.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back likewise when you look back on everything you've done to this point, you're still working hard on things.  What would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Most of the people seem to think that they think it's my wisdom about life, the girls tell me.  Mama you have so much and I guess so because I'm forever doing and solving for other people.  But then I don't care like before you all came in today it was the worst time of my life almost, for time you know.  But I think really my ability to deal with people and work with them and they say you made my day.  I joke you know like I tell 'em now don't be called me, I, I told you I can't be made nervous I got my own issues you know.  Well I just want to know do could you do what do think about this, are you going just to this thing are you going to that.  And then I get up and go in the room by myself and said oh well she's asking me what do I think, why should I go.  So my whole thing is I do hope that as they say that my interacting with these people and my whole life has been volunteering in one way or another.  And that I have oh I've meant a lot, to a lot of my girls that I've taught.  And they tell me all the time and they write.  And then other people that I've met, Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] you are a very sincere and genuine and caring person.  And as I don't need to have any other accolade than that I've meant something particularly to the younger girls.  And, and a friend to my friends and that's I try to give them everything I can of me.  Very little materially do I have, but I try to give myself.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now you, you have some children right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a son, Robert D. Dickens Jr., he went to Catholic schools and he is finished university, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] then University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  He now is into what is it the computer and all for the Atlanta Board of Education.  But he did work as a, at the [Atlanta] Housing Authority [Atlanta, Georgia] too, like is one goal because his father [Robert D. Dickens] was director at one time.  But he has two boys and one of 'em finished Morehouse and is now with Verizon [Wireless] into computers and everything.  And my younger boy has a little girl and that's the size of my immediate family.  I have a lovely daughter-in-law who is now executive director this Gate City [Day Nursery Association, Atlanta, Georgia] that I told you.  She he met her at the University of Michigan and I think the whole family even extended my sisters, you know my nieces and nephews we've all done well.  Some of us better than others. Some children have not seen it the way it should be, but that we feel it should be.  And but we don't consider it a disappointment we work with them too, all over work together.  Whether it's illness or anything else drugs or whatever it is, we have the same thing everybody not quite as much, we're blessed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We are blessed.
Story_ID: 290782
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you before I ask the last question?  Is there anything I haven't asked about that you think you want to talk about before we close with the last question?
Speaker 2: You fixing to get to the last question?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: I do not really, I think I'm not particular about you answering anything other than I could say to you if I could make a statement.  I am just about as happy as I'd ever want to be in my life, at this point.  I am doing so many things that I do like but I had said that Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] number one, Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] number two and the High Museum [of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] and the arts will be my thing that's, that's where my energies will go now.  Until the, I'm not able to do anymore, I will always keep in touch with them and I just hope that I have been some kind of model, role model for some of these children I've taught.  And I kind of believe that I have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I have been very, I so pleased and blessed.  Physically and every way, I'm just so happy about my heritage I don't know what to do.  I am, I'm just, I'm just so delighted and so consequently I keep you know I just this is the way I am all the time.  I really feel very about myself I've always done it.  But I'm not always been you know right, ooh way off at times.  But in these recent years I have done this.  I'm not talking about religion and all that thing, I'm just as a as a person and I just feel, and I don't care I want 'em to say I feel very good about myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm so pleased, about what God has done, I'm am.  Now most of the people say that they had doctors tell me ask how old are you and it true, my gastroenterologist they gonna tell you, you about sixty-five and if you ask young or old they'll hit it almost dead on the head most times.  Now anytime I'm eighty-four and that blessed you know physically and I, I just can't be anything but happy.  And I stay here when I'm not doing, I'm here by myself looking at the cops.  I've decided I want to be a detective (laughter).  No but it's something to keep my mind going.  See I just can't sit up here and look at this stuff I can't I got to figure out.  But I don't get depressed, it's gotta be real serious I don't, I don't let that do.  But and I try to share, that's the secret you have to share you gotta give, you gotta give whatever you have been blessed with.
Story_ID: 290783
Speaker 1: Now our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I tell all of the girls, I like for them to get up and take a half a second just make a line and say Mama Gee Gee [HistoryMaker Georgia Dickens] sure was a sweet person, she was a giving person and she cared about every one of us.  And I think and that what I want my brothers and my sisters and all of 'em to say that I did the best I very could to be a good friend and you know and a friend and a sister and a mother.  And my son [Robert D. Dickens, Jr.] and now he calls me chief and he's sixty-two.  Left here this morning running to do thing for the, you know, my sign in sheets. He looks after his mama.  Now not too much to give but he does give attention.  So I'd like to, I think maybe that I kept that I was a person that when were around me that they were, they enjoyed it.  And they tell me all the time oh you just so delightful I just love talking to you or you made my day.  And I just want to be a friend and I person that really that people and respected.  And that's the main thing I really hope they felt that I did have something to give.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you ma'am it's been a pleasure to interview you and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You through?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh bless your heart.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
