 Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  Today   s date is January 28, 2016. I am here with Steve and Pam Holton. We  are in Poteau, Oklahoma, and this interview is a part of the Cowboy in  Every County Oral History Project, which is part of O-State Stories. Now  we   re official. I think the first thing I wanted to just ask both of you all, and  you can answer this separately. You can help each other where you think it   s  helpful. You cannot help each other where you don   t think it   ll be helpful.  (Laughter) I have a feeling you all are going to be pretty easy to do  together, just a little bit about where each of you all are from and a little bit  about your family, who your parents are and if you have siblings. If you  want to talk about that, that would be helpful, a little bit of background.  Either one of you can start. You all can sort that out.  P. Holton I   m Pam Buck Holton. I was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, in 1949. I was the  third of six children, and we moved to Oklahoma City when I was eleven. I  spent junior high and high school in Oklahoma City.  Milligan What part of Oklahoma City were you in?  P. Holton Nichols Hills. We went from a pretty small home, a little red brick home in  Shawnee to a real nice big house, and it had lots of room. It was very much  fun. We had a golf course right behind us. That   s where I feel like I grew up.  Then I went to college my freshman year. There were several girls on our  street. We all went to Temple Buell College. It was Colorado Women   s  College in Denver. It was our chance to go away to school and     S. Holton    hopefully meet Air Force cadets.  P. Holton That was the plan. I lasted a year. (Laughs) I didn   t like being away from  home. It was an all-girls school, which was a huge mistake. I came back. At  Christmas, I said, told my parents I wanted to go back into state and I had  sent all of my stuff to OU  University of Oklahoma . My mother said,    You  will not go to college if you go to OU. You can only go to OSU.    (Laughs) I  wasn   t given a choice.  5  Milligan Why did she tell you that?  P. Holton My older brother had played football at OSU. He had decided  between   OSU or OU and he decided OSU. They had been big OU fans, and when  they made the transfer to OSU, I think they must have really liked the  people better because they were then avid OSU fans. I was, oh, in sixth,  seventh, and eighth grade, and he was playing football at OSU. I got to go to  a few football games, not very often. They would take us. I went back to  school my sophomore year. I went to Stillwater.  Milligan Why did you want to go to OU?  P. Holton That   s where all my friends were. My friends who stayed in state, almost all  of them were at OU. There were a few who were at Stillwater.  Milligan Did many of your friends stay at Temple?  P. Holton At Temple Buell? Actually, two of them did, and they graduated from there.  Two of us came back. My best friend, she went to OU, and then I went to  OSU. Then I made the adjustment. (Laughs) I didn   t meet Steve until my  senior year.  Milligan At OSU?  P. Holton At OSU, yes.  Milligan Steve, what about you? Tell me a bit about where you   re from and your  family.  S. Holton I was born just across the border, Fort Smith, Arkansas, but I was raised in  Poteau. I finished high school in 1966. My mom and dad both went to OSU,  Oklahoma A M. That   s where they met. Two of my uncles also went to  school in Stillwater. At the time I graduated from high school, I had three  older cousins at OSU. It was just expected. I never considered another  school. I just knew that when I finished high school I would go to OSU.  While I was there at one point, there were seven first cousins all on campus  at the same time. That was really neat. In the fall, especially for  Homecoming, we would have moms, dads, aunts, and uncles all there, and  usually on Sunday morning, everyone   d meet over at the Student Union in  the old cafeteria area. We would have almost a family reunion. It was really  neat.  Milligan Do you know why that your family was so invested in OSU? Did it start with  your dad   s generation?  6  S. Holton My dad was the first in his family to go to college. Well, I take that back.  My aunt went over to the University of Arkansas, his older sister, and it was  closer, of course, than Stillwater. The roads back then, it made Stillwater a  pretty good trip from Poteau. Fayetteville was a lot more accessible. I asked  Dad about that one time, and he said he was really looking at going to the  University of Arkansas and then got to thinking about that he would be  coming back to work with his dad in Poteau and that he really needed a  network and friends and contacts that were Oklahomans, not Arkansas  people and that that   s how he decided to go to OSU. My mother is from  Woodward  Oklahoma . From that corner of the state, I think OSU was just  probably a number-one choice for most of  the  kids up in the northwest.  Milligan Was that more agriculturally aligned? Is that what the OSU draw is?  S. Holton Yes. With my dad, too, we   ve always been in ranching. He pioneered the  broiler industry here when he came back from the war, a lot of ag ties.  Milligan I know we have an interview with your father in our archive, right?  S. Holton Yes.  Milligan We definitely can cross-reference some of that information to find out more.  That makes more sense. I always wonder because a lot of people, once you  get it in the family with OSU, a lot of peoples    parents are eager for siblings  to follow or cousins, or then you know people and then you go back. It   s  interesting to know when that starting point is, where it starts.  P. Holton That was it. Steve and I counted up after the Homecoming this year. We  have forty relatives that we could name right off who have gone, and most  of them have graduated from OSU. I thought that was pretty interesting. A  lot of them went on his side, but my brothers and family, their children all  went to OSU. I thought that was   .  Milligan All of your  siblings  went to OSU?  P. Holton Five out of six of us went to OSU. One brother didn   t. He stayed at Central  in Edmond, went to Central State  University .  Milligan Maybe Pam, just back to you a little bit. What were you majoring in? What  was your focus in college?  P. Holton I didn   t know what I wanted to do, but I did elementary education because I  just felt like even if I never taught, I would just have a better understanding  of children. I was very glad that   s what I did. Then I did come back and  teach just a couple of years. I got teased a little bit, but I feel like I used it  with my children a lot.  7  Milligan Was that pretty typical of a lot of your generation, to do     P. Holton Our choices, I felt like, at the time, we could be a nurse or a teacher. That  was pretty much what you did. I was not an athlete. I don   t remember any  girls being athletes at the time. My sister and I were raised with athletic  brothers     S. Holton You   re competitive.  P. Holton    but we didn   t have that opportunity. It   s real interesting how things are  different now. It   s much   many more roads open for women.  Milligan Was it expected of you that you would go to college as the woman in the  family?  P. Holton It was expected of me that I would get married and have children. (Laughs)  That was the only thing expected, and that   s probably why my dad sent me  to college, to find a husband, I bet. (Laughs) We never really talked about it.  All they would talk about was getting married and having children. (Laughs)  Milligan Do you feel like that was the way with a lot of your peers in college?  P. Holton I don   t know about that. Most of my friends, some went into retail, and my  sorority sisters, most of them were teachers. Some went  into  FRCD   Family Relations Child Development .  Milligan Is it the administrative?  P. Holton They just went into retail line of work.  Milligan What did your mom think about you going to college then? You talked a  little bit about what your dad   .  P. Holton She told me one time her only regret in life is she did not go to college, and  that kept me in school because there would be some times when you just, it  was not going like I thought it should. I thought,    If that   s the only thing my  mother has regretted, then I need to finish.    I have to say I   ve been very  proud to be able to say yes, just not bragging about it, but to be able to say I  graduated from OSU. It has meant a lot.  Milligan I   m hearing from that, it sounds like that you and your mom talked about  that while you were at college as well. You talked about that opportunity as  an opportunity for you versus just a placeholder in your life.  8  P. Holton The Depression kept her from going to school. She was packed up, ready to  go, but my parents are both from Pennsylvania. She decided that her  younger brother needed to be the one to go. She didn   t go and apparently  always regretted that.  Milligan Do you remember much about any of your classes or any of your  professors?  P. Holton (Laughs) No, because when people talk about     Milligan A lot of people don   t remember.  P. Holton    when they talk about a different professor, I just think,    Oh my goodness.  How do you remember?    I really wasn   t a great student. (Laughs) That  wasn   t what I was in school for.  Milligan (Laughs)  P. Holton I mean, I was an average student.  Milligan Where   d you live on campus? I   m assuming you lived on campus.  P. Holton I lived in Drummond my first semester of my sophomore year because that   s  when I went, and then I moved to the Tri Delt a  house. I lived there until I  did my student teaching, and then I moved to Oklahoma City to student  teach.  Milligan You were Tri Delta?  P. Holton Yes.  Milligan What made you choose that organization?  P. Holton I didn   t go through formal rush because I just didn   t know if I wanted to do  that, and my roommate was a Tri Delta. She   d take me to dinner. It seemed  like a really nice group of girls who were not pretentious. It was just a  nice   just all different types of people. I liked that compared to a stereotype  of some houses. I was very comfortable there. Sorority wasn   t real important  to me. This was in the late    60s, and then I graduated in    71. Although we  didn   t have a lot of rebellion in Stillwater on campus, it was a time  of   Greeks were not at the high, they weren   t at their high point. It wasn   t  as important. There was a lot of anti-Greek movements. It wasn   t real  important to me, but it played an important part in my life actually, that it  got me involved on campus and helped me work on my grades.  Milligan What are some of the ways that it got you involved on campus?  9  P. Holton Well, just to be in parts of different organizations that I would not have done  it before. I did Army Blades for a couple of years, which, we marched in the  Homecoming parade, and I   m sure they don   t have anything like that now.  We had the little military uniforms. (Laughs) We ushered at the basketball  games. Then my protest to the Vietnam War was my senior year. I didn   t do  it. I was quite the protester. (Laughs) I really wasn   t much of an activist, but  that was a way I could be a little bit of an activist. (Laughs)  Milligan Was there a lot of that going on in Stillwater?  P. Holton I don   t think there was. Do you? (Laughs) There   s a little bit.  S. Holton Yeah, there was more in the late    60s, by    69 and especially    70. It was  nationwide. I mean, there was a lot of unrest on campus, and Stillwater,  luckily it never got as extreme as it did. I know even down at OU they had  some protests. I think maybe they took over the president   s office at one  point. It was more extreme than at OSU. Things were not all good. Some of  it was racial tensions. A lot of it was the war. In    70, the four students were  killed at Kent State. It   s hard to believe that that was the level of student  unrest that was going on around the nation, but it was pretty extreme. In  some cases, it got violent. Fortunately, that didn   t happen at OSU.  Milligan I haven   t heard too many people actually talk about   I think it   s interesting  that you have any stand because a lot of people don   t talk about trying to  consciously, unless they were in it altogether, unless they were in it to really  make a stand, these moments of defiance that were conscious    (Laughter)  P. Holton I   m not very defiant by nature. It   s the little things you do, though. (Laughs)  Milligan Maybe that was even more of a challenge then. I wonder, was it something  that you thought of, or was it something that other people around you were  doing as well?  P. Holton No, it   s something that I thought of because the draft was taking people that  we knew.  S. Holton I think Chris had gone to the Marines.  P. Holton My brother was in the Marines, my younger brother. He was at OSU, and he  left OSU to go into the Marines. I was very concerned and frightened for  him.  Milligan Yeah, that   s interesting. Well, we   ll come back to this. (Laughter) Let   s  catch up with you a little bit, Steve, on where   you made it to OSU.  10  (Laughs) What was your major? What was your goals? What was your plan  while you were there?  S. Holton My family had numerous businesses here in Poteau, and my dad had come  back to join his dad after college and after going to the war. It   s something  that Dad and I really, we never talked about, but I think I always felt this  unspoken obligation to at least come back and try to work in the family  businesses. I always had that in mind. I majored in business at OSU, really  went up there without any specific thing in mind other than just business  administration. Really marketing became my interest, and I   ve used that all  of my career.  P. Holton He   s good at it, too. He   s good. (Laughs)  S. Holton That worked out really well. That was how I ended up in the school of  business. Like Pam, I was an average student, but I was active in a lot of  things on campus and felt like I got as much out of that as I did out of the  classroom and made a lot of friends but knew a lot of people.  Milligan You were related to half the campus. (Laughter)  S. Holton I had eighty in my high school class. Going to Stillwater was   that was a  big deal, and the girls in that eighty, I had gone to school with most of them  since nursery school or kindergarten. I   ve got to be careful of the terms I use  here. I would fall in love almost every time I walked across campus.  (Laughter) I had never seen so many girls, so many attractive girls, and  coming from a small high school, that was just a treat. (Laughter)  Milligan A difference for sure, right? (Laughter)  S. Holton Things change so much, and Pam and I have talked about this. From the  time I was a freshman in the fall of 1966, there was just almost a generation  change from my freshman year to    70 or    71. My sister was three years  older, and I look back at her college experience and how she was at OSU but  it was a different experience. There was just such a change of culture. My  freshman year, we wore slacks and a shirt and tie to class. By my senior  year, people were in bell-bottom jeans, and we didn   t even know what bell-bottoms  were as freshmen. I might   ve been naive, but I had no idea what  marijuana was as a freshman, and by the time I   m a senior, it   s just  everywhere. There were some major changes during those four or five years.  It was just real interesting. Then talking with my sister and her age group,  even though they were just three and four and five years older, there was  just a different mindset. It was a little bit different time. It   s pretty neat to  see that change.  Milligan It   s interesting, yeah, to be there at that pivotal point.  11  P. Holton That was towards the end of our last year, too.  S. Holton Just a lot of things like hours, my freshman year, the girls had to be into the  dorms or the sorority houses by ten o   clock on weeknights and I think  midnight, I don   t know if it was one o   clock on weekends, but by Pam   s  senior year, they had to be in by seven a.m.  P. Holton We had to turn our key in by seven in the morning. (Laughter)  S. Holton We   ve always laughed at that. I guess it was so they could say they had  hours. (Laughter)  P. Holton Then it didn   t last much, but my senior year, we had to check out a key. I  checked out a key in the house, and then it had to be in the   I don   t know  who, the house manager or  sorority house  Mom, I don   t know who would  check to be sure the keys were turned back in every morning. (Laughs)  S. Holton That   s just an example of how that all changed in four or five years so much.  Milligan Whereas the big shift between people who went to OSU in the late    50s was  the check-in time went from eight to nine over the four- or five-year period,  which was just like,    Nine o   clock.     P. Holton (Laughs) Oh.  Milligan It   s hard for me to imagine. I mean, having it in that context, it   s really  interesting to think about when you start there, your expectation is you   re  going to be suited up. You   re going to have a tie on for class. You   re going  to be groomed, and then by the end of it, roll out of bed and go to class  almost, it sounds like.  P. Holton When I pledged as a sophomore, you could not wear anything, any Greek  insignia on campus, like a t-shirt or sweatshirt, and jeans, you didn   t wear  that onto campus. In fact, since I was raised in a house full of boys perhaps,  I don   t know, my sister and I   I never wore jeans until I was, we were not  allowed to wear jeans until I went to the Army Surplus Store when I was in  Colorado and bought some jeans. My mother was horrified (I was a  freshman) that I was wearing jeans out of the house. It was the bell-bottom  jeans.  Milligan That   s when you were a freshman in Colorado?  P. Holton Yes. I came back and bought those. I didn   t wear jeans around my mom for  a while. (Laughs) If you were on campus, you had to be in your, a nice pair  of pants or a skirt and a sweater.  12  Milligan That was a sorority rule?  P. Holton Yes, that was a sorority rule our first, I know my sophomore year. I think the  junior year started to lax up. Maybe I   m not supposed to tell this, but I was  on the standards committee because I was an officer. One of our standards  meeting was one of the girls did not wear a bra in the lobby, and it had  embarrassed her boyfriend. We had a meeting about this. (Laughter) It was  just funny because I didn   t wear a bra, either, but it didn   t matter. (Laughter)  No one could tell. I just thought,    Oh my goodness.    That was my senior  year that they were discussing that.  Milligan What was the verdict? What     P. Holton I don   t remember what the verdict was, but I think she was just  reprimanded. She had to wear a bra when she was out of her room, under  her sweatshirt or whatever it was. (Laughter)  Milligan New rules, I guess. Was there anything written about that beforehand?  P. Holton I don   t know. I was only on standards for one semester because then I left to  do my student teaching. (Laughs)  Milligan Right. Some of those transitions that were happening, even specifically that  you   re talking about within your sorority, how were those changes being  made? Was it something that was being pushed as a greater campus or from  the sorority members? Was there pushback?  P. Holton I think it was pretty much a divided   we just had a few people who seemed  to be a little more free-spirited. I think your sorority girls, as in general, are a  little, probably pretty conservative publically. There   s a lot going on behind  the scenes, but publicly you   I probably didn   t tell anybody,    Well, I don   t  wear a bra, either. No one seems to know.    (Laughs)  Milligan You didn   t fess up at the hearing about that reprimand? (Laughter)  P. Holton No, I don   t think I said anything. I just remember there were some girls who  were just a little more free-spirited than the others. There wasn   t a lot of it.  We were still just making that transition.  Milligan Yeah, that   s interesting.  S. Holton You   re asking about how those changes came, though, and I   m trying to  think. It was an evolution, but it happened pretty fast when you think about  it. It wasn   t like there was just a leader of a movement to change this  13  overnight, but it was pretty much a general consensus, I think. Just suddenly  things just started changing. They just loosened up and   .  P. Holton I think in other parts of the country they had really made big changes. We  always talk about what they were doing on the coast, what they   re wearing  and what they   re doing. We just felt like we were not isolated or protected  but just slow. (Laughter)  Milligan What did the professors think about   do you remember that transition from  more formal to less formal? Was there any pushback from some of the  classroom?  P. Holton I don   t remember anything at all.  S. Holton I don   t remember anything being said. I remember the same way with the  faculty you had. You had those that were much more liberal and those that  were more conservative. It was a lot more fun to get a professor who was a  liberal. There was change, I guess, going on that we probably weren   t aware  of at the faculty level, administrative level, yeah, that there was probably  quite a bit of leaving some old ways because it was, especially my senior  year, it became part of the unrest on OSU   s campus. It wasn   t just focused  on protesting the Vietnam War. It was students feeling like that they weren   t  involved in policymaking that affected student life, and they wanted a  greater voice in those administrative decisions and felt like they were still  being treated as children, even though now they   re twenty-one and away  from home and college students. It was still very conservative from an  administrative standpoint. That was a big thing, as well as the more national  agendas that were out there, too.  Milligan You also mentioned earlier that there were a lot of changes going on geared  towards race on campus as well. Was there anything that you can remember  with that unrest that dealt specifically with that? Was it common to have, I  guess, international students, maybe a little bit more, but even just more  black people in classes, was that something that was an issue at that point? I  mean, it   s not really an integration area but it is in that same time period  when all that change is going on. Do you remember anything going on with  that?  S. Holton I was just aware that the, I think the black students became more outspoken  and more organized and were bringing things to the surface and making  some demands. Then there   s some resulting racial tension out of that, and  there were a few things that happened just off campus. I remember a few  fights and some broken windows. Then even in the part of Stillwater that  was predominantly black, I was driving through one night and had a brick  thrown through my windshield. There was some trouble.  14  Milligan That   s pretty scary.  S. Holton I guess it never got just totally violent or out of hand on a broad scale, but  there were tensions there.  Milligan Did you tell your parents about you getting a brick thrown through your  windshield?  S. Holton I did because I had to get my car back home to get a windshield replaced.  Milligan What   d they think about that?  S. Holton Nothing.  Milligan Nope, didn   t worry them? (Laughter)  P. Holton One more thing Steve did. (Laughter)  S. Holton I   m sure they were glad I wasn   t hurt.  Milligan Was that just a passing incident, or was there anything else around that?  S. Holton Oh yeah, I was just a random target. I found out later that then on the Strip,  on Washington Street, there had been a fight that night, and it was racial  problems. That had just spread into the neighborhood, and I was driving  through the neighborhood.  Milligan You were there.  S. Holton I was just there, yeah.  Milligan Yeah, that   s interesting. When did you all meet?  S. Holton We actually met towards the end of the semester, Pam   s junior year and my  senior year, and in one of the bars there on Washington Street. I walked by a  booth, and Pam was sitting with one of my fraternity brothers and stopped  and visited with him. He introduced us. I just filed that away. Whenever I  came back for another semester that fall, I asked him if the girl he   d  introduced me to, if they were dating. He said,    Oh, we had a few dates this  summer, but no, we   re not,    and I said,    Well, pal, fix me up.    (Laughter) I  think he and one of Pam   s sorority sisters got together. We had a study  break date on a Thursday night and went out for a cup of coffee because we  had a date to a ballgame that Saturday. We thought maybe it   d be nice     P. Holton    that we should meet and see if it was going to work out. (Laughs)  15  S. Holton    to meet before we go spend the afternoon together. We did that and then  made it to the ballgame that weekend and saw each other, I think, every day  that next week.  P. Holton It was pretty fun. We were just   .  S. Holton The timing was right. Pam was back for her senior year, and I was back for a  fifth year and just clicked.  P. Holton It worked, but sometime, I don   t know when, I asked Steve, I said,    What  are you going to do when you graduate?    because he was going to graduate  that semester. He said,    Oh, I   m going back to Poteau to work,    and I  thought,    Oh God, I need to get out of this    because I   ve heard my sister,  she   d come down to Poteau with a friend. I said,    I   ve heard about Poteau,  and I don   t want to...we   re seniors. I don   t want this to get any more serious.  I need to get out of this,    but we kept having fun. (Laughter)  Milligan Did you ever tell him that you ever have those thoughts?  S. Holton Oh, I   ve heard this story. (Laughter)  Milligan I know since, while they were going on?  P. Holton No, no, no, I didn   t, no, because I was just having fun. I had had a long-term  boyfriend. I had just started getting back into the dating and having fun, and  I was not looking for anything from it. We just had a good time.  S. Holton Pam went to the city  Oklahoma City  to practice teach, and I got a job at  the state capitol with the legislative council during that session. I was living  in the city, and she was in the city. We continued to date, but at some point  when she asked me to marry her, I said,    If we   re going to do this, it needs  to be fast. I don   t want a long engagement.    We got engaged in April and  married in June.  Milligan Okay. Wait, who asked who to marry whom? (Laughter)  P. Holton He says I ask him. I think in the talk was,    Well, if we were to get  married   ,    if. (Laughter)  S. Holton That   s how it went.  P. Holton I think that   s how it went.  Milligan You didn   t start with,    If we were to get married, is Poteau in our future?     (Laughter)  16  P. Holton Yeah, really. (Laughter) I think I really was a small-town girl at heart  probably. I had spent those few years in Shawnee. I was familiar with, but  this was really small. (Laughs) We did. It   s been good.  S. Holton I mean, a great place to raise a family. It   s worked well.  P. Holton It   s worked.  Milligan When did you come to Poteau then?  S. Holton In July of 1971. We got married in June, and we moved back here in July,  forty-five years ago.  P. Holton Forty-five years this summer.  Milligan Wow. That   s a long time. I mean, it   s a long time to stay on what you  weren   t sure was   . (Laughter)  P. Holton Well, I made a commitment. (Laughs) It   s been good.  Milligan Quick decision to marry but long-term dating.  S. Holton That   s right.  Milligan Long-term casual dating.  P. Holton Well, we had a lot of fun, though. I mean, we just hit it off. We just had fun  together. It   s just worked. Steve   s been patient.  S. Holton (Laughs)  P. Holton I went  home  a lot. I went back to Oklahoma City a lot. My dad died just  before we got married. I ended up going back home, being with my mom  and little sister a while, I mean, just    (Laughs)  S. Holton    yeah, that first year.  P. Holton    that first year, yeah. I was trying to   just to keep everything moving  nicely.  Milligan Maybe your dad had an opinion for a while, but how did they feel about you  moving down to Poteau?  P. Holton Well, when Steve asked   went to my dad to talk to him, tell them what you  said.  17  S. Holton Oh, her dad was a big Republican, and I   m a Democrat. I said,    Mr. Buck,  would you be okay with a Democrat in the family?    That   s how I asked, and  he hesitated for just a minute. (Laughter) We didn   t spend much time  together, he and I, but we got along fine. He just didn   t live long enough.  Yeah, that   s how I asked if he would be okay with us marrying.  P. Holton He said,    Would you consider changing?    (Laughter)  S. Holton Oh yeah, he did say that, and I had to say no. (Laughter)  P. Holton When we were talking, going to tell my parents, the OU wrestling coach  was there for my little brother talking to my family about my little brother.  We   d go by, and his car would still be there. (Laughs) Then finally, when he  was gone, then we got to come in. My parents got bombarded that night.  Tony ended up going to OSU playing football instead, but it was an  interesting night. That was in April, and then we got married in June. We  had to move our date a little bit. My dad died, and then my little sister was  in a car wreck two days before we were supposed to be married. I know  people thought it probably wasn   t supposed to be, but we did it. (Laughter)  Soon as she got out of the hospital, we got fourteen people together, and we  got married. (Laughter)  Milligan That   s great. That   s fantastic.  S. Holton Then yeah, we moved back down here. Suddenly you   re removed from  OSU. We were able to get back to some ballgames that first couple of years.  Then you start having children, and I was working six days a week. It  became more and more difficult.  Milligan They had Saturday soccer.  S. Holton Yeah, the weekend activities start. We reached a time when we didn   t get  back on campus very often     P. Holton Once a year maybe.  S. Holton    for several years, and then I stayed involved. We formed a Leflore County  OSU Alumni Association, and we would charter a bus and go over to Little  Rock. OSU played Arkansas, but it was always at Little Rock. We would go  over to that game and created an alumni group here in the county, and that  was fun. It was all ages, and some from over at Haskell County, too, that  would go with us. We did that, and that kept us in touch, I think, with OSU.  Then OSU would do a   the Alumni Association sponsored academic  banquets that were recruiting banquets for juniors around the state. I put  those on for fourteen years, and we would invite all of the juniors in Leflore  County who were in their National Honor Society or in the top 20 percent of  18  their class and invite them and their parents to come to a large banquet we  would do in the civic center here in Poteau. We would have 200, 250  people. They were really well attended. Merle Rogers was the head of the  Alumni Association then, and they would either fly or drive in. They would  do a multimedia presentation, which consisted of a movie on a screen and  two slideshows going on on the left and right.  P. Holton It was a big deal. (Laughter) Every time we saw it, it was like,    Oh my,    oh,  we were just so proud. (Laughs)  S. Holton It was a great recruiting tool, and we had a lot of kids from Leflore County  during those years that went to OSU. Then it became where financially it  just wasn   t real feasible, and they started phasing them out and pulling it  down to just some, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and a few of the, maybe Lawton,  Bartlesville, just the larger towns and phased out the old county student  recruitment.  Milligan Has that student attendance from this area to OSU gone down?  S. Holton I think it   .  Milligan I mean, there   s no concrete way for you to know.  S. Holton Right, but it   s strong for a few years. I just know Poteau students, some  years, you might have six, eight, or ten kids that go from here to Stillwater,  and then maybe the next year, one or two. It varies a lot.  P. Holton A lot of them, they   ll do one or two years at Carl Albert  State College , at  the state college, and then they   ll go. I don   t really know how the attendance  is now. It   s real interesting when your children get older. You get out of  what   s going on. You don   t really notice much.  S. Holton Then as our kids got older, then we were taking them to OSU. We were  back on the road again and getting back to ballgames. Then I was on the old  alumni association board and even was on the executive committee at one  point, and that   s when my daughter decided not to go to OSU. I told Jerry  Gil, I said,    There   s no need for me to stay on the board. I can   t recruit my  own daughter. I need to get off,    and I did. Pam still gives me a hard time  because when it was decision night, I remember we were up in Kelly   s room  sitting on her bed, and that   s when Ford just came out with the Explorer. I  told Kelly, I said,    If you will go to OSU, I will buy you a Ford Explorer. I  will open you a charge account at the Wooden Nickel and give you a credit  card        P. Holton       and a spring break trip.     19  S. Holton       and a spring break trip,    and Pam is just sitting there seething.  P. Holton I   m going,    That   s not fair.     S. Holton (Laughs)  P. Holton Kelly, she goes,    Dad, that   s not where I want to go.    (Laughter)  S. Holton I said,    Well, it   s not about being fair. That   s where she needs to go to  school.    She said the reason she didn   t want to go to OSU is that she was  just too comfortable there, that we had taken her to OSU so many times that  she just felt so comfortable and enjoyed it, and she just wanted something  more of a challenge.  Milligan Where   d she go?  S. Holton She went to Vanderbilt.  P. Holton She got a challenge. (Laughter)  Milligan Way, way up.  S. Holton Yeah. We didn   t have any luck with all three children. None of them went to  OSU. We   ve got grandchildren now to work on.  Milligan You   ve still got some time.  P. Holton Yes, we   re working on them.  Milligan Some less time than others. (Laughter)  S. Holton That   s right. (Laughs)  Milligan That   s interesting, though, because you kept that culture going. I mean, you  took them to games, and you all still had that as a part of your family events,  though, and still felt a part of that culture. I want to get back to some of the  events that you, the student recruitment events that you had here. What was  the momentum behind that? Was there a lot of people helping to organize  that? Was there a lot of community support behind that effort to try and  recruit for OSU?  S. Holton It was coming out of the Alumni Association office     Milligan Oh, was there an association?  20  S. Holton    in Stillwater. Yes, and they basically designed the program. We just did  all the groundwork here. We did the invitations. I would line up people to be  on the program, and then they would do their presentation.  P. Holton It was very well attended.  S. Holton Yeah. It was well done. That went on for really twelve or fifteen years. We  did that     P. Holton    every year.  S. Holton    for a long time.  Milligan What do you think most students would find appealing about OSU from  Leflore County?  S. Holton I found this, too. Even if there are 20,000 students there, you feel like the  majority of them are small-town backgrounds. I know there are a lot of kids  from Tulsa and Oklahoma City and Dallas, but still, there are a lot of small-town  kids that go to OSU. I   m always aware of that. When you look at the  kids that are named each year as outstanding seniors or whatever honors that  they   re getting and you go and look at the hometowns, still the majority of  them are not from the    metroplex.    I just think that   s pretty cool, and kids  can sense that. They know that they   re more at home there than they would  be at other campuses, yeah.  Milligan Yeah, I think you   re right. There   s something to being from a rural area and  finding comfort in other people from rural areas when you   re making some  transitions. Well, tell me a little bit about   you talked a little bit about your  ties with OSU after you came back to Poteau after you graduated, but talk a  little bit about what you all   what did you do with yourselves? I know there  was some teaching involved. There was some family business taking over  involved. Explain to me what that means, though. What happened?  S. Holton In our personal lives?  Milligan Yes.  P. Holton (Laughs) Well, we had Kelly. I quit teaching after I   I was teaching when I  got pregnant. I quit and thought about working part time.  Milligan You were teaching in the Poteau school system?  P. Holton I was teaching in the Poteau school system. I really enjoyed my teaching,  but I talked to my pediatrician about it   to Kelly   s pediatrician about it. The  first two years is when you need to be home with them if you could wait and  21  to not have to go back to work. Then by the time the second year was over, I  was pregnant again. I was very fortunate I got to stay home with my kids. I  know that. My friends, the ones of us who were able to do that, the friends  here, we all were real aware that we were in the minority because women  were going back to work, and several of our friends had their children and  immediately went back to work. We didn   t, and it was nice until after my  third child. Then it was like,    I need to be with some adults.    (Laughs) I was  a fitness instructor at Carl Albert for about fourteen years. That was just  part-time, and it also kept me in shape, kept me motivated, kept me with  young people. I had classes. I volunteered at the elementary school during  recess to lead classes, and then I went all the way to the nursing home. I had  all ages. I had from little kids and then college students, ladies my age and  older (I had a class of ladies who are my age now, but I was twenty years  younger, thirty years younger than them), and then that nursing home. I just  got to stay involved that way, and that was very fulfilling for me.  S. Holton A couple years, the coach of the college had the baseball team take Pam   s  aerobics class in the off-season, and she said they would come in that first  day thinking,    This is going to be a piece of cake.    By the time it was over  with, she would have them just   . (Laughs)  P. Holton I was trying real hard to work them. (Laughter)  S. Holton The coach would be in there with them, and they had to do   .  P. Holton He   s still the baseball coach, and he keeps those boys, they were very well-mannered.  This was the first time thing. I did that about three off-seasons. I  did work part time until my mom got sick and I needed to be in Oklahoma  City more. Then I just never went back. (Laughs) I got to retire. (Laughs)  Steve, when he had to work six days a week, that was not as much fun. That  Saturday when I was home with the kids, it was not   I didn   t like that  much. He changed careers when he was forty.  S. Holton That   s right.  P. Holton He went into banking at forty. Then bankers    hours aren   t really just nine  to   .  S. Holton Well, then I just had to work a half-day on Saturday.  P. Holton Yeah, for a while. You did. You did. You did have to work half a day on  Saturday. (Laughs)  S. Holton That was great.  Milligan Wait. How does that happen? (Laughter)  22  P. Holton Then now he has a whole weekend, but that was the first time. When you  work for a bank, you have to take two weeks. You have to be out off of, I  guess     S. Holton    two consecutive weeks.  P. Holton    two consecutive weeks. That was unbelievable. We had two weeks. Our  kids would go to summer camp down in Camp Ozark, and we would take a  vacation. That was fun.  Milligan You   d have to take mandatory two weeks?  S. Holton (Laughs)  P. Holton Had to take, yeah. We weren   t gone the whole time. That was very nice.  Milligan Talk a little bit before you made that switch. What is it that you did when  you came back from college?  S. Holton I went to work with Dad. My granddad had passed away in    67. Dad had  been running everything by himself. I think he was important to me coming  back. We had retail stores. We had a department store, a hardware, True  Value Hardware, a furniture store, and a supermarket. I was general  manager over those retail stores. I did that until 1989 and decided that I  really wanted to do something other than retail in a small town the rest of  my life. I started phasing out of the family retail businesses. I ended up with  a lot of residential and commercial rental property, and then I started doing  oil and gas leasing on the side and at night and had some success doing that,  some early success. Then typical of the industry, things were just good,  good, good, and then all of a sudden, they were bad. I had to work out of  that. Finally, I was able to come back to the top of that cycle the next time  and get everything cleaned up. Then I sold the rental property and moved  over into banking. That was a nice transition. (Laughs)  Milligan I   m sure that   s true. Was your dad still alive by this point? Well, yeah, he  was, because we interviewed him a couple, handful of years ago.  S. Holton Yes, right, yeah, he was.  Milligan How did he feel about you getting out of the family business?  S. Holton Probably he didn   t like it, but I mean, we never had any real conflict about  it. I just told him that   s really what I felt like I needed to do.  P. Holton That was hard for Steve to have to do.  23  S. Holton I phased out over a couple years. I didn   t just walk out one day. That all  worked. We were involved in the bank in a minority position, and I had  become a bank director in 1972. I had some experience in banking through  those years. Then our position in the bank changed in the late    70s. I think  he realized that it was better for all of us for me to be involved in banking on  a day-to-day basis and have hands-on, taking care of that part of our assets.  That part, and then I think once I did that, everything smoothed out real well  after that. Dad was chairman of the board at the bank until his death, and I  was CEO and then became chairman after he died. I   d looked back. My  grandfather moved to Poteau in 1926 and became a director of the bank, and  from 1926 until now, we   ve been involved in Central National Bank in some  way. My granddad served as an interim president after the death of a  president until that position was filled, and then my dad did the same thing  in 1979 or    80 for a short period. It   s real interesting how long we   ve been  involved.  P. Holton Steve   s granddad, who I never met, he went to school through     S. Holton    fifth grade.  P. Holton    fifth grade, which I guess is not that uncommon back then. I didn   t realize  that for particularly, maybe for this part of the state. He was quite the  wheeler-dealer and quite a personality.  Milligan It   s probably more uncommon to go through the fifth grade even then and  then end up being director of a bank and have those sorts of positions.  S. Holton He was a gifted horse and mule trader, and I didn   t grasp that for a long  time. Then we were back east touring something, and they talked about it. It  made you realize that that was how the work was done and transportation  was done, how important horses and mules were in everyday life. If that was  your strength and you were good at it, you were right in the middle of  everything. He started out doing that. Then he and my grandmother bought a  little, oh, twelve-foot-wide retail general merchandise store nine miles from  here, and then it just grew from that. At one time, he had 10,000 acres and a  herd of 2,000 Angus cattle and all of those retail businesses and a Pontiac  dealership and a cotton gin and a feed mill, and it just went on and on. It   s  one of those neat stories.  Milligan It is, yeah. I have a question. Coming from OSU back to Poteau, and then it  sounds like you were pretty young from the first time you were made as the  director, either on the board of directors or the director of the bank, right,  on the board of directors.  S. Holton On the board of directors, yes     24  P. Holton    and he had long hair.  S. Holton (Laughs)  Milligan Really?  P. Holton This is the early    70s. (Laughter)  Milligan No, I don   t mean that. I   m not surprised because of that. (Laughter) I   m not  surprised you had hair.  P. Holton He had long, dark, and it was   .  Milligan I   m surprised they let you on the board of directors with long hair.  P. Holton Oh yeah, there   s a picture of him in that room. (Laughter) I mean, he   s got a  full beard. (Laughter)  Milligan Really looking like you should be wearing bell-bottoms. (Laughter)  P. Holton Not a lot, but some of the salesmen would comment. To come back to this  small town and   not that we were rebels by any means, but that   s just what  everybody looked like.  S. Holton (Laughs)  P. Holton My hair, I had hair right down to here. (Laughs)  Milligan You were in your twenties when you first took on that role.  S. Holton Right, yeah.  P. Holton He was.  Milligan It was straight out of college. I   m wondering a few things. The first one is  the time you had at OSU, do you feel like that had any impact on your  ability to deal with that transition, to roll into that not only business but  something like board of directors?  S. Holton Luckily, I   d grown up in businesses, I mean, a carry-out boy in the  supermarket. I   d worked in the department store, in the hardware and had  done everything. That helped. It wasn   t like I didn   t have some real  experience, but to come back and be in your twenties and suddenly you   re  the general manager, yeah, that was a little more difficult. I just had to be  careful how I eased into that. These were good people I was working with.  25  Over time, I mean, it all worked well. Yeah, I   m sure there was some things  that I didn   t hear that were said, but it worked out okay.  Milligan Did you feel pressure about any of it?  S. Holton Sure, yeah, I think so. I did.  P. Holton Yeah. I think so.  S. Holton There was a lot to learn and a lot of responsibilities. It was such a variety of  things. We would go down to Dallas and buy clothing, and then I would go  to Chicago and buy hardware and then be down working at the supermarket.  It was so broad that it made it pretty exciting.  P. Holton Steve likes to do a lot of different things. He   s lots of talents. You thrived on  all that, but he did realize that it   s not really what   retail is hard.  S. Holton It is hard.  P. Holton In a small town, you get lots of feedback. That   s not what he wanted to do  forever.  S. Holton That   s where I used my marketing. I did all the advertising for all of those  different businesses. I used to run ten radio spots a day on the local station,  and it was    The weather, brought to you by Holton Stores, but first, this  word from Steve Holton.    Then I would do this thirty-second radio spot, and  then they   d do the weather. Especially our older customers, they would stop  me on the street, and they would ask me weather questions because they   re  hearing me ten times a day with the weather. They were always wanting to  know what they could expect tomorrow. (Laughter) That was my routine  every Wednesday night. I would write as many as, oh gosh, seven, nine. I  usually did an odd number of thirty- second  radio spots, and then I would  go out and tape these. Then they were rotated ten a day until I did new ones  the next week. I was quite the radio personality. (Laughter)  Milligan Where did you come up with an idea like that? I   m just curious.  S. Holton I don   t know. (Laughs)  P. Holton He has lots of good ideas. He still has lots of good ideas. Some ideas, we  toss out. (Laughs) He   s always coming up, I mean, I   m just always amazed  at     S. Holton    the ideas.  P. Holton Yeah. (Laughs)  26  S. Holton You want me to get back to OSU? (Laughter)  Milligan We can get back to OSU. I think this is   .  P. Holton Well, now Steve did do this. He was the speaker at commencement. Are you  going to tell that story?  S. Holton I can.  Milligan Go for it.  P. Holton I think he should because he was the last student speaker at commencement.  Milligan Oh yeah.  S. Holton They still had class officers.  P. Holton I saw his signs. Before I met him, he made really goofy campaign signs. I  would see them around campus and think,    Who in the world is that?    and I  married him. (Laughs)  Milligan What were you campaigning for?  S. Holton We had class officers at OSU. I ran for senior class president and was  elected. Then we abolished class officers because they really were pretty  much ceremonial. By that point, there was student government. You have  student senators. That   s the real representative of the students on campus. It  wasn   t class officers, but that had been carried forward for forever. I was the  last senior class president, and as senior class president, I was asked to speak  at commencement. I did that. That was during this time we talked about of  campus unrest. I did have a real concern that OSU could end up with some  serious problems on campus, and I chose to address that at commencement.  My heart was in the right place. I should have spoken from my heart, but  instead, I did it more formal.  I had some help from a psychology professor and an English professor in  my wording and structure. I think, looking back, if I had just done it more,  like I say, from my heart, I think it would have been better received because  it was just expressing a concern of the hostility that was growing between  the student body and the administration and that there needed to be better  communications and there needed to be respect shown on both sides and that  we needed to avoid something like Kent State or even occupying buildings  and that type of thing. The tone of it, I guess, came across maybe a little  more threatening or anti-administration or anti-school than I certainly  intended it to be...  27  P. Holton    for a graduation speech. I mean, like you say, it   s something that meant a  lot to him     S. Holton The time and place     P. Holton    but it perhaps wasn   t the right time.  S. Holton    yeah, but it probably wasn   t the right time to do it. I got standing ovations  from the students there, but I got hate mail afterwards from parents. They  were    Hope you burn in hell   -type letters because of bringing up that topic  at a time of celebration for their families and their students, that it just  wasn   t the place to do that. My own mother wouldn   t talk to me. (Laughter)  P. Holton Faculty had reviewed it.  S. Holton Yeah, but the administration hadn   t. Dr. Kamm was very unhappy. His vice  president, Abe Hesser, Abe was a hatchet man. He called me in and said that  he wished there was something he could do, but I was too close to  graduation. (Laughter) He really just couldn   t get me at that point but that  someday, I would regret that. Anyway, that was a rough way to have  commencement go, but the next year, I   m back. I   m in Blue Key, and I   m  chairman of Parents Day. I   m down on the fifty-yard line with Dr. Kamm  helping hand out awards to parents. Life goes on.  Milligan The next year after you graduated, you came back and got   .  S. Holton I needed three more hours.  P. Holton He didn   t graduate. (Laughter)  Milligan Oh, you had the last semester. That   s right, yeah. You did your  commencement not when you walked but the year you were senior class  president. I understand. Well, did you ever regret it?  S. Holton As I   ve said at other graduations, in our children   s graduations, I thought,     Yeah, that probably wasn   t the place to express those concerns.     P. Holton You really didn   t have an opportunity. Things were quite a bit different. You  didn   t have an opportunity to   and like you say, you were speaking from  your heart and what you really felt.  S. Holton Right.  Milligan Well, I think it   s telling that the students reacted so enthusiastic, it sounds  like, based on what you had to say. I mean, it sounds like it resonated with  your peers but maybe not with their parents or their parents    peer group.  28  P. Holton An older generation, perhaps. I came back that next  year , because I was a  junior. Then I come back my senior year, and I heard all about the great  graduation speech from the year before. This is before I knew Steve. It was  just interesting how it was perceived.  Milligan You mom was mad at you. Did your dad have anything to say to you about  it?  S. Holton Not too much, no, not too much. I was on the alumni board and other things,  and when I would see Dr. Kamm and we would shake hands, it was always  the forced smile and then    Steve, so good to see you.    I   d say,    So good to  see you, Dr. Kamm.    (Laughter) That was our conversation, yeah, left things  a little strained, but you really have to go back and take into context what  was going on. It was fairly serious. There were a couple of organizers from  the Students for a Democratic Society  SDS  on campus, and I knew they  were there. Things had the potential to get a lot worse.  P. Holton She has no idea who that is, the SDS. (Laughs)  S. Holton I was concerned about that.  Milligan Now who   s the SDS? Is that what you said?  P. Holton Yes, Students for, yes.  S. Holton It was a national radical     P. Holton    radical movement.  S. Holton I was concerned because I was proud of OSU and still am, and I didn   t want  to see anything like that happen there.  Milligan I guess if I   m understanding it, it sounds like you felt like by taking the  opportunity in a public venue to be able to try and call out some of those  potential brewing facets, that that was maybe a way to help calm them or  diffuse them. I wonder if you felt like the administration and the other, that  peer group, some of the parents or whatever, had a sense of how much those  things were percolating on campus, maybe as good a sense as some of the  students who were in them.  S. Holton I don   t think parents would have. The administration should have. I think  they were aware of them because their response was to really just buckle  down and tighten things up instead of maybe more open dialog and creating  new avenues of communication between students and administration. It was  a little bit more ironfisted, and that   s the way to handle it, which was  supported by people around the state and my parents. They were very  29  supportive of that approach. In defense of the administration, they were  doing what their constituents or their students    parents would, for the most  part, want them to do. Those were just a little bit different times right then,  and we don   t have anything like that right now. It   s hard to drop back to that  time period and   you have to remember what was going on, to say,    Well,  yeah, but this is why you felt like that was the reason you needed to do this.     You   re removed now forty-five years. It doesn   t make quite as much sense  maybe.  Milligan Makes perfect sense in context. I think it   s really interesting that you took  the opportunity to do that. I think a lot of people wouldn   t have, maybe  wouldn   t have felt safe enough to do that. Just like you found your one way,  your way to protest something that is meaningful to you, but it   s not like you  had to have a rallying group to do that or a huge group. You find ways to  express those. It   s interesting, interesting. Of course, nobody called the  hatchet man in on you for bowing out of the     P. Holton (Laughs)    Blades. I don   t even know if they have ROTC      S. Holton I think they do.  P. Holton    on campus. They do?  Milligan Yeah, yeah.  P. Holton We were the auxiliary, I guess you would say. (Laughs)  Milligan Yeah, they   re across the parking lot from where I park every day.  P. Holton Oh, they are? They practice? We marched. Once, we could go, and you  practice. We did get to do that in the Homecoming parade. That was fun.  One time, I was a Homecoming judge in 2004, about 2004. That was a  highlight. It was very hard, Homecoming decorations are unbelievable. It  was very enjoyable. I don   t think I   d want to do it again because every year  when we go back, I   m doing a little judging in my head. It   s like,    Oh my  goodness, this would be difficult.     Milligan What was Homecoming like while you were there?  S. Holton It was big, but the house decorations weren   t as elaborate.  P. Holton Did they move like they do now?  S. Holton Not nearly as much. (Laughter)  P. Holton I didn   t remember that. (Laughs)  30  S. Holton One year, in front of the Lambda Chi house, we did a big papier-m  ch    champagne bottle, and it would tilt and look like it was filling a glass. We  thought that was just an unbelievable house decoration. I don   t think we  won anything, but we were real impressed with ourselves for doing that. We  still did floats.  P. Holton Yeah, I worked on a float one year putting the stuff in it. It is actually a lot  of fun. It really is. It   s just real unifying.  S. Holton Now we can   t believe the scale. On Friday nights, the Walk Around, wow,  it   s just amazing.  Milligan Well, and I wonder about this because now they spend weeks, I mean, if not  a month or more working on these visibly where people can walk past and  try and see.  P. Holton Before that, they   ve even done their planning and gotten all that approved,  and there   s just a lot to it that people don   t realize before they start stuffing.  Milligan Was it that long of a process when you all were involved in it?  S. Holton No.  P. Holton I don   t think it was at all.  S. Holton It wasn   t that complex, and the floats were, if I remember right, they were  secret. They were done in warehouses and around town where you would  have them out of the weather. If your fraternity and sorority are doing a  float, people didn   t really know what that float was going to look like until  the parade, or they weren   t supposed to. You hopefully had a little edge on  your decorations.  P. Holton It seems like there were more floats than there were house decorations at  that time. Then over the years, it   s evolved into these unbelievable house  decorations, but I think it   s a real good opportunity. You work together for a  common goal and create great memories because we still remember it. The  Walk Around   s a good recruiting tool. (Laughs) Our granddaughter, we   ve  got to get her to Homecoming, do Walk Around.  Milligan What were some of the things that the two of you did socially while you were  dating in Stillwater?  P. Holton Well, we went to one Lambda Chi party, and I said,    That   s it.    We went to  one hobo party. I hadn   t been to very many fraternity parties, and it was like,     Oh my goodness.    (Laughter) We went to one.  31  Milligan What was going on there that made you not want to go back? (Laughs)  P. Holton Just a lot of wildness, a lot of wildness. Steve decided   .  S. Holton This is taking a different direction than I thought it was going. (Laughter)  Couldn   t tell her response. (Laughter)  Milligan Oh, oh. (Laughter)  P. Holton Steve, he goes,    I think I   m through with these.    (Laughs)  S. Holton Well, I was back for a fifty-year    I was starting to party on down a little  bit, and that was good.  P. Holton (Laughs) Yeah. That first week we went out, we went to a music festival.  We went to the fair in Oklahoma City. We flew kites somewhere. Oh, he  took me to the lady who makes candles out in Perkins  Oklahoma .  S. Holton (Laughs) Some real highlights.  P. Holton Yeah. (Laughter) What else did we do that we can tell? (Laughter)  Milligan Well, that   s the key. (Laughter)  S. Holton I was thinking about when I interviewed Mom and Dad and the Overstreets  and they were talking about the cost of things then.  Milligan Oh yeah.  S. Holton Even in 1968,    69,    70, for five dollars, you could have a day, go to the  movies, go down to the Coachman, and have a pitcher of beer for a buck and  a quarter. For five dollars, you could have a pretty nice day. I think where  that gets you now. (Laughter)  Milligan Not even popcorn at the movie. (Laughter)  P. Holton Yeah, not even popcorn at the movie.  S. Holton Not even the concession stand. Yeah, we just did a variety of things, I think.  Milligan That   s a good point, though, about the cost of things. That   s one of the  things that comes up often in alumni interviews is the cost of tuition, cost of  going to school, and what scholarships, if there were anything available that  you all took advantage of while you were there or if you had jobs while you  32  were there. I mean, I wonder how you all made it through financially for  school. Was the tuition cost, I know it was much different, but     S. Holton Oh yeah.  P. Holton I just worked in the summer, and I worked for my dad. That   s another thing  that did keep me in school, though, because I knew I did not want to   I  wanted a degree so I didn   t have to work for my dad. (Laughs)  Milligan There   s motivation.  S. Holton That   s right.  P. Holton My mom and dad didn   t motivate me. (Laughs)  Milligan What did you do for your dad during the summer?  P. Holton He had an oil company, and I was in the office. I thought,    I do not like  secretarial work. This is not what I want to do.    Both of my older brothers  were working for my dad at the time, and I didn   t want to do that. Steve  worked all the way through. You worked in college.  S. Holton I was associate editor of the yearbook, of the Redskin, and it was a paying  position. Then I worked for the dean of the students. These were part-time  jobs in school. I think a house bill was 110 dollars a month. I don   t  remember what tuition was, but just fractional to what it is now.  Milligan One of the things I wonder is it seems like, did you feel like you could put  yourself through school or get close to that by working while you were  going to school or not at all?  S. Holton I didn   t, not with the jobs I had, and my family helped me tremendously  going through school. I had friends and fraternity brothers who were, they  were earning the majority of the cost to them to be at college and from  summer jobs and them working part-time while they were in school. There  were a lot of kids doing that. They were busy. I had one fraternity brother  who would do the wheat harvest. He would end up almost in Canada by the  end of the summer. He said the good thing about it, all they did was work,  and they didn   t have a chance to spend their money. He would come back in  pretty good shape. Then several of the guys would sell bibles, and they  would make a tremendous amount of money.  Milligan On campus?  S. Holton No, no, no, no. (Laughter)  33  P. Holton No, you went door-to-door in the summer.  S. Holton They would be in the South, maybe in Georgia and Alabama or   .  P. Holton A lot of people did that.  Milligan Really?  P. Holton Yeah, and I   d forgotten that. (Laughs)  S. Holton If you   ll go in the alumni building, in the hallway with all the pictures,  there   s a picture of one of the classes, Southwest Bible, and some  information on it. A lot of OSU students did that. Like I say, it was very  lucrative.  Milligan Was it just a job, or was it     S. Holton No, it was a job. This was a national company     P. Holton You set up with the company, yeah.  S. Holton    who recruited college students who were     Milligan Like encyclopedia salesmen, but selling door-to-door bibles?  P. Holton Exactly, yeah.  S. Holton    good, good salesmen. They were selling bibles. I know one guy that went  to school for eight or ten years. He had a Corvette that he would put in a  garage. He would get an older junker and go into the South and sell bibles.  He worked his way up where he was a team leader or whatever the title was  and made a lot of money and then would come back and get the    vette back  out of the garage and enjoy going to college and having an apartment and  having spending money. He took his time going through school. (Laughter)  That was one of the more interesting summer jobs that I knew that, a few  people I knew that did that.  Milligan That   s very different.  S. Holton Yeah. That would be a fun interview, to talk to one of them.  Milligan Yeah, I   ll have to keep my ear out for someone who   s done that. (Laughter)  S. Holton Just learn about the organization and the training they got and then their  experiences going door-to-door.  34  P. Holton I had friends who in the summertime, they would be camp counselors  somewhere. Several girls did that. I don   t know what else people did to  work.  S. Holton They used to go out to Tahoe and be cocktail waitresses. Yeah, they loved  Oklahoma kids.  P. Holton They did because they were hardworking is what we always said. I did.  You   re right. I   d forgotten that. (Laughs)  Milligan There was an Oklahoma    outflux    during the summer to Tahoe?  P. Holton Yes, in the summertime to go out there, yes.  Milligan That   s interesting. A lot of those are ones I haven   t heard. (Laughter) It   s an  interesting point because a lot of, to talk to someone who   s graduated in the  last ten years versus talking to somebody who graduated, say, the forties,  that answer is extremely different on how you, the expectation of how you  get through school and what financial shape you come out at the other end.  (Laughs)  S. Holton Yeah, I don   t know. Student loans, when we were in school, I don   t know if  anyone did that.  P. Holton I may have had friends who were on scholarship and I didn   t know it. As far  as needs scholarship, I don   t know.  S. Holton I think the loans were mainly the parents were taking out the loans to help  the children go through school, but I don   t know what the student loan  structure was or if there was one.  Milligan That   s interesting, right.  S. Holton I don   t think kids came out of college with a lot of debt. They didn   t come  out with anything, but they didn   t have debt.  Milligan (Laughs) They came out with a great education.  P. Holton That   s right.  Milligan (Laughs) Well, I   m trying to think if there   s anything, any points that I had.  P. Holton Is there anything else that you need to, that you can remember?  S. Holton Oh, I   ve got one other story.  35  Milligan Bring it on.  S. Holton Dr. Campbell was president at OSU, and he had not come over to the  southeastern part of the state. Our state senator thought that he needed to  come over and get acquainted with us. We put together a two-day tour for  him to come from Stillwater to Leflore County, and we were going to take  him to what we considered our highlights. Dr. Campbell came in and spent  the night, and we started early the next morning. I borrowed a twelve- or  fourteen-passenger van and picked everyone up. We had Dr. John  Montgomery, a veterinarian from here in Poteau who was on the board of  regents at the time, and Senator Hamilton and myself and my Dad. Jerry Gil  was with us from Stillwater and several other people, and we had the van  loaded. We started out at the Kerr Foundation and toured that and then  loaded up and drove down to Heavener  Oklahoma  to a hatchery. We  completed that tour. We loaded up in the van and had pulled out and started  heading back up towards Poteau. I was driving the van, and Dr. Campbell  was in the passenger seat. Dr. Montgomery was back behind us. I think Jerry  was all the way back at the back of the van.  I looked over at Dr. Campbell. He had no color, and he was doing his left  hand like this and had his eyes closed. I said,    Dr. Campbell, are you okay?     He just nodded his head yes, but he didn   t answer me. I thought,    Boy, he   s  not okay.    I just stepped on the gas and started heading for the hospital. I  turned around, and I said,    Dr. Montgomery, I think we have a serious  problem here.    Doc leaned up and started talking to the president. I  remember putting my flashers on, and I was passing people on the right. I  looked in my rearview mirror at one point, and I made eye contact with  Jerry. He wasn   t aware of what was going on in the front seat at that time,  and it was just like,    Steve, what the hell are you   we   re not in that big a  hurry. What are you doing driving on the wrong side of the road and  shoulders?    Anyway, we got him up to the hospital. I was on the hospital  board at the time, and we had just talked about a new drug. Streptokinase, I  think, was the drug.  It was a new drug that if you could administer that within thirty minutes or  an hour of a heart attack, that it would either completely eliminate or it  would greatly lessen permanent damage to the heart. We had that drug on  hand. We got him up here, and they used that and got him stabilized and got  him into ICU. Well, the next thing was,    Do we need to get him out of  Poteau and get him to Tulsa or Oklahoma City?    A freak snowstorm set  down on Poteau, and it just shut us down. We couldn   t fly a plane in. We  couldn   t drive an ambulance out. We ended up having to keep the president  another night and all the next day. Then finally they got a private jet out of  Tulsa, converted it to a hospital transport, and flew it in to Fort Smith, and  we were able to load President Campbell up into an ambulance and get him  from Poteau to Fort Smith and load him onto that jet. I drove his wife over.  36  We followed the ambulance to the airport that night and got him loaded, and  they took him to Tulsa and completely recovered. Everything worked out  fine.  Milligan Whoa. That   s pretty scary.  S. Holton Yeah, it was, and he never came back. (Laughter)  P. Holton When was that?  S. Holton I can   t remember, but that was his only visit to southeastern Oklahoma.  (Laughs)  Milligan Did he enjoy the tour up to that point? (Laughter)  S. Holton I think so.  Milligan Oh gosh, that   s stressful for everybody. (Laughter) Did you ever lure  anybody else back down for the Stillwater, Leflore     S. Holton I don   t think we have. (Laughs) That was it.  Milligan I think I have one more note here, and I   m pretty sure this was direct from  Karen, maybe, to ask about the Boren Education Initiative. Does that mean  anything to you? That was something Karen, I   m pretty sure, put a bug in  my ear.  S. Holton I   m not sure if she   s talking about the Oklahoma Foundation for Excellence  that is a statewide program that when David Boren was US senator, he  started     Milligan That could be, yep, Foundation for Excellence, yeah.  S. Holton    as a statewide organization. I was a founding trustee back in 1985, I think.  At that time, I had a full head of hair and a beard, and I said I was the token  youth from rural Oklahoma. I   ve stayed on that board and was president of  the foundation in 2008 and had been involved in that. I think that   s what  she   s talking about.  Milligan I think that   s what she was talking about, too.  S. Holton I thought maybe she was referring to the plan to increase the sales tax to  raise teacher salaries, which is also one of David Boren   s ideas. (Laughs)  Milligan I think it was the Foundation for Excellence, but you could also talk about  that if you wanted.  37  S. Holton No, the foundation is good. When it was started, I think there were eight  public school foundations in Oklahoma, and now there are over two  hundred. There are more public school foundations in the state of Oklahoma  than any state. I, from that experience, formed a Poteau Education  Foundation. We   ve been around about twenty-five years. Those foundations  around the state financially have been very supportive of public schools and  also do a lot of teacher recognition, provide funds for teacher training and  continuing ed and special, national conference attendance and that kind of  thing. A lot of neat programs have come out of it.  Milligan What got you started working in that?  S. Holton David Boren asked me to do it.  P. Holton He campaigned for David Boren when he first was running     S. Holton    running for governor and when he was running for senator. I knew him  from that. Seriously, he probably just needed someone from our part of the  state to help start that foundation, and I was over here.  P. Holton We   re a house divided. He   s a Democrat, and I   m a Republican. (Laughter)  Milligan You   ve lingered all these years. You followed in your father   s footsteps.  P. Holton I haven   t always gotten to vote, either, down here. (Laughter) Yes. I  couldn   t deny my heritage. (Laughs)  Milligan Does it cause problems at dinner sometimes?  P. Holton Never.  S. Holton No.  P. Holton We never talk about it.  S. Holton Oh, sometimes I   ll say,    Well, your people   .    (Laughs)  P. Holton Yeah, he does say that. (Laughter)  Milligan What about your children? Are your children one-sided or another  politically, or are they divided?  P. Holton They   re pretty conservative.  S. Holton They are.  38  P. Holton I think I won them. (Laughter)  Milligan Well, I think, for me, that   s all I knew that I, those were my goals. We talked  about this earlier, that we   ve reached my goals, but if there   s anything else  that you all want to add, there   s still some time for you to do that.  P. Holton Do you have any other stories     Milligan    or anything else you want to talk about that     P. Holton Steve had great experiences at OSU.  S. Holton I did.  P. Holton He was very involved and very active.  Milligan Well, if you fell in love every five minutes for the first two years you were  there     P. Holton (Laughs) That was a great experience. (Laughs)  Milligan    not lasting love until the very end, I understand that, but fleeting love.  S. Holton That   s right. (Laughter) I just think Pam and I, we   ve had, like I had talked  about earlier, times when we weren   t as involved because of the stage of our  family life, but we   ve certainly enjoyed almost everything we   ve done with  OSU through the years and have been able to come back these last ten years  or whatever and do things and be involved in them.  P. Holton Yeah, it doesn   t have to be over in your college years. I mean, they   re gone,  by any means.  S. Holton We   re both so impressed with what   s going on     P. Holton Oh my goodness.  S. Holton    on campus.  P. Holton Wow.  S. Holton I mean, we think Burns Hargis just does a fantastic job, but just so many  things are happening. It   s fun because we will go six months, maybe nine  months between visits to campus. The things that happen just in that period,  it seems like the last five years, we   re just blown away when we go back and  39  all of a sudden there   s a new building. It   s not just that. It   s just the  programs and the mindset. Just everything is great.  P. Holton Yeah, the physical appearance, though, does make a difference because I  can remember even through the years when we   d go by the gardens by the  Union and think,    This is an agricultural school. Why does this look so  bad?    and then how they have developed those. My goodness, every time  we go by now, we   re just, it   s beautiful, and it wasn   t that way for a lot of  years. It   s very nice, very comforting, I think.  S. Holton I think other people are   some have been more involved these forty-five  years that we   ve been out of school than others. I mean, they stayed at a  high level of involvement, but a lot of people were like us. They   ve had to  slowly come back as they could. It   s been fun to make contact with some of  those people that we maybe hadn   t really been involved with for twenty  years, and now we   re back at a ballgame or some function and seeing them.  Our classes had a lot of very talented and accomplished people. Out of that  graduating class of    70 and    71, in those years, there were some people that  really have gone on and done some really great things. It makes you proud  of them, proud to be one of their classmates. That   s pretty good.  Milligan Do you keep in contact with many of your classmates?  S. Holton Not as much as we should.  P. Holton Sporadically, just sporadically.  S. Holton When you get back together, it   s always fun. We   re a little off the beaten  path. We just don   t quite attend as many things as some of our old friends  and classmates do, but when we do, we enjoy it.  Milligan (Laughs) Do you more often come up here if it   s a sporting event for football  or basketball or wrestling or golf or any other     S. Holton Maybe a couple of football games a year, and every now and then, we make  a basketball game or catch a wrestling match. Sometimes we happen to be  there for something, and it just works out where we catch maybe three  things. I mean, there will be a baseball game or a wrestling match we didn   t  even know about. While we   re there, we   ll just bounce from one to the next,  just take it all in.  Milligan On top of Grandparents University.  S. Holton (Laughs) That   s right.  P. Holton Yes. That   s a highlight for sure.  40  S. Holton (Laughs)  P. Holton It certainly is. (Laughs)  Milligan We   ve been talking an hour and a half...  S. Holton You   ve got plenty. (Laughter)  Milligan    yeah, if you can believe that.  S. Holton I think you should go through and edit this is what I think. (Laughter)  Milligan No. (Laughter) All right, but I will stop it unless there   s anything else for  real.  P. Holton Unless you have another story, something interesting.  S. Holton (Laughs) No, I   ve told all the stories I should tell.  P. Holton (Laughs)  -------  -------
