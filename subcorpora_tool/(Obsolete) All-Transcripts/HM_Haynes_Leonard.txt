Speaker 1: Okay, now let me ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Leila Davenport, D-A-N--D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R-T, Davenport.
Speaker 1: And the first name?
Speaker 2: Leila, L-E-I-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Atlanta, Georgia, June 12, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Hmm, well mom--well my grand, her mother, Adele Davenport, she died at the age of--I think she was ninety three and she was from southwest Georgia not too far from Plains, as a matter fact where Jimmy Carter was President.  And my grandfather Walter [Davenport] of course he preceded her in death, was from the same area of Georgia and he worked as a foreman in a iron, an iron-making factory and so forth.  My grandmother never worked; she stayed at home.  And beyond--before that not quite sure about my grandfather's father or my grandmother's mother but they were in the, how do I say the beginnings of, sort of like the middle class in the early Atlanta experience and Grandpa was a foreman.  He wore a shirt and tie to work in Atlanta for--and that was very unusual for an African American male (unclear).
Speaker 1: This would have been during the--
Speaker 2: The forty--thirties and the forties, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause he passed away in the late fifties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What kind of business were they involved in?
Speaker 1: Oh I--as my--my grandfather worked in an iron factory.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Iron-making factory.  He was a foreman, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: All right.  So he didn't have to get dirty in the factory?
Speaker 1: Well he, he wore a shirt and tie which my mom reminds me of when she talks about her dad.
Story_ID: 107115
Speaker 1: Are there any stories on that side of the family from the days of slavery or reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Well I think one thing what was interesting when my grandmother [Adele Davenport] passed away where she was in the hospital at Grady Memorial, that's where my mother [Leila Davenport Haynes] was born, Grady Memorial Hospital and I asked her, why was she a Republican, a member of the Republican Party.  I was always curious about that and she said it was a party of [President] Abraham Lincoln.  She said our family had always been that way and so that was an interesting tidbit there.  In terms of history, my mother of course went to Booker T. Washington High School [in Atlanta, Georgia] and she lived in the same neighborhood of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  Matter of fact they went to school together.  She was just a year or so in front of him and so she knew all the King family and they--used to play with them and that sort of thing.  And when mom was in--we lived in South Carolina, she went working on her Master's at AU, Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia].  She and my--would take my sister, they'd ride the bus from Orangeburg to Atlanta and the way that mom would catch a ride she'd catch a ride with King.  Martin was there at the time so she would hop a ride with him.  He'd take her to the campus and so forth.  So I--and it's very you know, you get these little bits and pieces.  And she used to say they called him M.L., and they didn't think he was going to amount to much when he was in high school.  (Laughter).  Of course you know what happened.  The history has already proven that.  I think while--mom was telling me about Grandpa Walter [Davenport] and this foreman there that--that white men respected him you know.  He, he never played the role of a subservient person.  He was a very proud person.  I remember when I was really, really little you know, and he always stood erect till he had a stroke and then he had a cane.  Grandmother of course put herself through night school so she wanted a high school diploma, you know.  And she did that and of course for that period of time that must have been very interesting but she was determined to get it and she did get it, um-hmm.  And of course never worked outside of the home which is also very unusual for that particular period when they, they were coming through and they grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.
Story_ID: 107116
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your mother's personality like?
Speaker 2: Mom [Leila Davenport Haynes] has a very outgoing personality and she's still living.  She now lives in Baton Rouge and she loves music, art.  She taught French and so she's--reads--was a vociferous reader you know and very engaging and has a very sharp mind.
Story_ID: 107117
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well I think mom [Leila Haynes]--my dad [Leonard Haynes, Jr.] was at Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta [Georgia], that's when he met mom.  That's when they met and he was courting her and then they subsequently got married.  Mom was married at nineteen then they moved to Boston [Massachusetts] you know when my dad went up there to work on his doctorate.  Interesting thing about my father, he was the first African American student at the Boston University Theological School [sic Boston University School of Theology].  In other words he preceded [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and dad was the first one to get his degree.  The same people that taught King, taught my father.  And Boston later named him as one of their outstanding alumni of the year of the theology school.
Story_ID: 107118
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Leonard L. Haynes, Jr.  I'm the third and he's, he's a junior, H-A-Y-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Three fifteen twenty-three so that's March 15, '23 [1923], Austin, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well I know a little bit more about my dad's side of the family actually.  I guess you can go back to the 1840s but actually go back further than that to 1741.  Haynes, H-A-Y-N-E-S is an unusual spelling for a last name.  It gets confused with H-A-I-N-E-S and H-A-Y-E-S and the like.  That name came from Barbados in 1741.  There were three brothers named Haynes, all Englishmen who brought their slaves with them to the Americas.  And we are thinking that it was the branch that went Georgia that we come out of because under-- when President Andrew Jackson was the president they moved the Indians out of Tennessee, the Cherokees, and they moved in there.  And there is a town in Tennessee called Haynes, Tennessee.  My great-great-great grandfather was a Cherokee Indian.  His name was Archie and it's around the 1840s and then they moved to Texas outside of Austin, a cotton country, a little place called Morales, Texas, not even on the map.  And now that's where the Haynes family, part of the, my family kind of grew up.  My--Archie, the great-great grandfather had a saying, my grandfather who I'm named after Leonard [Haynes], Sr. told me he would always say, that's for sure.  That was one of his favorite sayings, that's for sure, that's--and my grandfather's dad was Gilbert and was a farmer and so forth in Tex-, that part of Texas. And then the Archie of course was his father who was enslaved but was free, you know when freedom came.  There is a place outside of Austin I've yet to go to it, they've had family reunions there that was called--sort of like Haynes Town.  All the Haynes are buried there.  That we could--wherever they are they tend to come back there.  My grandfather who I'm named after of course grew up Austin [Texas].  He rode a horse to school at Sam Houston College.  You know that's where he went to school.  My father later went to the same school and he graduated.  It's now called Houston-Tillotson [University] and my grandmother [Thelma Haynes], my dad's mom was the first African American woman to be on the Board of Trustees at the now Houston-Tillotson College [sic University], which is connected to United Methodist Church.  I mentioned that because both my grandfather and my father were United Methodist ministers.  My grandfather was a very prominent minister in the state of Texas.  He was the first President of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He did a number of things and he died at the age of 93.  He retired from the ministry in Fort Worth in 1971, but he pastored in Texas and Missouri, in Tennessee and in New Orleans [Louisiana] too where he was the first president of the NAACP in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 107119
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a good story that you remember about your father [Leonard Haynes, Jr.], that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Reverend Haynes, oh yeah I can--there's a lot of them.  Well one of course I guess is why I use the phrase the black experience all the time is cause I really got it from him.  My dad was a philosopher and during the course of his career, he was either between the Church, United Methodist church or one--the college, one of the historically black colleges.  So his last stop before he died was we were in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for almost thirty years.  He was the pastor of Westlake United Methodist Church for twenty-eight years till he retired in 1988 and then he was a professor as Southern University and at LSU [Louisiana State University] at the same time.  But anyway dad would--I'd ask him questions about why were things happening the way they happened in terms of lack of progress on the part of African Americans to do certain things given the opportunities that was available.  He used to say all the time, son you'll come to grip with the black experience.  I said what is that?  He said you'll know it when you see it.  I said--so I interpreted that to mean that what he was trying to tell me, you will be surprised and disappointed at what the race can do.  And then he would all--he'd go on to say remember now your success in life is measured against the race.  If they haven't made any progress you are--you haven't made any progress really.  Therefore it's your responsibility to make sure that you do your best and encourage others to do as well as you've done.
Story_ID: 107120
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now reflect back to childhood.  Now did you grow up in Boston [Massachusetts] or--?
Speaker 2: No.  My earliest recollection of Boston was I suppose I was around the age of three.  We were still there.  I think I remember standing in front of a window looking at the train yard.  My dad [Leonard Haynes, Jr.] was in school of course at the time and was also the superintendent of an apartment building so we lived in the basement.  And mom [Leila Davenport Haynes] said we weren't near a train yard.  I remember seeing that's a local--the age of locomotives was still going on then so the steam engine which fascinated me.  But I left there and went to St. Louis to live with my grandfather while my dad you know finished and everything and I stayed in St. Louis for a while.  And then when we--my dad graduated we moved through the South.  I started my--we were in Little Rock, Arkansas first when he was at Philander Smith and then--but I actually started school, first grade in Pine Bluff, Arkansas when we were at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.  So we were there--I was there for first and second grade, then we moved to Orangeburg, South Carolina where I was in third, fourth and fifth and he was a Dean at Claflin College at the time.  Then we left Orangeburg and went to Morristown [Tennessee] where he was President of Morristown Junior College [Morristown College, later Knoxville College-Morristown], which no longer exists [closed in 1994].  So I was in sixth and seventh there.  And I say part of seventh cause then I went to Fort Worth [Texas] where I finished the rest of--my grandfather was in Fort Worth so I went there.  And then to Wylie [Texas], to Marshall, Texas where I finished the rest of the seventh grade--no, the eighth grade and then on to Baton Rouge where I started ninth grade.  So we've--and I point that out cause we spent more time in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and so for the ninth grade on up through college, and my mother still lives there, I guess we have to call that the home.
Story_ID: 107121
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when you reflect on your early life when you were a little kid, can you give us an idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  Well, I have a lot of memories.  As I told you the trains in Boston [Massachusetts], I remem--recall that.  I remember when my grandfather took me to Sportsman Park in St. Louis [Missouri] to see Jackie Robinson play.  Remember going to Ebert's field to do the same cause my mother [Leila Davenport Haynes] had aunts and so forth and going up to the polo--looking at--they lived in the Bronx [New York City, New York] so you could look down into the polo grounds from where they lived and you know I, I remember all--the Coney Island rollercoaster.
Speaker 1: You could actually see the games from there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, you can sit right on that hill and I remember looking, looking down sitting on the sidewalk you know.  I remember that when I was a young boy.  The Luray Caverns, my dad used to take us everywhere.  We'd go out to California riding--I got on Hopalong Cassidy's horse.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Stagecoach, the cactuses, the Pacific Ocean, many, many memories of--and even today my mind will float back and forth.  I'll see these images all over again you know.  I had a rich, a rich life.  I had a lot of opportunities that came my way and they--my dad and mom believed exposing you to everything, you know.  I remember we were at Claflin [University, Orangburg, South Carolina], the first time I heard the name Thurgood Marshall [former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court].  This was when they took--he took me--he was on campus one evening.  I didn't know who he was but he spoke in the gym.  I can remember that, you know, this tall light-skinned guy and I was just a little fellow.  I was like in what, fourth grade or something.  I remember that.  By the same token I can remember if you didn't get your time tables correct you got a whipping at school.  (Laughter).  And also everyone didn't take a bath every night.  It was every other night for conservation of water.  It was just, you know an access--and one of my class, my classmates in South Carolina, my sense of appreciation of what was going on in the world, I guess I was in the fifth grade.  His father had fought in World War II, so we used to play with all of his medals and patches.  And I used to wonder where did these things come from you know.  And they were from the war, World War II.  And South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] had a World War II Museum at that time where they had German--you know, things they had taken from the Germans, the Nazis and so forth, interesting.  I had a dog at that time--Lassie, we used to ride all over, all over the South Carolina State campus because Lassie was a popular television series so I named my dog after (unclear, laughter).
Speaker 1: Did your dog look anything like Lassie?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a, it was a--what was Lassie?  Lassie was kind of like a Setter.  Kind of like a Setter yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it male or female?
Speaker 2: It was a female and she had a lot of pups and we named them Colonel, Captain, and General.  I don't know whatever happened to them.  Lassie subsequently got killed by a farmer I think in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  She got inside the chickens you know was going after the chickens.  He shot her.  It was horrible.  But almost everywhere we, where we lived you know it was certainly an experience, you know.  I haven't even mentioned the ones in Texas, but I can remember the extreme cold of Fort Worth [Texas] during winter. In my opinion, it was real cold. And the very, very hot weather in the summer time, that I, I can remember that.  And Louisiana of course is a, sort of a sultry kind of place where the pace is not as fast but the mosquitoes are very big and the roaches are even larger.
Speaker 1: That's where they fly right?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what me and my brother would say.  Here they come.  We called them helicopters cause they could lift you up.  (Laughter)
Story_ID: 107122
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well now what kind of a little boy were you growing up?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I think I was a--my mom would say I was a good kid.  I, I liked to read.  I liked to play.  I had a lot of imagination about, you know, everything, airplanes, jets, played piano, tried to play the cornet, loved sports, you know.  You name the sport--cause we had the balls so I mean, if we don't show up, no one got to play in the neighborhood--and very impressionable with television.  I actually made a television commercial.  This is amazing to me when we lived in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  I believe I was one of the, probably one of the first blacks on tele--commercial television.   I was selling hot dogs.
Speaker 1: What did you say?  Can you remember what--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I had on a little cowboy outfit with the (unclear).  I had a little lasso and I says, buy these hot dogs.  Now that was before royalties and all this other stuff so I don't think we got a dime.  But no, I was, I really was active and kind of loved sports.  I did, I played everything, you name it basically.  And if it was a ball, I was around it, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you play little league in baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Played little league base--my brother did too.  I was the pitcher and he was the catcher.   And then when I got to high school of course I played high school football.  I was a good high school football player.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: In high school I was on the line.  I played guard at Southern University Laboratory High School [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And we won, I think we won most of our games.  I think we only had one bad year.  And I just saw my coach on July the 4th.  We were down--went home to see mom and he--that Sunday we were at church and Coach Owens [Larney Edward "Coach" Owens Jr.; deceased 2009] is still living.  He's ninety years old.  He's amazing.  My high school coach is still living.  And I looked up and said--he said hey man.  I said what?  Yeah but he--but we had a good high school football--had a good sports program.  Everybody played you know, so--I didn't play basketball.  I played football, played baseball.  One year I played baseball.  Then I went on to play at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  I played football at the main campus and matter fact I had a scholarship to play football.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107123
Speaker 1: Now back to grade school, I mean now you moved around quite a bit.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have trouble--
Speaker 2: Adjusting, no?
Speaker 1: Yeah, maintaining friends everywhere you went?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  I guess the only thing that troubled me with one of the moves we made and I guess this was when I was in seventh grade, we left Marsh Town to move to Texas cause my mother [Leila Davenport Haynes] was sick at the time.  My model airplane collection, I left it at the house and, and I never saw it again.  My dad [Leonard Haynes, Jr.]--I guess I never asked him about it.  I never did ever ask him whatever happened to it even as I got older.  But that's the one dark thing that I always remember cause I had built these Revell sets.  You know, I had the ships, I had all this stuff.  I put a lot of time and energy--I still remember that stuff and never saw it again. But in terms of friends naw.  I guess, you know, well my brother was living, of course my sisters were--my oldest sister.  But we never had a problem with adjustment, you know.  My dad was in the Methodist system so I guess we became acclimated, you know, to the idea that one would move.  Sometimes I'd be surprised that we stayed more than a year or so, why we weren't moving, you know.  But that was not my decision.
Story_ID: 107124
Speaker 1: Now, how many siblings do you have and where do you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.  My brother [Walter Haynes] was second oldest.  He's deceased now and my sister Angela [Haynes] and then Leila Ann [Leila Pelichet], my youngest sister.  So it's two sisters and me that what's left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107125
Speaker 1: Now when you were in grade school were there any teachers or personalities at the school that stand out that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  The only one I can recall is Mrs. Mazeek [ph.], my first grade teacher in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  When I became U.S. Assistant Secretary and one of the things that I did, I remember that was to write her a letter and thank her because she was a person that helped me to perfect my ability to read and I remembered that.  And I said you should be proud of your first grade student.  I'm now Assistant Secretary of the United States of America.  Yeah, I remember her, yes Mrs. Mazeek.  Yeah.  She's deceased now but she certainly stands out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, see in high school now you went to high school in Baton Rouge?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started at first--the ninth grade I spent at McKinley Senior High School and then I transferred to Southern's Lab School [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] for the tenth grade and I finished there at the high school.
Speaker 1: The Lab school was probably a little better than the other ones?
Speaker 2: Well my father was teaching at Southern at the--you know he got on the faculty so it was convenient to--well we were living in South Baton Rouge [Louisiana] then we moved inside the city.  We moved from 16th Street to North 39th, so I would just catch the--catch him to school.  And I was--the Lab School was very--it was a good school, very competitive, very competitive.  And as I think back on it--and they prepared us very well for college.  Matter of fact I started college while I was there as a senior.  And I was president of the senior class and I was very active at the high school.
Story_ID: 107185
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about high school and you were president of your--
Speaker 2: Of the senior class.
Speaker 1: --of your class.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, number ten when we graduated.  I was number ten.
Speaker 1: Now with--
Speaker 2: Only guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with such a background--
Speaker 2: There was nine girls in front.
Speaker 1: You've got an academic family in your background.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So was it easy to choose a college?  You were already at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I was at Southern.  I mean I wanted to play football.  That was one of my little goals.  You know you kind of--at that time you know, you could see.  Well I was into the sports thing, you know.  So I had no aspirations beyond--I guess my--I wanted to go to the University of Oregon to be honest.  That, that--if I had--I really wrote them a letter.  I remember writing several but University of Oregon, why Oregon, I just picked it out.  It was in Eugene and I had my friend, she typed the letter and everything, we sent it off.  I think I was accepted but I never got there.  So I wound up going to Southern University and I'm kind of glad I did.  My dad was there and most of my high school classmates the majority, although they went everywhere.  See, remember now, when I was in high school, was at the time when integration of the public schools started to take place.  So--no, let me clear that up, the desegregation of the public schools started to take place. So the--so my classmates who were in the eleventh grade with me, a lot of them left to go desegregate East Baton Rouge [Louisiana] Parish Public Schools.  So we had a different cast in the senior year.  We lost some of the kids.  I was asked to go be one of the initial people but the reason I didn't go was that I couldn't play football my senior year.  See, those who left couldn't play sports initially you know in those segregate--desegregated schools.  So I wanted to you know, to stay active in the athletic field, that's why I didn't transfer.
Speaker 1: Now did you all have a successful football season?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  Absolute--we went to the playoffs.  We went to the playoffs.  We lost to a school from up, gee, up in North Louisiana.  We--they beat us in Lake Charles [Louisiana].  We, we made it all the way to the semi-finals the senior year.  Had a good, we had a good football team.
Story_ID: 107186
Speaker 1: All right so, well tell us--tell me about Southern, about your first year at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, first year at Southern I actually--let me back up, actually was when I was in twelfth grade.  You know, I was--took a test and I got early admissions so I was taking English and history as a senior in high school so--and it was very rigorous.  And the experience there was great because my teacher in history when I was in high school at Southern [Laboratory High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] also became one of my main mentors when I got back to the University, Dr. Cobb, Henry Cobb.  So very--he was a professor of history and spent a lot of time under his tutelage.  I became a history major because of him.
Speaker 1: Now what, what period of time was he--did he focus on basically?
Speaker 2: Henry was--American history was his period but also I guess the African American experience in American history was one of his primary focal points in African history too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is that the aspect of it that really excited you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was always inclined towards history even in high school.  I--that was always one of my favorite subjects was you know social studies--the history of the world and all of that.  I was always intrigued with that.  And around the house my dad of course was a philosopher and theologian.  There was a lot books on religion and so forth and philosophy but he also had a lot of history books.  Yeah 'cause he was also I guess an undergraduate major, history was part of his field too.
Speaker 1: You were coming along really as a senior, you were a senior in '65 [1965]--?
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: '64 [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 107187
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just you know, people were just beginning to talk about black history.
Speaker 2: Yes, just at the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in the public school?
Speaker 2: Preliminary--yeah, well actually that didn't start until around the early--the late sixties and the early seventies is when.  And then when I was in graduate school at Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] is when I walked into the fact that the notion of black history really was about to unfold itself.  And that's when I was taking my master's in American history at Carnegie Mellon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And then, people were starting (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah because you know the quote "the revolution" was showing up on the street around that time.  You know Black Power Movement, you know Soul On Ice [by Eldridge Cleaver], all those things.  It was kind of an electric period during the late sixties, early seventies.

Speaker 1: Okay now, did you ever meet any of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] volunteers or any of the civil rights--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, (born Hubert Gerold Brown)], matter of fact went to the Lab School [Southern University Laboratory High School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  We called him Hubert.  He tried to play quarterback and he could actually throw the ball.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But he left, Hubert Brown.
Speaker 1: Hubert Brown.
Speaker 2: In the summer of 1966, while I'm a student at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] my dad wanted me to have a Washington [D.C.] experience so he sent me up here and it was the first time that I came to Washington was 1966.  I was a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And one of the only people that I knew when I got here was Hubert.  He used to come by and pick me up in his little, he had a little, what was that thing called, MG [car], a little red MG, and take me around the City of Washington, uh-huh, and that was before he became famous.  That was the summer right before he came out with 'burn baby burn' [phrase coined in the mid-1960s].  And when I saw that on television, I said that's Hubert.  (Laughter).  And I subsequently saw him, you know, after a period and so forth and he was kind of a little upset with me because he said I never wrote him while he was in prison, but I didn't know what prison he was in.  And I've since saw him.  I haven't seen him since he's had his latest problems [in 2002, Brown/Al-Amin was convicted for the 2000 murder of a police officer in Georgia] but I knew his wife too, the woman he later married [Karima Al-Amin] who was with the Southern Education Foundation in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of person is he?  I mean what was your impression of him.
Speaker 2: Oh I mean, you know I have--I guess he you know when people blow up and become famous you know, you know them from one setting but you don't know they have the capability to do these other things.  I was surprised, cause I said that's the guy you know--but you never know what transforms an individual when they get into certain settings you know.  How we--
Speaker 1: Did he seem like a real intense person?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh. He was a nice guy.  And I mean we had nice (unclear) regular fellow you know.  We would listen to The Temptations, The Four Tops and all of that.  That was the period you know.  And then of course he had that little sportscar and that was kind of exciting.  I never rode in a convertible before.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I knew him and I'm just trying to think is there anybody else during that period that I ran into?  But Hubert would be the number one personality that I actually knew, you know.  Who participated in the struggle if you will, at that time, at that time.  I may have known others.  Their names just don't come out to me but I probably did.  But I know Hubert did stand out.
Story_ID: 107189
Speaker 1: Okay, now did the movement affect life at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah it did.  There was a student demonstration over--I think it had something to do with public accommodations or so forth.  I remember that period.  Actually it started when I was in high school.  I remember students marching down past the high school.  We could see them out the window.  We did not--I mean the high school students did not join them.  We were still in class, but we remember that period.  My dad [Leonard Haynes, Jr.] was very active in the Civil Rights Movement in Baton Rouge.  He was a member of the, what was called the--what was that thing called, Civil Rights Committee of the city [sic Baton Rouge Council on Human Relations], you know.  It was commissioned with both blacks and whites trying to, you know make the public accommodations, bring all of us together.  And I remember he received, you know, calls and threats and you know and had a little cross burning in front of our yard one time.  I remember that and so yeah it was, it was an interesting period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107190
Speaker 1: So you said history was your favorite subject at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Professor Cox was a--
Speaker 2: Cobb, Cobb.
Speaker 1: Cobb.
Speaker 2: Henry Cobb, yeah.  Yeah he had studied at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] too and he was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and went to Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And he had a way of connecting with people, the young people and I just became one of his favorite students I think.  And it was between he and my dad that kind of pushed me to go on you know to graduate school.  I received a fellowship to go to Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] which was kind of, I think was kind of top drawer at that time.  And of course the Vietnam War was going on too and I was certainly sensitive about the draft.  I was 1-A [draft classification meaning the registrant would be available for service], and when I got to Carnegie Mellon, I actually received a draft notice to report for the physical.  And it was kind of scary cause this was in 1968, I think the fall of '68, I went to the physical downtown at the Federal Building in Pittsburgh and everybody in there was in graduate school.  That's the thing that got me.  All of the fellas that were in there were all in graduate school.  So I did all I could to fail the test but you have to be a moron to fail their army test and I passed it.  And I actually passed the first physical and I got a little concerned cause you know I said well if I go, I'm probably not coming back.  That was my thought process.  So I am, I'm an asthmatic, you know and so I sort of petitioned that they didn't catch that so I took another physical then I was rejected.  And then I was able to finish the war--I mean I finished the period out as a 1-Y [draft classification meaning the registrant would only be qualified in event of a national emergency].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you couldn't get a deferment as a grad student?
Speaker 2: Um-um.  No, no deferment.  I was always labeled 1-Y.  You know I went from 1-A to 1-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still got that draft card around here somewhere just as a reminder of what that period was about.
Story_ID: 107191
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you're in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] right, at Carnegie Mellon [University]?
Speaker 2: At Carnegie Mellon.
Speaker 1: This is different from Baton Rouge.
Speaker 2: Absolutely in many, many ways.  I'm married now.  I met my wife at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  One of the best things that happened was to meet her in front of the library asking her for the time.  What the--what a lame line.  (Laughing).  What time is it?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And she did not have a watch.  I knew that all along.  But she stopped (laughter) and I began to chase her around the campus until I could finally get her undivided attention.  But we got married.  And my dad said you did three things that are interesting and questionable.  A. In 1968, June, I bought a car.  Now this, I had the means to buy one because I'm very entrepreneurial.  I can be that way.  I made some money while I was at Southern selling insurance, life insurance.  I sold life insurance and made a lot of money.  So I bought a car, 1968 [Pontiac] Le Mans car, got married in August and then we packed everything we owned into the car and drove to graduate school in late August to Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  I was accepted but we had no idea where we were going to live so when we got to Pittsburgh we checked into the Howard Johnson Hotel not far from the campus and we stayed there for about two weeks until my wife said--Mary says, I don't think we supposed to stay in a hotel.  We got to find a place to stay.  I said, okay what do we do?  So we had to read the paper, I had no concept, you know.  So it was an interesting experience.  But I enjoyed my time at Pittsburgh and she did too.  We ultimately moved into this--up in Schenley Park--Schenley Hills into this apartment building.  We were the first blacks in the building.  The superintendent was a black guy and he told us that, says you are the first ever and that was a Jewish neighborhood you know so we were kind of surrounded by--well it was all Jews.  I mean it was a Rabbinical School not far from us so we could watch the kids go on Saturday. So all of that was kind of a new experience for us.  And it rained--it snowed thirteen straight weekends, I remember that.  It gets cold in Pittsburgh trust me, it snowed.
Speaker 1: And the hills too (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the hills were there and I had to have chains on my tires--no spike--no, I had studs that's what I had, studs that's right.  Remember those studs, right.  But the pizza was great.  And Carnegie was located next to Forbes Field so in the spring when baseball season started the Pirates were playing there.  You could get in free after the seventh ending.  So Dick Stockton the guy you see on TV, we remember him cause he was the sportscaster for Pittsburgh, KDKA.  I remember that so well.  I saw Willie Mays play, you know, we went to the baseball games.  The [Pittsburgh] Steelers played at the University of Pittsburgh stadium and no one went to see them play so I remember going out there to see them play.  We saw Rudy Bukich [Rudolph Andrew Bukich, football player] so we were a losing team.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The [Pittsburgh] Pirates had Roberto Clemente [baseball player] right?
Speaker 2: Roberto, yeah Roberto was playing at the time, he was playing.  Bill Mazeroski [baseball player], all those guys yeah I saw them play.  I saw them play.  But I met--so you were kind of in that Pittsburgh culture and then I graduated.  It just took me a year to finish my master's degree, which was remarkable.  I thought it would take longer.  But while we were in Pittsburgh I met a guy who's now become my friend of many years, Tommy Bogger, who's now in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Bogger, Tom Bogger, B-O-G-G-E-R.  Tommy's now a professor of history at Norfolk State, but he left Carnegie and went on to University of Virginia [Norfolk, Virginia] and became the first black to get his Ph.D. in American History from the University of Virginia.
Speaker 1: That sounds like it might be tough in those days.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness!
Speaker 1: Virginia being so steeped in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Thomas Jefferson school--are you kidding me?  And Tommy probably--he went through a lot, but he's doing well now.  He lives out of Virginia Beach and doing fine.  He's the archivist for Norfolk, the city of Norfolk, and has written two books, one on the slave experience in Norfolk and one of them The Free Blacks in Norfolk.  So that's, so that's good.
Speaker 1: This is important.  Those that are watching this now may not understand it but for many years when there were no black folks that wrote about slavery.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: John [Wesley] Blassingame [African American historian] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness yeah, or [HM] John Hope Franklin who I finally got my son--I, I'd met John Hope.  He came to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] when I was a student and had met him several times after that and saw him just this past--cause his son lives out here somewhere cause I saw him at the Giant [grocery chain] that we go to this past holiday season.  My son was with me and I--he was coming out of the grocery store.  I said, "Dr. Franklin."  He stopped--because I recognize famous people wherever I--and he turned he said, "Hi, how are you?  Haynes, oh I remember."  And I introduced my son and he said, "Dad, that was Dr. Franklin."  I said, "Yeah, you know from Slavery to Freedom," a premiere eminent guy.
Story_ID: 107192
Speaker 1: But while we were there in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and my wife sub--she did substitute teaching and later got a teaching assignment at--fulltime at Conroy Elementary [now Conroy Education Center] which was right next door to Three Rivers [waterfront park in Pittsburgh] which was just being built.  It was just being built when we were there and we left you know that.  But my brother Walter, who was a--at the time at SMU, Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, was playing football and he was a sophomore that year.  And they came to Columbus, Ohio to open up the Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] football season in 1968.  That was the team that Ohio State had that went on to be undefeated and win the National Championship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Archie Griffin [Ohio State University running back, later NFL player]--
Speaker 1: No, no, not Archie Griffin.
Speaker 2: Wasn't him?
Speaker 1: No, it was Jack Tatum [Ohio State University safety, later NFL player].  Who was the quarterback, Rex Kearns?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That was that team.  That was Woody's [Woody Hayes, football coach at Ohio State from 1951 to 1978] greatest--he always said that was his greatest team.  So Bogger and I and Mary drove over because he was coming so close, Pittsburgh to Columbus is just three hours.  I'm telling you this is--cause it's important.  This is--this changed my life.  We went over to see Walter and we had tickets to the game, we went into the Ohio stadium, never been in the Buckeye stadium before.  The game was great.  The opening kickoff my brother returned for a touchdown.  You can imagine the excitement on my face.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I imagine, yeah.
Speaker 1: I am sitting in the stadium you know, eighty-something thousand people, Mary--
Speaker 2: It was packed.
Speaker 1: --and Walter takes it back and then they drop the flag and call it back, saying that there were twelve men on the field.  But that was a great game and Chuck Hixon [Charles Oliver "Chuck" Hixon, Jr.] who was Walter's quarterback set the NCAA passing record that day.  It still stands.  He threw for four hundred and sixty nine yards that day.  The ball flying all over the field but Ohio State won the game.  So as we were walking out of the stadium on our way back to the car, we walked by the administration building of Ohio State.  And I--my wife will tell you this day, I stopped right there and I says, "We'll be coming back here again."  So--and I subsequently did go back there to earn my doctorate but she will tell you, I actually said that.  We will be coming back here again, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so Ohio State [University] just stood out in my mind as a place where I would be going to, you know.  And low and behold when the opportunity came and presented itself I went right back to that phrase, I said, "Mary, you know I told you we were going back," and that's what happened.
Story_ID: 107193
Speaker 1: Now, what did you write your thesis on when you got your master's?
Speaker 2: Well, at Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] you didn't have to do a thesis, you know, it was just the coursework.  But I think I put a lot of time on urban history and I began to delve into the history of blacks, you know, and the period, you know, the American Revolution up to the Civil War that was the courses.  And then because Carnegie Mellon [University] had a focus on teaching history, I was exposed to the methods of teaching history and so forth.  So I came out, I think I was pretty well prepared.
Story_ID: 107194
Speaker 1: When I graduated I had an opportunity to go to Robert Morris College [sic, Robert Morris University in Chicago, Illinois] to teach but I turned that down and decided to go home.  And so we went back to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] where I would join the faculty at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] as an instructor of history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  I went back so I was one of the youngest people--I was the youngest person in the history department.
Speaker 2: How long did you teach there?
Speaker 1: Well, that time it was one year.
Story_ID: 107195
Speaker 1: I did one year at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Vice President--the then-vice president of Academic Affairs and Dr. Cobb said that I needed to go back to graduate school.  They didn't want me to stay.  So I start saying well I guess we got to find a place to go.  Then I said well maybe what I might want to do instead of going on to get the Ph.D. in history, I'll go to law school.  So I wound up going to Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] for the CLEO Program [Council on Legal Education Opportunity], law school.  I did a summer there then after that went to University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois], to the College of Law, that's where I was in law school.  One year of law school changed my mind about the law.  It was not what I thought it was going to be.  See the Socratic Method is a different way of teaching, so then I changed to the graduate school.  I left law school and went back to graduate school and started majoring in history again.
Story_ID: 107196
Speaker 1: At Illinois?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, at University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois].  And while there, Clarence Dade, who was in Student Affairs, is a black guy--he lives here in Silver Spring [Maryland] by the way.  No, he lives in--yeah, he lives in Silver Spring, not too far from here from Warrenton, Virginia--I met him.  I was in his office and in graduate school.  And then one day he says to me, you know Hayes you have a feel for this policy and all of this stuff.  He says something just came across my desk about an internship in Washington [D.C.]. It was called the Washington Internship in Education and I think you ought to apply.  So I applied and was invited to an interview in Chicago [Illinos].  You know Champaign to Chicago is a car drive.  So Dr. Taylor was the Deputy Director then, Charles Taylor is his name.  He was the last president of Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They just got rid of him.  And while he was president of Wilberforce he called me and says Hayes, we want to interview you for this position.  Now to show you how excited I was, I said well, I can be there.  I'm going to drive you know, I have a--he said drive?   We're going fly you here.  I said no, I can drive.  I said no that's all right, I can drive.  But I didn't know the airplane trip came with it.  So I took a plane trip from Champaign Airport to Chicago and met him at the Hyatt [Hotel] up there.  And he says I think you'd be a good candidate for this and I'm going to make sure that you get into the program.  So I was--I got into the program and then that really opened my eyes to the world of educational policy and its connection to student achievement and advancing the race and all of that.  I could see the dynamics of that and that was a great experience.  It brought me here to Washington [D.C.] periodically although I was based in Springfield, Illinois because I was at the state capital in an educational advisory role.  I got to travel around the country and meet people and that was a critical period of my life I think because it showed me that I needed to get a doctorate.
Story_ID: 107197
Speaker 1: And so at the conclusion of that period is when I went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].  That was the only school I had on my mind.  I applied, got accepted, was interviewed, had nothing to do with any special program.  That was the thing.  I never knew that until after I got there when I ran across students who were there because of a special program, minority students, and I didn't know anything about it you know.  I had a different experience.  But I didn't look down at them or the like but it just demonstrated to me what was going on.  So at Ohio State of course I had as my dissertation chairman a black man.  Matter of fact the three people on my--the three people on my committee, all three were black, unusual for the period, Bill Moore [William Moore Jr.], Lonnie Wagstaff and Russell Spillman.  Those were my three people on my committee, you know.  And of course I wrote a dissertation on the effects of desegregation upon public black housing which was one of the best dissertations written that particular year, during that period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's when I got involved in the black college, the dynamic about--and my goal then was well what could I do to help improve the black colleges?
Speaker 2: Did you study the dynamics of that at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in Ohio at all?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah that was part of my study when I was at Columbus.  Of course Central State was a public institution.  I had to go over there.  At the time the President was Lonnie Newsome, he was the president of Central State so I went out to Central State and then when we would go home for holidays I'd stopped off--I'd drive--we'd drive so--going to Louisiana so we would make sure that we could hit several campuses you know, Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] for example, Alcorn [State University, Alcorn, Mississippi], Jackson [State University, Jackson, Mississippi].  I mean I--we were collecting my data and so forth.  So I had a pretty good study though and got a pretty good feel for what those institutions were like and what their possibilities were.
Story_ID: 107213
Speaker 1: We're talking about the challenge of black studies on black college campuses.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  Well you know we've come to sort of a two phase, an evolutionary kind of thing as well as a developing thing.  And remember Carter G. Woodson was the one that came up with the Negro History Month, picked out February.  And some people took that as a serious academic challenge in the black experience and others ignored it altogether.  Today of course we're still evolving.  Even in the historically black college community the number of blacks who major in history for example is in my opinion woefully inadequate you know.  You just look at the numbers who graduate.  Now that's a function of the job market yes, but it's also a function of lack of attention to their own experience.  As a consequence, we are unfortunately I think graduating people and producing people who have limited background and knowledge of their own experience in a factual way, but they will seize on myth and legend and create something as they go along.  And when they confront the real facts of how we got here, of why we are here, what we've done since we've been here, it becomes something of amazement.  For example, my colleague at American University [Washington, D.C.]just told me last week and he's African American, he directs the American Studies Program there.  He took a group of black teachers out to Arlington Cemetery during this past, last month cause he runs the Civil War Institute [a weeklong summer program at American University].  And one of the black teachers whispers to him as they--he's walking them through the graves and was telling them General So-and-So is here, So-and-So is here.  She makes the statement, where are the bodies buried?  My point is she thought that the stones were decorative.  That's one thing.  And I was sharing that with a colleague the other day and he was telling me, said, "Leonard you haven't heard the worst.  Let me tell you this," and this is another black person.  They just had a study tour go to Paris [France], spend two weeks and come back.  He went out to the airport to get his wife who was one of the chaperones and another husband went out to get his.  And as--he told me, Pierre says they were getting off the plane and they would say hey honey how was it?  She said, oh it was great and do you know the little children there speak French.  So there's a disconnect about what's real and the definition of realities is a moving target now in the black experience.  It's kind of scary.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: It is really scary.
Story_ID: 107214
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) --And young people of course were growing up getting a lot of mixed images, a lot of images of the world in which they live, so much so that the real world to them exists on television and the world that we live in is an illusion.  It's flipped.  So it's very difficult to sustain a legitimate conversation with people on issues of substance therefore I--we're on the map, all over the map, comedy and entertainment seems to draw us in, but even that's superficial cause it's never deep.  And when you try to go deep, you're going deep by yourself cause it ain't too many people you can relate to.  As a consequence, relationships with people are moving targets, it depends.  I have very few friends for example because I know for a fact there are very few people that I have met who can understand what I've gone through, what I'm about.  You know my wife is the same way.  And it's almost scary that you, the older you go and you want to share and exchange but do they have the conceptual framework to deal with it?  And you overwhelm them then they'll think you're trying to be superior.  But no, this is just who you are.  But I'm flexible, you know, I go with the flow.  I've learned that sometimes too much information might--will hurt people in ways in which they'll be damaged for a long time.  But it is a struggle though cause see I have spent a lot of time in the educational arena and as I was saying at my present position today, we've got African American support staff, women, who there is no other place in the work place they could work and earn that kind of money they earn except in the United States federal government.  They're high school graduates.  We have international projects, we give out millions of dollars a year all over this country and--to help U.S. institutions engage in people around the world and yet the support staff has no concept of that.  They just go through the routine.  I produced a map yesterday to make sure that they had a map of the United States.  They'd never seen one before like this that showed them where our projects were.  And one of the support staff came to me today and she said, Dr. Haynes, this is great.  I didn't know we had a project down there.  Now they've been in the government for twenty-something years.  You see what I'm get--this is Washington [D.C.], the capital of the United States of America, arguably the greatest country on the face of the earth with every resource imaginable but yet there is this disconnect.  So if they're saying that, what are their children saying?  You see, this is all tied together.  So it's, it is a struggle.  The struggle continues (unclear).
Speaker 2: And in this country though, it's not just a black problem?
Speaker 1: No.  No, it's universal.  The average seventeen year old can't pick the country out--can't pick the states out on a map. They don't know who their own representatives are.  No concept of the history of this country, no clue.  And the democracy that we're trying to perfect--and I say perfect cause we're not there by a long shot--depends upon educated people to make it work.  The greatest threat is ignorance.  If people are ignorant, they can't participate in a democratic society.  What they're participating in for them is like totalitarianism.  They do what the dictator tells them to do and that's what's scary.  We've got too many young people and too many adults I might add, who are drifting through life with no educational context whatsoever.
Story_ID: 107215
Speaker 1: Well let's, let's go back to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and get you out of Ohio State--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and to what comes next.  Now what-- so how long were you at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: I finished my doctorate in seven quarters, one of the fastest completion rates for any student there.  I was on fire.  I mean every course was an A.  It was like I was energized.  I worked on my dissertation during my first year of coursework.  I had the idea already done.  Every paper I wrote, the courses was another chapter, another element so all my research was being done, I formed my questions.  It was nothing short of amazing.  And actually we had two children at the time and I remember when I was actually writing my dissertation I had sent Mary and the kids back home to the south, back to Louisiana and after a week they were gone, I told them they had to come back 'cause I hadn't written a line.  I needed them around to keep me going.  But I finished my degree, in June of 1975 I marched across the stage and it was a very proud moment, you know the stadium.  And actually during my last year as a graduate student when I was working on the dissertation I was a graduate student in the office of the president of Ohio State University, the first to ever be such.  I worked for the president, Harold Anderson and that was a great experience, you know being exposed to the day to day operation of that major university, and they involved me in everything.  I was kind of like you know part of the team.  And then I finished and he was very influential in my life too.  And I'll say this, when I was--before I graduated an opportunity came up to direct the Black Cultural Center you know and so I'm thinking about my next move once I complete my degree so I made an application to be the Director of the Black Cultural Center before I was--
Speaker 1: Where at?
Speaker 2: At Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Still in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ohio State.   And I was very naive about the process and how it works and selecting and so forth.  But I just said hey, I work in the president's office, I should have a, you know a shot, you know, so I put in.  And then after I'd applied, I guess this was in the spring.  It was in the spring cause it was the spring quarter.  The president called me to his office you know and he smoked a pipe you know at the time, Harold [Leroy Enerson].  He's still living.  And I was standing up and I had this afro you know and it was the day of the afro.  My hair was all out here.  And I said, "Yes, yes sir you called for me?"  "Yes.  Leonard, it says here that you applied for the Black Cultural Center directorship.  I have your application."  At first I was stunned.  I didn't think it went to him.  I thought it went to the Vice President for Student Affairs so what is he doing with it?  And he says, "I'm going to do us both a favor."  I said, "What is that sir?"  And he took the application and tore it up, threw it in the trash can.  And I know my mouth just fell down to my shoes cause I wanted to know what is he doing?  What's going on here?  And he says, "You're probably wondering why I did that."  I said, "Yes sir, I am."  I'm getting a little testy.  He said, "Well, you have an opportunity here to learn how we manage a four hundred and seventy some odd million dollar operation.  The Black Cultural Center is an auxiliary.  Do you know what the definition of an auxiliary is?"  I said yes.  He said, "You know that means it's something you can do without.  So where do you want to be? In something we can do without? Or do you want to learn how we run the operation?"  I stood there stunned and he stood up.  Whenever he stood up that meant the meeting was over.  He said, "That'll be all."  And I walked out.  I went straight home and Mary, my wife, I said, "Mary do you know what happened today?  This guy tore up my application."  I was so mad.  (Laughter).  I was on fire.  I said I don't know what I'm going to do.  She said, "Leonard calm down.  Think about it.  It must be a message there for you.  It's a message for you."  And I think the message was, is that you do have opportunities to learn how everything is being run.  And you have also learn--opportunities to learn how auxiliaries are created and what relevance they have for the actual mission of the institution.  That was the message I left with that.

Speaker 1: So after I graduated from Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], the university offered me a position and I went to work as assistant to the provost of the university, Dr. [Albert J.] Kuhn, and that was--I could have stayed at Ohio State University.  I could be there right now had I not listened to President Enarson again who told me while I was working for the provost I--you need to leave here.  I--we don't want you to stay.  You need a Washington [D.C.] experience and the first opportunity that comes up, take it.  Now Enarson had worked for President Truman [Harry S. Truman, 33rd President of the United States] so I kind of knew what he was--you know I began to listen to him very carefully cause he was a very bright guy and took an interest in me, you know which I guess was probably unusual for a president of a university to do so.  So when I was working for Al Kuhn, he was--I was coordinating the committee on academic misconduct.  I mean I was putting people out of the school and that so I had a lot of power for a young guy with a Ph.D.  And the minority--Frank Hale's operation, the--he was running the minority--what is Frank's thing called?  The Minority Scholarship [sic Minority Affairs, for which Hale was vice provost] I think was doing a program.  Frank Hale was the famous black guy there.  He knew Nelson and everybody.  He was having his spring program in 1976 and the speaker for the moment was Dr. Elias [A.] Blake, who was here in Washington as the president of the Institute for Services to Education, ISE.  Eli later went on to become the president of Clark College in Atlanta [Georgia] and he's back here in Washington now.  But anyway they needed someone to go to the airport to pick him up so I was chosen.  They asked me, "Haynes would you go out and pick up our speaker and bring him to the Fawcett Center where he's speaking," so I did.  So I went out, picked up Dr. Blake at the airport in Columbus [Ohio] and on the way in you know Blake said, "Well young man, what do you do," you know all this.  So I'm explaining myself and so forth and he said "Boy, you, you're working on desegregating higher education?  Well I have a program that's looking at higher education desegregation.  You might want to come work for me."  And then a light bulb went off in my head.  This guy is from Washington.  Maybe this is what the president is talking about.  And so I told him in the car I said "Well hey, that would be something of interest."  He said, "Well I'm going to call you. You know maybe we can continue our conversation."  So he called later and matter of fact he called me from--he was in South Africa.  He called me from South Africa of which I was impressed, you know.  And he said, "I want to invite you to Washington, D.C. to the institute for an interview.  We've got a vacancy.  The director of the Higher Education Desegregation Program is leaving and you are at the top of the list as our candidate."  So I said, whoa!  So I flew to Washington [D.C.] and I got--was interviewed and was selected as the new director of higher education.  And now my twin boys [Jabari and Bakari] were just being born at that time.  That was in June.  So I had to come here for August in 1976 and I got a hell of a pay raise.  I went from $16,000 a year to $24,000.  I thought I had arrived.  So that's how we came to Washington [D.C.] in 1976.  That's how we came from Ohio State.  Could have stayed at Ohio State, today I could be there, you know cause I just--that was a great place.  My wife was a little bit ambivalent about coming but we came and I became director of the Ford Foundation, John E. Whitney Program, Higher ed. deseg [Higher Education Desegregation], did my first, our first books and so forth as a, as the director.
Story_ID: 107217
Speaker 1: Well what were the challenges in this job?  I mean what was your job about and what were the challenges?
Speaker 2: Well, I pioneered the research on higher education desegregation.  You know at the time in 1969, H.E.W. [the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] had issued sort of a ruling that the vestiges of deseg--of segregation had to be eliminated from dual systems of public higher education.  It had gone to court and gotten a ruling upholding that.  So if you looked around the south and the border states you had public black institutions that were segregated, public white institutions that were segregated by law.  And H.E.W. said to receive federal funds you had to eliminate the vestiges of all segregation so I was right on the firing line in terms of the research I was doing, on the information that I put out.  I became very famous for putting out a little newsletter called--what was that thing called--the report, the Adams Report, because the case was Adams [Adams v. Richardson, 1973]. The federal case was called Adams.  I put out--I did it.  I wrote the copy, I ran it off, I walked it to the post office, I mailed it.  I got it out.  And then I wrote this book, The Critical Examination of the Adams Case, a source book which became sort of the defining document that all researchers looked to, to understand higher ed desegregation and it's still used today.  So that brought me into contact with policymakers and key leaders in higher education you know whether they were white or black, didn't matter.  I knew--became very widely known throughout the black college community as a person that did this.  And my success at ISE [Institute for Services and Education] was such that after three years there the National Land Grant Association which ran the office for the Advancement of Public Black Colleges asked me to come down and be their director.  So I left ISE to go head up the Public Black College Office.
Speaker 1: Now there are several I guess--the desegregation of public schools in the north was quite a struggle.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's the southern struggle people I think is more well-known but in the north it was quite a struggle.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: When--in the early seventies in Dayton, Ohio the head of desegregation for the Dayton Public Schools was Dr. Charles Glatt was shot dead in his office--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --by an Appalachian gentleman [Neal Bradley Long] who did not like the idea, just shot dead right in his office.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: It was a very testy period.
Speaker 1: In Boston--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --in--
Speaker 2: That's where my brother was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Boston [Massachusetts] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, South Boston.
Speaker 1: --neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --South Boston.
Speaker 2: South Boston, yeah.
Speaker 1: Plenty of fights.
Speaker 2: My brother had to cover that, right.
Speaker 1: There was a photograph in fact of Ted Landsmark [HM Theodore Landsmark] being tackled from, with the American flag ["The Soiling of Old Glory"] in front of the--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Boston City Council.
Speaker 2: Period wasn't that long ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And even of course with the black colleges that were state, the difficulties they had receiving state support that was equal and fair.  They never received an equal share.  Of the underfunding, the institution I went to, Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] did not receive its equal share from the Louisiana legislature and it had to take the case--and even after the case ruled in their favor the states were slow in responding.  You know they would come up with this reason, this reason, this delay, this delay.  Then of course another governor would come in, he'd reinterpret this and reinterpret--so we're still in the process of still trying to catch up even today and that's almost what thirty years almost--
Story_ID: 107218
Speaker 1: Now how did--there's a, I know there's a controversy in Minnesota in the last couple of years where the mayor or the former mayor of Minnesota [sic Minneapolis, Minnesota; Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton], a black woman of Minneapolis was in contention with the head of the NAACP, [HM] Matthew Little concerning busing in Minneapolis.  The NAACP contended that busing was necessary for desegregation and the mayor was saying well that's passe now to do that.  I mean it's a policy that had its usefulness at one time but now it doesn't really work and it's going to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's a--it is a complex issue, you know.  In this issue of Atlantic Monthly [now The Atlantic], there's an article about diversity [David Brooks, "People Like Us," The Atlantic, September 2003].  Many people use the word diversity, they think in terms of racial terms.  That article is making this point.  But that's not really the fact of diversity--diversity is basically about class you know.  How much money do you have determines where you live, regardless of your race.  Therefore, busing doesn't accommodate that.  They're just on moving fiscal numbers.  And sometimes long distances so far away the kids forget what they're supposed to learn when they get there.  And most of the time the kids who were bused were black kids.
Speaker 1: Well most--almost all the time.
Speaker 2: All the time, bused out of their circumstance and so forth.  Did that help them necessarily?  I hate to say this but I'm a product of segregated schools and many people my age and so forth are who grew up in the South.  I have yet to run across any of my colleagues who grew up as I did although they didn't move as much as I had to or--very proud of their segregated education.  We feel second to no one cause I think we put forth the effort.  Now did we have everything we needed to work with?  No.  I can distinctly remember being in South Carolina where we had to erase the textbooks that the whites used the year before you know and hearing teacher say, "Well you're going to have to be twice as good as a white person so you know you better take this seriously."  But that we were on a mission that education was the key vehicle towards success and improvement and quality of life and we believed that.  And as a consequence, I think I am the person I am today for having taken that message to heart.  Now, having painted that picture of what that was like and with the integration situation cause my own kids have gone through integrated schools, it's worked for them but I think it's even been better--it has worked even better for them because of the support of the family, the reinforcement, and they could question.  So--but everyone doesn't have that sort of situation.  And so this is a function of class, orientation, commitment to education.  Not relying on luck but on rigor and sacrifice with a purpose.  That's where I think--these are the intangibles that you cannot legislate or order by the court.  It has to be in your conceptual framework that you want to improve yourself or to make yourself better and you will do it through an education vehicle. Wouldn't it be wonderful, I often said this to classes that I taught if the students would come in and make a statement whoever they were, we expect to be taught today? And we will not leave here until we are.  But you don't hear that.  My son teaches English at Kennedy High School [Montgomery County, Maryland] not far from this house, young man, just got his masters from Trinity this past May.  And he says, "Dad, the students who give him the most difficult time are the black students."  Now isn't this amazing?  And they're living in the affluent Montgomery County and they're the most difficult students.  There's this disconnect with the reality of where we are.  That's my point and it is a struggle--
Speaker 1: So you're saying we need the support system to accountability?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we need the support--yeah we need a support system and we need to all be on the same page about the value of getting a good education and that's where we're not on the same page.  I didn't say an education, I said get a good one, you know, where reading and writing are treasured, you know.  My mother [Leila] at seventy-seven, still writes me letters.  She takes pride in thinking, putting pen to paper.  She can call me on the phone all the time.  We talk by phone but it's the letter that stands up in my mind, having a moment of recorded history of her thoughts.  My father [Leonard] was like that always writing letters.  He'd talk to me on the phone all the time, but dad would put it in writing.  How many people do we know who can put it in writing of what they're thinking?
Speaker 1: In your opinion was the busing experiment a failure or--?
Speaker 2: I think in some parts it succeeded but I think it wasn't necessarily a failure, it just did not succeed with the objective that it was after, which was to produce equality, equal outcomes.  That I think it failed miserably.  There were no equal outcomes out of that experience.
Story_ID: 107204
Speaker 1: The whole notion of a-- of an integrated society is a goal and I use the word integrated.  But before you can have integration, you must have desegregation and we're still in the process of doing that.  And it goes back to how we view the outcome of the Civil War and I do think that's the most defining period in American history that few people fully appreciate, that it was during this war that this country broke apart over issues not just slavery but economics, orientation, origin, all of this.  It produced a great president [Abraham Lincoln] who was ambivalent about the role of blacks in American society and came reluctant, reluctantly to the conclusion after hearing from Frederick Douglas that to end this war I must break the economic back of the south and to do that I'll free the slaves, but only to end the war.  There was never a concept of what would happen after this happened.  It was just expected that this would just end that part and the country could come back together.  Of course the war was won, the slaves were freed, Lincoln was assassinated and there's been drift ever since.  Now some blacks have appreciated the fact that there is in fact an access to freedom.  Others are still caught in a time warp.  Some whites have appreciated the fact that there's been an emancipation, others haven't.  Some are caught in a time warp.  So--and yet, we've become a more modern society and we carry this cause there's never been a reconciliation commission.  I'm not talking about reparations.  I'm talking about reconciliation.  Who are the people who perpetrated these things?  Have they been pointed out?  Have they been killed?  Well you know Lincoln of course forgave all the Confederate generals and so forth, you know.  [Ulysses S.] Grant gave [Robert E.] Lee his horse, go--you know (throws hands up).  You know, in other words--so that was an attempt to repair the bond that had been broken.  My point is if you just catapult that forward, we are still in the process living that out.  When the Brown v. Board of Topeka [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] decision was rendered in 1954, remember the Warren Courts said with all deliberate speed there must be integration.  And my father [Leonard] who was very active during that period in the civil rights movement said to me, I remember him telling me, he said son, you know we made a great mistake.  We assumed once the court had acted that it would happen right away so we took our foot off the pedal and just assumed that things would happen.  And of course they didn't.  Then they had to go back and take to the streets, you know King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], direct action, and so forth and so on.  And even that, King was viewed as sort of an oddity by a lot of blacks you know at the time.  Why are you doing this?  You know, peaceful solution, turn the other cheek, when you had another element saying, we need to burn it down.  When that element was saying burn it down, what was going to be rebuilt in its place?  You remember the riots that sprung up and you still see the remnants of the riots in almost every community where the riots took place.  My friend at the Washington Post, Courtland Milloy, wrote a piece about the Martin Luther King Avenues and the Malcolm X Drives, they're always located in the most downtrodden part of any community.  If both men were alive today they would be wondering, "How did this happen?  Where did they go wrong?"  So I'm giving you this, sort of the discursive commentary in answer to the question about how do you have an equal society?  We're not there yet.  We know we're a young country too.  We're what, 227 years out since 1776, compared to other societies.  So we're still in the fermentation piece.  We're still fermenting.  There have been no conclusions.  In my lifetime I've think we've made some progress but we sure have a lot--long way to go.  And actually I think we're regressing if I listen to rap music.  And if I listen to the events of the day, Mr. Bryant and Company [Kobe Bryant was arrested in July 2003 after allegations of sexual assault], you wonder where--what is happening?
Story_ID: 107205
Speaker 1: Now let's, let's pick up your career from--you're in [Washington] D.C. and you are in charge of (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, the black, public black colleges and I did that for three years very successful.  I opened up opportunities I think for the public black college community to raise money.  I was the first Washington [D.C.] director.  Heretofore, the only institutions that had received any kind of recognition or notoriety were members of the United Negro College Fund.  But those were forty-two private institutions.  It did not include public institutions.  So I was the director that kind of raised the profile of the state institutions at a time when they were in the process of pushing for equal treatment in their respective states.
Speaker 1: These are the all black schools (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, they're--yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --like Southern and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Grambling [State University, Grambling, Lousiana] and Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]-
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right, Lincoln University Missouri [Jefferson City, Missouri], Alcorn [State University, Alcorn, Mississippi], Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi], Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina], you know all of those institutions I represented them here in Washington.
Speaker 1: And there was fear in the black community at one time that these institutions would be destroyed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was sort of a scare tactic.  I mean the truth of the matter is, even today, if the institutions did not exist today, they would have to be created--
Speaker 1: Well the--
Speaker 2: --because the need is there.  No one can serve that population and serve them well like they have done for almost over a hundred years.
Speaker 1: Well the fear was that integration itself would destroy these schools because if--
Speaker 2: Well I remember that and I remember dealing with that.  But that was never--that was never a worry of mine cause I knew that these institutions were probably the last hope for the race that if it can't get done at predominantly black institution, because they had taken the schools from us as a result of desegregation activities you know with busing and so forth.  They closed all the good high schools, took the good coaches out, took the good principals out, just juggled people around, but they didn't do that to the black college.  They stood the storm.  And by and large if these institutions were not here today I do think and I believe that the black community would create black colleges because they're--the need is there.  Nobody else does what they do.
Story_ID: 107206
Speaker 1: So now how long did you work with the black colleges again, about two years you said?
Speaker 2: Well I was director for three years but actually you know I started my work at ISE so I, I've put in six years.  And then I left to go back to my alma mater Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Lousiana] as executive vice president of the university.  The plan was I would go back as executive VP and I would succeed the president and become the president of the university.  That was the plan.  So I went back you know and did a good job.  I was the youngest executive vice president.  At the time Southern had three campuses you know, one in Shreveport [Louisiana], one in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and one in New Orleans [Louisiana] and of course the law school [Baton Rouge, Lousiana].  And I served under Jessie Stone who was a noted civil rights lawyer of the state of Louisiana, was very active in the civil rights movement and was sort of a political presence if you will.  Was a lawyer by training, was constantly pushing the envelope in the state of Louisiana to kind of fess up and give us our fair share so I served with him.  But at the time I went there the governor of the state of Louisiana was a Republican governor.  And of course when the race came up for governor again, a Democrat won and that was Edwin Edwards.  And Edwards decided to turn the universities over to the black caucus.  That was their payoff for his winning the election. And the caucus was always kept at bay by Dr. Stone cause he didn't want them meddling in the affairs of the campus.  Remember blacks were just getting into the legislative process at that time and the most--was it the largest item on the state budget in Louisiana were the two black state schools, Southern and Grambling and they wanted to run both of them.  So Stone lost his job as the caucus took over and so I left and went back to the faculty as Southern's professor of history.  And they got their own president who they brought in who was a kind of a disaster unfortunately.  He didn't know what he was walking into but Southern's been gone ever since.  It's gone down ever since.  But--so I went back to the faculty and became professor of history and taught there for five years.  And then an opportunity kind of came up to become the Assistant Superintendent for the state of Louisiana.  I was the first black to be over academic programs for the whole state under the administration of Bill Cody.  Will, Wilmer Cody who was the state superintendent, he selected me, put me over elementary and secondary so that was quite an honor, you know to be dealing with K12 in the whole State of Louisiana.  Like you know go through busing and segregation and all that and all of a sudden bingo, here I am as the number one official over elementary and secondary education.  That was really at--that was really something.  I haven't--I didn't get a chance to get that to sink in because I had not quite finished the whole year when the presidential election took place in '88.  And then shortly after that I received a call and I really wasn't a political person, per se, invited me to come to Washington [D.C.] to interview under President Bush I administration for a senior position in the administration.  And I came up, initially I thought I was going to go to be the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights because you know I had done all my work in that area.  And when I got to Baton Rouge and I got a call saying no, you're going to be over post-secondary education.  And that was one of the largest units in the Department of Ed [Department of Education], thirteen billion dollars.  So I was the first African American Assistant Secretary for Post-Secondary Education.  So I came to Washington [D.C.] again in 1989.
Story_ID: 107207
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what did that job consist of?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, over all student aid, everything, all student aid programs, Title 3, TRiO [Federal TRiO Programs], everything to do with the Higher Education Act from 1965 I was responsible for, which was a major job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was 6'5" when I took the job.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You get kind of hammered down from--
Speaker 2: Right.  Beat you down, beat you down, beat you.  I knew I was in the big leagues when after I'd been on the job--and I was confirmed by the senate you know that nobody voted against me.  My confirmation was smooth, ninety-eight to zero.
Speaker 1: Now were you known as a Republican at this point or did--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Just not--you never--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, I was just an educator.  I'm a younger, a little younger then but had a lot of credibility.  I was--people in Washington [D.C.] knew who I was and so forth in the higher education community and consulting; my reputation was very positive and so forth um-hmm and so I was selected.  So I came up and took the job, became a presidential appointee.  It's a big thing.
Speaker 1: It is a big thing.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it's on the wall there, yeah.  "The Honorable" for life.
Story_ID: 107208
Speaker 1: What--was the Bush Administration [President George H.W. Bush] helpful?  I mean was it--could you do what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I did not have any problems doing what I wanted to get done.  I was--I had to comp--I did not compromise any of my you know concerns.  I did a lot for the historically black colleges while I was assistant secretary. And a number of things happened.  I kept some schools from closing.  You know I mean just--and that part aside, became an advocate for international education.  I started some programs that we still have today.  I'm now with the European Union and so I did a lot.  I mean it was a great job.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed my time at the department.  I spent two years there and then I left and went to work with the United States Information Agency as Director of Academic Programs where I finished you know the rest of the term in administration which was also a great job.  I became the first black director there too.  I was responsible for all the Fulbright Programs and all the international exchanges and so forth.  That's why I have a lot of international in my background and so forth.  That was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sandye Jean McIntyre over at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] was involved with the Fulbright--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear) and yeah so I was over the whole thing.  It was a hundred million dollar program at the time.  So I was traveling all over the world.  It was a great experience, probably my best job but--except this one right here too cause it's international.  I always liked the internationals.
Story_ID: 107209
Speaker 1: Okay.  So currently--well you were acting president of Grambling [State University].
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's right.  Nineteen ninety-seven [1997] I got a call, I was here in Washington [D.C.] at the time. I was in the private sector just finishing up---well and actually I was at a point where I was thinking about coming back into the world of education.  And I got a call asking me to come back to Louisiana to assist the president Ray Hicks of Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] who was having the problems.  The governor had had a blue ribbon commission report talking about mismanagement and so forth and so on.  There were a number of issues there.  So I went back as the provost, the number two position at Grambling, my initial--and shortly after I got there (phone rings)--
Story_ID: 107210
Speaker 1: So I went down as the provost at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] in July of '97 [1997].  I was to reconfigure their academic programs and put the thing in shape, help with the management issues and so forth.  And I'd had a Louisiana experience so they wanted someone who had the kind of experience I had.  And I had national visibility.  So I went.  The idea was to help Ray Hicks, the president and shortly after I got there, Ray had problems with the board.  There were some issues that I didn't have anything to do with.  And I was at Yale on a trip for the university in September and I was meeting with Harry Lee [Henry Lee], the one who did the O.J. Simpson trial--cause see we were about to start a program in--what was that thing that he was doing?  My goodness, I forget the name but it's how you look at clothes and data [forensics], you know and all that.  I forget.  It's a field.  It's escaping me right now.  But we were going to start that same program and we were going to have Lee to come down and give a talk to our faculty about how to put this program together.  So I met Lee and he took me to his lab.  He's an interesting guy.  But anyway, when I got back from that trip, I turned on the television set and there was Ray Hicks talking about he was not going to resign.  I didn't know what was going on.  I called him immediately from my little apartment and I said, "Ray, I'm looking at you on TV this morning.  Is there something I need to know?"  He said, "Aw man, come to the president's office at eight o'clock."  I said, "Fine, I'll be there."  So I went there.  He said, "Haynes I've got to step down."  I said, "Well what happened?"  He said, "Well the board and I, we aren't in agreement."  I said, "Well what about me?"  (Laughter).  He said, "Well you call the board chairman."  So I called the board chairman, Mr. Barham [E. Edwards Barham] and he says, "You had nothing to do with this.  Ray's got to go and we're going to ask you to run the school until we figure out which way we're going to go."  So that's how I became acting president and I immediately took charge and corrected a number of problems that the university was experiencing.  They had a three and a half million dollar deficit I eliminated.  I had to deal with the very sensitive issue of Coach Eddie Robinson who was in the last year of his tenure as president--football coach of the legendary Grambling Football Tigers.
Speaker 2: He was in his eighties (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well he was--no, he was not in his eighties, he was like seventy, Eddie was seventy-five [sic seventy-eight].  But at the end, it was coming to the end.  It was a lot of pressure for people to--causing him to--calling for him to step down, the alumni.  It was a lot of you know a lot of issues.  But I liked Coach.  He was great.  So I got him to retire and I made him assistant to the president and gave him an honorary degree.  I thought he had one from Grambling.  He didn't.  They--there was--you just won't believe how they treated him.  I felt so bad.
Speaker 2: He was an icon--
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: --of American sports, everybody (unclear).
Speaker 1: Except at home, except at home, a lot of jealousy and envy about Eddie.  But that was a sensitive situation.  And then of course I hired Doug Williams you know as the football coach and Doug came here from Washington [state, where he coached the Washington Redskins].  So that was a very interesting period and I did a lot.  Then they add--then in December of '97, the board came to me, they said, "We're going to run a search for a permanent president." And I told them I was not going to be a candidate 'cause I was doing too much--I had too much on my plate and I didn't have time to campaign in the political way that they do in Louisiana cause it's like running for office.  So the chairman says, "No you got to do this.  You are our candidate."  So I said well fine.  So they had the little search.  I was in the top three and thought the job was going to come to me but then they selected somebody else who had no experience.  And two members of the Board after the selection was announced and said the least qualified person was chosen.  When I heard that, I knew I had to leave.  (Laughter).  So I left at the end of my tenure.  When I--I conferred the degrees in '98 and stayed a month or so and then I came back.  I took a leave of--I had a--they gave me a leave of absence so I came back to Washington [D.C.].  I came back to Washington and, but then to do some research around economic impact effects on black colleges.  I was working with a company.  And then the control authority that was running the city of Washington [D.C.] asked me to work for the school system and I went to work with the--I went to the control authority and I work with the D.C. public schools and I sort of serve as an advisor to the superintendent then and that's how I got involved in K12.  And that was interesting.  I mean you're talking about reality hitting you home.  See, at one end I'd been in higher education so I know how the kids were trained but to actually be in an urban system to see what in fact happens to kids from K through 12 in a city that's the nation's capital was an eye opener.  You know the performance of kids in D.C. public schools is awful.  The school system itself had collapsed.  You know the city had collapsed and the control authority had to--was appointed by the Congress to take it over to put it back into good shape.  It was depressing working for D.C. Public Schools and exciting at the same time.  The potential was there but the people who were doing it to each other were all black.  There were no white people who were causing these problems.  These were black folks and it's still going on.  There's not a week that goes by that you don't read the paper in Washington and find out something else has happened to D.C. public schools.
Story_ID: 107211
Speaker 1: What is the, in your opinion, is the essence of the problem?
Speaker 2: Incompetence.  Incompetence and mediocrity, accepted as the norm.
Speaker 1: It seems--
Speaker 2: That's basically what has happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I think it's almost--see Howard University is in Washington [D.C.], arguably one of the finest institutions in the city.  It is.  My oldest son is a graduate of Howard and I taught there for a little bit. I think there is an envy of the prestige that Howard once held with the medical school and all that stuff, by people who couldn't get there.  Well the people who couldn't get there wound up working in D.C. government.  See, [HM] Marion Barry made that possible.  He created the middle class but many of them were not well trained but yet they rose up, they found themselves into positions and they have friends and relatives who they promoted and hooked up with various things and that.  And then there was a disconnect between how they were embellishing themselves and enriching themselves and actually what they were dealing with.  As a consequence, they couldn't identify with the kids that they were responsible for because they were living in PG County or getting ready to move to Mitchellville, you understand what I'm saying?  So--and where were their kids going to school?  Not there but somewhere else.  So the problems of theft, greed, incompetence of the first order, it's just rampant.  It was just, it was just awful.
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is that this is a politically--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --appointed group of people who--
Speaker 2: Basically by way of a political--by patronage.
Speaker 1: Yeah, patronage--
Speaker 2: Patron, patronage.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) people who--
Speaker 2: Not necessarily by competence, by patronage.  Now there are some good people in the system, don't get me wrong.  There are some good schools.  There are some able students who have the capability and the potential to do extremely well but they get lost in the shuffle because they're dominated by the other half.  As a consequence, that's why the problems.  I had a meeting with Secretary Paige [Rod Paige, Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005] once last year and Secretary Paige of course came from the Houston School System and was voted superintendent of the year and Houston's an urban system.  And he said to me, Leonard, what is wrong with the D.C. public schools?  I don't understand it.  And that's a fair you know, question.  I couldn't respond to him.  I said it's not in the textbooks.  This is a result of a, of an accumulation of things.  And to correct it will take more than tomorrow morning.  It will take probably another lifetime.  But you have the infrastructure and you have to hold their feet to the fire.  But while I was working with the D.C. schools of course there was another election that took place in the national scene and of course Mr. Bush number two was elected.  And shortly after that I was asked to come back to the administration, to the Department of Education.  And so I left the D.C. schools and went back, came back to the Department of Ed, initially as the Special Assistant to the Secretary.  And now of course I'm no longer under the political end, I've now gone back into the career service as a Senior Executive Service, in SES.
Story_ID: 107212
Speaker 1: Now, you know, pardon me for asking this but I have to because it's a--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --sort of begs--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --for a question here.  Is--now you were appointed by both--
Speaker 2: Bushes.
Speaker 1: --George Bushes [President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean the average person would think, says well is this a black conservative?  Is it someone who is a right wing person or I mean why did they consider you as somebody that they would want in this position?
Speaker 2: No I've never had a label put in me.  I am you know--I belong to the Republican Party.  I've never seen myself as conservative or liberal titles.  But there are philosophies which I think are--make sense, you know.  I mean what's wrong with hard work, sacrifice, rigor?  Those are not antithetical to things that I have been a part of most of my life.  And as I told you early on, my grandmother was Republican.  My father was a Republican you know.  It was Republicans in my family.  I--and it was never an issue, you know.  I've always gotten along with everybody and made no apologies about who I am.  And if I can do it, I can do it.  If I can't, I won't.  I've never been asked to turn the race in, you know.  I've always been a person I think if you check the record out, who's probably made more things happen, you know, as a consequence of being who I am and where I am.  So that's never been a problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just you know, it's like something that would beg (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and I'm sure that--yes, I'm sure, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I feel you know sometimes it--of course you know in every party you got all kind of factions, you know, Democrat, Republican no matter (unclear) run the gamut.  But I have kind of kept in the back of my mind that you do what you can to make change that's positive.  And my dad says you know, the party of Abraham Lincoln, the party of emancipation, got to make it real.  You--and to do that takes a lot of energy and drive and you will stumble along the way cause you got some people that don't want to have any progress and on both sides they are.  And you'll meet them when you know them and part of them are involved in the black experience (laughter), that's what he told me--
Speaker 1: Well you know--
Speaker 2: --which is true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of our leaders from time to time have called for--significant black leadership has called for, from time to time, a complete independence of the black voters in the first place.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: [Frederick] Douglass called for it--
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson has called for it.
Speaker 2: Even Booker T. Washington raised the question about this and [W.E.B] DuBois even raised a question about this.  And see I have in my background I guess my orientation has been advancement of the race.  That's--and that was a theme that I heard over and over again.  I, you know I said you know my success was measured by how well the rest of the race is doing.  If the rest of the race is not doing well, you have not done enough yet.  Therefore, stay busy and press on.
Story_ID: 107154
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now one policy issue I wanted to ask you about is the school voucher issue.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what are your feelings about school vouchers?
Speaker 2: Well vouchers, I mean as I said my experience at the [Washington] D.C. public schools taught me that hey, the current system as it's constituted is not working therefore, let's try something else.  You can't depend on one thing to do it so I'm for charter schools, I'm for alternative learning sites.  I mean we don't have the magic, silver bullet just yet.  A voucher, if it allows a kid to get into a better educational setting, give him a chance to use it.  So I have no problem with that.
Story_ID: 107155
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're currently Director of Fund Development for--
Speaker 2: Fund for the Improvement of--
Speaker 1: Fund--okay.
Speaker 2: Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, my glasses (unclear).  I was looking at a blurb.  But yeah, well what do you do in this capacity?
Speaker 2: All right, FIPSE, the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education has been in business for thirty years.  This is our thirtieth anniversary.  It is a program that is responsible for supporting innovation in higher education or post-second--anything above the twelfth grade.  It has a rich history of making these kind of improvements.  The staff that I have, they're almost like a college faculty, you know.  They, they're--we're the equivalent (unclear), what we do is a discretionary grant program.  We hand out grants for people who write innovative proposals about improvements they can make in higher education.  And it runs the gamut whether it's access, retention, curriculum reform, international.  We've got projects for example with Europe, with Brazil, with Mexico, with Canada.  We're thinking about exploring the possibility of developing projects in Africa and with the Middle East.  So this is an exciting program and I'm proud to be a part of it because it's the jewel of the crown of the Department of Ed.  This is the little, one of the prize programs that the United States Department of Education operates that impacts higher education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 107156
Speaker 1: Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well I would hope that we would take seriously this notion that it is important to place a high value on getting a good education.  We are not there.  I think we've got to come to this conclusion if we're going to improve and make the progress that we need to make.  How do we do this?  I'm not sure.  I don't know what the magic wand is.  I think we need to have the media, the entertainment industry, the sports industry, they all need to speak with the same voice that whatever you are looking at, at the end of the day you've got to get a good education.  If our young people can hear that and it's repeated over and over again, I think they will be more serious about studies, will challenge the way they're being taught or demand that they be taught and we'll see some systemic change happen.  Until that happens I think we're going to drift a little bit.  I think health-wise I would hope that our people will take seriously the matter of their health.  The number of fat people who are out of shape, high blood pressure, HIV/AIDS is just incomprehensible.  Our race is more affected by poor health habits and eating habits than probably any other group.  We're killing ourselves you know. The murder rate among young blacks is too high.  We're doing this to each other.  We got to take serious the notion that a life is precious and you should take serious the notion of being alive and wanting to do your best while you are alive to help others so they can help themselves.  So health is an issue.  Education, I think between education and health, those are the main ones.  I will also say the issue of faith too. Faith, religion of course is an issue of faith.  You either believe or you don't.  But whatever it is, you need some sort of anchor to kind of guide us through the difficult times and through the times that are prosperous so you can keep it in perspective from a philosophical--that we are not just here, that there is some higher authority, whatever you want to call it, that's trying to order the universe and you need to kind of come to grips with where do you fit in this whole scheme of things, what's your role?  And everybody has a role.  As my dad used to say all the time, you never know when history is going to call you to the stage.  But you will be called if it's only for thirty seconds or a minute, there will be something that you do in your life will have an impact on the way the history of the world is written.
Story_ID: 107157
Speaker 1: Sir, at this juncture in your life, you're still fairly young, what will you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would think that I would want people to know that my legacy has been that I've tried to make a positive contribution in advancing the race.  That's been what my whole objective has been.  The alternative is unacceptable in my mind.  We know what that is.  But every day I get up, I'm just trying to figure out how can I make this better?  And then to deal with the question, how good is it, to define that for myself.  I don't think I've--I'm at the end of the line.  I think I still got about two or three more things I still need to get done.  But I think pushing the envelope on causing kids to aspire to act on that which they can imagine, 'cause imagination is very important I think in one's life and we don't have enough people who imagine things anymore.  They don't dream.  We need to dream big dreams and my dad was always pushing that, if you got a thought, dream it and go out and try to make it happen.  We live in the greatest country I think where opportunity is available to anybody.  I have seen examples of people who started with nothing who have everything now.  I've seen the opposite, people who had something and lost it all.  So you can do it here.  If you can't do it in the United States of America, I don't know where you can do it.  That's why I'm proud to be a citizen of this great country.  Believing the ideals, we're not there by a long shot but I think we--what I've tried to do is to get people to understand it, it's--you can do this.  It can happen to you.  It just takes application and dealing with a concept of sacrifice and a commitment and faith.
Story_ID: 107158
Speaker 1: Okay.  And finally--well, is there anything that you would do differently when you look back?
Speaker 2: No.  I couldn't--I, I couldn't--I've thought about that all the time.  No, I think you're on the path and if it's meant to be, it's meant to be and you make the best of it.  Lot of people say, if I could have, would have, should have, you don't have those choices.  You start down the path, history calls you to the stage and you have to do your thing.  You don't get a second shot.  People say they get a second shot but it's not doing exactly what they did before.  They're doing something just a little bit different.  Even an athlete who says I need a second chance, he may not run as fast as he used to run but he's out on the field again.  But you can't go back and call it back.  You know you have to do it while you're here.
Story_ID: 107159
Speaker 1: And lastly, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hmm, yeah what is the epitaph that's on the tombstone?  Well as I said: "He did his best to make a positive contribution to improve the quality of life for everybody.  And he was devoted to his family and gave them his best, didn't always succeed but he didn't fail."
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Very good.
Story_ID: 107160
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is Gilbert Haynes, my great-grandfather and it's shot on the doorstep of his house outside of Austin, Texas probably in a little community called Morales, Texas.  Don't know what the age is on that.  That was probably taken maybe around the turn of the century.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Oh and this is my family: three sons, Leonard, IV on the far right.  The one with the glasses is Jabari and between him is his sister Eboni, then my wife Mary, then me, and Bakari who is Jabari's twin.  That was taken during the Grambling-Southern [Grambling State University, Southern University] football game in 1967 at the Super Dome.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Perfect, next.
Speaker 2: I know some Bakaris and Jabaris, about three or four of them actually really.
Speaker 1: This is when a served as United States Assistant Secretary for Post-Secondary Education, the United States Department of Ed, as a presidential appointee under President George Bush [George H.W. Bush] in nineteen--that picture was probably taken in 1990.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, next.
Speaker 1: In the Oval Office, I might add.  That was my official photograph as Assistant Secretary for Post-Secondary Education for the United States Department of Education.  Picture was taken in 1989.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Great, next.
Speaker 1: --Man March [Million Man March] October 16, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  I took the photograph on the top and someone took the photograph with my camera on the bottom.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, next.
Speaker 1: Many people say that I look like the famous--
Speaker 2: Go ahead sir.
Speaker 1: Many people say that I look like the famous all-time NBA Great Julius [Winfield] "Dr. J" Erving.
Speaker 2: You do.
Speaker 1: And we met each other for the first time in Washington in nine--no, I think it was last year at the One Hundred Black Men of America's Annual Dinner.  And I went up to him, I said, I says Dr. J, they say we look alike.  He said I can see that.  So we took a picture together.  And that's Hugh Price there, former head of the Urban League sitting right next to him.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's my father, the Reverend Dr. L.L. Haynes, Jr.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is my father, Reverend Dr. L.L. Haynes, Jr., graduate of Houston-Tillotson College [Houston-Tillotson University], Boston University.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  When do you suppose this photo was taken?
Speaker 2: Dad took that probably in 19, probably around 1991 or '92 [1992].
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather for whom I'm named, Reverend L.L. Haynes, Sr.  This hung in my father's office for years and I've assumed that this was done probably around 1968 or '69 [1969].
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Great, next.
Speaker 2: My junior year as a Southern University, member of the Southern University football team, the Fighting Jaguars. Taken probably in 1967.
Speaker 1: You were playing like linebacker?
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, linebacker.
Speaker 2: Linebacker, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  Oh that's my wife and I with the Ambassador, the Tunisian Ambassador to the United States.  That was taken last year.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.  Let's start with the top.
Speaker 1: Proud moment in our family.  Our--one of our twin sons is--he got married in 2001 to LaToya Terragamo [sic Torregano].  This is Slidell, Louisiana and that's the wedding picture and below of course the rest of the family and my son, Lenny [Leonard Haynes IV], Mary, Eboni and Bakari.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, could you spell Terragamo for us?
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Put you on the spot.
Speaker 1: I can't, I guess I can't spell it.  You have to sound it out.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Next one.
Speaker 1: This is my father in the pulpit of some church.  He was known as one of the great preachers in United Methodist Church when he was living so he was there doing his thing.  And that's my mother--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's my mother Lela Davenport Haynes and my dad and I think that was taken probably around 1985 or '84 [1984] or something like this.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And these are the--
Speaker 2: Those are the four generations of Leonards right there.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Wow.
Speaker 2: Leonard I, II, III and IV, taken during my sister's wedding in 1995, June 15th.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay, the top, this one right here.  Oh, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, those are my baby pictures I guess, I don't know was I less than a year old then.  That's probably 1948 probably, my dad and mom.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, and the next one.
Speaker 1: My grandmother holding me, that's probably in St. Louis.  I was probably like about a year or two.  And then on the bottom it was my mother and my grandfather and me in St. Louis I guess, um-hmm.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's my sister Leila Pelichet, she's married now.
Speaker 2: Can you get it with my fingers in the way like that (unclear)?
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's probably 1998.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Would you be able to spell that name?
Speaker 2: P-E-L-I-C-H-E-T.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, great.  Next.
Speaker 2: And that's Walter Lafayette Haynes, my brother who is deceased and I would guess that would have been about 1978.
