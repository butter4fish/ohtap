Speaker 2: My mother's name, Maggie Goodson Russell.  She was from South Carolina.  My mother was a very unique lady.  She worked hard all her life.  She gave lives to eight kids.  Of the eight, I just happen to be the baby of the eight.  You could say that I was a mama's baby because I was at home with my mother much longer than my brothers and sister, being the younger of the, family.  My mother married my daddy, Roger Russell, who was from, Georgia--was born in East Georgia.  My mother helped to--my father with the income.  I was a child who was born during the [Great] Depression.  And my mother had to get a job in taking care of eight kids.  And I just don't understand how she was able to do all of that, but she was a good mother and just was a fantastic lady.
Speaker 1: Since you were the youngest, did you mother, did she talk about her growing up with you a little bit or even her, you know, back--anything about her background in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Very little.  You know, being the youngest, she had to have been pretty tired.  She was really getting pretty much over the hill a little bit.  And, I don't remember really no dialogue about her childhood days in South Carolina.

My father was a master in getting the most out of a dollar.  He taught me the art of saving money.  My father's philosophy was that whatever you make, if it wasn't for one dollar, you should save a portion of that one dollar.  And that he did.  And my father was able, with the little money that he made, to buy the home that we was living in, the house, and he bought another piece of real estate.  My daddy learned a trade, the mason, [unclear] work, cement work.  And he taught all of his kids that particular trade, that art.  And daddy was a fascinating man, an honest man, work-a-holic.  I think I'm very much like my father.

Speaker 1: Now, can you share some of your earliest memories of growing up?  Do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, very much so.  We--I was born in Summerhill [ Atlanta, Georgia], now where Turner Field [Atlanta Braves baseball park]was built.  And I was a part of building Turner Field.  I knew what it was like growing up in Summerhill that we used to go to E.P. Johnson [Elementary School, Atlanta].  And if it's cold or raining, with pasteboard in our shoe because the shoe was worn out.  And if it was raining, too bad.  Your shoe would get full of--water.  And if it's cold, too bad.  It was, it would freeze almost.  I know what it's like not to have.  I remember many days we would go to the table, never went hungry, we always had potatoes, vegetables, but it was rare when we could have meat; fish on Friday and chicken on Sunday.  We didn't know how poor we was because we had a loving family.  And everybody took care of each other in the neighborhood.  We didn't have to worry about locks on the door.  I was taught good working habits.  I always was looking for a job, something to do.  And I--all of my life, I had the art of--working.
Story_ID: 19677
Speaker 1: Now, Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia], what was that community like, sir?
Speaker 2: Summerhill had a lots of shotgun housing.  You could--you'd open the front door, you could see all the way through.  We didn't have, we did not have a bathtub.  We did not have hot and cold water.  I remember we didn't have electric lights, a telephone.  I remember when all of those things took place in, our home.  But we had love, deep love in, our home.  It's--I remember when we was taking a bath, we had to heat the water and take a bath in the tin tub.  I remember when we got electric lights.  Oh, you talking about excited moment in my life.  That was, high tech at its best.  And finally we got a telephone, and it was about three or four party line.  You know, you, had to wait until the other family around the corner gets through talking.  But those are the type of things that, you know, I remember.  And I think it helped me to appreciate more, the material things of life today.
Story_ID: 19678
Speaker 1: Now, let's take--I want you to take yourself back to Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia], and growing up.  And I'm wondering if you could talk about what, either sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights would be the, neighborhood.  I didn't know what a lawn looked like because we did not have shrubbery.  We did not have grass growing.  Everything was either unpaved road, unpaved sidewalk, but not dirty.  I don't remember our neighborhood being dirty.  I remember mama [Maggie Russell] making a broom to sweep and just, things were just so neat all, the time.  Not too much violence.  Very little violence in, our community growing up.  I have, good remembrance of, my neighborhood.  But I do remember that it was not easy a whole lot.  Everybody tried to get in one room, hug around the big pot of (unclear), with wood and coal.  But, it, really enriched my life.
Speaker 1: Any smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no, other than when somebody was burning something in their backyard.  (Chuckle).  That's the only, you know, we, you know, you could burn whatever you wanted to.  You usually burned most of the trash and stuff in your, you know, in your backyard.  But other than that, I don't--

Speaker 1: Now, describe more family life, what family life was like.  You're the youngest, so you're the baby of the family.  But was there a lot of activity?  Were you--just describe some (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Church, was everything.  My, other than my daddy [Rogers Russell], my role model was, mentor, was my pastor who I got my inspiration from.  Church was our social life.  It was our inspiration, fortunate enough, our Bishop Wilks (ph.) eventually, he was a Bishop, got to be a Bishop.  He was an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] pastor for a number of years at my church.  He was such an intelligent, such a natural-born leader.  So he motivated me a lot, brought the best out of me.  So church was our, was our social life.  It was really what kept us motivated.

Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I remember I, knew what was going on when I was about--I guess I was in about the fourth grade.  And I had one teacher to call me out in the hall one day.  And she called some more teachers out, about four or five.  And what they, what she had me to do, to recite my, tables.  And when I got to, in my sixes, and, it sounded like I was saying, "shit", or something, you know, they were getting a kick.  What she was doing, taking advantage of a kid, my age at that time and just really having fun with it.  And now I that find that, you know, and then even after--to be one of the worst things someone can do.  Instead of pointing me to some program that would help, she felt to do something a little different.  I'm not condemning all of the teachers at David T. Howard [high school] because I had some good teachers.  When they realized I was behind in certain areas, made sure that I would read anything I could get my hand on to, you know, to improve.  But I'm going to get into detail of all of that, you know, in, my book.  But I've a long and rich life and a very blessed life.
Story_ID: 19682
Speaker 1: Now so, was the school that you went to, was it a segregated school or non (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, segregation, oh, definitely so.  Definitely so.  Definitely so.
Speaker 1: And okay, what were you like as a child?  Were you fun loving?  Were you quiet?  Were you shy?  Were you rambunctious?  Or what were you like?
Speaker 2: I would say a combination of all of, that.  I believe in myself.  I've always believed in myself.  I always believed I could do whatever talent that God had given me.  And when I set out a course for myself, I usually achieve whatever those goals may be.  And, even as a child, my teachers, at the early age when I went, when I entered junior high, they detected some leadership in me.  And I was a president all the way through the seventh grade through the twelfth grade, president of my class.  And I headed up the campaign from seventh grade in junior high, I was a campaign manager of--the party--that ran for, president of the student body.  And, we won.  So I guess I've always had a talent of being the diplomat, of getting things, done.  And so if, you go through my yearbook, I, was very talented--wasn't the best academic kid.  I fought to, hard to, make passing grades.  It's just been very rewarding to know who you are and, and never worry about the (unclear).  Do what you can do and move on.
Story_ID: 19683
Speaker 1: In your household, what were--you said you spent a lot of time with your mother.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Your father was also--what age were you starting to work with him and his plastering?
Speaker 2: Well, let me recap that for you.  At the age of eight, I went into my first entrepreneurial business.  I had a paper route.  I would get up early and had the paper on people's porches at six in the morning.  And after doing that for a couple of years, I decided I would set up on the weekend, a shoeshine parlor.  And I sat up a shoeshine parlor on the corner in front of our house on a vacant lot that I did not own.  And I was so good at shining shoes that I got so many shoes dropped off; I got someone to help me.  And then I realized that I could sell shoelaces, Coca Cola [beverage] and ice cream.  So that got to be quite of an enterprise.  And then during the summer, my daddy [Rogers Russell] would take me out on a job.  And I would go out on a job and work with my father in the construction business.  And when I reached the age of sixteen, I was a master mechanic.  I was making as much money that to the older, men because I was the best at what I was doing.  And then I bought a lot from the city of Atlanta [Georgia] at the age of sixteen and, and began building a duplex on and worked for a couple of years.  And when I finished [David T. Howard] high school [Atlanta, Georgia] I went Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], came back during the summer and finished that duplex.  So I, that was my first piece of real estate that I owned and renting out at that time.  So everything just took off from, that point.  I started buying more and more land, more and more land.  And during my first year at Tuskegee, I was working during the weekend on people's housing and all.  And I asked my brother to come down and help me.  And I had an enterprise set up down there during my, freshman year.  And we were doing so--the end of my freshman year, sophomore and junior year, and we were doing so much business, the sheriff came out.  And we didn't have a license there to build.  They gave my brother twenty-four hours to leave the city because we were taking work from other people that really needed to work at that time.
Story_ID: 19684
Speaker 1: So I want to know.  I want to go back, you know, what (unclear) sort of made you, you know, who you are?  You said your father [Rogers Russell], you learned a lot from him.  And what types of things was he telling you?  You said your father was extremely good at, you know, well I don't want to say stretching a dollar, but sort of managing a dollar. What were the things he was sort of telling that, you know, that had, you know, influenced you and made you a good businessperson?
Speaker 2: Well, he taught me a trade that nobody could never take away.  I can do that today if I had to.  He taught me the art of living.  He was my role model.  Remember, this is a guy who never finished the fourth grade, but as I say, a PhD in common sense.  He knew how to handle money.  And he knew how to invest money.  He believed in land.  And he just, he, just was a guy that could look around the corner and almost predict what's going to happen tomorrow.  He just was a good father.  He, was someone that I admire and someone that took care of his family.  And I picked up all those good traits from my, father.
Story_ID: 19685
Speaker 1: So your parents encouraged you when you had the, you know, the shoeshine and things.  They thought that was a good thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely, you know, I was making money.  And, when, I got ready to really get my first loan, I didn't get a loan on that first house that I built.  I built it out of savings.  And when I, went downtown during segregation days.  That was during--way before the, before Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came on the scene.  And when I went down to get a loan for an eight-unit apartment building, and I'm just right out of college [Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And I guess I'd been out for about a year or two years, I went to the bank.  And I had everything together so well, my finance information, my business plan.  And when I went into this white institution, the young lady asked me to take a seat.  And about five minutes later, one of the loan officers came up and he got me, took me back to his desk.  I laid everything out to him what I wanted to do.  He was so shocked.  He said, "Wait a minute."  He went up and talked to the president.  I don't know what he said, "I got--this colored boy is here, and, I can't believe what I see, probably the little money he has saved."  It wasn't a whole lots of money.  I may have been worth about five or ten thousand dollars.  I don't know what it was back--and he, came up to the president's office.  The for--the president--said, want to know where do I go to church, you know, just give him a background (unclear) that really shouldn't have even been applicable to what I was trying to, you know, to borrow.  But they were so impressed with me, and they told me, say, "We will let you know in a week."  And they called me back in about three or four days, said,  "You have the loan."  And, that president and that bank came to be one of my best friends.  I started doing work for the president before he passed away, and I remember Mr. Miles, you know, when I went into the wholesale liquor business and all, and he was one of these Baptist members that just thought that you couldn't, shouldn't drink, you shouldn't sell booze and so forth and so on.  So he called me in his office, said, "You have done well.  You have made money, and you didn't make it off of liquor". And, oh, he was against me going into the retail liquor business.  But, but he was a wonderful gentleman, but I have to be honest with you, even in the deep South, I was very fortunate.  I had a lots of white leaders in this city who saw something in me, probably I did not see in myself at the time, was willing to help me and push me along.
Story_ID: 19686
Speaker 1: Now, I want to just take you back to--so, in [David T. Howard] junior high  you said you got active with the class, you know, running class campaigns.  When did you start playing football?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started playing football in junior high at David T. Howard in the seventh grade.  I was a pretty good athlete.  We--I was voted in 1948 as the best athlete in Georgia.  So I played football and baseball.  We, had a championship team.  But back in those days, see, we didn't have an offense team and a defense team.  We played sixty minutes.  I mean, you know, unheard of.  And, all of the equipment for the first--well, all through junior high, it was handed down equipment from the white.  And you had all used equipment back in those days.  But, I, really enjoyed football and baseball.
Story_ID: 19687
Speaker 1: Did you have any heroes at that time, you know, in terms of football and baseball that you really looked up to?
Speaker 2: Well, you must remember segregation--see, we didn't have nobody in the Major League [baseball].  Jackie Robinson was, the only one.  When Jackie Robinson--he wasn't in the Major League when I was playing at David T. Howard [high school].  When Jackie Robinson was signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers and came here to Atlanta, (Unclear ?), a baseball park.  I was there.  You, you're talking about, ooh, a happy day in, in this city when Jackie Robinson--ooh, when he stepped out on that field, you know.  And, of course, we all know, you know, what happened back in those days.  So, and then I really got to know Jackie Robinson very well.  I remember when we both were invited by [U.S.] President [John F.] Kennedy at the White House.  And I had the good fortune to, ride back to the airport with him in one of the government cars.  And he was telling me, he said, "Herman, the, most, the most disappointing thing in my life, I went to the World Series--."  I think it was in (unclear) or somewhere.  He sold out to the baseball, and he went into the locker room.  And that, you know, at that time, I guess it was a dozen Afro-Americans was on the team then, but he just felt like he should have got more gratitude from those guys.  But he, did not.  He said, it was very disappointing to him.  But, you don't want to talk about Jackie Robinson.  You're here to talk about me, I don't know.  But he was, he was one of my heroes.
Speaker 1: Did you follow any of the Negro Baseball League players at all?
Speaker 2: Did I do what?
Speaker 1: The Negro Baseball League players?
Speaker 2: Did I follow any?
Speaker 1: Follow any of them?  Did you have any favorites or (unclear) or--no not really?
Speaker 2: Not--you know, Satchel Paige, different ones.  You know, I was, I wasn't really large enough when they were, you know, when they were, to keep up.
Story_ID: 19688
Speaker 1: Now, what--so you're, even at sixteen [years old]--
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: At sixteen, you said you bought this lot.
Speaker 2: I bought my first piece of land.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me how that even came about and what your thoughts were about that?  Was that something, you know, I'm going to go buy--.
Speaker 2: My daddy [Rogers Russell], my daddy.  My daddy believed in land.  He figured that's one of the best, and he was right, one of the best investments in the world.  And remember now, I'd been working ever since I was eight.  I'd been saving my money.  You see, it was natural for me to buy the land from the city [Atlanta, Georgia] for $125.  See, it was natural.  And then I had the expertise to know how to build and put things together.  And it was, a natural thing for me.
Speaker 1: So you built this duplex?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had some help, you know, friends and all, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you brothers help at all?
Speaker 2: They helped a little bit too.  They helped a little bit.
Story_ID: 19689
Speaker 1: And then so, was it always--what made you decide to go off to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  Was that assumed that you were going to do that? And what was the whole--?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee, I couldn't go to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  Tuskegee was the only college that I know of in the deep South that taught building technology, you know--they didn't call it that then, back in those days, that I could go and learn about the building industry.  So that's why Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: And when you went to Tuskegee in, like 19--
Speaker 2: '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: 1949, that's right.  And now, this is your first time really away from home.
Speaker 2: First time, first time, you're right.  First time (laughter).  And it was not easy.  That's right, first time.
Story_ID: 19690
Speaker 1: So how was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was, different because I, went to Turman Station (ph.), got on a train and went to, went to Tuskegee [Alabama].  And it was a lonely feeling.  It was a lonely feeling.  And I met B.B. Beemer, who was a big entertainer, promotion, brought big shows into town, like B.B. King [blues guitarist].  I used to have a band too, by the way, in high school.  And I don't know one note.  I owned the band, and we used to travel all over Georgia with this band.  And B.B. King gave me the opportunity, my band, to play with Nat King Cole [musician] at the city auditorium during the break period.  And B.B. King--I mean, I mean Mr. Beemer was a guy that used to push me and give me opportunities to do things.  And so let me tell you about that.  I used to have a little band, and don't know one note.  But that's the entrepreneur in me.
Speaker 1: So, where did you find these guys, and were they in [David T. Howard] high school with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were high school.  Some turned out to be some of the world's leading musicians.  And they just were good.  We, had a good band at David T. Howard.  And then we just put a jazz group together that was dynamic.  And they needed a little seed money and all.  And I was there, and owning the band, you know.  We made a little money and had some fun (laughter).
Story_ID: 19691
Speaker 1: Well, now, when you were at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] though, I mean when you go there, this is your first time away.  And you've never been to a campus before, right?
Speaker 2: Never been to the campus before.  Never been to the campus before.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you get there and it's a whole--I mean--
Speaker 2: Whole new world, whole new experience for me.  But it didn't take me long because I was entering into Tuskegee Institution [sic. Institute, became University in 1985] then, they called it.  And, it had a nice little building program.  It had a nice little building program and so we, fit right into because see I brought some expertise with me.  And the teacher and all detected that very early.  And I was working on their homes they were building.
Speaker 1: So what did--did you learn at Tuskegee though that helped supplement what you had learned--?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely so.
Speaker 1: So tell me what types of things you learned and why you think it was a good experience?
Speaker 2: Well, prints, I mean blueprints.  I learned the fundamentals of reading, the fundamentals of--introduced to the calculator, not computers back in those days, learning the, fundamentals of how to put things together right.  And I had some good role models there too, on the campus.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about some of the role models?
Speaker 2: Well, we, had people that, who had worked up North, who were teaching the course, who could, tell you things and show you things that you had never been introduced to before.  It just was a great feeling to, have someone that could teach you things that you'd never been introduced to before.
Story_ID: 19692
Speaker 1: Now, who was taking care of your duplex while you were, you know, while you were at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I had--I put it in the agent's hands.  A fellow by the name of Q. B. Williams.  He had a real estate company, a member of my church.  So he rented the unit for me.
Speaker 1: That is cute.  That's nice.  So, I mean, not cute, but I mean really sort of nice.  So, you--did you come home [Atlanta, Georgia] during the summers and things like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, summers, yes, summer, yes.  Yeah, because I would come home and work on my duplex.
Story_ID: 19693
Speaker 1: Now, were there other things that influenced you at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] while you were there, I mean that you learned or enforced your or changed you in some way?
Speaker 2: Well, just improved my expertise, you know.  Tuskegee is part of a university in itself.  You would have to rate it, back in those days, for sure, one of the top three Afro-American universities in the world.  And so Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and, you know, it just was so many heroes that, it's so much history there on the campus.  You know, Booker T. Washington, his philosophy that, you know, we should, we should master a trade.  We should, teach the kids how to use their hands because you're going to always need, there's going to always be a need for electricians, plumbers, heating and air conditioning people.  But that didn't mean that you can't get both, you know, the education along with the trades.  So it was the right place for me to be at the right time in my life.
Speaker 1: And you continue to be active.  You're on the board of Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: I'm Vice Chairman of the Board.
Speaker 1: And you're considered still an important institution?
Speaker 2: Oh, no doubt about it.  No doubt about it.
Speaker 1: Is its admission still the same, sir, or is it broader?
Speaker 2: Well, it's much broader now.  You know, we have one of the finest veterinarian schools in the world at Tuskegee, you know.  Engineering, all--it's, you know, it's a wonderful, wonderful university.  I've set up an entrepreneurial foundation there.  I give scholarship to kids.  Of course, I did it for about four colleges.
Story_ID: 19694
Speaker 1: When you graduate from Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], you come back to Atlanta [Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are your thoughts at that time?  You're not married at this point?  Are you married or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, what are your thoughts at that point?  What are you, you know, looking to do and, you know, what do you set out to do?  Or what do you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, when I left Tuskegee, I came back home and set up my own operations.  My daddy [Rogers Russell] was, he was pretty old at that particular time, had sort of retired.  And I set up H. J. Russell Company.  And we started bidding, had the expertise, the know-how, on large jobs.  We started doing large projects like the Equity building, downtown Atlanta, some of the biggest landmarks in Atlanta.  We just, you know, we got involved in some of those big projects.
Speaker 1: You didn't get involved in those in the late '50s [1950s], did you?
Speaker 2: Not the late '50s, '53 [1953].  What I did before then, I later came back and did lots of sub work for the first, probably the first five years.  And while I was doing the sub work, I built lots of apartments for my own portfolio.  And in, say the '60s [1960s], we started doing large commercial projects, like I mentioned, the Equity Building.  And now, remember, I'm still the sub-contractor, you know, not a commercial builder at that time.  I didn't really get into the commercial building part of my career until about the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Late '70s.
Speaker 2: Okay, I was going to say--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we started building, we started building the projects for other people, government, private and so forth and so on.
Speaker 2: Okay, I want to go back though to the '50', you know, when you just a little bit, I mean I'd like to go back and look at that.  So you're subbing, and you're doing, you're actually building your own portfolio?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So how many properties did you end up owning like by 1960 or--?
Speaker 1: 1960, I at least would own probably about 1,500 units throughout Georgia.
Speaker 2: Throughout Georgia?
Speaker 1: Throughout Georgia.
Speaker 2: Not concentrated just in Atlanta?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: But when you say throughout Georgia, what are you talking about?
Speaker 1: Gainesville, Georgia, (unclear)  Georgia, Albany, Georgia, [unclear], Georgia.
Speaker 2: And you were collecting rent on all these units?
Speaker 1: Yeah--.
Speaker 2: What--were you learning some important lessons during that time, sir?  You know, just about, you know, building property and managing it because that's a lot of property.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no.  Way before we started building we started building all of those properties, I remember when we built--I remember Vernon [Jordan] with his first wife, when he moved into one of my projects, and this was back in the early '60s [1960s].  We had taken over.  I had set up my own management company then.  See, we had, oh, gosh, we had two [200] or three hundred units, you know, then.  So we, I took over in probably the early '60s [1960s] all of my real estate.  I set up my own management company.  And later on I set up my own insurance company because we were paying over a million dollars premium just for, just insurance.  So, what I learned early that the type of enterprise that I was in, development, building, management, they all fed into each other.  And, you know, that's how you can build these enterprises, and even today.
Speaker 2: I'm just saying 1,500 is a large number at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah
Story_ID: 19695
Speaker 1: And no one was really stopping you, that--I mean you were operating mainly in the black community.  No one was like stopping you or trying to try and put roadblocks in your way or--?
Speaker 2: Well, see, what I did in the '60s [1960s], particularly, late '60s, I hired a Greek fellow.  He went all through the South and bought land for me.  And, you know, once he'd buy, we'd change the title over.  Now, a lot of land that I bought here in Atlanta [Georgia] and elsewhere, it was in the deed--you being a lawyer, years ago, it was legal.  They had, in the deed, they could never sell this land to a Negro.  Okay, but you know what happened, the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled that unconstitutional [see Shelley v. Kraemer (1948).]  But it still was in the deed because it had been recorded years ago, you see?  So it was a whole--it was a lot I had to overcome, but I had a good friend, who's a best friend of mine today.  He, he was my front man for it.
Speaker 1: And this was the Greek fellow?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you come to know him?
Speaker 2: I came to know him--it's a funny thing that I got to know [United States Senator] Herman Talmadge.  And he was--his daddy was [Georgia Governor] Eugene Talmadge.  He was a segregationist,  Herman Talmadge, when he was a senator.  But he never--as his later years in life, Herman Talmadge's son--was a friend of mine.  And Jim Cochran was a friend of Herman Talmadge.  I met Jim at a party through Herman Talmadge's son.  And that's how we got to--
Speaker 1: Now, Tabin is T-A-B-I-N [Talmadge is correct spelling]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the other name Cochran?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: C-O-C-H--
Speaker 2: H-
Speaker 1: R-A-N?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Story_ID: 19696
Speaker 1: The other--okay, because you even said earlier that you've always had a good relationship with whites, you know, throughout your life?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, sir, let me just say this because this is, to people, I mean outside of Atlanta [Georgia], you know, when you think of the South, you know, and the tumultuous times, all that time you're functioning as a businessman?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And not having any, any--
Speaker 2: Well, we had some problems now, but, you know, but, but it was enough good whites there that I could work with, you know.  Even today, if somebody don't know me, if I go into a boardroom, I'm a typical Afro-American.  See?  Now, it--and once they learn a little about you, things just change a little bit.  But you, you're faced with that, you know, today, not as bad, thank the Lord.
Speaker 1: But in the, I'm saying that in the height of like the '60s [1960s], you know, like from--were you impacted at all during that time?  Or you're still functioning, just--
Speaker 2: A little, yeah, oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Just functioning?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 19697
Speaker 1: The insurance company started when, in the '60s [1960s] or the early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: My insurance company?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I started my insurance company about '70--'72 [1970-1972].  In '72 [1972], yeah.
Speaker 1: And you didn't think that that was--do you still have your insurance company today?
Speaker 2: No, no, I sold it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were using like Atlanta Mut--were you using, what was your--?
Speaker 2: I mean like Metropolitan [Life Insurance Company], New York Life [Insurance].  See, I was the agent.  You see what I'm saying, I booked the insurance and sell it to them.
Story_ID: 19698
Speaker 1: What were--and you say in the early '70s [1970s]--no, late '70s, you start getting involved with--what other things are starting to happen?  You were involved--what I want--you were involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: I--Huh?
Speaker 1: You were involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, sure.  There again, I'm plugging my book again, you know.
Speaker 1: I'll give you a trans--sir (unclear)--
Speaker 2: How I was deep involved, they would never let me get arrested.  They wouldn't let me get arrested because I had to bond the people out of jail, because I had the real estate and a balance sheet.  I remember the sit-in here in Atlanta [Georgia], we had a mass sit-in, probably locked up, oh, about sixty people.  But I was able to bond all of those people out.  And they couldn't deny it because I had the real estate.  I had paid for it, you know, the balance sheet.  So that was, that was my major role, other, than meeting with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], you know, at my home and other places, you know, strategizing, but that's--I would never get arrested.
Story_ID: 19699
Speaker 1: Who else--who were the other significant businessmen around the [Civil Rights] Movement, if you don't, you know, if people don't know their names?  I knew that Harry Bellefonte [performer] was supposed to be one of them.  Was that, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm talking about here [Atlanta, Georgia].  See, this is the fatherland of the Civil Rights Movement, you know, because I mean they all were born here.  I mean the Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], you know, the Dr. King, the Vernon Jordan, Julian Bond.  I mean, you know, John Lewis wasn't--he was in Alabama, but he eventually moved here.  (unclear), you know, just all of those guys.  But, but I mean everybody know here, you know, my role.  Don Hardaway who is a, senior lawyer that is living today who, Vernon [Jordan] worked for as an intern when he first got out of law school.  I mean, they all know.  I mean they all know who was, involved.  I don't know.  I mean Jesse Hill was here.  He's from St. Louis [Missouri], but he was right in the midst of it.  I mean we all were right in the midst of it.  [Andrew] Andy Young was just a young kid that we brought into Atlanta back in those days, as a lieutenant for Dr. King.  But we all worked together and worked together very well.
Story_ID: 19700
Speaker 1: Now, sir, when did you come to first know Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]?  Was it through is father or through himself--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  At the YMCA [Young Mens Christian Association].  We used to go down there and shoot pool.  And, now, understand, back in those days, he was just 'M.L'.  I mean nobody knew, you know, Dr. King--another Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] guy, you know.  So, and I, really--I'd known him way before he got involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  And, of course, when he took the pastorship of the church [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church] in Montgomery [Alabama] and then the rest is history when he got involved with the Movement of the bus boycott with Mrs. Rosa Parks [civil rights pioneer].  But I had known him, and then once he got involved, we all got involved.  And, his second home was my home because I had an indoor pool, and he could just come there--he, loved the water.  I mean he was just like a fish in the water.  And so he would--I would come--I would leave my office, and if he was here in Atlanta and had an opportunity, you would find him in my pool.  And we, you know, my wife loved to cook, and we had a lot of cook-outs, but he, you know, we just was the best of friends, best of friends.
Speaker 1: Now, do you--also, with Vernon Jordan, when did you say you got to know him? You said you--
Speaker 2: So you met him, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went, we go way, way, way, way back.  He served on my board for twenty years, H. J. Russell Board and was my tenant in my apartment, yeah.
Story_ID: 19701
Speaker 1: Were there any other things that happened significant with your business during the, you know, late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: No, we just would continue to grow.  We get late '70s [1970s], no.  That was in '80 [1980], we had--that was late, '80s [1980s], when we got into the television business.  But we, we did get the French South or Atlantic Cable back in those.  And we sat on it for about, for about fifteen years before we did anything with the cable rights.
Speaker 1: With the cable television franchise?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So you got involved in that in the '70s [1970s] and some in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '70s [1970s].  Yeah, see, you know, we--it was only two franchises given.  That was Cox [Cox Communications-cable arm of Cox Broadcasting] and my group.  And we, just sat on it for fifteen years because we wasn't ready to move with cable at that time.  And that's what happened.  And then I built my ABC [American Broadcasting Company] television station in the late '80s [1980s] in Macon, Georgia.  We put ABC on the air in Macon, Georgia.
Story_ID: 19702
Speaker 1: Now, you--just so I get some perspective, you said the early '60s [1960s], you owned 1,500 units.  And by the '70s [1970s], did that portfolio grow?  I mean did you--how many were you owning by--?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, roughly about 9,000 units throughout, Alabama, South Carolina and, you know, commercial stuff and all.  But it, just grows, you know, each year and grows every day because I'm still, you know, building.
Speaker 1: And you have how many--you have one, you have two different types of management companies or you have one?
Speaker 2: One, well, I, you could say two because some that I handle myself with another group of people.
Story_ID: 19703
Speaker 1: You were talking about the cable franchise.  What made you interested in starting--getting involved with that and diversifying?
Speaker 2: Because I believed at that time that who would be--the person that would be fortunate enough to get the cable rights for the city of Atlanta [Georgia] could do very well.  And we were fortunate enough to get, to be one of, of two franchise holders with the right to build cable throughout the city of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Now, when you got that franchise, who was mayor at that time?
Speaker 2: When we got it, Sam Massell, he was mayor at that time [Atlanta's first Jewish mayor].  We didn't have a black mayor at that time.  That's how long it's been.
Speaker 1: So you--wasn't that atypical that you would have gotten the franchise at that time?  You're talking about what year?  '70 [1970]-what?
Speaker 2: That was--when we got that franchise, it was about '76 [1976], I believe [Sam Massell held the Atlanta mayoral office 1969-1972].
Speaker 1: Okay. And who did you end up selling that franchise to?
Speaker 2: Okay, what we did, you know, timing is everything.  And once it got hot, Time Warner [media conglomerate], so many groups came in and, and just was dining and wining us, you know, to be a part of the franchise.  But we didn't have the capital.  And back in those days, it would have taken, just to build out the system, half a billion dollars.  It was big.  And we, we made a mistake.  We, went with the most wicked group out of Canada.  What they called themselves?  They was major.  They were in--there were from Montreal, Canada.  And what happened, they really had problems in raising the funding, when you would have gone with GM [General Motors] or Time Warner, you wouldn't have had that problem.  So, they ended up bringing in the Bass Brothers out of Dallas, Texas--Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, a very rich family.  They came in and sort of really bought the control of them.  And that watered our ownership down as well.  And finally, we sold all of our (unclear) in, the cable business.
Speaker 1: And sold it, what in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was in the '80s [1980s], late '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 19704
Speaker 1: Now, what else were you involved in, in the '80s [1980s], beside--you said you started your insurance company and then you said the TV station.  When did that--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  The TV was in the '80s [1980s] too.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in the '80s [1980s] too.
Speaker 2: Right, TV was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that?  What made you decide to do that?  And how did you find out about the opportunity?
Speaker 2: I found out about it because there wasn't an ABC [American Broadcasting Company] associate in Macon, Georgia.  It was CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System], NBA--[NBA (NBC?)], and not a ABC.  So we petitioned Washington [D.C.] to, build an ABC television station.  And it's unbelievable what you have to go through, the hearing you have to go through, the people, the--people you've got to dine and wine and so forth and so on.  So we went against the competition--up against the competition and won.  So we were on air, I believe--I think we were on air about '89 [1989], I believe.  And we, operated the station for about twelve years, did quite well, moved up to the number two position, and made a lot of money, sold it.
Speaker 1: Now, who was part of your team at that--?
Speaker 2: The television?
Speaker 1: --who was part of your team?
Speaker 2: I owned 72 percent of it.  I brought Don Hill, who worked for Cox Broadcasting here in Atlanta [Georgia].  He had retired.  I sold him about 10 percent of it, and he--that's where the expertise.  You--I have no expertise in television and radio.  But he was a lifesaver.  He, he's the one who I named the president and ran it for me, and did quite well.
Story_ID: 19705
Speaker 1: And then the Coors (?), when did that begin?
Speaker 2: Coors Beer? Well, I had two wholesalers, here in Atlanta [Georgia] and Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, why did you even get those?  How did you go after them, and get--because you don't just call and get them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, at that time, the push was on that all of your, the Fortune 500 companies needed more Afro-American franchise holders.  And so I saw there the opportunity.  And I went after it against  Hank Aaron [Atlanta Braves baesball player] and some other people, and I, won out.  I didn't have the name recognition that Hank Aaron had, but I had the money.  And so we, won and built the warehouse here, state-of-the-art warehouse.  And so it went very, well.  And then when we decided to go into the airport business, you cannot own a wholesale distributorship and be in the retail business in the airport.  You would have a, you would have the advantage over other people.  So I had to--I was forced to sell the wholesale operation.
Speaker 1: So do you have regrets about that or are you saying the airports are doing fine?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I don't have no--
Speaker 1: So it was better, the airport business has been better then.
Speaker 2: I made the decision. Yes, yeah, airport business is much--and it's more growth there, in the airport business.
Story_ID: 19706
Speaker 1: Do you know a girl named Judy Byrd?
Speaker 2: I know Judy Byrd.  Judy Byrd is, one--she just--Judy Byrd is the only Afro-American that I know of that have the expertise, the airport, and the high heart to put, to patch together for people like me to bid on.  She was hired by a Detroit [Michigan] Airport.  And we won it.  And St. (unclear) hired her.  We won.  She is a good friend.  You make sure you let her know that you've been talking to me (laughter).
Story_ID: 19707
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's talk about, you know, your role in politics here.  And, you know, we've already talked some about your role in the Civil Rights Movement, but I want you to talk about, you know, what things you've been, you know, very instrumental in.
Speaker 2: Well, I've been in politics all of my life.  I was born in politics.  And we were talking about the White House earlier.  I remember when [James E.] Jimmy Carter was, was Governor of Georgia.  He called about eight of us out to the mansion, one hot July afternoon.  And we went up in his living quarters.  And I was shocked.  We were all around the table, and he said, "Guys, I want you to raise me a quarter of a million dollars.  I want to run for President of the United States."  I turned, I said, "Jimmy, what you thinking about Vice President?"  He said, "No, President, Herman."  And the rest is history, you know.  We raised him the money, but he is a good, dear friend.  You can tell about me being in Air Force One and in the President's limousine because I traveled with him on Air Force One.  And he, he's just a good friend.  Now, local, not only local, national, I believe in good government.  We give money to people all over the country that we think that can represent this country well.  I've never had a desire to be in public office myself.  That's not my expertise.  But we work behind the scenes and support good government.  That's all I know I can say about the, politics.
Story_ID: 19708
Speaker 1: Now, Samuel [Adams] had asked about your role with [Atlanta mayor] Maynard Jackson's campaign.  You want to talk about that?
Speaker 2: I was his treasurer.  My responsibility was to raise the million dollars that it took for a well-financed campaign.  He was the first Afro-American, mayor here in the city [Atlanta, Georgia] and was a wonderful mayor.  And I was fortunate to have that good fortune to serve as his treasurer.
Speaker 1: And, you know, let's talk about that a little bit, just in terms of the fact, you know, when you look at, let's a Chicago [Illinois] versus, you know, an Atlanta, you know, whose, you know, had a string of black mayors.  And I know, you know, in Chicago we cry a lot.  You know, [Mayor] Harold Washington passed away [1987]--
Speaker 2: Oh, a tragedy.
Speaker 1: -- it's going to be, never, I don't think there'll ever be another black mayor.  So my question for you is, as a business person, why do you think that, you know, has been important, you know, that there be, you know, a black presence, you know, a presence? Or do you feel that that is the case?
Speaker 2: If I understand the question, why people like myself should be involved in politics?
Speaker 1: No, not involved in politics, but, you know, having a black presence, you know, a significant presence in politics.  Is that helpful to you as a black businessperson?
Speaker 2: It not only helps the presence of being involved as a businessperson, but I think it helps society all over the world.  I think good politics, it helps in good quality of life for all people.  You're born into politics when you enter this world.  You can't go out of this world unless some politic is involved in it.  So if we don't have good leaders, we have to get involved.  Just like if we don't have a good education system, we have to get involved.  It's just no way.  I just think you just--it's good for society.
Story_ID: 19709
Speaker 1: Are there other things that I'm not aware of that you're involved in because it seems like that--I mean you have, you know, the commercial and residential real estate?  You have the airport concessions.  You have--you're not in the TV anymore, but I mean are there other parts of H. J. Russell that I don't know about?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, of itself (unclear), but, you know, I'm the major shareholder of the bank [Citizens Trust Bank] here [Atlanta, Georgia], the Afro-American bank, you know, that, you know, that between my family and I, we own over 70 percent, you know, of the bank. But that's ran, not by H. J. Russell Company.  It's, you know, we have a separate board, you know, we have other shareholders. But I'm the chairman of the bank, been for many, many years.  But it's other enterprises like that, that I'm involved in, but I don't think you would be interested in that.
Story_ID: 19710
Speaker 1: Okay, but what I want to talk about now is, when you think about, you know, where you came from and where you are now, and, you know, the road that your life has taken, are you yourself surprised?
Speaker 2: I'm not surprised that I can do what I want to do.  But I am surprised of the mass of things have taken place during my lifetime.  And I see that it's still just the tip of the iceberg.  When I look, what I'm going to do just in eight blocks around my office building, that I'm involved in, my pet project, I don't get involved in third-party activities.  My organization, the leadership of my company, they are involved.  I, am enjoying semi-retirement that I'm working now, twelve hours instead sixteen hours a day.  And I'm doing fun things like building retail, lofts, restaurants, hotels in the heart of what once was the ghetto area, when I built this office building here forty years ago, that it wasn't nothing but shotgun houses.  With the good blessing of the Lord, if I'm here another three or \four years, I'm going to invest over $300 million, those next three or four years just improving the quality of life, just in this area alone.  And if you, if you all have time, we probably going to grab lunch over here in the new restaurant that opened this week.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about your pet projects and why you, you know, you decided to do that and invest?  Was this, it's called--
Speaker 2: Castleberry Hill--
Speaker 1: Castleberry Hill right [upscale housing development in downtown Atlanta, on National Register of Historic Places].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, if I could take you back over forty years, when I built in this location where we are today, it was nothing but two or four or five hundred shotgun houses [home with no side windows and entry in front and back of home, orginates in American south].  That's all you would see.  You would see probably a death every other week in this area.  For me to have the satisfaction now to change the whole scenery of this area, improving the quality of life of people is one of the most greatest satisfaction I've ever received out of life.  Not only that, knowing when I'm through here, I'm going to be giving over five hundred new jobs to people in this area, to say nothing about the over three thousand jobs that my headquarter office supports today here.  And I tell you, you're talking about getting a satisfaction, there's nothing like it.  Money can't give you that type of satisfaction.  Only when you know you're touching the life of people and making a difference.
Story_ID: 19711
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about, that it was a big move for blacks to get involved in, and it was a big move for blacks in education.  Now, I mean you started a long time ago, but now, you know, the last whatever, ten, fifteen years, you know, it's about blacks getting in business.  And I'm just wondering if you would talk to why that's important.  You know, why it's important for black people to own things.  You know, and you go back to your father [Rogers Russell], you know, that--and this has still been your core still doing your real estate, still been your core.
Speaker 2: I'm totally convinced, I'm totally convinced, as an Afro-American in this country the best way for us to control our own destiny, be good entrepreneurs.  You create jobs.  If you're fortunate to make money, you can give back to the community.  You're a good taxpayer.  I support entrepreneurialship.  That's why I choose four colleges and challenged them that if they match my money, the 4 million dollars, I would keep giving for entrepreneurialship.  I believe in it.  It has brought me to the party.  It has made a difference in my life.  And I think that's the answer.  Now, that doesn't mean that you don't need church, good church.  I think it's a sad day when we don't have as many entrepreneurial type of businesses, that we have churches.  Now, when you look at the other society, in particular, the white side, they have a hundred times more entrepreneurial businesses than they have church.  I love church.  That's my foundation.  Don't get me wrong.  They have done a wonderful job.  And I admire all of the ministers that I dealt with.  Let me tell you.  We got to wake up.  We got to do more on the ledger side of entrepreneurialship.
Story_ID: 19712
Speaker 1: Now, with--when you look at the black community, you know, in its current state, what are your hopes and your concerns about the community?
Speaker 2: It's sad.  It's sad when, when we look at our young people.  When I have a job fair, and I have four hundred applicants to come to the job fair, and some good young people that have great potential.  And when I send in through the drug tests, I'm not talking about what they have used a year or five years ago, but the immediate tests, you have over 50 percent turned down because of drugs and another 25 percent turned down because of armed robbery, or some habit.  Sad.  We ought to do a better job.  We, all of us, all of us, got to do a better job in our--reaching out to our young people with programs, with (unclear), catching these kids almost from day one, when they're born into the world, to make sure that we save more of these younger people at a much younger age, because it'll cost more on the tail end than it does up front.
Speaker 1: Sir where do you think we went wrong with the black community?  I mean do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: You know it's not just one simple answer.  It's a number of answers, probably you can give.  I'm no expert, but when you have a situation that people have lost hope.  Now, when we were talking earlier about my life, you know, it was always hope.  There was always that motivation.  Everybody got to have it.  Everybody got to have it.  And some people is a little more determined than others.  I've had people to get in my way, I ran over their butt.  And that wasn't a turn off, that wasn't a turn-off for me, you see.  But some people say it's a turn off.  So, we've got to show more compassion.  We, who have been fortunate enough, to have been blessed.  We've got to show more compassion for so many people out there that need our help.  And when baby, and baby having baby, they're going to require a lots of help.  And I know we can say babies shouldn't be having babies.  But it's a reason for everything.  I think we all got to re-commit ourselves in getting involved.  I think that's the lone solution to a very serious problem.
Story_ID: 19713
Speaker 1: And do you think that, because now in our community, probably more than, you know, we're more class structured, you know, the haves and then the have-nots.  What do you think the answer is going to be for, you know, making things go forward and people reaching back?  I mean, I think in your life, you've reached back, you know, always, but, you know, I'm just saying, you know, when you look at when you first started, sir, and the larger society, you know, and the limitations that were put on the black community, and all of those--well, not all of them, but, you know, a lot of those limitations of the society you came out of, have gone, they've gone, you know, in the form that they were.  But the black community, as a whole, in some respects looks worse.  And I'm just--you know, than even what you came out of, you know, because there were families.  What do you talk--you talked a strong family environment, you came out of.  And I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what, you know, what can be done?
Speaker 2: It's not an easy question.  You know, we have to begin with the basics.  Education, education.  We've got to make sure that every child, I don't care how poor they are, that that child have a chance and have the same chance that my grand kids have.  I just went to my six-year grandson, Benjamin, to celebrate Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], Black History week [month], and celebrate Dr. King's live.  And they were so fantastic.  I mean I saw all of those brilliant minds working and what they were able to memorize and do.  It brought tears to my eyes.  And then I thought about, how many young kids out there, the same age of my grandson, but do not have the same opportunity that my grandson have in that fine learning environment.  It's so many out they're much brilliant than he is, but never had a chance to develop.  And they will end up ten years, fifteen, twenty-five years, a lot of them in jail.  We've got to find a solution that we can reach these kids at a very early age.  And it all goes back to education.  You build hope in education though.  You believe in yourself.  You just cannot get away from that.  And the price is not too much to pay for that, because you're paying more to maintain people in prison.  We just got to, we just got to commit ourselves.  And it's all of our kids.  When we see a kid in the hole--I don't care what color, white, black, pink or blue, that's our kids, and we've got to reach out.  We just can't say, oh, you know.  We can't just--we can't turn our backs.  We've got to get involved.
Story_ID: 19714
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, family has been very important to you, both the family you came out of and the family that you have.  And I--what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got married in '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: '56, so that was--you were still at Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I had graduated in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: You had graduated, right, '54 [1954], that's right.
Speaker 2: '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953], okay, right.  Fifty-three [1953].  Okay, so family has been very important.  And I just want you to sort of address that, the role of family in your life and why that's been so important to you?
Speaker 2: It's everything.  I wouldn't be here today if I didn't have a wonderful wife [Otelia Russell] of forty-six years.  And anytime a wife will put up with a workaholic like me, the greatest blessing that I received is my wife.  She's just an angel and my three kids.  I had no idea that all three of my kids would end up in, all of my enterprises.  That's impressive in itself.  And they all live here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And God have blessed those three units with eight of my grand kids.  And I'm devoting time with my, as much time as I can find, for my grandkids.  I'm taking the three oldest ones with me this year.  I want to take them to New Zealand.  I'm fighting with my wife.  She said, "That's too far.  Let's take them to Honolulu [Hawaii] somewhere."  But there is nothing like a family.  At the end of the day, at the end of the day, with all of that brick and mortar out there that I own, with the blessing of the material things in life, all of those things put together, it's nothing like your family.  At the end of the day, having a loving family--and that's what it's really all about.  I'm hoping that I could keep the parent of my grandkids, not to ruin my grandkids, make sure, because they all have to work here.  It's mandatory that they work and report to their granddaddy, not their dad--not their daddy and mama because I want to make sure that, they work hard and do dirty work.  That is very important.  And I'm fortunate.  They all have to work during the summer, that is old enough to work, the girls and boys.  And my wife and I stay in contact with my grandkids.  We take turns, they stay with us over the weekend because that's very important.  That's very important because I just want to make sure that they get the type of training that, they're going to need in life.
Speaker 1: And that has to come from Grandpa and Grandma (chuckle)?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right (laughter) because, you know, I mean I, you know, we're from the old school.  You know, we talk, we don't mind punishing the kid.  But you should see my daughter-in-law and all, when we have to hit--ooh, I mean they, I mean they don't like it, (unclear), but they can't do say anything about.  But, you know, I just believe in, you know, this, you know, you would tell them, I would take things away.  You know, "You won't be able to do this or that," but sometimes I had, you know, sometimes I had to whip their little butt.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Like they say, "Spare the rod, spoil the child."
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Story_ID: 19715
Speaker 1: And you know the other thing, you know, and a lot of businesses, black businesses, unfortunately, what has happened is that they're no longer existing, and not passing from generation to generation.  And I mean I look at what you're doing here, and it's a testament because it's so little of that.  You know, and I just want you to comment because other people, they're saying, "Well, so what, you know, we get money."  You know, "We should be allowed to sell and get money."  But there's a sadness on the part of the community because we have so few institutions, business institutions, if there's not a passing down.
Speaker 2: Well, I never, never said to my kids that you have to be an entrepreneur.  I made sure that they were able to get the best education.  I made sure that when you come home, we're going to have a rap session, no television at--dinner.  I want to listen to you.  I want to listen to you, I'm not going to shut you out.  I'm going to listen.  I mean I'm (unclear).  And we did that from day one, you know.  I mean no television.  You have to have a dialogue hour with your mother and father.  And it worked well.  It paid off for us.  And we didn't say you got to take over your daddy's enterprise.  But what you have to do, you have to give 500 percent.  Be a doctor, be a lawyer, you know, be whatever you want to, you know.  But give the best.  And they all ended up here with me.  And, you know, that's impressive in itself.  But it wasn't mandatory.  You, you just can't do that, you know.  You've got to be happy with, you know, what you're involved in.
Speaker 1: But at least you feel that your legacy will continue on, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think my greatest hope, those eight you see over there with me, that picture.  It's seven--(unclear) Raymond's seventh birthday party.  I mean they're the ones, ooh, I mean I've saw so much dynamic and brilliance in those eight kids, ooh!  And then if you ask one right now, and (unclear), I didn't tell them, they want to be chief executive, you see.  (Laughs)  So, that's, you know, that's what it's all about.
Story_ID: 19716
Speaker 1: And so what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want it to be that I did my best.  I gave back to the community, that I'm deeply appreciative that I had that opportunity to live the type of life that I've been blessed with, that God have given me.  And I hope in some way that my little light will shine that will motivate someone to give back to society where someone else could have a quality life that they probably wouldn't have if it wasn't for my little light.
