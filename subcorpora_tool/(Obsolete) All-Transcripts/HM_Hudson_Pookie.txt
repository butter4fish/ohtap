Story_ID: 179573
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your mother, Mr. Hudson.  What was your mother's name and where was she born and when was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Ardath Roberta Collins.  She was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, she was born on September 13, 1917.
Speaker 1: Could you spell her first name for us?
Speaker 2: A-R-D-A-T-H.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background and how she grew up?
Speaker 2: I know about my mom's--well, let's see, she had two brothers, had a sister who passed in infancy.  She loved her father [Robert Collins], was born to him and he could do no wrong.  But the father and the mother had broke up.  My grandmother married another gentleman named Crews [ph.].  My grandfather met a young lady name Mike.  So, but, we would go back and forth to Iowa from Gary [Indiana] to visit, you know, during the summer.  I would spend more time than she would.  But basically my mom was, of course, a great lady 'cause she my mom, but she was a whistler.  Oh, she could whistle.  You never heard anybody whistle as beautiful as she could.  In fact she had a couple of bands in her youth who wanted to take her on tour with them, but her father and mother wouldn't let her go.  She was always striving for something, more education I think.  It was cut short because of the birth of myself, but she always wanted to learn.  She always talked about reading was so important.  At two or three she would take me to the library.  So by the time I was four, I could read as well as anybody 'cause we always sit in the library and she would read to me, showed me how to read.  She had quite a few--she had really bad luck with men.  I know she never had that one stable man that obviously wanted to be the husband that she was looking for and deserved, they all had their own agendas.  They were all in that same frame, the woman did what the man said do and you didn't question them what they did.  And so she really had bad luck.  To the end she did marry a pretty nice gentleman name Mr. Robinson, Johnny Robinson.  But he retired from the mill after about thirty-five years, and the next year he passed.  So it kind of left her at a loss.  I went back and I stayed with her for about two years.  And it got to the point that I had to put her in a nursing home because my life was going on too, you know.  She had gotten a little possessive with me and I could understand that.  But I was the only child, a life line I guess she felt, but I explained to her, you could live to be ninety, and if I stayed with you, I just liable to crawl over in the casket with you, 'cause that's old for me too, you know, 'cause you wasn't but sixteen years older than I was.  But anyway she went there and she passed in the nursing home a few years back.  So next (unclear) 'cause she lived a spectacular--she won't go down in history but she'll always be in my heart.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you while you were growing up that come to mind?
Speaker 2: What did she tell me?  Well, it seem a while ago she told me about my birth.  I was conceived in a dog house by a gypsy whose name was Williams something or other. Mr. Hudson, he stepped in and he married her before I was born, so that's how I got the name Hudson. The gentleman [biological father] I think I see him twice in my life and I know nothing of his family, plus who was probably my father, I knew nothing of their family, I know nothing of him period, so.  It always been with my mom's family, on my mom's side.
Story_ID: 179574
Speaker 1: What about your stepfather [James Hudson], what can you tell us about your stepfather who was involved mainly in your rearing?
Speaker 2: James [Hudson] was, number one, he was a real jealous man.  He was really jealous of my mom [Ardath Roberta Collins].  We, up to, I guess, I was about nine or ten, we never had a place with a toilet, but we had gaslights, we took baths (unclear), even though he had a heck of a job, for some reason we could never get ahead as far as--I mean, which I didn't understand at the time 'cause I was just livin', you know.  He was a little brutal.  He had--if I did something he didn't like, he had a habit--he'd pick me up by my legs and twirl me around, around, around there then he would thump me on top of my head, he was a pretty brutal man.  He never, as far as I know, he never hit my mother.  But when we finally did move into the projects [in Gary, Indiana], when they built this projects and cared for blacks, well for anybody really, but basically blacks moved into it.  And the first time we lived in a house it had a bathroom that I can remember.  I mean, as far as when they were together.  I don't know about my other parents and had my own room you know.  It got to the point that sometimes he worked four to twelve and sometimes my mother would go to the store just before he go to work and I'd go out and play, whatever.  We had a closet that sit across from my room and ten or eleven o'clock it's time for me to go to bed.  I go in the closet to get the cover, he'd be sitting there sleeping. He'd be in this closet from four o'clock to ten o'clock at night, thinking somebody's gone come and see my mother, but that's the way he was.  And I had a cousin who wasn't too much bigger than you pretty much.  She came through there and the one I told you I was named after, name was Louise, and she came in there, she had a poker, she ran the man out the house.  I mean he was a great big strapping man.  She didn't care, she thought he was mistreating her cousin, and she didn't like it at all, she ran him out the house.  He never came back.  That was the end of that marriage.
Speaker 1: Did you have much interaction with his side of the family?
Speaker 2: No.  I think I saw his father one time--
Story_ID: 179575
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your grandparents on your mother's [Ardath Roberta Collins] side, do you know their names and if so, tell us their names?
Speaker 2: Ardath Crews.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Crews?
Speaker 2: C-R-E-W-S, and Robert Collins.  They were my mother's father and mother.  They had split, well, after they had the children, they split up, I don't know why.  My grandmother [Ardath Crews], she was a fly woman.  She was fly in terms of 70s (unclear).  She'd travel all over the country by herself, she'd drive by herself, she refused to grow old until she got to be about eighty-seven something like that and she got-when people begin to lose their memory--
Speaker 1: Alzheimer's.
Speaker 2: --Alzheimer's yeah.  She suffered from Alzheimer's.  My step, not my stepfather, my grandfather, she lived in Davenport, Iowa,  my grandfather lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and he owned a tavern and he worked for Ford, one of the auto companies.  They make (unclear) and things.  Plus he owned two taverns, he got two taverns in Cedar Rapids [Iowa].  Basically, like I said, he married another lady name Mike who had two or three kids so we kind of--me and my mother became secondary, not because he want it that way, but that's the way it was, because he had married her [Mike] and the kids and she was the type of person that made sure everybody knew that, so.  And I used to go over there and stay with them for a while.  Every summer I spent two or three weeks in Cedar Rapids, two or three weeks in Davenport [Iowa].  I had an uncle, my uncle, youngest uncle, he went to Coe College [Cedar Rapids, Iowa] there, so I usually stayed with him and his wife.  I had another uncle an older uncle and he was cruel, you know, he was a bully.  I mean he never do to me, he thought the world of me and my mom, but he was having one of those things, he was the type of person  that--he had a friend name Grimes who had one eye, and when they walked into the bar everybody just came out 'cause they was just terrible, you know, yeah.  But it finally caught up with him up in California.  He got arrested and he made a deal with them, but they took a part of his brain out to be released from prison.  Actually a part of his brain which they thought was the part that caused him, you know, being as violent as he was.  And he wasn't as violent after that, but he wasn't the man he used to be.  He could remember things twenty years back, but he couldn't remember nothing yesterday, so.  Then he had a lot of epileptic fits behind that, you know.  But basically my youngest uncle he became--he was in Tuskegee [Alabama].  He was one of those pilots [Tuskegee Airmen].  After he came back he was a pilot, but he was one of the black pilot.  He became a captain in the service [U.S. Air Force].  And then after he became a dentist, and his practice was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  He been a dentist for about twenty years, he did well.  And on my side of the family Josephine Baker is a cousin, Fats Waller is a cousin.  So that's on my mother's side.  And there's a couple of other people that are famous that are part of the family.
Speaker 1: Did you have much interaction with them?
Speaker 2: No I didn't have interaction with them.  They were--when I got, they realized Josephine was in Paris [France], she got her castle with her kids and things.  That one of my grandmother's first cousins went over there and took care of the castle thing for her, one of my--her son, he was the one who took care of the bakery and things in this particular castle.  So that's why he had passed before I got to that point. But I used to--I had an aunt, my grandmother's sister, her name was Audrey [Collins], when the acts came through Davenport and (unclear) the Ink Spots, [Nat] King Cole, all the acts would come to her house and you know they rehearsed and sang, so I was exposed really early, you know, 'cause I used to sit and listen and watch you know and even though I didn't know the importance of it at that time, it was just enjoyable.  I think that's really what made me want to sing, you know, to be able to do that.
Story_ID: 179576
Speaker 1: Speaking of memories, what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory growing up.  Well, I can say I remember living in these homes that didn't have no bathroom, and taking baths in tubs and having potbelly stoves and it gets cold (unclear), believe me.  And I remember when we first moved into the projects, I think we were the first family to move into the projects which we stayed for about ten years, I guess.
Speaker 1: What other special memories do you have from growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  Like I said my mom [Ardath Roberta Collins] used to take me to the library, I remember reading all the time, I remember that, which came in handy when I went to school.  I remember the school, [Theodore] Roosevelt High School [Gary, Indiana], which at that time, was from kindergarten to twelfth grade, which was the only black school in Gary [Indiana] at the time.  And if you went to Roosevelt, you're black or you went to Froebel [High School, Gary, Indiana].  Froebel was mixed, but it was still--it was very segregated.  So I went to Roosevelt you know, and that culture, the only black culture, it was just what can I say, we were segregated (unclear), 'cause we were all basically lived in the neighborhood (unclear) and we didn't have a lot of white people (unclear).  And my mom worked for a lot of the white people and she did a lot of house work, things like that.  And so I just remember, you know, to me, life was good.
Story_ID: 179577
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about where you did most of your growing up and do you remember the name of the street that you lived on maybe when you moved to the projects, do you remember the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on 832 24th Street [Gary, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block for us and what the community was like?
Speaker 2: Well it was--these projects, they weren't high-rise projects, it was individual, there was two buildings, it had the flat top and it had a family in each one.  It wasn't like twelve stories high and you have a thousand people, I think the whole place had 380, you can call apartments or homes, and it was basically I say a black thing.  We all lived together in them days, you know.  It was when if you did something down the street and they didn't like it, they would whip your behind and take you home and your mama whip your behind, you know.  It was no problem.  If you left you could leave your doors open.  If anybody come and took anything they left you a note and let you know they got it.  You could walk the streets and nobody bothered you, so.  That was another time-- those were things I remember about--
Story_ID: 179578
Speaker 1: Are there any sights or smells or sounds that really remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well not really because see we were from a steel town [Gary, Indiana] and which we had some of the biggest mills in the world.  I can remember sometimes the smut would block out sun.  I played a lot of basketball and I played-- basketball was my game.  Really I guess I was just into playing, and well I learned a lot, you know, I did.  I was not really into school.  I got to a point that when I got into high school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana] they gave us these books, well I take my books and I'd read in a day, and, but, they be going through day by day, they be going through chapters and things.  I done read the whole thing, you know, and I'm ready to move on.  But you can't move on until everybody else move on you know.  So I'd skip school until they got to that point.  And one time the teacher Mr. Brown, he said, "You think you smart don't you," and so he gave me this test and I passed it.  And he didn't understand it.  Like I explained to him, I've read all this stuff and I maintained most stuff.  And you're going through it day by day, it just became boring.  In life I find that everybody's not for school, you know, because the curriculums are not for everybody, you know, you have people work with their hands, you got people working with their minds, and they should be able to go and be in an environment that is more satisfying to them instead of having to go someplace and have to sit there and be bored.  I may not understand because it's not a part of what you can do, you know.  You got people who are great carpenters, that don't mean that they're great readers or mathematicians, but their work is fantastic, and this is what they do, you know.
Story_ID: 179579
Speaker 1: Speaking of school tell me a little bit about your elementary school years and if there were any teachers in particular that really influenced you in elementary school, if you can remember their names.  But tell me a little bit about your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Elementary.  You know what I can't remember no teachers from elementary.  I remember ones from high school, but elementary I kind of glided through, I basically can't remember any teachers.
Speaker 1: But what was school like during your elementary school years.  What did you enjoy in school, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed anything like English, I enjoyed math, I enjoyed history, anything I could read, that was very enjoyable to me.
Speaker 1: What type of child were you during those elementary school years.  Were you a well-mannered child or a mischievous child, how would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: I was well-mannered.  I was very well-mannered.  I was so well-mannered that I get whipped because somebody else would do something right here and they'd blame it on me.  But I was very well-mannered, my mother [Ardath Roberta Collins] protected me, and that's what I did.  I tried--I really tried to be invisible, that way I figured I could do no wrong, I think I did no wrong.  So I wasn't the one that always had my hand up, I wasn't one who always had to go to the bathroom.  I always tried to do things that would not antagonize anybody.
Speaker 1: At that time did you have any dreams and aspirations yet?
Speaker 2: At that time no not really.  I really didn't start playing basketball, I didn't want to play basketball.  I started playing basketball then.  It was like thirty below outside, and I'd nail me a basket on the post and I'd play basketball, and I kind of carried it on through high school.
Speaker 1: Did you spend all of your elementary years in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I spent all of my--no I didn't.  I think I went two years in school in Davenport [Iowa], two years.
Speaker 1: What was that like compared to Gary?
Speaker 2: It was a whole different thing.  Davenport is really about education.  I remember one time the snow came up to the bedroom window and the truant officer came and knocked on the window and said, "How come he ain't in school?"  So they didn't care about the snow, "You have to go to school."  And they were about education.  I guess they still do, they had a very fine educational system.
Story_ID: 179580
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My mom [Ardath Roberta Collins] made sure I went to church.  In fact she volunteered my time to clean up the church.  I used to teach Sunday school.  I used to be in this creeky building all by myself trying to clean up, trying to keep all the doors open 'cause when the place is full of people it's different but when it's empty it's terrible, especially for a child, when I used to clean up the church, you know, I had to go back to Sunday school and I had to go to church.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Not the one I'm talking about. I did go to First Baptist when I got old enough to go on my own, I got to be about thirteen, fourteen, I joined this church called First Baptist [Church of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and I was good, I sang in the choir and the whole thing, until the preacher said, "Well, we got membership fee today, everybody got to pay a hundred dollars," so I haven't been back to First Baptist (laughter).
Story_ID: 179581
Speaker 1: So what about junior high.  You were still at [Theodore] Roosevelt [High School, Gary, Indiana] at junior high.  Who were some of your friends in junior high school and what kinds of things were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, junior high (unclear) a fellow name Calvin Fossett.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: F-O-S-S-E-T-T.  Calvin Fossett, he and I ran together, from grade school up, he and I ran together, like two peas in a pod.  He was much more aggressive than I was, but he was always there for me, and I was always there for him.  Calvin-- we met Billy Shelton [ph.] at that time.  And Billy wasn't athletically inclined, but he was one heck of a singer.  The boy could -- he knew all the harmonies, I mean, this was like a fourteen, thirteen year old, you know, harmonies.  He could teach you to (unclear).  So we ended up forming a group, first we called it The Three Bees, it was just the three of us, and we'd sing.  First his mother had a choir, his father was a preacher and they had a little church they built on the back.  So we would sing in the choir first and then she would allow us to sing contemporary songs afterwards.  And we had a very, very good group.  We had another fellow name William Dooley who became our bass singer and we sing in the hallways at school, and school was like four stories and you could hear us all over the place.  It got to the point they put us out, and we couldn't sing. We'd stir the people up trying to study.  But we had a heck of a group, we had a very good group.  What happened was they graduated a year before I did.  I was supposed to graduate with them, but I decided I liked school, so I stayed another year.  I was doing some amateur shows by myself, and Gerald Gregory became my bass and Willie C. Jackson approached me at my locker, it was a Christmas show coming up and they wanted to sing with me.  I really didn't want it, but I was type of person I couldn't--it was hard for me to say no.  And so we went back stage picked up another gentleman named Ernest Warren.  And we sang a song called 'I'll be Waiting' by the (unclear), and that's when we became Pookie Hudson and the Hudsonnaires. And it turned out we picked up another fellow name Opal Courtney [Jr.], and he became--he was our youngest singer, and that was our group, The Spaniels, when we recorded in 1953.
Speaker 1: And this is still--while you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 179582
Speaker 1: When did you first develop a love for singing?
Speaker 2: I just loved the radio, you know.  It just so happened, it was at a time when the blacks had about an hour on the radio and the rest of it was white music, so basically what I learned was the pop songs and the white music.  And if you wanted to hear black music you had to tune into 'Randy at Night' who was down in Memphis, Tennessee.  He played black music all night.  But basically in our city we had like an hour of black music.  And the lady who recorded us she was a DJ at the time, her name Vivian Carter.  Now we like thirty miles from Chicago [Illinois], so you know, if you in Chicago, you can hear a lot of the black music also.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how old you were when you would sit and listen to the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, about eight, nine or ten.  And it wasn't no television, you know, so that was our form of entertainment, listen to the programs like 'Amos 'n' Andy,' 'The Fat Man,' 'The Shadow,' '[The] Lone Ranger,' and it was great because it left everything to your imagination, you know.  As they talking to them you had to imagine what was going on and that was some great times, you know.  Television came along, it leaves nothing to the imagination, so.  I hate to say it - there's something wrong with our kid today, they have no imagination.  We talking about they get everything they want.  We had to make our toys, we had to make things to play with.  They don't do that now, they just let them buy it, so they have no imagination, they don't know what they doing half the time.  They don't care, you know.  Half the time the family don't care long as they're not bothering them.  That's, I think, becoming our biggest problem with our children.
Story_ID: 178720
Speaker 1: Mr. Hudson, let's go back a little bit.  You had mentioned Josephine Baker and Fats Waller being cousins.  Were there any particular stories that you remember that were passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  No more than like I said that I basically found out through my other cousins because they were taking care of the castle [in Paris, France] and they mostly interacted with Josephine than the family in Iowa did.  So I was only informed that they were cousins, you know.  So that's when I take it from there.
Speaker 1: And you talked about the acts stopping at your [great] aunt [Audrey Collins]'s house.  Who were some of those acts and what do you remember?
Speaker 2: Like I say there was the Ink Spots, there was Bill Kenny, Bill Kenny and the group [the Ink Spots] he was with, and they would sing, and then they fight.  That's what they--they carried guns on stage with each other--they hated each other as much as they sang with each other.  But they sang I guess because of the money situation.  But they ideologies were definitely different, they really had.  And [Nat] King Cole came through.  He--this lady across the street, she used to do all their hairs-- do all their hair.  And they would come over to my aunt's house and they'd sit there and they would talk.  I would just sit and listen, you know.  And Larry Darnell came through there.  It was quite a few acts that came through there and for some reason, I don't know how my aunt got that close with them, but that's where they would stop, it would be her house.
Story_ID: 178721
Speaker 1: Did you know at that time that this [singing] is what I think I'd like to do when I grow up?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly if I thought, I know I enjoyed it.  Because and before they like be at my grandmother [Ardath Crews]'s house who lived down the street from my aunt [Audrey Collins] and we all--the way the fact most blacks lived on Judson Street in Davenport [Iowa].  That's where they lived at.
Speaker 1: What street was that?
Speaker 2: Judson.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: J-U-D-S-O-N.  And my grandmother lived down the end.  My grandmother had a big huge plot of land she had.  I think she had every apple tree that she wanted, she had a cherry tree, she had two or three different kind of grapes; she had plums; she had an orange tree. She had everything but a banana tree.  And then down the side of the hill, she had asparagus and all these different foods.  Her husband was a chef.  He ran, like CVS chain was here, well, he ran the chain of drug stores through Iowa as a cook. He was the head cook and he made the meals and things for them.  And he was an avid hunter and he would take my uncle and he would go hunting and they bring back bear, tuna and deer and I don't think I ate any pork or beef while I was there.  That's all we ate was wild life, you know.  And he was a connoisseur of doing that.  As I said, he was a heck of a chef.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how old you were when you all moved from Iowa to Gary [Indiana] and what that was like?
Speaker 2: Well, now that's something--I don't know the age, you know.  I can't even--it's not a glimmer there.  I mean, all I remember is being in Gary, that's all I can remember about Gary, I mean about that move.
Story_ID: 178722
Speaker 1: So, as you were getting older, and you had already formed your first singing group in junior high school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana], were you starting to develop some role models and people that you really admired?  Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well at that time, I remember a name--what was this man's name.  I can't think of his name, sang lead.  (Unclear).  I just loved his voice.  I thought he was one heck of a singer and this is an era before the Doo Wop.  Everybody was singing some of those street music or maybe up to (unclear).  Billy Williams, that's his name, Billy Williams of the Charioteers.  I just loved--and Bill Kenny of the Ink Spots, of course [Nat] King Cole, all these people together, you know, helped mold and I tried to sing all these songs, and I got pretty good at it.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Ardath Roberta Collins] think about--
Speaker 2: My mother?  My mother said, boy, that music you singing ain't worth a dime and ain't gon last five minutes.  So that was her of me talking about singing.  She was into her Jeffery Langford [ph.] and Billy Eckstine, she was into a whole different realm of music.  So what I was doing really didn't interest her, truly.
Story_ID: 178723
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first performance in front of an audience, how old were you?
Speaker 2: You mean professionally?
Speaker 1: No, just the first time you sang in front of an audience, whether it was at church or--
Speaker 2: Well the Three Bees we used to sing, we had a place called the neighborhood house, we used to sing for the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  We didn't do any talent shows, we just sang in the hallways and things, you know.  But they put us out of school because we made all the noise, they called all the noise.  But basically, really the first real, I guess, audience was when we first formed Pookie Hudson and the Hudsonnaires, and we did the talent shows, so we had a very big, you know, school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana] audience at that time.
Speaker 1: When you were singing in hallways and at church, do you ever remember being nervous.  What were those performances like, what was it like?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I enjoyed it, you know, I didn't find it to be nothing to be scared about, you know.  Yeah, we always had butterflies and things what you're doing because you hit the wrong the note you don't sound bad and whatever 'cause we didn't have instruments. We had to use our voices so.  As long as we got the right note and you could see the reaction on people, they was enjoying what you were doing, and that just helps build you up more.
Story_ID: 178724
Speaker 1: How were the Three Bees different from Pookie Hudson and the Hudsonnaires?
Speaker 2: Well, the Three Bees we sang more of the old stuff, which is old at that time, we sang more of that. We sang songs like 'I Know', we sang--we had a lot of gospels, we did--basically we start off with gospels.  We did folk songs, we used to back up a young lady name Shirley.  She did this thing, 'The Fish Gotta Swim, Birds Gotta Fly' and we had a background for her.  And so it was not so more of singing to females, as it was singing for females.
Speaker 1: And how did you all come together, how did you all know that one another could sing, was it just through your reputation at school or how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Billy [Shelton] recruited me and Calvin [Fossett].  He just came and said, "Man, come on," and we had not did any singing, you know, not as together 'cause Calvin wasn't really into singing, but Billy whipped us into shape and taught us all the songs and things and we became very good at it.
Speaker 1: Was Billy the leader of the group at that time?
Speaker 2: Well you can say he was, 'cause he was the one teaching us and he was the one showing us the way.  I mean, I sang the lead, but he was a bass singer, but he was the one who put all the harmonies and things together for us.  And we had the little shows and things, he got all those little things for us.
Story_ID: 178725
Speaker 1: So at the time you were in the Three Bees, you all spent a lot of time singing songs that had already been written and produced.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When did you start making the transition into not only singing, but writing as well?
Speaker 2: That happened just as we were getting ready to record we would sing other people's songs, so the people (unclear) say, "You can't sing other people's songs, you have got to have your own material."
Speaker 1: So was this after high school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  See we came out of high school recording, so we had to finish school.  And so we were trying to put a song called 'Baby It's You' together which was our first release.   'Goodnight Sweetheart' I had written back in '52 [1952] and it was not really writing a song, it was for a young lady name Bonnie Jean.  I used to be in love with Bonnie Jean, and I used to go to her house and I stayed and stayed, and her mama got tired of me staying so she told me one night, said, "Son, your mama may not care about you being out after twelve o'clock, but she didn't mean for you to be here after twelve o'clock."  So walking home I put together 'Goodnight Sweetheart', but we did that in '52 [1952].  We didn't even want to record 'Goodnight Sweetheart' because we thought it was a childish song.  I took it to the group and we put it together.  So when the company tried to get us to do 'Goodnight Sweetheart' it took us almost eighteen hours to do the song 'cause we didn't want to do it.  We thought it was a childish song, we thought it was something that you would do in a nursery rhyme, or something.  And see how much we know about it-- the biggest thing we ever had was 'Goodnight Sweetheart.'
Story_ID: 178726
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to right after high school and you had formed the group, Pookie Hudson and the Hudsonnaires, what happened after that and what year was it?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the year '52 [1952] and '53 [1953].  We still in high school and we rehearsed, but we sang everybody a song.  We sang other group songs, the Clovers, the Five Keys, groups that were before us.  We were doing these tunes.  And we sang on different amateur shows, and we went to--they had a talent show in Chicago [Illinois] which showed on television and--every Sunday. I forget the man--and they had auditions at the Chicago Theater.  So we went in, and we auditioned, we sang tunes by the Crickets, not the white Crickets, there was a black group called the Crickets before (unclear) got killed, before him, there was a black group called the Crickets and they had a tune  called--
Speaker 1: What was that performance--what was it again?
Speaker 2: --'You Are Mine' that was the name of the song.  And we did 'You Are Mine' for the audition.  They wrote us a letter and told us we were too professional, they wouldn't let us on the show.  So we couldn't get on the show.  But that was just one of the first things, you know, that happened to us, which we-- kind of really gave us a boost to go ahead and do our thing.
Story_ID: 178727
Speaker 1: So when were you [The Spaniels] first approached by Vee-Jay Records?
Speaker 2: We were singing at a talent show.
Speaker 1: What year was it?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953], it was just before we graduated and a young lady who was in our class, she worked for them and they ran a record shop also.  Then she heard them discussing forming a label, so she made them come see us in school.  And they did and they liked what they heard.  And from then on it was history, you know.  They signed us.  We were like a little family there for a while, 'cause they lived in Gary [Indiana] also.  We rehearsed in their garage.  They treated us like we were their sons, you know, for a long time, until Vee-Jay Records became established to Vee-Jay Records and they hired a gentleman name Abner, Hewitt Abner [ph.], and he made it completely business.  When we used to walk in or walk in the back -- (unclear) -- couldn't do that no more.  They stopped us right at the gate.  So it became artist and business.  It stopped being friends, you know.
Speaker 1: How was Vee-Jay Records formed?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, what they did was--they want to do was label, what they did, we did 'Baby Sue' a song called 'Bounce' and they leased it to a label called Chance.  Chance put it out.  Chance went bankrupt.  So when Chance went bankrupt, Vee-Jay took it back and put their name on the Vee-Jay Records and that's how Vee-Jay began.
Speaker 1: So at this time when you're about to graduate from high school or about to record one of your first songs, were you ever thinking perhaps I will consider going to college or did you know this is the career path that I'm going to take?
Speaker 2: Well, I couldn't afford to go to college so, I mean, I was either going to sing or go to the steel mills like the rest of the kids did.  That was my option.
Story_ID: 178728
Speaker 1: Do you think that you all [The Spaniels] were considered celebrities in high school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, especially when we put the first record out 'cause it was played in Gary [Illinois] first at the skating rink on the radio, so we definitely became you know in our time, we became celebrities then.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: It was great.  I mean, we looked up to people, you know, they treated you different and it was you know it was a whole different thing than it was in the beginning.  You go back there now they couldn't tell you who was in the group.
Speaker 1: Were you all getting paid during your performances in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We weren't getting paid doing performances high school.  The Three Bees, when we used to sing, five dollars or six dollars, seven dollars.  I think we made ten dollars one time.
Speaker 1: Were any of your teachers influencing you in high school?
Speaker 2: I had quite a few teachers, especially (unclear) school in new music and our music teachers and our teachers that had plays.  But then I was in all the plays we had from freshman to senior.  I had Miss Simms [ph.], Miss Slaughter, Miss Hudson.  There was a teacher name Miss Hudson and it was Miss Shell [ph.] and Miss Gray and Miss Guy.  All these ladies were a real influence, you know.  And I might have missed a couple, but I don't mean to, but they were very influential.
Speaker 1: And how did they feel about you all singing.  You had mentioned once before that you all had gotten kicked out of school for singing.  How did the teachers feel about it?
Speaker 2: Oh, they don't mind us singing.  They didn't want us disturbing, you know, everybody else in school.  Oh, they loved us so we can go back stage and I told them that we wasn't bothering nobody, in fact, they used to come and get me out--I used to be in the mixed chorus and the boys' glee club member.  The girls' glee club, she would come and get me so I could sit down and sing for the girls for the mixed chorus and things, so they enjoyed it.  It wasn't that, you know, they didn't want to sing; they just didn't want us singing in the school 'cause it was disturbing people.
Speaker 1: And you had mentioned that this really elevated your popularity and I'm sure that it helped in terms of getting dates and that kind of thing.  So what was that like?
Speaker 2: Once we started doing professional?
Speaker 1: While you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, in high school?  I was really shy so I didn't know, you know.  It really didn't affect me that much.  I didn't have--like I said the only girl I really thought about at that time was Bonnie Jean, and I wasn't--I wasn't chasing girls, I was playing basketball, all I was doing.  And that basically was what I was doing playing basketball so it was no, no--just like in those days, I mean--
Story_ID: 178729
Speaker 1: It's hard to believe that you were this performer and singing all these different places and you were shy, so how did you deal with that when it was time to perform?
Speaker 2: I closed my eyes and just sang.
Speaker 1: Did you pretend you were someplace else or you were someone else?
Speaker 2: I just blocked everybody out.  I just do what I had to do.  And all I came to there was either applauding or booing, one of the two, whichever one they was doing.
Speaker 1: So did Bonnie Jean know that you had written the song 'Goodnight Sweetheart' for her?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she knew.  She knew.
Speaker 1: What did she think about that?
Speaker 2: Being kids you know.  It wasn't no big deal at that time.  It didn't become a big deal to any of us until we got older and people started asking about it, you know.  And 'cause she was a big--helping me started getting money.  I did this in '53 [1953] and never got a dime until about '78 [1978].  And she was one of those who let them know that she remembered me writing this tune for her in '52 [1952], so.  They had to start paying me, but they didn't want to pay me, you know.
Story_ID: 178730
Speaker 1: So once you all had graduated from high school [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana] and were with Vee-Jay Records, were you financially successful or did you think, okay, great, I can really support myself as an entertainer or how were you financially successful?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't make a heck of a lot of money.  You know we made two or three hundred dollars a week a person.  You know at that time two or three hundred dollars was not a bad amount of money, but we traveled.  You know so you know mostly you got your food and a hotel or something and you didn't have a heck of a lot of money.
Speaker 1: What was the traveling like, you had to pay for all your own expenses?
Speaker 2: We had enough to pay for our own expenses.  We had to pay for a car which came out of our recording money.  And the company give us the car but we had to pay them back to record.  And recording, revenues came out the recording.  And then we had to pay the note and we drove everywhere we went.  So we had to buy gas wherever we could stay at that time.  A lot of places--we went south wasn't too many places you could stay, and of course it was (unclear) city.  We go before the city.  And (unclear) they weren't sitting there when we first started sing, and so we were subject to all the prejudiced things that were going on in the South.
Story_ID: 178731
Speaker 1: Do you remember the first time you heard one of your songs on the radio?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember the era.  Yeah, I remember around the time and it was--it was uplifting.
Speaker 1: About what time was that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think (unclear) fall from eleven to twelve so that would be between eleven and twelve.  Of course he must have played it six, seven times, you know.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: So the first year you were with Vee-Jay Records?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What did your family and you friends think?
Speaker 2: Well, it took a while for my mom [Ardath Roberta Collins], she still didn't come around.  You got one but you probably won't get no more and one of them kind of things, you know.  And she went back to her Billy Eckstine or (unclear), she wasn't thinking about me.
Speaker 1: Was that hard for you not having your mother fully support what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No.  She did what she wanted to do, I did what I wanted to do. I had no problem with it. In fact that way she wouldn't be in my business.
Story_ID: 178732
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about some of the travelling that you all were doing.  You were travelling down south, was that your first experience in the South?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was about--well, you know Gary [Indiana] had been quite prejudice at one time, too.  And, you know, we had to ride on back street cars, and in the bus station, they had the "colored" and "white" signs.  We had--some theaters we couldn't go into.  And then we had--we had a beach in Gary that I didn't even know it was there until I damn near got grown, excuse my language.  I didn't know we had that beach 'cause we couldn't go to it called Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And the young fellow [Opal] Courtney [Jr.] who was in our group, his father went out and integrated Marquette Park.  They beat him something terrible when he came out of there, but he was the one that went out, and he opened my eyes that we had a park.  But he was well compensated behind that, but they did a job on Mr. Courtney but he was one who stood his ground, you know, 'cause his father used to be a [Harlem] Globetrotter also.  So we were lucky we had some people who around.  And then we had a police officer named Saint Louis.  Saint Louis went down to the bus station, and he shot down all the signs, anybody from back over here he was shooting them.  So we kind of went into integration on our own, you know.  It never bothered me 'cause I never knew it was, you know, that it was such a thing, as it being segregated until we went south and then I saw what the difference was.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: It was--sometimes it's hard and then sometimes it was a great learning lesson.  So you really had to have patience to do that 'cause what they cared about killing one of us was nothing.  So it was just knowing how to get by and being entertainers.  We got stopped a couple of times in Mississippi where the police would stop us and they would pull their cars on us and they see that we was singers and they make us sing on the side of the road, crap like this here, you know, but and then they call back and say, "We have a bunch of them niggers down here, some of those singing niggers," this type of crap.  One time the Dells, we were following each other, and we went over Lookout Mountain in [Chattanooga] Tennessee and they stopped us and they made us eat watermelon, they made us (unclear), they made us sing just because we were black and had Illinois tags on our cars.  So we went to places to eat, we had to go around the back and they slide your food out, shoot, so if you catch it, you got it made, if you didn't catch it, you know, made no difference.  You know we went through a lot of that crap, too.  But, like I said, that was before the city, you know, so.  I think we were (unclear), we just went along with it (unclear).
Story_ID: 178733
Speaker 1: How did the other members of the group [Pookie Hudson and the Hudsonnaires] handle it?  Did everyone pretty much handle it the same way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody handled it about the same way.  Everybody handled it the same way 'cause we understood, we were outnumbered.  We were in they country, we weren't in our country.  So we had to basically do the way things were done in that era.
Speaker 1: What was it like going to some of these places that were far away from home where people didn't know you but they still knew of you and were coming out to listen to you perform, what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great.  Some more people across the world enjoy what you're doing and--I mean they would approach you like they knew you all they life, you know, this type of thing, so.  And you learn fast, you had to learn fast because you're not in a place all that much time, you know, so you had to make your relationships or whatever you did almost in a day and a lot of these friendships became, you know--lasted, lasting relationships as far as being friends were concerned.  But it was a fast life, it was very fast.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well you know, people giving you something.  Everybody giving you liquor--we were lucky, we weren't on drugs, we didn't use drugs so we didn't have that problem, but drinking, we had that problem.  You know, women following you around if they are available and something that you didn't do when you were home, and you don't realize it then until you do get out and see how other people live.
Speaker 1: Do you think it was harder because of your age?  Do you think had you been more mature you could have handled it better?
Speaker 2: Oh quite sure.  I'm quite sure.  If we had been more mature we could have handled it much better and we could have really made something out of it.  But we were so busy--we were so busy pleasing ourselves, pleasing the flesh--
Story_ID: 178734
Speaker 1: Were you happy with your life then in the early '50s [1950s], were you happy with the way things were going (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I didn't have to go to the steel mills [in Gary, Indiana].  I worked the steel mills about a year and I was very happy to get out the steel mills, so yeah, I enjoyed it quite much so.
Speaker 1: And were you thinking that you were on the road to stardom and what were you hoping would happen?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I wrote a song one time called 'Once A Star Always a Star' and I had this earnest feeling that once you're a star, you was always a star.  I found out the hard way, that's a lie.  It don't work like that.  My feelings were very high in the beginning, you know, but then when I start realizing and reality start taking place, it wasn't as easy as you would think it is.  It was hard writing night and day sometimes and you got to drive here, you got to drive there.  Sometime you go in a place singing, you didn't have no time to go to a hotel or anything.  And then you had to come out of there and go someplace else, so you know, it was very, very, very tiring.
Story_ID: 178735
Speaker 1: Mr. Hudson, we're right around, you know, mid-'50s [1950s] and 1954 was your first marriage, tell me a little bit about your first wife and what that was like with you being a young performer, travelling and spending a lot of time away from home and her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Alice, Alice Marie--what was Alice's last name.  Doggone, can't think of her last name.  Alice Marie Morton [ph.], Alice Marie Morton.  And I was beginning to discover girls and I had put Bonnie Jean on the back burner, and I ran into Alice and we got together and she was young and I was--Alice, she was fifteen and I was almost twenty, something like that.  We spent a lot of time together and things and next I know we were married and having our first child, who was Mark Hudson, he was my first child by her.  And it was--you know, we had no business getting married, we were children, you know, and we honestly didn't know how to handle marriage at that time.
Speaker 1: What was it like being a young performer with a wife and a small child?
Speaker 2: Well, right at that time we had a child, I quit singing, I stopped singing.  I said, well, I'm gon' stay home, get a job, take care of my family.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], '56 [1956], something like that, right in between there.  And so I stopped singing, got a job at General American making boxcars, and we stayed with her mother for a while and we finally got a little apartment of our own and we got--she was still in her childish state and I was still in mine.  I happened to come home one day and she had left the baby in the crib and her and her little girlfriend went to the store to get the some candy and they got blew up and she went back home to her mother and things and it basically ended the marriage, you know.  But we kind of got back together after a second child.  And then after that it really just, ended the marriage.
Story_ID: 178736
Speaker 1: And after that [separation from first wife] you went back to singing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right I went back to singing.  Gerald [Gregory] had kept the group going, the bass singer.  And he had gotten Donald Porter, [Parmaley] Carl Rainge and James Demple Cochran [ph.], and they were singing as the Spaniels and they were caught up on recording. I think Carl was supposed to sing, Carl had got hoarse or something.  So they came to me and asked if I would do the recording and I had wrote a tune at the time called 'Peace of Mind' so we learned that and we did a little tune called 'Please Don't Tease' and we did that, and from that day then I still (unclear).
Speaker 1: And were you all still with Vee-Jay Records at this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were still with Vee-Jay Records, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you know one would think you're recording these songs and you had this huge hit, 'Goodnight Sweetheart' that you all were probably doing pretty well financially, was that the case?
Speaker 2: No, not really, not really.  We didn't make a heck of a lot of money, really didn't.
Speaker 1: What was happening--
Speaker 2: I think we were being doubled a lot, you know.  People said we were being double contracted, you know, like--
Speaker 1: --What does that mean?
Speaker 2: --That means that the buyer would pay the agent a certain amount of money, you know what I'm saying.  Say the buyer pay the agent $6000, agent come to say, "I got a job for you for $1500."  Not only did he keep the other money, he want ten percent of your $1500, so we got caught up in a lot of that.  And we were just young, dumb. We out chasing women, drinking whiskey and finances was not a problem to us until it was too late, what should have been the first thing on our mind, was the last thing.
Story_ID: 178737
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about what happened later on in the '50s [1950s] a couple of years later when you all [The Spaniels] were hoping to have some of your songs played on Alan Freed's [Albert James "Alan" Freed] program, what happened there?
Speaker 2: Alan Freed wanted to put his name on 'Goodnight Sweetheart' as a writer.
Speaker 1: And who is Alan Freed?
Speaker 2: Alan Freed, was at that time, they say he's the beginning of rock and roll.  He was playing all the black music on the radio station.  He had a few whites, but basically his music was black.  He used to give his shows to Brooklyn Paramount.  He had his great shows, which we never did any of those.  He never hired us for any of his shows, he never played any of our records because we would not let him put his name on 'Goodnight Sweetheart'.
Speaker 1: What do you mean you wouldn't let him put his name on it?
Speaker 2: He wanted to put his name on it as a writer, in other words he wanted to collect royalties, and we wouldn't let him do that.  So his way of getting back at us was not to play our records or to hire us in his act or in his shows.
Speaker 1: Did that hurt in terms of your career?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I didn't even know he was there, truthfully.  If anything, to get on his show, all we do is making money for him anyway, you know, truthfully.  So it wasn't no big loss--
Story_ID: 178738
Speaker 1: So, it was the height of doo-wop, so tell us a little bit about what doo-wop is and how it came about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we [The Spaniels] never thought it was doo-wop when we started but--and I could understand what you're saying because what happened was we different from the older groups who did a lot of straight harmony singing.  We made up words for our background, like doo-wop, dooby, dooby doo, doo, dooly doo-wop.  We made up this version and we used this as harmony lines.  And for some reason somebody come up and said, "Well, this is doo-wop," and it stuck.  But really, it was just rhythm and blues at the time.
Speaker 1: And what was happening with your career in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: It had taken a nose dive.  And what happened was I moved from there to Washington [Washington, D.C.].  I got a group from Washington and I started recording for Neptune Records, which was Lloyd Price and his partner [Harold Logan].  We started recording for them.  In fact before then, the last record we did with Vee-Jay Records was called 'I Know, Cha, Cha, Cha', and it made a little noise and things for this group.  And it lasted for about a year then we went to the Lloyd, and I had moved from here to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and one of them was Lloyd and he recorded some songs with us.
Speaker 1: Why did you leave Vee-Jay?
Speaker 2: Well, Vee-Jay was going bankrupt.  And Vee-Jay had over extended itself in the record business.  If they had've stuck with the black music I think it would have been great, they had great artists, you know they had J. F. Butler, they had the Dells, they had us and they had the Magnificents, they had the El Dorados, had (unclear), they had a roster of hit-makers, but they decided they wanted to delve into the white music and they stopped buying up  Joe Stafford and people like this here, you know, and I think, you know, it just hurt them.
Speaker 1: And when Vee-Jay went bankrupt what did that mean for you?
Speaker 2: Well, that meant it was over with, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like your career was over?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause we knew we could always go to another record company.  And I had been approached by a few people anyway about you know singing about recording (unclear).  And I chose Lloyd Price and his partner to do it.
Story_ID: 178739
Speaker 1: So when you went to Neptune [Records], what year was it and were you thinking this is gonna be a new beginning or what were you thinking about this opportunity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well like it would be a new beginning.  I had a new group, new beginning. It was about '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: So it was--was it still the original group when you went to Neptune?
Speaker 2: No, I had another group in Washington [D.C.], a whole different group, 'cause the old group had broke up, Donald Porter and [Parmaley] Carl Rainge and Dimple Cochran [ph.], they went back home.  So it was me, Gerald [Gregory], Ernest Warren, Ernie Mack, Billy Carie [ph.] and Pete Simmons became the group, which we did 'I know Cha, Cha'.  But then, down the line, Gerald and Ernest left.  So I was left with Mack and Billy and Pete, and I guess the group just kind of just evolved to different people on down the line, 'cause we weren't doing that much work, you know, and weren't doing that much recording.  I ended up doing a tune by myself called 'I know I Know' on W.L. Records, which is also (unclear). I did it by myself, along with the background of Little Anthony and the Imperials, did the background, in fact, Sammy Strain wrote the song who sang with the Imperials.  So I did three or four things with them, you know.  And 'I know I Know' became a pretty nice song, it was (unclear), it didn't maintain, you know, as we hoped that it would.
Speaker 1: Why not.  What was happening?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't recording enough.  I don't really think we were getting played that we needed really to get and so you don't get to play, people don't hear, people don't buy it.
Speaker 1: So the group was, as you had mentioned, dissolving and you had formed a new group.  What do you think was happening where you were thinking, I'm going make this happen, why were you so determined to continue to try to keep the Spaniels together or keep at least the name?
Speaker 2: Well, it was something I wanted to do, you know, I really wanted to sing.  I wanted to see if I get some of my material out there and I pray for that.  You know it wasn't like the time to make things get better, 'cause things were getting better for black artists, they were getting--see when we were coming along we didn't get no white radio play.  White stations didn't play black music, so all our music was played on black stations, the stations that played black music.  And as you came along in the '60s [1960s] then they start with Motown, they start with what they called the cross-over music.  And white stations were playing black music and things, and I was hoping to get into that, you know, to that type of thing in the music business, you know.
Speaker 1: Why do you think you weren't able to make that transition?
Speaker 2: I did not have the representation I should have had, you know.  It's a funny thing, people that do business basically do not like to talk with entertainers.  They would rather talk to an agent or somebody else.  They don't really want to talk--they really don't want to do business with you, and basically I was doing my own business, and it became a problem.
Story_ID: 178740
Speaker 1: What impact do you think the Civil Rights Movement had on music, if any?
Speaker 2: Well, it meant that we had more freedom.  You know, like I say black music began to start getting played on the radio, black artists were beginning to be recognized by the white community.  Most likely Beatles and Mick Jagger, their music basically came off black music.  This is what inspired them, you know.  And so it was good for--it was good for those that were able to be there and maintain and have the representation that they needed, it was good for them.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing with your career in the '60s [1960s], what was happening with your career?
Speaker 2: It was off and on, you know.  I was working here, I was working there.  There was a lot of singing and I had a little label of my own called North America, tried to do something with that, and it fell on its face.  And I had many jobs.  I worked in all the hotels in Washington, D.C.  (Unclear) used to collect garbage, just trash, I cleaned bathrooms, you know, I've done the whole gamut to try to stay into what I wanted to do which was singing.
Speaker 1: What year did you start your own label?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] I think it was, about '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: And why did you decide to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was hoping that I could take it out there and get played, you know, I hoped that somebody would play the material.  Just didn't work that way.
Speaker 1: Were you still collecting royalties from--
Speaker 2: I was getting no royalties at that time.  I didn't start getting royalties until 1978.
Story_ID: 178741
Speaker 1: And how did you start getting royalties?
Speaker 2: Finally found, after going through about twenty lawyers, I finally found one lawyer, who a lawyer and a gentleman name Henry Farik [ph.], who's a investigator and went to New York and went through some papers and things and found that the songs were mine and they came up with the indisputable evidence that these people couldn't say no to, so they ended up having to pay me.
Speaker 1: So what was happening, when did you first say, I'm entitled to these royalties.  Tell me a little bit about how that fight began and just take me through the steps?
Speaker 2: Well, it basically--see when I first started writing songs I didn't know there was such thing as a song writer, you know.  I thought you just wrote songs so you can sing.  I didn't even know money was involved as far as being a song writer was concerned.  And I had to be schooled down the line by different artists who knew, you know.  And it must have took ten years for me to realize, you know, that I'd been taken.  By the time that they come up it was too late 'cause it was done, you know.  So when I went to the publishers who handled it, they tried to say I had nothing to do with it, and it so happened they said I sold it all to Vee-Jay Records, what they said, and they came up with some paper that I had signed.  What happened was I was drafted during the Korean War. It was fifty-something [1950s]. It was '56 [1956], it was after I went back to singing, and I was drafted to go into the Korea War.  I refused to go, and they came and got--we were singing in Texas, they come and took me off the stage and they had brought me back to Chicago [Illinois], and brought me back through the, not inspection -- we had to go through all these tests and things to see if you're all right.  And somehow I came out of this one, they said I had a bad heart, that's what it was.  So they sent me and another--all those people, too--went back home.  So in going back, I wanted to go back to Texas to catch up with the group 'cause we were going on a ninety day tour, I think it was.  And so I went to the company, they had a song, I told you about, 'Peace of Mind' I told Mr. (unclear) who was the husband [Jimmy Bracken] of Vivian [Carter], I say, "Listen, I'll sell you this song for $50, all I want to do is get back to Texas."  He took it, and they took the song, and I signed the paper for it.  They took that paper and scratched it, and they put all my songs and said I sold all my songs for $50.  Anyway my lawyer found out, number one, that would have been against the law anyway for me to do that, number two, they found out that it wasn't notarized.  So it held for this anyway so they ended up had to start paying me on the basis of that.
Speaker 1: Why did you have to go through so many lawyers?
Speaker 2: Well, for some reason everybody else stomped their toes.  But what I think it was, when they got close enough to these people, they gave a piece of money, and they come back and said, "Well, there ain't nothing we can do."
Speaker 1: As you talked to other artists were there others in the same situation that you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of the black artists at that time had the same problem--had the same problem, yes.
Speaker 1: Did most of them get the end result that you did of the people?
Speaker 2: So far most of them have now, yeah.  A lot of them that were persistent, you know, have gotten their dues.
Speaker 1: And during this time when you were still fighting for your royalties and just hearing 'Goodnight Sweetheart' everywhere, in movies, and you know re-recorded, what were some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well I was happy it was being done, you know.  I didn't know if I would ever recoup any of that money for the simple reason that they kind of had me, I don't know, I went through so many lawyers, I almost got to the point where I almost gave up, so you know if the lawyers can't do it, you know, what can I do?  And just so happen I got the right lawyer that went all the way and got it done.
Speaker 1: Did it make you angry?
Speaker 2: No, you know, at first.  A lot of things in the beginning things were--like Miss [Vivian] Carter, she ended up in a nursing home, lost her leg and arm and stuff to diabetes in Gary [Indiana], so I went to visit her, you know, and I sit there and talked, we cried together, we talked together, we forgave each other and when I walked out, I didn't look back no more.  'Cause I find out looking back only hurts you, it don't hurt nobody else 'cause they already did what they gon' do.  So if you looking back, you know, that means somebody gon' pass you up 'cause you're not watching where you going, you know.  After I start watching where I was going and it made a difference--
Story_ID: 178742
Speaker 1: What year is this that you went back to Gary [Indiana] to visit her [Vivian Carter] at the nursing home?
Speaker 2: We were both living at the same time, I'm trying to figure out who was--it had (unclear), I think it was in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Did she admit to, you said you forgave her, did she admit to wrongdoing?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: What did she say to you during that conversation?
Speaker 2: Well, we just talked about the old times and things were at the times, and she was telling me they wanted to write a book about her and they was supposed to be coming to the nursing home to deal with that, and sorry that things didn't work out, there was no different then what they did and sorry too, you know.  Never got into a thing to say, "Well, you beat me, da da da da da."  It didn't make no sense to do that at that time, even though at one time that's what I wanted to do, you know, it didn't make no sense to do that because, like I said, it's already done, you can get it back, you know.  And you started watching them, and trying to cause some problems for them is not going to do you any good, so I left it alone.  Walked out of there and, like I said, I never looked back.
Story_ID: 178743
Speaker 1: So, in the '70s [1970s] you were still trying to hold the group [The Spaniels] together?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you all were working on and doing in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Well, we were basically being, what do I want to say, giving--I'm sorry, being hired for little shows and things, you know, around the country and I had a group out of Washington [D.C.] and we did a lot of work in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and a lot of stuff around here, but basically, we all had jobs, you know.  The whole thing came down if you want to pay your rent you had to have a job, so that's what that came to.  The song 'I know I Know' I was telling you about I did with Lloyd Price.  I starved for that song.  I left Philadelphia and went to New York, it was around Christmas time, and I thought Lloyd and them were gon be at the office.  I had seven dollars when I got to New York, I had no money, really.  I had seven dollars when I got to New York.  They had gone on Christmas vacation and I'm in New York with seven dollars, you know.  At that time it cost you fifty cents to get into New York and fifty cents to get out, but I was riding the buses, and I didn't have any bus fare, so I slept in Central Park [New York, New York] for two weeks in snow this deep.  Nobody could tell you that newspaper can't keep you warm, it kept me warm for two weeks.  Finally ran into somebody I knew and they put me up for a little while, I got a job at Macy's just counting beads, had a great big roll of beads just with beads in it.  So I got a job after Christmas counting beads with Macy's.  Lloyd came back I did the song, 'I Know I Know' and they sent me to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to do a show for a disc jockey.  Now they had this suite for me in this hotel.  The disc jockey thought Lloyd and them paid me and Lloyd had thought the disc jockey was gon pay me.  Lloyd went on vacation again, I'm sitting here in this big suite for a week, had pots and pans, had everything in the place.  I didn't have a dime, you know, I didn't eat for a week, all I did was drink water and go back into this room 'cause I knew nobody in Pittsburgh.  And it just shows you things you go through sometimes to do what you wanna do, and that's what had happened to me.
Speaker 1: The time in Central Park, was that your lowest point?  Did you feel like that was your lowest point?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I never know what the lowest point was.  I mean, I was always willing to do what I had to do to continue doing what I wanted to do.  So I really wouldn't even call it the lowest point.  I don't know if it's (unclear), the lowest point I've been there, you know.  I picked up dollars, I took them down, ten dollars, I mopped floors, I've done the whole thing, so what is the lowest point.
Speaker 1: And so what was happening with the group and with you personally in the '70s you were--
Speaker 2: We had disbanded.
Speaker 1: --But the group that you had in Washington [D.C.], had that group disbanded as well?
Speaker 2: That was after--the incident was before the group.
Speaker 1: Right, but in the '70s [1970s] what was happening with the group then?
Speaker 2: Oh, same thing.  We were just, you know, somebody would hire us here, somebody would hire us there, you know, wasn't no great big thing.
Story_ID: 178744
Speaker 1: What do you think has been the most valuable lesson that you've learned from all of your experiences?
Speaker 2: The most valuable lesson I've learned was that I have to learn how to trust in the Father and the Lord.  I have been so busy in my life trying to do things myself and they all failed.  And then finally I turned to the Lord and let it stand where it is supposed to, I succeeded.  So I think I learned how to really turn things up to the Lord and that's been very good for me, that's the best high I could have.
Story_ID: 178745
Speaker 1: And what are your hopes for doo-wop and for other artists similar to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I know we'll never get back into the swing that it was.  It's possible two or three of us might break through, but I had this foundation called, that I put together called Landmark Theater and what I would like to do with Landmark Theater is to open a small theater here, I call it theater, don't have to be, a place where tourists could come through, they can check upon the history of what they call doo-wop and check upon the different artists and things, can buy the materials and buy these things and have a show maybe once a day or twice a day and then one big show maybe once a month with the old groups.  And I would like to take that money and help out those who at one time were singers and who lived this and who gave their lives so that people could hear their music and who never did anything else and now they don't have a way to really take care of their selves, or maybe send their kids or their grandkids to school, and maybe do some things--that's what I'd like to do with this organization.  I would surely like to do something for all those who are not able to take care of their self.
Speaker 1: Are there a lot of former artists like that?
Speaker 2: I think there's quite a few.  I'm quite sure there's quite a few that you know that are hoping, that's singing and hoping that's something's gon' happen.  And I think, you know, I think they're out--everybody needs a push and everybody needs some help.  And I don't see anything wrong with it.  Getting trophies and plaques and things, that's all great, but it don't pay any bills, and a lot of people need bills paid, I know I did.  I mean, if I ask for a credit card now they probably put me in jail, 'cause I owe everybody and their mama, 'cause I had to do what I had to do to survive.  Now I'm sorry that I had to but it just happen, you know.  If it don't be for my wife [Delores "Dee" Brown Hudson], right now, she's been my biggest supporter, she's been there for me through thick and thin.  And I thank the Lord every day for her. I've been through a lot of women and none has been the stalwart that she has been.
Story_ID: 178746
Speaker 1: You were inducted in the [Rhythm and Blues] Hall of Fame in 1992?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-one [1991], '2 [1992], something like that.
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Hudson, let's talk a little bit more about doo-wop, the music.  Do you think there's going to be a revival of doo-wop?
Speaker 2: You know, we're doing quite a few shows now.  I don't know how long it's going to last, but we're doing quite a few shows, you know, we're getting a lot of--we get a lot of people, you know we get three, four, five thousand, sometimes ten thousand people.  Just so at the particular moment they white and it was not that many blacks that participate in this, but in this area it is.  But in the Washington [D.C.] area, you know, we get a lot of black folks, but basically our town and around our audience is white.  And these people real knowledgeable to music, I mean, they're knowledgeable of each individual can tell you know where you from, your name, where you born, your mama, your daddy, I mean, they dig into it all the way.  And they bring their children, you know, to hear this.  And so far you know like we were doing shows with eight, nine, ten groups sometimes, you know, but and sometimes we do a lot of things by ourselves and we still get the same type of response.  So I can't say that how long it's gon last, so far it's been pretty good to us.
Speaker 1: Why do you think it's been able to last this long?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it ain't that.  One time for some reason or the other someone started bringing them back where people started coming with all they albums and things.  And then the big thing was the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] show that really set it on fire, so through that it has been able to sustain.
Speaker 1: When was the PBS show?
Speaker 2: PBS show, when was that?  '92 [1992]?  No, no, no, PBS show, not too long ago, about four or five years ago, about four years ago, about '99. It was about '99 [1999], before I married her [Delores (Dee) Brown Hudson], about '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: So what do you think is going to be the future of Doo-wop?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if we would work together, it's one thing if we really work together we can really give it longevity, but we have to work together to do this.  I mean we might as well work together, I mean, the other groups, you know, the other people that are involved and we can maintain, you know.  But if we don't work together it's going to do the same thing, it's going to fall apart again (unclear)--
Story_ID: 178747
Speaker 1: Do you think that there are younger artists who are interested in doo-wop?
Speaker 2: Sure.  You know I have a gentleman name Ronnie I who gives his show almost every weekend up in [Clifton] New Jersey, and he has a bunch of a cappella groups that comes through, and they all young.  I mean they're twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven years old and know the music and sing it well.
Speaker 1: So are you hoping they are going to pick up the torch?
Speaker 2: I hope, you know, that they would bring along some kind of luck and bring some kind of way that I might be able to help them to do that.
Speaker 1: What do you think about the current popular musics, in particular rap, do you think that Doo-wop can compete with that?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause we don't have that kind of audience.  Our audience is not that big.  There's no way we can compete with that kind of music, what they call music.  It's talking to me, but people (unclear).  Now I'm sounding like my mama [Ardath Roberta Collins], 'cause my mama said, "Your music ain't nothing."  I'm saying these people, but their music is fine for them 'cause it's making millionnaires out of most of 'em.  I don't know what type of attitudes they have, but I see some of those that strung off that and went into movies and things and do a very good job, what they doing, you know, so I don't think Doo-wop would ever measure up to that, no.
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for young artists who are interested in Doo-wop, what advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Well, the best advice I would say now, make sure you have a good lawyer, be sincere with your singing.  And you be sincere and you could cross other people--they'll let you know.  Boyz II Men did it, (unclear) Doo-wop.  They make plenty of money doing it.
Speaker 1: Do you think they [Boyz II Men] would consider a doo-wop?
Speaker 2: Whether you consider it or not, it's doo-wop, you know.  It's the same thing we were doing.  Not only them got a few white people, you got Joe, what's his name, I can't remember his name, he had a little group, there's another group, white boys would do it, so it's successful for some.  They can call it what they want to, but it's nothing but doo-wop.
Story_ID: 178748
Speaker 1: You had talked earlier about young people's interest in doo-wop, not necessarily entertainers, but tell me a little bit about your experience in Europe?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went to one place in Europe, we did a weekend and it was like a resort and these kids came from all other countries, like Belgium, France, England, Australia and they came to this place and stayed a weekend.  And they couldn't hardly talk to each other, you know, they couldn't even understand each other hardly, but as you singing, if you watch their lips, they knew every word to every song that we sang.  So it's pretty big over in Europe, you know.
Speaker 1: How did that make you feel to look out in the audience and see that?
Speaker 2: Well, that was amazing, you know.  I didn't expect it, but it showed that there is a lasting thing to the music.
Speaker 1: In the early '90s [1990s] you were inducted into the Hall of Fame [1992], what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame, you know.  It's always nice to be recognized, but the thing is this recognition that they give us I have lots of plaques, I have lots of trophies and I get a lot of accolades, but and it's hard to say, but I have to say it don't pay any bills.  It don't give you any more jobs than you would have gotten in the beginning, and now at this time in my life, it's about making money.  It's not a game anymore, I'm not chasing women, I'm not drinking, I'm not doing these things that I once did in life, you know.  Right now I'm trying to build something and trying to build everlasting something so that some of these people can get some kind of payout, the time and effort they put into entertaining people.
Story_ID: 178749
Speaker 1: What do you think has been your biggest accomplishment and what are you most proud of in terms of your career?
Speaker 2: Biggest accomplishment, what would that be? Well, first I guess being needed that the Lord allowed me to have a song like 'Goodnight Sweetheart' to be able to say it's mine and to be able to say that you know I wrote it.  For finally finding a good woman in my life with someone who's about me and not about they selves.  And who's there when I need her.  And then I finally been able to relax myself in the Lord and understanding and I let him do the work, I won't have to worry about anything else.
Speaker 1: What about regrets.  What's your biggest regret, what do you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: If there was a difference for me to do, I had to be more on top of the business aspect of the entertainment business.  I wish I had been more serious.  I wish I had had more morals than what I had and not being led into everything and accept me because someone say, "Well, Pookie, you know you deserve this."  I don't deserve everything and some of the things they say I deserve, I shouldn't even deal with, but I have and I thank the Lord he's allowed me to be here this long, to be able to realize my mistakes.
Speaker 1: Were there some artists that you performed with who did have a good knack for business and it's paid off for them?
Speaker 2: [Earl] Speedo [Carroll], The Cadillacs, he has a very good head for business and he's been doing well.  I normally pass some of those, I know the Dells, they've had a very good head for business, and they survived, and they're still there.
Speaker 1: So do you think that's what made the difference, that they really did have, they were really more involved in the business end of things?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  It made a whole lot of difference, yeah.  You know when people start taking for granted they start doing what they want to do and start offering what they want to offer you anytime you take a stand and say this is what I want and you don't want give it to them, you go on to the next person, you know.  I've sometimes include them not doing that.  (Unclear).  Shouldn't be that way, you know.  I feel if you feel that you can give a show, then you should be able to pay the price.  I mean, I'm not here to make you--I'm not here just to make you money, you know what I'm saying, you sing for nothing I take the money home, it don't work like that anymore.  Used to be a time when I was working like that, but it don't work like that no more.
Story_ID: 178750
Speaker 1: You continue to sing and perform, how long do you plan to do that?
Speaker 2: Until they throw dirt in my face.
Speaker 1: Are you planning to get together with some of the original members of the group [the Spaniels]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We got two or three things we doing next month, so.  And hopefully we can do some more things, you know, we working on doing some other things.  Hope it work out for us.
Speaker 1: What's it like for you when you all get together?
Speaker 2: Because you go back and relive times, and there's no animosity, ain't nobody accusing nobody of nothing.  All we trying to do is make whatever we got better.
Story_ID: 178751
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and or concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh, are we getting political here or--
Speaker 1: No, just in general, what are your hopes or concerns, whatever?
Speaker 2: My only concern is that we are the people are able to keep banding together, being strong, being able to let people know what we want and to not being subservient to people.  And I wish our kids would stop killing each other.  We should have more love, more understanding and pray our leaders, who I don't know who they are, I don't even know we got leaders, but those who profess to be our leaders to be able to stand, not only for themselves, but for those that they profess to lead.
Story_ID: 178752
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered, what do you want people to say about you when they talk about Pookie Hudson?
Speaker 2: I'd like to know that somehow I brought 'em joy, somehow I gave 'em some information that be worth they while down the line and that I was there for them when I had a chance to be.
Speaker 1: But do you think that you will more than likely be remembered as the man who penned the song 'Goodnight Sweetheart' Goodnight?
Speaker 2: Well, but that's the way history ever had a way of doing things, you know.  Sometimes it brings you down to your simplest form and the rest of it is there but, what can I say.  And you might get one word in the book, you know, he wrote 'Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight' it might be the end of it.
Speaker 1: And what about your foundation, are you hoping that that will be a legacy as well?
Speaker 2: I'm praying that it will be a legacy and I pray that it will always be there to help and to guide and to finance those who need it.
Speaker 1: And are you getting assistance from other artists?
Speaker 2: Not at the moment.  Everybody's doing their own thing.  It's kind of hard to get that done.  It's just something--and I hate to say it takes time, we just don't help each other.
Speaker 1: And one of the goals of this foundation is to share the history of Doo-wop and these artists.  Why do you think that that's important and why do you think history in general is important?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's an important part of our music the Doo-wop.  It don't be for Doo-wop lots of white artists out there with me out there wouldn't be out there, you know, like take Pat Boones and (unclear), this is what they--they can't offer this.  This is what they recorded to become who they are.  And they became who they are because they were white and they could get the regular play that we couldn't get.  So songs that we have been singing for years, white folks never heard and they thought it was original, but it was our music and I think that that should be documented that it was our music.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to add, Mr. Hudson, that maybe we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Let me think.  No, I can't think of anything, you know.  I truly appreciate you coming.  I hope I had something to say that makes somebody happy or shows somebody the way to go.  I thank ya'll, I love you, God bless.
Story_ID: 178753
Speaker 1: Mr. Hudson, earlier you said that doo-wop was really just Rhythm and Blues, what did you mean by that?
Speaker 2: I mean it came out the rhythm and blues field.  We put doo-wop together, it was our song.  This what we did as background for songs, but we were singing rhythm and blues.  That's why it never got played on white stations because the white stations wouldn't play it.  But they said that our music was the devil music and so they didn't want their children to listen to it--they wouldn't let their children listen to it until somebody got the bright idea, let's go get some white kid, let them sing it and all of a sudden it becomes good music.
Speaker 1: I'm been trying to like look from a really broad perspective that popular music as a whole in the evolution of popular music, what's the place of doo-wop or what's its major contribution?
Speaker 2: It's major contribution was the big hit songs that came out of thin air, (unclear), 'Goodnight Sweetheart', 'Little Darlin', (unclear) he died when-'Louie, Louie'.  All these songs came from black people.  So and it became part of white culture, especially 'Louie, Louie'.  You play that at almost every movie you go to.  You listen to it.
Speaker 1: What's the Spaniels place within doo-wop, where do they stand?
Speaker 2: Well, basically you want to tell the truth.  We were the originators of Doo-wop, even though we didn't call it that, but it was our background.  We started singing those type of background before anybody.  We started doing the shoobops and the shoobooms and the doo te doo and doo-wop.  I mean, this was our background and our songs.
Speaker 1: I take what you said about the fact that the music was essentially taken over or hijacked by the white performers for the live audiences, do you think also that the electrification of music kind of led to the early demise of doo-wop, I mean it went into decline before it came back?
Speaker 2: You think with the Beatles?
Speaker 1: You put rock and roll in general and things started to be electronic, do you think that affected doo-wop?
Speaker 2: No, not really 'cause we went electric right along with them.  And our music became electric as fast as they did.  You had Bill Haley, he sang 'Rock Around the Clock', you had, who else--we've got songs, you got things called 'Crazy Baby', that's nothing but electric guitar, you know.  We have songs that were electric so I don't think some of that was than it was--the disco came in and people started shining away from it then, everybody wanted to dance, everybody became hip, nobody would listen to music and love became nothing.  People stopped being in love.  It came to a point that--see we were singing love, we were singing about love and then when we left everything else to your imagination.  You don't need no imagination no more.  They tell you everything that, you know, they want to tell you.  So you ain't got nothing to think about.  All you doing is going along what they say, you know.  And if you go along with it, I mean, this is what you do.  So you have no reason to sit back and romanticize--to be romantic, because there's nothing to be romantic about.
Speaker 1: Looking back to the '60s [1960s] and the early '70s [1970s] when there was such an explosion in popular music, who do you think are, as you listen to it and as you saw it then, who are some of the acts or performers who were most deeply indebted to or most influenced by doo-wop and what they did?
Speaker 2: Like we said [The] Beatles, Mick Jagger, Elvis Presley, who else would be in that day.  I don't think there's too many names that wasn't, unless he was strictly pop.
Speaker 1: So you heard elements of doo-wop almost everywhere in popular music it sounds like?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.

Speaker 1: If you could like have one other song that you'd be remembered for other than 'Goodnight Sweetheart' which one do you think it should be?
Speaker 2: 'Peace of Mind.'
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because when I wrote it I had peace of mind.  And that was the reason for the song was to give peace of mind, and I find it quite comforting to sing.
Speaker 1: Was that the one you said you wrote like when you got ready to go back to Texas?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where and when you wrote that and was that hard to write?
Speaker 2: I wrote it working for General American making boxcars.  I was outside one night eating lunch and saw the star in the sky and the words just came to me, and the melody just came to me.  And I wrote it all in about ten, fifteen minutes.
Speaker 1: Did you always write the words and the music yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I always put the words--I don't write music, I don't play an instrument, everything come out my head, the music comes out my head.  I sing it, somebody write it down for me.
Speaker 1: And would you like work out the harmony just with your group then, you just take the melody to them and work out harmony?
Speaker 2: I work out--yeah, I take the melody to them, but they'd work out the harmonies.  We had another fellow who was very good, his name was Dimples, James Dimples Cochran [ph.], he was fantastic.  He was as good as Billy Shelton [ph.] when it came to putting harmony lines together.

Speaker 1: One last question.  This is kind of philosophical, like some of our other ones, but from your perspective now, what would you say is the best decade of your life and why?
Speaker 2: The best decade of my life.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Well, I got to say the '90s [1990s] up to now for some reason.  Number one I'm still alive, number two I've been able to, as I say, find somebody [Delores (Dee) Brown Hudson] that's really into me and somebody that I'm into.  And then I found some friends, I mean, this is strange, I found some friends down.  Not that people say you are my friends, I got people now that I might not talk to for two weeks, but if I need something I could call them and there's no questions asked they give it.  So I know this is nothing but the Lord at work with us.  It was times when I was on my own doing my own thing I could never get the help--get to people who say they love me to do the things to show that they love me.  So I think this is the best era for me.
