Story_ID: 622600
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your father.  Tell me his name and where he was born?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Lee Andrew Lester [Lee Lester].  He was born in, also in the northern part of Arkansas.  And we lived in Little Rock, Arkansas and probably before my mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and father separated, he went south, and he went to Louisiana, to California, then to Louisiana.  And we moved north.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 2: I think he was born in 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Brinkley, Arkansas.  That's where it was, Brinkley.  Okay, Brinkley, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Do you remember much about your father?
Speaker 2: Not too much because we were very, I was very small when we went, moved north.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you remember?
Speaker 2: No, he used to come in from, from work.  He was a tailor, and he also was a teacher.  And he would come, our mother would have dinner prepared.  And I remember our evening meals together that we had, and that's about the last recollection I had of him.  I remember he had a brother [Woodie Lester] who was a preacher, a minister.  And his brother's son was the famous writer, Julius Lester.  He was up at one of the colleges on the East Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know much about his education?  You said he was a teacher?
Speaker 2: He was a teacher.  I think he went to Philander Smith College [Little Rock, Arkansas], and I think he also went to the seminary here in Atlanta, Georgia.  He was there for a while and did some ministry work, built some churches in the South also.  So he was, he did a variety of things.  He used to make my clothes for me, for me when I was very small.
Story_ID: 622601
Speaker 1: And what year was it that your mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and father [Lee Lester] divorced?  Do you remember?  How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was about five years old, something like five or--five years old.
Speaker 1: And your mother remarried?
Speaker 2: My mother remarried, yes.  She married George Ransaw, and it was years later that my mother remarried, several years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk about Mr. Ransaw.  Was it--was he influential in your life?
Speaker 2: He, he carried insurance.  He was an insurance carrier.  And I used to go around with him on his route sometimes with that.  And he played a part, a role in my life--my mother played the more important role in there because she was the one who financed my education to a large extent, more so than he did.  So I think she was more influential than he was on that.  But he, there was a little, he kept a little distance.  We weren't that close.  Over the years, we got to be a little closer, but--
Speaker 1: Did he adopt you?
Speaker 2: Yes, legally adopted me, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you don't know much about his life growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I know there's a lot of Ransaws.  I didn't realize there were, 'cause I usually go to cities to try to find Ransaws in the dictionary [sic.], and I didn't see any.  But I was invited a few years ago to a family reunion of Ransaws in Alabama, and there are a lot of 'em down in Alabama.  I mean they were coming in, coming in the droves.  So we went down for that reunion.  It was very nice.
Story_ID: 622602
Speaker 1: All right.  Well let's, let's talk about your mother.  Tell me her name, when she was born and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Sylvia Hall [Sylvia Hall Ransaw].  She's from the Hall family.  And she was born in Ozan, Arkansas in 1918.
Speaker 1: Did she share many stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, she shared lots of stories about her growing up.  She would--because she had a large family, lots of sisters and lots of brothers.  And one of her stories was that Papa Hall, who was her father, was a, he was a preacher.  And sometimes before he'd leave to go to work--he was very dapper.  He was a well dressed man.  Before he would go out, sometimes he put the switch to 'em because he knew they were gonna do bad (laughter), when he came back.  So he would--they would see him coming down the street, and they would all scurry and run, but, when he started coming home.  But he was, he was a very clean and dapper man, Papa Hall.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what his first name was?
Speaker 2: George.
Speaker 1: George?
Speaker 2: George Allan Hall [George Hall], yes.
Speaker 1: And what type of work did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a minister, yeah, he was a minister.
Speaker 1: And did they live in rural Arkansas or in the city?
Speaker 2: They lived in, well, Ozan was actually a rural part of Arkansas.  It, very small.  The big house on one side of the tracks, and you crossed the tracks, and the rail- and the house sits right on the tracks almost.  When the train comes by, you can--you know it's coming.  And going down across the tracks, you can see, on one side, you see one store, a Baptist church and a Methodist church on the opposite side of the street.  Down at the end of the street, you'd see the little schoolhouse down there at the end of the street.  And, and that was about it, a few houses around, and that was Ozan, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your mother's education.
Speaker 2: My mother, she went to Philander Smith College [Little Rock, Arkansas], and she only went for a year.  And she didn't have money, a lot of money, so she took her class ring, high school class ring and sold that.  That gave her her first year of education there.  So when we went, moved north, she finished school, a beautician, beauty school, beautician school.
Speaker 1: Any other stories that she shared about her growing up, the things that she had to do outside of school?
Speaker 2: Outside of school.  Basically, no, they didn't, she didn't share too many stories.  Everything was basically pertaining to a school and to things that we did when we moved that she shared with us.
Story_ID: 622603
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and Mr. Ransaw [Ransaw's adoptive father, George Ransaw] met?
Speaker 2: We were in Gary, Indiana when she met him.  And I don't know exactly where they met.  I think someone introduced my mother and father to him--my mother to my stepfather.  And they had a fairly long relationship before they decided to get married.  And what she did, she, they got married in Gary and went to Indianapolis.  That's where I grew up and sent for me about a year later.  They wanted to get settled there.  I was staying with her sister [Arbella Hall Bailey], my mother's sister, and until she got settled.  And then they brought me down to Indianapolis, Indiana.  And I remember when I first got on the bus going to see mama just for, to stay and to live with mother, they met me at the bus station and took me to the movie theater.  And we went to see a--the first thing, before we got in the car, went back home and went to the show.  So I remember doing that.  And my first exciting event when I w- met up with mother.
Story_ID: 622604
Speaker 1: Before we go on to your life in Indianapolis [Indiana], talk to me about your [maternal] grandmother.  We talked about Papa Hall [George Hall].  What was his wife's name?
Speaker 2: Mary Catherine Hall [Mary Gamble Hall].  Her name was Mary Catherine Hall.  She was, worked in the post office in Ozan, Arkansas.  And Papa Hall met her there.  She was a postal worker there, and she, he, that's where he first met her in the post office there.  She was a very strong willed woman, you know.  She had, I think, six girls and six boys, and so a large, large family.  And so she kind of ruled the roost.  She kind of, they were very--I just enjoyed being around her when I was around her.  She would come visit us up north, two or three times over a three year, four year period.  And she would make that voyage up.
Story_ID: 622605
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that household while you were living there in Arkansas?  If you could think of a sound, sight or smell, what would take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: Probably the sound of the train coming down 'cause we would go out, when we'd hear that train coming, and if someone in the family was getting off, that train would stop, I mean it would stop.  We'd run down the railroad tracks to meet the train.  And that was the sound that I always associate with.  We'd be sitting out on the front porch in a swing, and we could remember that train coming down the tracks and doing that.
Speaker 1: What about a sight or a smell?
Speaker 2: There was a creek or a lake about, looked like about four, five hundred yards from the house, through some woods.  And I remember me and my cousins, we would always go, when we'd try to hide from someone else, we'd go over to the lake, sit down on the lake and watch the ducks, frogs, try to catch a turtle and do things of this nature and play out in that area.  And we could hear mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] calling or Mama Hall [Mary Gamble Hall] calling for us to come to eat.  And so we'd rush back on over there and do that.
Speaker 1: And what smell takes you home?
Speaker 2: Probably the smell of--she was good with biscuits, and the smell of those biscuits, and breakfast biscuits and syrup, what do they call it?  Smorgans [sorghum], it's starts with an S.  I'm not sure what that smell was, but the butter biscuits and breakfast, bacon and all of those things take me back there.
Story_ID: 622606
Speaker 1: Tell me who lived in your household?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: When you're in Arkansas still?
Speaker 2: In Arkansas.  Oh, mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] had her, a couple of her daughters there.  She had, and then her, the daughters' kids, they were there, because Mama Hall [Mary Gamble Hall] had the big house, but there was several other houses right around where the children that were there stayed, but everybody would congregate at Mama Hall's house.  And so my cousins, Freddie [ph.] and Fezell [ph.] and Bert [ph.] and all of those would be in the other houses, but they would all be in the house.  You never knew who was really living in there because they were all over the place, you know, the little family, a little village we had set up there, that they had set.
Speaker 1: So tell me who your siblings are?
Speaker 2: I have none.  I'm just a, an only child.
Speaker 1: You're an only child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what age are you when you go to--tell me the name of the aunt that you lived with.  How long did you live with her before your mother sent for you to go to Indianapolis [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Probably about four--about five or six months.  I was there a little while.  But it's an interesting story how I got there.  My mother's--there was a migration that took place, the second migration after World War II [WWII].  And the first one was around 1900 where over a million people moved north.  But the second one was, took place in the '40s [1940s] during the war and after the war.  And my mother, one of--a couple of her brothers and her sister, Clarabella [ph.] moved north.  They went to Chicago [Illinois] and Gary [Indiana], in those areas there, looking for better jobs, better lifestyle.  And so once they found their jobs, they asked mother to come and to come up there to find a job up there and further her education in the North.  And she decided she would go.  And so we got on this train.  I remember, they'd give you a long ticket, and the longer the ticket, the further you'd go on the train.  And each stop they come, the porter would come down and punch the train, and each state we'd go through 'til we got up to Gary.  So we stayed with my mother and Aunt Clarabella, Aunt Arbella [Arbella Hall Bailey], and her husband, Uncle Leroy [Leroy Bailey], and stayed there for several years and moved.  And I think I attended my first school there in Gary, Indiana.  It was an elementary school that I attended in Gary, and--before mother sent for me, moved to--got married and moved to Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you say, we lived there.  When you're saying, we, who was we?
Speaker 2: We was my mother, Aunt Arbella and Uncle Leroy.  They were the three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, three of us, and their daughter, Virginia [Virginia Bailey (ph.)].  Virginia is my cousin, her--their daughter, first daughter.
Story_ID: 622607
Speaker 1: So you attend school there.  Tell me about your first day at elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the first day at elementary school, but I do remember the school that we went to was a elementary school near Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana].  And mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] used to--because she had to go out and go to work and to go to beauty school, I was left to try to come back by myself.  And so what she would do, she would take my glove, my sleeve and my glove and she would pin my, the house keys into the glove 'cause I'd always lose stuff.  So she made sure I didn't lose it.  And I'd have it, every day I'd put that jacket on after it's hung up and bring it in and pull the key and come in and wait for her.  You could do that in those days.  You can't do that now, but it was about, about a six block walk to school that we had, where we attended.  And I remember some of the little games we played in the first days of school.  I was trying to remember one of the songs 'cause I was thinking about it the other day, several of the little tunes that we used to sing.  And when we'd go around the bush and things like this.  But I remember some of the earlier days of that school.  It was very enjoyable.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the teachers?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the teachers from that school.
Speaker 1: What about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember I had a best friend though.  I do remember him.  We used to, we played together, and when I moved to Indianapolis [Indiana], I always remembered him and wondered what would happen to him.  So he, I kept through--since Virginia [Ransaw's cousin, Virginia Bailey (ph.)] stayed there in Gary [Indiana], I kept up with him.  And he was, ended up to be a star, a football player on the football team.  They called him Eighty-eight, you know, Robert Anderson [ph.].
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Robert Anderson, so I do remember him 'cause he was my best friend.  And I remember one incident which is not, I don't know how pleasant it is, but when I was coming home one day, some boys, they kind of surrounded me, and a little bit more than my age.  And about my age, and they surrounded me.  And they shoved me around a little bit. Bullying, I guess they call it today, bullying.  And I remember telling Bobby about that, Bobby Anderson about it.  He was in my class.  And we decided to get some revenge.  And so we waited on one of them (laughter) a few days later to come up, and we started, we picked on him and bullied him.  But they didn't bother me no more after that.  They see that I had someone to--but I think that was one of the reasons why mother decided she was gonna leave Gary was because there was some dangers in the, in the kids and the community and things like that.  She wanted to get me out of that environment.  And that's one of the reasons we left.
Speaker 1: So can you remember the name of the school, the elementary school?
Speaker 2: East Pulaski, I think it was East Pulaski elementary school [East Pulaski School, Gary, Indiana], East Pulaski.  And the reason why I remember it because later on when I--well, I don't know if you want me to mention that now, but later on when I went back after serving in the [U.S.] military, I did some substitute teaching, and I ended up teaching at the same school that I attended first.
Speaker 1: So what year--how long did you live in Gary?
Speaker 2: I'd say I lived in Gary at least four years or five years.
Story_ID: 622608
Speaker 1: Tell me, do y- did you have extracurricular activities outside of school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  When in Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think I was pretty good in art.  And, and I guess one day or one day I was out at church, we had gone to church.  And we were outside, and they had some chalk or crayon or something, chalk, colored chalks.  And I drew a picture on the sidewalk, on the sidewalk, did a big picture on the sidewalk.  And someone came by and took a picture of it, and it appeared in the paper there, in the newspaper.  I remember I always was trying to find out when that happened.  But mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] told me that that's what happened.  "You know, you were pretty good, and they recognized that and took a picture of you there."  So that was, I guess--and then my uncle, I had an Uncle Xynipher [Xynipher Hall], one of mother's brothers.  He lived in Gary too.  He was a barber.  And he was very good in art, and he would come over, and we'd lie on the floor.  And I'd watch him draw flowers and things like that.  And so I think that was one of my interests then outside.
Speaker 1: So you always just had a natural talent in drawing?
Speaker 2: I believe so.  I believe, I believe I had an interest in drawing at an early stage, yeah.  And it was probably due to my uncle, who was very good at that.  I was amazed at what he could do, you know.
Story_ID: 622609
Speaker 1: And you talked about church.  Tell me what church did you attend?  What religion?
Speaker 2: It was Methodist, Methodist church.  I can't recall.  Was it Tainey Methodist Church [ph.]?  I remember the location of it, but I don't remember the exact name of it.  I remember going there with my cousins because we had a lot of family in Gary [Indiana], had moved from Arkansas up, on both sides, on my mother's side of the family.  The Gambles as well as the Halls.  And we all attended this church.  And mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] sang in the choir, and sometimes they would bring me--I would be on the front row.  But I'd lay down and go to sleep on there, and (laughter) they had to wake me up.  I'd always fall asleep in, in church.  But I remember attending that church.
Story_ID: 622610
Speaker 1: Explain to me or describe for me the neighborhood in which you lived in Gary [Indiana]?  Who lived on the block?  Tell me about the stores and the shop owners?
Speaker 2: We lived in the upstairs.  It was a two story building, and we lived upstairs and in the back--there was an apartment at the front, and there was an apartment in the back.  And in the back apartment, we had some more cousins.  I had another cousin, Charles Gamble [ph.], the Gambles were in the back, and his brother and mother and father were in the back.  And we were in the front of the apartment.  And downstairs, there was a little--and behind that apartment, it was interesting because behind the apartment there was a alleyway, and in that alley, there was a shop where you could, store or a place where you can take newspapers, old newspapers and recycle them.  You can take bottles and recycle that.  And I remember we used to go around the neighborhood and getting things and going around the block to recycle those things.  But one block away was a playground and the church.  So it was one block away from that.  I remember going to the church several times and you'd go up to the window of the basement of the church, you could look in the basement, and then my uncle who was the barber, Uncle Xynipher [Ransaw's maternal uncle, Xynipher Hall], they had a, sort of like a little gospel quartet.  And they would be down there practicing and singing.  We'd lay on the window ledge and listen to them singing and harmonizing down there on that.  And then you had your playground there.  And a block away was a main street, which was a little theater, a movie theater.  I think it cost about thirteen cents to go to the movies at that time.  And mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw], sometimes mother would take me down to the, over to the theater.  And she'd go, and I'd sit on the--she'd put me on the front, first, second row.  And she'd go shopping or do whatever she needed to do.  And then she'd come back and get me when the show is over.  She'd come back in, and I'd be there, sitting there waiting on her to come.  So the neighborhood, it was very, was very close and tight.  Those are the things I remember.  Across the street from the church, I mean from our house was a, sort of like a Sanctified church.  And I remember we'd go over there across the street on Wednesday nights or Thursday nights and you can hear the tambourines, while they'd be up there singing with the tambourines in there.  So we'd stand out and listen to them.  So there's a lot of activities going on in that particular neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So your neighborhood was totally black?
Speaker 2: Totally black, yeah, totally black.
Speaker 1: And the movie theater, did you have a, did you have to sit in a certain section or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was, didn't have to sit--you could sit any place you wanted in that movie theater.
Speaker 1: At this young age up until you moved to Indianapolis [Indiana], in Gary, had you ever experienced any racism?
Speaker 2: Until I moved to Indianapolis?  No, I hadn't personally.  I wouldn't have known it, recognized it probably, but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Did you have any dealing with any white people at that time?
Speaker 2: No, except in the stores, (unclear) store, grocery store.  And also at the recycling place, I think there were whites running that.
Speaker 1: So were there black owners of businesses?
Speaker 2: Yes, my--one of the Gambles, one of my mother's brothers had a, Lawrence Gamble [ph.], he had a store about eight blocks away on Main Street, yeah, a grocery store.  And we would go there--we always considered him the rich one in the family, you know (laughter) 'cause he lived a little bit uptown, a little bit, a little further up on 25th Street, and we were down on about 15th Street, something like that.  And we'd go to his place sometimes for dinner, you know, so.
Story_ID: 622611
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's, let's move on to your move to Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, by this time your mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] remarries?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother remarried, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me about the move?
Speaker 2: The move.
Speaker 1: To Indianapolis.
Speaker 2: Well, I had my suitcase, and on the bus, one or two bags, and that was it.  They were, they took me shopping the next day, went and bought clothes and got me squared away, moved in with my stepfather [Ransaw's adoptive father, George Ransaw], my aunt and her husband, a very nice neighborhood, very nice neighborhood on the north side.  And it's interesting because that neighborhood was, there was a lot--the city was segregated to a large extent.  From blacks mostly lived in an area called Lockefield Gardens [Indianapolis, Indiana] during that time.  And even the doctors, but it was a well manicured, well kept housing project called Lockefield Gardens.  And most of the people that I know later moved out and moved into better places, but they could only go up to 30th Street.  There was an area that once they moved out there, there was redlining and districting.  They could only move up to 30th Street in Indianapolis.  From 30th Street to 38th Street was a cemetery, a large cemetery called Crown Hill Cemetery [Indianapolis, Indiana].  And that was separating the white, blacks, from blacks.  Then they opened up an area from 38th Street to 42nd Street and about six blocks wide that they allowed some blacks to move into, okay.  And so that's where we ended up.
Story_ID: 622612
Speaker 1: Okay.  So continue the story about where you lived in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Okay, from 38th Street to 42nd Street, what they called middle class blacks could afford those, those houses in that area.  So we moved in with an aunt and her husband in that area called the Buchanans, Gertrude Buchanan [ph.] was living there.  And in order to go to school, we had to go back then to 24th Street where the black public school 87 [George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana] was.  So they brought four buses in to bus us back.  They would come down each street, pick us up and take us back down to school number 87, the public school that I attended, grade school that I attended.  Now, there was a school that was there on 40th Street, which was about four blocks from where I lived.  They wouldn't allow us to, to go to.  So I guess the first Civil Rights Movement during that particular time--this was early '50s [1950s] or the late '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s], mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and others went over and had a sit-in.  They protested that blacks weren't able to attend this school there and we couldn't go there.  But in spite of that, we ended up having to be bused back to public school 87 on 24th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what grades did you attend there?
Speaker 2: Attended all the way from the, probably the fourth through the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about the school?  Any teachers and any friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember most of my teachers.  This is when I started remembering teachers' names because Ms. Walker [ph.] or one of the teachers lived a couple of doors down from me.  But Ms. Walker was the art teacher, and she used to say what a nice job I was doing, and she thought my art was coming along good.  I remember her name.  She was my first art teacher.  Ms. Allen [ph.], she lived a couple of doors down from me on Cornelius [Avenue], but I remember her because she taught social studies.  And she would have us to line up in the hall going to lunch.  We'd have to all line up in the hall.  And I remember one day that I was in line and I was talking.  And she came and she popped me in my chest (laughter), and I never talked again in line.  She really, she set me straight on that.  It was very orderly.  The school was very nice.  There were, there were distinct classes, Group A, Group B, based upon how well they thought you could do.  I didn't know what all that stuff meant, but how you can achieve.  But each one, there were different sections.  I remember the physical ed [physical education] teachers and all of the teachers, I remember.  I really enjoyed that particular school.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a little above average student, you know.  I wasn't anything exceptional.  There were some really bright people at that school at that time, you know, that were doing well, exceptionally well at that particular time.  One student individual, he, he would come in, we'd have auditorium.  And he could sing, he could dance.  He'd go play anything on the piano.  I mean he would really, he was really an entertainer, and he ended up doing real well in life.  You know, so, but a lot of people--I was looking at my high school class [from Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], those that are, many of them still around doing very well.  You know, they made a really nice--
Speaker 1: What was that student's name that you said he did very well?
Speaker 2: What was his name?  It'll come to me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in a second.

Speaker 1: So besides art, what other activities are you involved in [at George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Today or then?
Speaker 1: Then.
Speaker 2: Okay, probably sports, yeah I loved sports.  I played basketball and baseball was my, was my, really my calling there.  And we had a little team that I was on, got my first pair of cleats and uniform.  And so I was very excited about baseball.  I had a bat.  Jackie Robinson was just coming into everybody's attention, and we would go into shop class for the World Series, and instead of working in shop, the shop teacher would have the radio on.  And we'd all pile around the radio and listen to the baseball game, you know.  When Joe Louis fought, we'd all pile around the radio and listen to him to see how he's gonna come out in his boxing matches.  Sugar Ray Robinson fought, we did the same thing, pile around the radio to listen to those matches.  So we were very much into certain athletes that were setting standards for us in sports.  So those were basically the ones.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject?  Not art.  Besides art (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Besides art, I liked, actually, I was pretty good at that time in mathematics and in probably history.  I liked, I liked the history classes and learned about things.  I was very naive.  I didn't know anything, you know.  Wow, this takes, took place.  And so those were my other subjects, most favorite.
Story_ID: 622614
Speaker 1: So when it was time for you to go to high school, what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Shortridge High School [Indianapolis, Indiana].  Now, Shortridge, it's interesting about Shortridge because Shortridge was one of the seven or eight top prep schools for college.  They patterned their whole curriculum and their colors and their ideals on Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].  The colors were blue and white.  The mascot was a Blue Devil, the same as Duke's, same colors as Duke University.  They had high standards, so they only let a few blacks come in there at a time.  I was--since we moved up 38th [Street] and 42nd Street, we were, I was among the third group that they let in.  And when I say group, I'm talking only about twenty-five or thirty students would come in at a time in a class period.  And everything at Shortridge was, was first class.  They had their own radio station, a daily radio station.  They had a daily newspaper called the Daily Echo.  They had, they had junior vaudeville which we weren't allowed to participate in.  There were some quotas on sports teams, so unless you were exceptional- exceptionally tall, you probably wasn't on the basketball team or the--and they allowed one on the baseball team, one black on the baseball team.  But in spite of all of that, you got a good education.  You got a really good education.  Most of their students that finished there went to Ivy League schools in the East.  You know, they got very good scholarships and things of this nature.  So basically, it was, it was a very good education.
Speaker 1: Now, the teachers in your elementary school [George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana], were they all black?
Speaker 2: All black, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now when you come to Shortridge, the teachers are black and white or all white?
Speaker 2: All white except maybe the foo- assistant football coach.  There was an assistant, I think they were all, the rest of them were--there were about two blacks in the whole col- in school, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you good enough to be on any of the sports teams?
Speaker 2: I was good enough to be on all of the sports teams (laughter).  But I wasn't.  I, mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] made me concentrate on those studies.  She said, "Well, look, we're gonna get you in there," and I went out for--what did I try out for?  Basketball team, made last cut.  They always put you on the last cut, made last cut.  And so I played baseball, but it was in, in a community, you know, baseball.
Story_ID: 622615
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell me then about extracurricular activities outside of school?  You played on, was it a rec team?
Speaker 2: Right, it was, it was a city team really.
Speaker 1: City?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a city team called the Tarkington Yankees.  We had, we'd go down to the baseball stadium, and we'd play in the big stadium.  We had a neighborhood home stadium we played in, but we'd play from all over the city.  We played even the high school teams, like that.  So it was a very good team we played in.
Speaker 1: Did you belong to any other organizations like the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?
Speaker 2: Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: Cub Scouts, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I joined the Cub Scouts, yeah.  And that was a nice experience too because I got to stay out all night, you know, in a tent.  You know, got to do that.  We went on field trips where we, and I thought it was interesting.  We'd take some food, pork chops or things like that and wrap 'em in aluminum foil, bury 'em under the ground, put coals on top of that, put hot coals on it, cover that up, go out and do our expedition, come back.  When we'd come back, open it up, and food's ready, you know.  That was a pretty exciting experience being in the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who your scout leaders were?
Speaker 2: I remember Ms. Dunlop [Pearl Dunlop].  She was my scout lady there.  She's female.  She's the one that did most of our in house things.  I don't remember the gentleman that took us out, but she was one.
Story_ID: 622616
Speaker 1: And what about church? At this time that you're in high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I went to University Methodist Church [University United Methodist Church, Indianapolis, Indiana].  My mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and stepfather [Ransaw's adoptive father, George Ransaw] were members there.  Both of them were in the choir, you know.  So, and so I attended that church.  We moved from 11th Street up to 30th Street, during high school.  And lots of my friends were in church there also.  So it, I enjoyed that.  That was--I remember going by one of--had one friend named John Adams [ph.].  He lived about two blocks from the church.  And I lived about fifteen or twenty blocks from the church.  So I would come--he didn't attend church often, very little.  So before I'd go to church, I'd go over to his house and knock on his door to try to get him up to come and go with me.  And sometimes he would, he would come over to church with me.
Story_ID: 622617
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your new neighborhood where you're living, you said you moved to 30th Street?
Speaker 2: I moved to forty- 38th Street, I lived 40th Street, yeah, 40th and Cornelius [Avenue].  It was a very nice neighborhood.  We had nice homes there, one of--I'm talking, not really--not the best homes, but really, they were, there were nice homes there.  And friends on each street, I mean we all knew each other.  That was the important thing.  It was sort of like a family.  Everybody knew the kids.  I could go any place and they would take care of me if necessary.  If mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] had to leave town and stuff or go down and visit her mother [Mary Gamble Hall], I could go next door and stay there for two or three days until she comes back if I didn't wanna take the trip.  There were a lot of potential scholars in that neighborhood, people that are doing real well today.  In my art class, for example, we had about five, four blacks in the class.  Two of them went into architecture, and one of 'em built that, ended up being the architect for the Freedom museum [National Underground Railroad Freedom Center] over in Cincinnati, Ohio.  He built that one, you know.  Another one, Elroy, built the, a community downtown, the housing projects down there.  So we had very talented people in that neighborhood that went to the high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] that I attended.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: One was Walter Blackburn [Walter Scott Blackburn], was one and the other one was Clyde Elroy Woods.  He was the other architect.  Both of 'em passed recently.  One passed about four years ago, and the other one about two years ago.
Speaker 1: In this tight knight community, do you know whether--were most of the homes two family--I'm sorry, two parent households?
Speaker 2: Right, most of 'em were two parent households.  Families were basically intact, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what type of occupations, do you know, that the parents had at that time?
Speaker 2: I remember one had a funeral home.  Another one that had ran the Flanner House [Indianapolis, Indiana] which was sort of like a community center of bringing people in and, that didn't have homes and taking care of them.  Others were in insurance, teachers, preachers.  Those were the kinds of occupations that were pretty relevant--pretty much--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Okay.
Speaker 2: --going down there.
Story_ID: 622618
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher who was influential or encouraging to you--
Speaker 2: In high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the art teacher was.  She was very--
Speaker 1: Okay, and her name again?
Speaker 2: Ms. Mesick [ph.].  She was the art teacher at the time.  But I think the one that really influenced me the most, the one I really got the most from was the English teacher.  I don't remember her name, but what she did, one day she said, "I want the whole class to try to learn the Preamble to the [U.S.] Constitution.  And that's your assignment."  And so I went home and studied it and studied it and studied and studied.  And I thought I came up with it.  So I came back to school.  And she asked, "Anyone, can you do the Preamble to the Constitution?"  And nobody raised their hands.  And so I meekly put up (laughter) my hand, and she asked me to say it, you know.  And I got up and said it.  And I was amazed that I remembered it.  And I think that was one of the turning points for me, was that, to know that I could compete with everybody in that classroom at a pretty high level because there were some pretty smart people in that classroom.  They hadn't done that.  And I think we had to learn part of the Constitution and I went home and learned that one.  You know, and that kind of kicked me up.  That was my kickoff point for learning at that point.  And that was in my junior year, I think that was sophomore, junior year before I really turned the corner on, I think I can handle the education, you know, at that point.
Speaker 1: Well, what were--what was your relationship like with the white students because you've come out of a school that was all black [George Washington Carver School 87, Indianapolis, Indiana] to now having to deal with white students?  How did you make that transition?  How did that work for you?
Speaker 2: That was, that was interesting because it was difficult because I hadn't, didn't know how to relate to 'em before and they didn't know how to relate to us.  You know, we were the first groups to come in there.  I got very close with the guy--my name is Ransaw [HistoryMaker Lee Ransaw], and I got very close to the student sitting next to me.  His name was Rader, R-A-D-E-R, Howard Rader [ph.].  And we became very close friends, he and I.  He ended up as CEO some place out in St. Louis [Missouri].  He's out there.  We went to a reunion.  But I met him, but he was the closest one that I, besides on the athletic field that I was close to.  There was always a sense of a challenge there, a competitiveness, a sense of competitiveness between the whites and the black students.  We needed to try to let them know that we can do what they can do, you know, what they're doing.  And we can do it as well or better.  And so we always had this sense.  But we, generally, you go to the cafeteria, blacks would be sitting with blacks, whites sitting with whites.  We'd have our own tables and things.  So that separate, separation was still there.  It was all, and all way through high school it stayed there.  Black girls couldn't become cheerleaders.  They weren't able to be on the cheerleading team.  They couldn't perform in the, on the vaudeville stage either, but they could join groups like the Spanish club or some group, some club.  They could, International Club, and so they joined those kinds of things trying to get that, get in and get that competitive edge.  And the same thing with the boys.  They did that.  We had one that was exceptionally good.  His name was Wallace Terry.  He was a student.  He joined the, well, he ended up being an officer in his class, in our class, but he also was, joined the Daily Echo as a writer.  And he was able to get in a lot of things.  He ended up going to one of the Ivy League schools, becoming--he wrote 'Bloods' ['Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans,' Wallace Terry], the book 'Bloods.'  And he also was a war correspondent and did things from that.  And they did a film on him.  I think I have one of his books around some place.  But he ended up doing real well.  But very few got, got to get through to that level, you know.  But as I said, you got a good education there.
Story_ID: 622619
Speaker 1: Before we go on to how you prepare to go to college, what's going on in your neighborhood as far as any civil rights starting to heat up, because you graduate in 1960, so we're coming up to the civil rights era.  Is there anything going on in your area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was several groups there with some civil rights.  I, I wasn't involved in the civil rights struggle, so I--at that point.  I didn't know, but I know that there were groups meeting.  There was a lots of things going on that I wasn't aware of and I wasn't, at that point, really interested in unless it involved me directly.  And, but there were, there were several protest meetings down by the school because they were thinking about changing Shortridge [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] from a prep school to another kind of school, you know.  So there were some things going on in the neighborhood that I wasn't up to date on at that point.  My mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] was.  She was up to date on all of it, you know, and I just let her take that up.  I mean I didn't get involved 'til much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In your activities in the city, like the movie theater, had anything changed from what was going on--in Gary [Indiana], you were able to go freely to any movie theater or restaurant.  But in Indianapolis [Indiana], was there a difference (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One, one incident did happen in Indianapolis at a movie theater.  Me and a couple friends went to see Gene Autry, the cowboy.  He was there, and there was giveaway prizes and things like this at this theater.  And we went in and sat down, and they called the name of the, the numbers out for a bicycle.  And they called those names out, and I looked at my ticket and there was my number, come up.  And I said, "Look, this is that number."  They called the name again, "That's the number."  I showed them. "Go get your bicycle, man, go get your bicycle."  I went down and rushed up on stage, and, and to claim my prize and they looked at my ticket.  And they said, "No, you didn't win.  Go sit down."  So that, that always stuck with me.  I went back and sat down and they gave it to somebody else.  So I never will forget that.  I never did follow Gene Autry after that.
Speaker 1: And that somebody else was white?
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely, and we didn't win any prizes that day, but that was it.
Story_ID: 622620
Speaker 1: What were you and your friends doing for fun?  What music were you listening to in your high school years and what other activities did you all participate in?
Speaker 2: There was a radio station out of Gallatin, Tennessee [WLAC Radio, Nashville, Tennessee], I think it was, that you could, you'd get a lot of snow and stuff in that radio.  And late at night you'd turn that on and you can hear all the black--Johnny Ace and some of those black singers singing.  And, and there were 45s [45 rpm records], that was when they came out with the 45 records.  We'd go and buy those records, and those records, when I put something, Mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] would say, "You, why you playing that?  The Midnighters, why you playing those," (laughter)?  Now, that stuff was mild compared with what they're doing now.  But we were listening to all of that music, but we very seldom heard--Fats Domino, we'd hear him on the radio.  We very seldom heard black musicians on the regular radio station or see 'em on television.  We wouldn't see 'em on television too much at that time.  Another incident that, what was very--what happened was that my mother, while we were on that street back in the early '50s [1950s], her and my stepfather [Ransaw's adoptive father, George Ransaw], they bought a television, and one of the first televisions on the block.  So everybody came over to my house to see the television.  Well, we bought, Mother had bought this screen, this filter that was blue at the top, yellow at the bottom and green at the bottom for grass.  And we'd put that on, and everybody thought we had color television.  All the little kids came over to play, I'd say, "Man, that's color television" (laughter).  They'd think that was color television.  But we would very seldom see a black performer on television, but when they did, everybody would come out of the room to see Nat King Cole or somebody perform during that particular time.  So it was very interesting at that time, the music was 45s.  I had a little collection of music.  We'd try to get those things. And as a result, we'd do a lot of bathroom harmonizing, me and the guys.  We'd have each, everybody would set up their own little quartet group and go perform, go play and sing in a--'cause you get a nice sound in the bathroom.  You know, we'd go in there and harmonize over at Shortridge [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  You can go in the bathroom and hear groups over there singing, you know, things like that.  So that was one of those songs.  One of the other competitive, Crispus Attucks High School [Indianapolis, Indiana], which was not far, was on the other side of town, an all-black school, I think they had a group that was, that really made it and went out and got a couple of hits going.  And so, but other than that, we just did community kind of things.
Story_ID: 622621
Speaker 1: Who helped you prepare for college?  Did you know that you were definitely gonna go to college?
Speaker 2: I knew a long time ago that I was gonna go to college, yes, I did.  I knew.  And I think my role model for that, it was interesting.  I had, was out playing basketball one day with the guys on the, in the community center.  And one of the guys who was playing, he was very good.  And I was guarding him, and we started talking, and I said, "What do you do?"  And he said, "I teach at a college."  And he named the college out in California that he taught at.  And I said, man, this guy plays basketball and doing real well, and he's teaching at a college, a young guy like this.  You know, I think I might wanna do that, you know.  And that was one of the things that got in my head early in life that I wanted to do.  And the other thing, I was watching a television program.  And I can't think of the actor's name, but he was, the scene of his, his series was that he was a college professor.  And he used to wear a sweater all the time.  And he was very mild mannered, and he spoke in a very mild mannered. And I said, "Man, that's an idea. I'd sure like to do what he's doing," you know.  Well, those two things kind of stuck in my head, you know, for a long time.  And I said, "Well, you know, I think I'd like to go to college," you know.  And I always worked towards that at that point, you know.  And then the things that I learned at Shortridge [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] kind of more or less cemented that desire to go and, go to college.
Speaker 1: How did you decide what college you would go to or apply to?
Speaker 2: Well, the most popular college in Indiana was Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  Everybody, 'cause everybody started talking it up, kids from other areas, friends, and they wanted to go to IU.  And so I was in art, and I wanted to go to IU too, but my mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] said, "No, you're not going down there your first year.  We're gonna send you here to the extension, and you can take your art courses or take some courses over to John Herron [John Herron Art Institute; Herron School of Art and Design] or someplace like that."  Well, John Herron was a very fine art school.  It was located there too, in Indianapolis [Indiana]. Hale Woodruff and some of the other well known artists had gone to, had been a John Herron.  So that's what I did.  The first year I decided--and I worked.  I went out to the, the state fair, got my first job at Allis Chalmers [Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company], shining tractors.  And I'd jump over the fence, go over there, go to work every day, and that gave me my first paycheck, all went toward college.  Everything I started doing was directed toward college.  So Mother could see that I was putting in and wanted to go that badly, she was gonna send me, but she wasn't gonna send me down on campus the first year.  And it's a good thing she didn't because once I started going down there, I went down there, a lot of my friends who had gone down there partying and playing was coming back.  They had flunked out.  So when I went down, you know, I was pretty much prepared.
Speaker 1: And so what courses did you take at John Herron?
Speaker 2: I took still life painting, how to paint an apple so that if you put a fly on it, or paint a fly on it, it looks like it's real and all that stuff or one would be attracted to it.  Those were the kind of courses I took, very varied (laughter). Then we'd go out sometimes and paint old sheds or old houses, draw 'em, and that was, that was very nice.
Story_ID: 622622
Speaker 1: Before we go forward into our college years, we missed talking about your great-grandparents, on your mother's [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] side.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's take the opportunity to do that now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're ready?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, we've done some research on our family tree, on lineage, and it goes back to 1834 on a plantation in Chickasaw, Mississippi [Chickasaw County, Mississippi].  And this plantation was owned by a man named Warsley [ph.].  He was Scottish, and he married an Irish wife, and they had this plantation.  And on this plantation, one of his foremen or field hands or forehands was named Raven [ph.].  And Raven took a liking to one of the slaves on this plantation.  Her name was Sylvia Buckingham [ph.].  Evidently, she was a very attractive woman.  So they cohabited and had about nine, he had, she had nine kids, some of them by him and some later by her husband, named Taylor [ph.].  But of those nine children that Sylvia Buckingham had, four of them we know something about who they were and where they were from.  One was named David, David Allan Hall [ph.] and the other one was named George Hall.  And when they were young, when George and David were young, they attended this school, a little school.  And the teacher asked him, "What's your name, what's your last name?"  And they said they didn't know.  This is how they got the name Hall.  The teacher gave them their name of Hall.  And they were fair complexioned kids.  And so they were allowed to leave the area in which they were and go to the store and do things, bring back, bring back. They were free, and they could go back to the store.  One day they went to a grocery store, it was sort of like a store and bought some things and brought back to the farm where everybody lived.  And while they were gone, they came back, the store owner discovered that there were several things missing from the store.  So he assumed that George and David stole them.  So word got out that they were gonna be, a lynching going on, and they were gonna come and get these two kids.  And while they were, they were young boys, teenagers, while they were out in the field, they saw coming over the hill a group of men and horses, and it looked like they were coming for 'em.  So they ran into the barn, jumped through the back window, ran out, went into the woods.  And they got deep into the woods.  They decided the best way to survive was to separate.  So David went one way and George went the other way.  And George went, came upon some railroad tracks and he decided to wait for a train to come in, come by.  And later on that night the train came by and he jumped aboard that train, hitched a ride, didn't know where it was going, ended up in Arkansas.  And so that's how he got to Arkansas and later married Mary Catherine [Mary Gamble Hall].  He went into the ministry, and there's a [U.S.] Census Bureau that came out with who the four surviving kids were, the 1900 Census Bureau.  That's where we got that information from.  And he later married Mary Catherine who was working in the post office there, and he became a minister and had about eight or nine different areas that he would go and minister around in.  So one day he had heard that there was this good old preacher down in the southern part of Arkansas that was preaching and is really tearing up the circuit with his gospel down there.  So he decided one day he's gonna go down and hear this preacher.  And he went down there and found out it was his brother, David, had also made his way to Arkansas and became a minister.  And they got together there.  So that's how basically part of our history came out.  Now, prior to that we had gone back as far as DNA to Africa to the upper Ghana area.  And this is where the family had come through, Elmira [sic. Elmina, Ghana], the Middle Passage.  The Door of No Return was up in Elmira and figured that they had come through that passage and came over to America.  We know the exact date 'cause so many people came over.  There's very little record, but we had checked with Bill Gates [sic. HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates] that they had done research on it and found that they were from either Liberia, Sierra Leone or several other, Ghana of those tribes or ethnic groups over there.  There're about twelve ethnic groups in that area, speaking Fulana [sic.] and different languages there.  And so this is basically where it started, but from that point on to the time of 1800 and around '64 [1864], that is where the family was.  We don't know how they got in.  Generally, it took about two months on those boats to come over, but that's basically our history.
Speaker 1: Okay. I'm glad we went back to cover that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Story_ID: 622623
Speaker 1: We're gonna fast forward back to 1960, and you spend one year at John Herron [John Herron Art Institute; Herron School of Art and Design, Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Right, a year, but while I was at Herron, I was still taking courses at the I- Indiana University Extension [Indiana University Extension Center; Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana].  I was taking courses.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what courses were you taking at the extension (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was taking English, geography, literature, what else I took?  Even took an art course over there, so I had several courses over there.
Speaker 1: And so you just paid--and you were working as well, so you were helping to pay for you to go to school, okay, so after the first year, what happens next?
Speaker 2: Mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] decided, you know, we'd got enough money for me to go to Bloomington, Indiana [to Indiana University].  And we got in the car and went down, and got housing in the quad which was the, very nice housing.  And I had a roommate.  It was one of my home boys from high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  And so he was my roommate the first year, the first semester.
Speaker 1: What, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Gilbert, Gilbert Johnson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came in the first year, and, and I went and I pledged a fraternity and did a lot of those kind of things.
Speaker 1: In your first year at Bloomington?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was at Indiana, actually, I pledged that there and went over at Indiana--I mean on the campus because they combined Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], Butler University [Indianapolis, Indiana] and IU Extension, all of those schools were combined to make a chapter called Nu Chapter.  And so we combined there.  So I went down to Bloomington, I became dean of pledges, you know, I was dean of pledges down there.
Speaker 1: Which fraternity is it?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: So you became dean of pledges.
Speaker 2: Right, I became dean.  My first job as a (laughter), as a leader, you know, really in life, I guess was that job.
Speaker 1: So, now this is 1961.  What's going on on the campus?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, this was 1959.
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is '59 [1959].  I graduated from college in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first degree was in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1959.  What's going on?  Who's the, who's the president at Bloomington?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name, a very large guy [Herman B Wells].  I don't remember his name now, so far, so long ago, a very nice guy though.  But I don't remember his name.
Story_ID: 622624
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what's going on on the campus [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, there were things that did go on on campus because we had some racial incidents on, on campus.  One student went in to get a haircut, and they told him they couldn't cut his, wasn't gonna cut his hair.  And he went back the next day, they sent him back the next day, and the barber put him in his chair and went right down the middle of head and took all, took a big swat out of his hair like that.  And so there were protests.  We had a parade.  We had a whole lot of stuff going on on that, you know, on that incident there.  And the, not the dining hall, the center where everyone goes and congregates was always segregated and that's by design, that was by--because everybody wanted to be segregated, blacks sat on one side, played cards, bid whist.  Whites sat on the other side.  And there was an effort to get them together, but that didn't work out that well.  But athletics were probably--and the same thing in athletics.  A basketball coach told several of the players, "You can play, but you don't fraternize with these girls over here, you know.  You don't do that."  And so there were certain unwritten laws that were down on Bloomington's campus.  Getting to Bloomington [Indiana] itself was a chore.  You go from Indianapolis [Indiana] to Bloomington which is about, oh, fifty or sixty miles, but there was a city inside, between where it was pretty much Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] territory.  So if you got, your car broke down or you got sick and had to go to a hospital, you couldn't go in that city.  You didn't go there.  You'd have to get, they'd have to take you, bring you back to Indianapolis or take you to Bloomington.  So there were a lot of things.  We had, my mind then started opening up a little bit towards civil rights and the struggle at this point because it was affecting me directly, you know.  Before I wasn't very much interested in that.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the professors at Bloomington [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: In my field, the professors were very nice.  They, they were very helpful in some cases.  Now, Indiana is such a large institution.  There was thirty--close to thirty thousand students there.  So I remember one class in, in biology that I took.  You went in the classroom and sat in the auditorium.  There were three hundred students in there.  And the professor came out on stage, we were waiting for the professor.  He came out.  He was an elderly man, white hair.  And he had, always walked with a slight limp and a cane.  He came to the podium.  He said, "My name is Dr. Torrey.  Some people call me Terrible Ted Torrey."  The crowd goes, (makes sound).  He said, "I took this course under my father, and my father gave me a C, and I know damn well nobody in here is smarter than I am."  And (laughter) and everybody was in amazement.  I came back to class the next time, there was only seventy-five people left in that class.  I said, "Where'd everybody go?  Where is everybody?" (Laughter) They had dropped that man's course.  So I had him for lab too.  I had the man for lab as well as for--sitting in my lab class. He had all of his glass embryos in these bottles behind cases up there and our lab section was out here.  And we were sitting out across from me this little white girl.  She was sitting there.  And they had to, we had to punch our fingers to take a blood sample.  He said, "I want everybody prick your finger, we're gonna come up and prick your finger and get some blood and put it under the microscope."  And this girl said, "Well, if he pricks my finger, I'm gonna faint."  I said, "Aw if you faint, I'm gonna faint behind you, I'll be right behind you, you know."  So we went up and got in line, and he came up to her and he pricked her finger, and she walked out of the line, turned white as a sheet and fell.  And when she fell, she fell into this glass case of embryos and broke the case, broke the glass.  And Terrible Ted, Dr. Torrey jumped up, "Get her out of--." We were trying to move her, and he's trying to save his embryos.  He don't care anything (laughter) about her.  But this was this class, one of these classes, how, how you are just a number at a school like that, Indiana University and not a name.  And our other classes, and I tell my classes this all the time, that you don't get no one on one treatment.  You might take a test at the end of the semester and have a question about your grade and your teacher would be, left, gone to Europe.  And your grade is given out by a teacher's assistant or something like that.  So you never know, make that individual contact unless you're in your field.  In your field, you can make that contact, but in the general education courses, you don't, you know.  So that's the difference.
Speaker 1: Now, you saw there's, there were about thirty thousand students.  About how many were black?
Speaker 2: I'd say about, we had about two thousand, maybe fifteen hundred blacks on campus.
Story_ID: 622626
Speaker 1: And with your art, what are y- how is your art progressing at this point?  What mediums are you working in?  What are you, what are you doing at that time?
Speaker 2: Right now, I'm doing portrait.  I've done a portrait for the performing arts center [Porter Sanford III Performing Arts and Community Center, Panthersville, Georgia] here in DeKalb County (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I'm talking about back in--
Speaker 2: Back in those days?
Speaker 1: In those days, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, how was it progressing?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was a learning experience for me because I was taking courses that, I hadn't taken before, working with media I hadn't worked with before and lots of basic stuff that they looked to see, do you have potential in.  Are you gonna get through this course so you might be able to go to the next level?  So during those first years, two years there, I was basically going through fundamental courses in art until I decided which area I wanted to go, lean toward, which was basically printmaking.  I liked printmaking a lot, and I like drawing, the figure, graphic design, graphic courses.
Speaker 1: What medium had you not worked in that you began to--
Speaker 2: Printmaking was one.
Speaker 1: Printmaking was one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hadn't worked in printmaking, and I think that was--oh, ceramics.  Those were the two things.  Ceramics course, you had to sign up two years in advance almost to get into the ceramics course.  And it was a requirement.  He was so popular, the things that he, that went on in that class.  So it was--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me why you liked printmaking?
Speaker 2: It was a new medium, different techniques.  Everything was fresh.  I could work on a plate and not know what's gonna come out of it, and it was fresh, the idea of wondering what's gonna happen when you pull that paper off of that plate, off of that print.  And, and it just gave me a different opportunity to see the world differently, you know, from that.  Things I couldn't control, like I can control a pencil, but a stylus, which is a metal tip point, you don't have that kind of control as you have in pencil.  You can't get the detail, so you gotta make some alternative suggestions and movements to do, to complete your thought on that.  So I really liked printmaking.
Speaker 1: All right, and so you decided that printmaking would be something that you would pursue more of, of working in that--
Speaker 2: In college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]. Right.
Speaker 1: In college, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: In fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're still talking about college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and 'cause, yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Print- be a printmaker.
Story_ID: 622627
Speaker 1: What happens after college?
Speaker 2: Well, after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, after you leave Bloomington [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]?  Or tell me up until when you leave, what's going on?
Speaker 2: Up until I leave college?
Speaker 1: Until you leave Bloomington.
Speaker 2: Basically, I was involved in social events, like the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  We'd plan activities, making sure that fraternity's GPA [grade point average] was up to par and sometimes we had to really get on those people that were not serious about their studies, to make sure everybody had a--we could stay eligible as a Greek organization as well as the other black organizations were doing the same thing, you know, making sure that they were competitive there.  So that kind of took up most of my time there and studying.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what artists had an influence on you at this time?
Speaker 2: At that time, generally, my minor was art history.  So all of the Renaissance artists, Leonardo da Vinci was--David [Jacques Louis David] and some of those were very strong in my thought about looking at how they approached paintings and Rembrandt and all of those artists were very influential, post-impressionist painters, impressionism, all of those were, were good.
Story_ID: 622628
Speaker 1: So what happens when you graduate [from Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana]?  You get a degree in--
Speaker 2: I got a degree in art.  But immediately, within fifteen days of graduation, I was in a uniform, [U.S.] Army.  They had drafted me and not--they were gonna take me before I graduated.  And I appealed that, my parents [Sylvia Hall Ransaw and Ransaw's adoptive father, George Ransaw] appealed that, and they allowed me to graduate.  But I didn't get a chance to celebrate.  Eighteen days later, I was in Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri] in basic training, climbing and crawling through mud and machine gunfire over my head, not knowing why I'm down there.  But that's (laughter) the life that I was leading at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) well tell me more about basic training and about just being in the Army, and was this your first time besides going to college, away from home?
Speaker 2: It wasn't my first time, but it--I had gotten some experience because in Indianapolis [Indiana], I would go back to Gary [Indiana] in the summer and spend the summers with my [maternal] aunt [Arbella Hall Bailey] up there.  And so I was there.  But this is my real first time, and my mother told me that the day that I left for the [U.S.] military, she was in the kitchen ironing.  And I went and told her that they were, "I'm getting ready to go today.  They're gonna pick me up, catch a bus and go downtown.  And they told me to only bring a toothbrush and this little bag here."  And she said, "Okay," and she never looked back.  She said, she was there crying and wouldn't watch me go out the door.  She didn't turn around at all.  And I was telling her bye, and she told me later on, (laughter), she said, "I refused to turn around and look at you because I, that was the last time I was gonna see you," you know.  But that was my experience there.  But once I got into basic training, they made me a squad leader.  You know, I tested pretty well I guess, and they made me a squad leader.  So my second leadership role was as a squad leader in basic training.  Now, after basic training, they sent me to Fort Gordon, Georgia.  And I was put into crypto school [cryptologic school], which was a very, highly classified part of the Army.  In fact, it's a, you get a top secret clearance.  Above that, you get a crypto clearance, and above that, you get the X clearance.  Now, the X clearance means that you walk around with a cyanide capsule under your lapel.  And if something were to happen to you while you're carrying these secret documents, you'd better take that pill, and you don't come back, you know, and you don't want to (laughter).  But the alternative to that, going to crypto school, where you learn to decipher and encipher messages, is that you, you gotta, you gotta take this polygraph test.  And if you flunk this polygraph test, they'll kick you out of school and put you in pole climbing school.  So you're stringing wires up there (laughter).  So in order to get through crypto school, (cough) excuse me, you have to go from zero to sixty words a minute typing in two weeks.  And I didn't know how to type.  So you talk about somebody putting in some time on that typewriter 'cause some of the friends I had training with couldn't make it.  They didn't make that school.  So I made, I made the cut, and we got, I got into, I got into crypto school which is that one.
Story_ID: 622629
Speaker 1: So I got my assignment.  Everybody got their assignments at Fort Gordon [Georgia].  Mine didn't come through.  Everybody got their assignments.  Some went to Vietnam and some went every place, and they didn't come to me.  And they had a list of the top five or six graduates for crypto school[cryptologic school].  I was number four.  The top five was supposed to go to Paris [France].  And, and four of 'em went, and I didn't go.  They kept me there on post.  And so I didn't know what it was, so I went to the IG, the inspector general and said, you know, "This is racism.  Why didn't I get my assignment," which was a civilian status job in Paris.  He said, "Well, I'm gonna look into this, we're gonna look into this and find out why you didn't get this school."  So they came back with the excuse that they wanted me there on post to play basketball and play baseball.  I said, "But you guys didn't know I play basketball.  How you gonna put me on basketball team?"  Said, "We'll cut you another assignment."  So two or three weeks later--they didn't tell me where they were sending me, they put me on a plane to New York.  And I ended up in New York at the fort up there, I can't remember the fort.  But I went there.  And they had APO 221 on my, for my mail.  And so I went to the post office 'cause mother [Sylvia Hall Ransaw] and everybody was asking me, "Where are you going?"  And I couldn't tell 'em.  So I went to APO 221, and that was Italy.  I was supposed to go to Italy, and I said, "Well, that's a pretty good assignment."  But in this crypto school, which is interesting, they give you a lie detector test as I said.  And on this test, they'll ask you a lot of questions, and then one of the questions they came to, they said, "Have you ever cheated on a college exam before?"  I said, "No."  Then they went down and asked some more questions.  And they came back to that same question, "Have you ever cheated on a college--," they asked it a different way.  My heart started jumping, and I remembered the time that I had looked on somebody else's paper for something, and I said, "No."  So we got through the test, and he unstrapped me.  He got me up, and he said, "Do you have anything to say?"  I said, "Oh, yeah, on that college exam, you asked me one question, I remembered I had looked on somebody else's paper."  He said, "I'm glad you told me that 'cause we were about to kick you out of school" (laughter).  I was about to be gone.  But I got a very nice assignment in Venice, Italy, Venezia, Italy, in crypto--and where I wanted to be.  That's because it's a center of art, Venice, Venezia, Florence [Italy], Rome [Italy] and I stayed over there for several years playing basketball and finished up [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Because this is the time of Vietnam, you have this really nice assignment in Italy, but did you understand about the Vietnam War?  At that time, did you understand what was going on?
Speaker 1: I understand--I understood when I got to Italy because several of my friends that were over there got killed.  And I did crypto so Red Cross would send me messages, and I'd see their names come across.  And I knew these people, a lot of these people that were getting killed over there.  They were down at Fort Gordon, Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri] with me.  And I knew the gravity of that situation over there, and it's just fortunate I didn't get sent over there.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so how long were you in Italy?
Speaker 1: I was there for about three years.
Story_ID: 622630
Speaker 1: So tell me more about, about your job, you know, doing the crypto [cryptology]?
Speaker 2: As I said, it was a highly classified job.  There were places I couldn't go to play basketball (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have the cyanide pill (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have that one.  I had the one under that one.  One of my friends, he was in crypto.  You were supposed to, called it classified trash and these perforated tapes would come out.  And you were supposed to take this outside and put 'em in the incinerator and burn 'em.  And he went out to burn his and he dropped one, and it stayed on the ground.  They came and found it, and court martialed him. Had another friend.  They sent him to Berlin [Germany] on assignment to take a package up there.  And he went into a nightclub on his night off, I guess.  And a lady came up to him and he was compromised.  And we didn't see him again.  And the next thing we heard, that he was back, he was in the United States in, in stockade because he was compromised.  So it was a very dangerous, it was a lot of suicides were associated with that position, highly stressful, highly stressful, yeah.  They asked me after I got out of [the U.S. military] service did I wanna work in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at the Pentagon in Washington.  I said, "No, I don't wanna stay in this, in this field."  But you can go, people go from there to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], to the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] to do all kind of things.  But I got out of that stuff.  It was--
Speaker 1: What was the most memorable thing that happened while you were there--
Speaker 2: In (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to you?
Speaker 2: In relationship to?
Speaker 1: To the job.
Speaker 2: One night, you know, they put you on these shifts, midnight shift.  Sometimes you're from eleven to seven in the morning, and they had put me on this shift, and sometimes you worked days, sometimes you worked nights.  So about two o'clock, I had a relationship with the dining hall, with the cafeteria to fix me a bacon and egg sandwich.  I'll come over and get it, you know, and did that.  And so I sent them a message that I wanted this bacon and egg sandwich, and I wanted something else, but I sent in the clear.  I didn't encipher this message.  And I went over and got the sandwich, and all of a sudden, I remembered that I sent this stuff in the clear.  So I threw that sandwich down and raced back over to (laughter), to the--we were in a trailer.  That's where we operated because we'd go up in the hills and we operated in a trailer.  And I got that message and cleared it up.
Story_ID: 622631
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1964, you come home from the [U.S.] Army.  Tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I come home from the, from the [U.S.] military, I go up to Gary, Indiana, back 'cause, to stay with my [maternal] aunt [Arbella Hall Bailey].  She had a little apartment in her house, and I rented that out.  And I worked at the Inland Steel mill [Inland Steel Company].  I went over there and got a job and attended, started graduate school.  I started IUPU- Indiana University [Indiana University Northwest] in Gary up there, took a couple of courses, working on my master's degree there.  And I also worked at the steel mill.  But I also started substituting, teaching, getting into the teaching profession and taught at the grade school [East Pulaski Elementary School, Gary, Indiana] that I had first attended, went over to Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana], taught at some of the historic high schools in Gary, Indiana, substituting in art, in those particular areas.  And I did that for a year.  And all the time I was sending out applications to teach in other areas to other cities.  And one of the areas that I was interested in teaching in was Louisville, Kentucky.  They had some openings down there.  So I sent an application down to the board of education in Louisville, Kentucky.  And they liked it.  And so they said, "Can you come down for an interview on such and such a day?"  And I wrote 'em back and said, "No, I can't come down on that date," you know.  And so I looked around for some other places, and they wrote me back.  They said, "Can you come on this particular date?"  And so I couldn't quite make that date either.  (Laughter) And so I wrote 'em back, couldn't make that date.  And so I just knew the job was gone.  The next thing I know they sent me a contract for this particular school to come on down.  And I said, "Wow, I got a contract" (laughter), so I'm going down there.  So I had, bought my first car.  My uncle helped me buy my first automobile.  It was a '57 [1957] Chevy, Chevrolet. A very beautiful car, good on gas but just drank a lot of oil.  So I drove that to, packed all my stuff, went on down to Louisville, Kentucky and went into the school and--Jackson Junior High School [Jackson Street Junior High School; Meyzeek Middle School, Louisville, Kentucky] was the name of the school.  And the principal down there--and I was so excited because I said, wow, they got me on the basis of my resume, you know.  But once I got down there, I found out the reason why they hired me is because I was over six feet tall.  They knew that.  I weighed such and such weight, almost two hundred pounds, and they got me down there for discipline to handle these boys down there (laughter), down there.  And so that was my first teaching experience was down in Louisvi- Louisville, Kentucky.
Story_ID: 622632
Speaker 1: Now, wa- had you already received your, your master's degree from Illinois [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I just--
Speaker 1: Just started?
Speaker 2: --just started it, just started down there in Illinois.
Speaker 1: So what year did you receive your, your M.A.?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Now, while I was down there though, that's when I was in classroom, and I think that's when I heard that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got shot.
Speaker 1: He died in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Well, it must have been, was it Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy]?
Speaker 1: Kennedy was killed in '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], okay.  I thought I heard one of them got--I was in a classroom when I heard Kennedy got killed, yeah, that's who it was.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: I remember we all rushed to the television.  We got glued to the television.  In fact, I was in Indianapolis [Indiana] when King, in the classroom there.  That's what it was, in the classroom there.  Okay, yeah, I remember that because there were a lot of, there was a lot of traffic going on in Louisville, Kentucky when I was there, people coming through and organizing and were very upset about Kennedy being killed and a lot of racist things going back on the radio, back and forth, both pro and con against him, like that.
Speaker 1: Well, there was a protest where at the, at Illinois State University where like two hundred students barricaded themselves in.  Do you remember that incident?
Speaker 2: At Illinois State?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember that one?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: I think that was in--it might have been '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: No, I didn't get to Illinois State until seventy--until the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, actually, it was in 1970.  President, the president there was Braisden [sic. Samuel J. Braden], I believe his name was.  And they wanted to name a building after Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.  Do you remember anything about that?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 622633
Speaker 1: Also artists and musicians are getting together and dealing with what's going on in the social aspect of civil rights.  And can you tell me anything about the Wall of Respect?  Do you remember anything about that?
Speaker 2: I remember quite a bit about the Wall of Respect 'cause I did my dissertation on the Wall of Respect and the murals in Chicago [Illinois].  I remember while I was at Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois], my lead professor on that, Dr. Stumboe [ph.], he, we went to Chicago.  He took me to Chicago, and we were out in front of the Wall of Respect.  I was taking pictures and everything, and I ran out of film.  And he, and I said, "I gotta go over to the store and get some film over here."  And so I left him out there, and he was standing there watching the mural.  And he said when I came back, he said, "I'm glad you're back 'cause I was sweating bullets.  These guys was coming all around me" (laughter).  But, but the murals, they were fascinating by Bill Walker [William Walker] and other artists who worked on those murals.  They were up on top of the buildings, and that whole corner.  That was their way of communicating, was through those murals.  And so I follow those murals in Chicago, the wall of pride and those other murals there in Chicago, the walls in Detroit [Michigan] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and New York [New York], all of those East Coast cities had murals dedicated to the struggle 'cause it was their way of communicating to the community.  Those gangs in Chicago were kind of, kind of ran the neighborhood really.  They took over buildings and had black laws.  Certain things were street laws as opposed to laws that we ordinarily see in our, in our books.  But they were very much different from our laws.  And people like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] were coming to the forefront there.  And one of the murals had Malcolm X, huge, very large and Martin Luther King small, and Jesse Jackson about the same size.  And it indicated that their, they pay more attention to Malcolm X.  And they showed that by painting him as the larger figure in life than what Martin Luther King was and Malcolm X.  Another mural in Detroit, we followed, I wrote up on that also, was at, on a facade of a church, they had painted, the artists were out painting Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson and Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] and some of the others.  And some boys were sitting on the sidewalk over there across the street from the mural.  And the artists asked them, and went across and said, "Well, what do you think about it?  What do you think about this mural?"  And they said, "Well, we'll let you know tomorrow."  And so they went back and started painting, and they came back.  The artists came back the next day and there was green and white paint slung all over Martin Luther King's face because he was next to Malcolm X.  He was too close, they felt.  And so they painted him out of that, that image.  So in the black community, they had their own ideas of who was important during that civil rights struggle and through that Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: And was there a different feel in different cities, maybe in Chicago, Malcolm X might have been bigger (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Might have been bigger in Chicago, yeah, it might have been 'cause it wasn't--he wasn't painted out.  He was part of a, for example, one of the murals had Malcolm X and the Quran, Martin Luther King and the Bible, and these books were right in front of them.  You could see these in the paintings.  And then the Black P Stone Nation, the gang right here, and their bylaws which was out there.  So these three sets of ideo- ideological laws were right there in front of you and to make up your mind, which way--very orderly.  The gangs were shown to be in a very orderly position, and--but you could still see the power of the presentation that these artists presented.
Story_ID: 622634
Speaker 1: What year did you meet [HistoryMaker] David Driskell?
Speaker 2: I met David Driskell around '72 [1972]. Seventy-two [1972] I believe, '71 [1971] or '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: It was an eye opener because it opened up some other ideas for me.  I was at Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois] as a student and didn't know anything about black artists, black art, anything at all, didn't--'cause we didn't get that in high school [Shortridge High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  We didn't get none of that back in high school or in first year at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], in college either.  They didn't have a black studies department or any departments like that.  So Dr. William Colvin who was in his last year of graduate school, working on his doctorate at Illinois State University, he got me to go with him down to Nashville [Tennessee], down to Tennessee.  And we went down there to look at the collection at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  And that's where I met David Driskell down there at Fisk University.  And that opened me up to looking at other black artists 'cause we would go to New York [New York] and look at--in fact, a lot of my collection comes from my traveling with Bill around on those early trips at Illinois State.
Speaker 1: What other trips did you take with him?
Speaker 2: We went to New York.  One of the bigger ones was to New York to visit 'cause he would bring shows back to Illinois State.  And one of the artist we went to was, we would go to his studios, LeRoy Clarke, whose piece is right here.  This piece, red piece behind me.  He's from Trinidad, and he's one of the top, he's featured in Ebony magazine, and he would--we went to his studio.  And later on when I went back to work in New York, he, I bought one of his pieces.
Story_ID: 622635
Speaker 1: Now you have an eye opening to, to black art.  What do you think?  At one time artists would say, "Well, I'm an artist; I just happen to be black."  And then there's a time when people are now saying or artists are now saying, you know, we need to paint or create black art.  So what are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, there are several schools of thoughts on that.  One is that during the 19th century, the most imagery that you would get about black people were caricatures, you know, blackface, pickaninnies, all these kind of images came out of the black experience or experience about blacks during that time.  During the Harlem Renaissance, there was Alain Locke [Alain LeRoy Locke] and others called, W.E. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] called for this back to Africa feel about, let's go back and find our identity and bring some of that into our paintings.  That was during the '40s [1940s] and up to the '50s [1950s] and what have you.  Since that time, a number of artists have gotten away from that and gone into abstract kind of paintings because they felt a sense of freedom at this point.  But they weren't really freed up.  You mentioned the murals.  This often give the black artist an opportunity to express himself because he couldn't get into the museums or galleries for his work.  So he would put his imagery out on the buildings so everybody can see those daily as they pass, and this became his museum at that particular time.  So we have a period then from the, from say, from the '50s [1950s] up to the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s] where there is very little expression of who black people were during the first half of the 20th century unless black artists do it themselves.  Other artists are not gonna paint black people the way they perceive themselves.  So we didn't get that.  Even in Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois], I didn't know until I read some books about black, 'The Black Aesthetic,' Addison Gayle's, 'The Black Aesthetic' and other books by the black scholar about who some of the black artists were or study the murals or what that meant, you know, to be expressed by black people.  And so if there is a need for black people to, artists to--some black artists that can do it, to express the true value and meaning of what black people, who we are, you know, because if you look at another hundred years from now, if you look back at this century, if you don't have these images, you don't have any images of the 20th century of what black people are, you don't have images of the 19th century, then, you know, who are we?  So it's very important that we express ourselves in a way which carries forward in history.

Speaker 1: Tell me what year you finish at Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I finished in '73 [1973], 1973.
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And this is where you get your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your dissertation as you, you talked about, was about murals?
Speaker 2: About the murals, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was about Merton's theory of functional analysis, and the murals.  It took us--Robert S. Merton [sic. Robert K. Merton], a sociologist.  And he deals with institutions.  And what I did was to take those institutions that he dealt with like government, like the church, like education and all of these social institutions and apply them to these images.  How did the black artists that did these murals interpret social institutions and put that on those murals.  So, it was a combination of those things.
Speaker 1: And who was the president when you graduated from Illinois State?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about the people who were on your dissertation team?  Do you remember anything about them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Tell me about them.
Speaker 2: I remember all of that, that whole team.  The, the head of the art department, he was the one--the head of the art department at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], and he was the one that convinced me to--Fred Mills [Frederick V. Mills], Dr. Fred Mills was his name, to come to Illinois State University.  The first year, I was supposed to be actually the first black to graduate at Illinois State in art, you know, but I wasn't able to go the first year.  My first child [Jennifer Ransaw Smith] was born during that time, and the second year, I went on up to Illinois State and became the third to come out.  Dr. Colvin [William Colvin] was the first and Jim Newton [James Newton] was the second.  I was the third to graduate in the program.  Others, Hughes Stumboe [ph.] was my dissertation committee chairman.  Everyone was afraid at Stumboe. Blacks and whites, everybody that was on the program 'cause see if--but I said, "I'm gonna try Stumboe.  I want him to be head of my committee."  And they said, "You're gonna try Stumboe?"  I said, "Yes, I'm gonna try Stumboe."  And so I went to Stumboe, and Stumboe scratched his beard, and he said, "You really want me to head your--," (laughter)? I said, "Oh, Lord, what did I get myself into?"  I said, "Yes, I want you to head my committee."  And so he did, but he gave, it was very rigorous, and he gave me a very good background on writing, on how to write, and--'cause others didn't wanna deal with him on that.  And he was very supportive of me.  But others asked him, then wanted to come aboard.  He wouldn't take anybody else.  After that point, he wouldn't take anybody else on that--but he's the one that went with me to Chicago [Illinois], and we worked on the murals and those things together.  We went to, went to Detroit [Michigan] for a conference.  He went with me to, it was an NCA [National Conference of Artists], a regional black conference on art.  He went with me to that conference.  And he was on, he'd never been in the minority before, and here we're sitting among fifty black people and he's the only white person sitting up there (laughter).  We got back to the campus three days later.  He said, "You know, I didn't use the bathroom but one day while," (laughter)--, "three days, 'til we got back," (laughter).  So it was a very interesting experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 622637
Speaker 1: And who else was there?
Speaker 2: It was Dr. Mildred Pratt.  She was on my committee.  She was a sociologist also 'cause that was my minor, wassociology.  And she was a black woman.  She was the only black on, on the committee.  And she was very, very good too on that committee.  And let me see, it was two more on there.  But I used to play basketball with the guys, you know, so I had a good relationship with them 'cause I passed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jack Hobbs [Jack A. Hobbs].
Speaker 2: Jack Hobbs, yeah.  Jack Hobbs, so I wrote, he was, he wrote a book, 'Art in Context' and he used some of my writing in his book.  His first book came out, and that was the first time I had published with him, was 'Art in Context' with Jack Hobbs.
Speaker 1: He was a professor of--what was his field?
Speaker 2: It was in art, art, probably--it wasn't art education.  Was it art education or history.  He was in one of those two fields, Dr. Jack Hobbs.
Speaker 1: Wilbert Leonard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wib Leonard, Wib Leonard.  Wib Leonard was, I think he was in aesthetics, Dr. Wib Leonard, and I used him too.  He was very good too.  He taught me about nature, beauty and all of those things.
Speaker 1: Thomas McClain?
Speaker 2: Thomas?
Speaker 1: McClain, is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Tom McCain [ph.], yeah, Tom McCain.  Yeah, he was on that committee too.  All of those--he was, McCain was in art also, I believe.  He was in Art.
Speaker 1: And Max Renelds?
Speaker 2: Max Reynolds [ph.].
Speaker 1: Reynolds.
Speaker 2: Max Reynolds, right.  He was the, he was the art educator.  Yeah, he was, he was very strong in art education, yeah.  That was a very strong committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one thing they told me that, because going into the defense of my dissertation, they said, "When you go in that room, you make sure that they know that you're the authority on the subject.  You, since you did the research, you know more than they do.  Don't let them, don't let them get the impression that they know more than you.  So you, whatever you say, it's got to be authoritative like, you know."  And I said, "Okay, I'll do that."  But the first time I went to defend my dissertation, I was teaching at the University of Wisconsin in Madison [University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].  I had to come down there, and I went in there to--and I sat outside the room.  They had me sitting out for a long period of time, and then they came out and say, "Lee [HistoryMaker Lee Ransaw], you won't be able to defend your dissertation today."  And I said, "Why?"  They said, "Because you were supposed to enroll in at least one hour of credit courses this semester.  And since you were up there, you didn't enroll in that.  So you can't, you can't defend today."  And I was, you know, so I had to enroll in one hour for the summer.  So I came back.  The next time I was sitting out there a long time, after the defense.  And they said, they finally came out and said, "Come on in."  And when I came in, they popped the champagne, you know, and said, "Congratulations."  So that was a--
Story_ID: 622638
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit.  You talked about the fact that you had a, a child that was born during this time.  When did you get married?
Speaker 2: The first time I--this is my second marriage.  The first time I got married in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, and who did you marry?
Speaker 2: Patricia South [Patricia South Ransaw].
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had a son, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me your son's name?
Speaker 2: My son is Lee Ransaw, Jr.  Yeah, he lives here in Atlanta [Georgia].  He's an administrator at Delta Air Lines [Delta Air Lines, Inc.].  He works at Delta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daughter, my daughter, she's in the, she's in advertising.  She had worked at Time magazine in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], no, in--yeah, in D.C.  And also on Wall Street.  She had worked down there, but she has her own advertising firm now.
Speaker 1: Tell me her name.
Speaker 2: Jennifer, Jennifer Leeann Ransaw Smith [Jennifer Ransaw Smith].  She married a Smith.
Speaker 1: What year was she born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other children?
Speaker 2: No, that's it.  Just the two (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 622639
Speaker 1: We were also talking about different artists.  And after, after Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois], when do you go to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I went to, first I went to University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] after Illinois State.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So during my last year of my studies there, I got a job, they asked me to come up.  They had heard me speak some place.  And they wanted me to come up to Madison [Wisconsin] to teach.  So I taught up there and finishing, while I finished--no, I didn't,--yeah, in fact, I did finish up my doctorate.  I had my doctorate before I went there.  So when I went there in '73 [1973], I had finished my doctorate and worked there a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did you go to New York?
Speaker 2: After I was teaching here at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia], I got a Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] grant to study in New York, to go to New York in '77 [1977] or was it--
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year--after Wisconsin, after Madison, you went to--
Speaker 2: Morris Brown College.
Speaker 1: So you came to Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came to Atlanta, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me how you got to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And Morris Brown?
Speaker 2: Okay, it was extremely cold in Madison (laughter), very cold.  I needed to go south.  The department was very large.  We'd had thirty or forty people in the department alone.  And it was very large, and there was no individualism involved.  Everything was, and I thought that I had a lot to offer, and I wasn't being, I wasn't able to get any black students in my classes there.  And I thought maybe coming to an HBCU school [historically black colleges and universities] would do the job.  So I wrote several schools in the South. Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I wrote Morehouse and Benjamin Mays was the president.  And he wrote me down, back and said, "Come on down for an interview."  And I couldn't make that interview.  Still I think I have the letter some place.  But wrote Morris Brown, and they called me, said, "We'd like to interview you; come on down."  And I had gone to New York University [New York, New York], interviewed up there.  In fact, one of two out of about sixty applicants for a job there.  And they had a junior position which wasn't paying me enough to, with a child and a wife, to live in New York.  So that one was out.  So they asked me to come down to Atlanta to look over the program here.  So they flew me down to Atlanta, and the dean picked me up from school.
Speaker 1: Who was the dean?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's gone, he left within the next year.  But he picked me up to school, and then I went to Morris Brown.  The president was Dr. Middleton [John A. Middleton].  He was the president at the time, and he called me into his office.  And he looked over my paperwork.  And he says, "What it will take--what will it take to get you here at Morris Brown or Atlanta?"  And I had gone through the rigors of, of interviewing in Boston [Massachusetts] and New York and a couple more places.  And, and I said, "What do you mean what does it take?"  He said, "What kind of money are we talking about?"  So I gave him a figure, and he picked up the telephone and called out to his secretary and he said, "Write [HistoryMaker] Lee Ransaw a contract for this."  I said, "Darn, I should have asked for more."  Boy, I was really upset then (laughter), gave him this figure.  But I said, "Dr. Middleton, you know, I don't, I can't afford to move down here from Madison."  He said, "We'll take care of your moving expenses."  I said, "But, and I got a- another baby, and I don't have housing."  He said, "We'll take care of that."  And he took, (unclear) told the dean to take me out.  We found an apartment, beautiful apartment on the southwest side and came back.  And I was on a plane at 3:30 going, going back to Madison.  So all that was taken care of in one day whereas in those other interviews that I went through, it was an all day experience.  You interview, sitting down being interviewed by twenty-five people.  You go to lunch with deans and students, and while you're trying to take a bite to eat, they're asking you questions, you know.
Speaker 1: So you finally took the position--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and settled in.
Story_ID: 622640
Speaker 1: Okay, so just to be clear, you come to Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1974, and you stay until '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. So tell me a little bit about what happens while you're at Morris Brown?  What's your title?
Speaker 2: They gave me the rank of assistant professor of art at Morris Brown when I first came there, and Dr. Ruth Hall Hodges was the chair of the art department then.  And she was getting ready to retire, and that's the reason why she wanted to bring me in to kind of mentor me into taking that position over at some point.  So I was an assistant professor, helped her out in various endeavors, took a class load of I think about four classes per week.  And I did that for, for two years or two--three years.  And then they moved my rank up.  I was able to go through the tenure process and moved up to associate professor.  And she retired, and so they made me professor--chair of the art department.
Story_ID: 622641
Speaker 1: And, so how do you leave to go to New York [New York]?  What happens?
Speaker 2: Okay, I wrote the--there was a Rockefeller Foundation.  They were giving out twelve fellows throughout the country in '77 [1977] to work with the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] and to under- to take on a project that they considered to be useful for their college and for their city.  And so I wrote a proposal to them and indicated to them that I was coordinator of the art program and the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia]--of all the art programs.  I was coordinator as well as chair of the department, and I wanted to develop a museum or a gallery there in the AU Center which would house African American art.  And there were some things I wanted to do on the national level, investigate black imagery in major museums throughout the country.  And they thought it was a pretty strong proposal, and so they invited me to come to New York to work there at the Met for a year in the education department.
Story_ID: 622642
Speaker 1: And is this the same time that you take Bob Blackburn's printmaking workshop [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, when I was in New York [New York], I took Bob Blackburn's workshop, and this is where I started my, I actually started my collecting of art because all of those pieces that I had gone to artists, that I had looked at with Bill Colvin [William Colvin], I went back and revisited some of those, some of those artists and got other works of art too.  Now, I was strung out, you know, for money, 'cause I would put a little here on this one, a little on this one and a little on these others.  And that's how I started building my collection that way.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what your first piece that you purchased was?
Speaker 2: Probably, let me see.  I bought a--Jacob Lawrence.  He was doing a fundraiser for his wife, and they had some serigraphs on sale during that particular time.  And that was the first piece I purchased while I was up there.
Speaker 1: And so you met Jacob Lawrence.  What about Bearden [Romare Bearden]?  Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: I went to several affairs that they had luncheons for him down there, and I bought one of his pieces too, one of the Bearden pieces there.  I didn't, I didn't talk to him personally, but I did see him.  He was a very, I admired him and his work.  And I had, at that point, studied enough about who some of these artists were to realize how valuable they were to our culture.
Story_ID: 622643
Speaker 1: Two things I, I want to know.  Where you are in your work?  What pieces are you producing now?  What are you doing?  What is your art looking like at this time and printmaking was something that you wanted to do or was your favorite back in, in college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  So tell about Bob Blackburn's printmaking workshop [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop].  I mean how, what was that--how was that for you?  So talk about the experience and the techniques.
Speaker 2: The workshop was, was great.  I would go, in fact, I had two, two or three things going on at the same time that year that I was in New York [New York].  One was the Bob Blackburn studio where I would go and pull a print or see what some of the other artists are pulling and look at their style of printmaking, their lithographs, their serigraphs and whatever they were doing.  And then another one, I was taking a course in printmaking at Pratt University [sic. Pratt Institute, New York, New York].  I was doing collagraphs, is a print, is a technique where you build up using different kinds of materials, and then put glue over that, let it dry.  Then you ink that.  Then you pull that off.  That was a technique that I picked up there.  And then I was going to The New School of Social Research [sic. The New School for Social Research; The New School, New York, New York], taking writing, how to write for publication.  So I was doing a whole lot of stuff my year and a half.  I was really up there about a year and a half in New York doing those things, plus traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you told us what a collagraph, but what's the difference between a serigraph and lithograph?
Speaker 2: I think it's the inks that you use.  The lithos you use the stone or you can use a plate.  And you go right into that plate with your stylus or whatever you're drawing with, and that'll dry.  And then you can print that.  A serigraph, you're using colors.  You're using more, you can use more colors, and it's almost like printing off of a silk screen.  You know, it's sort of like a screen process there.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that you also were taking courses at Pratt?  And what course did you say you took there?
Speaker 2: Printmaking, I took printing making there, right.
Speaker 1: Printing making there.  And who were some of the instructors there?
Speaker 2: Ramono, I think her name was Mrs. Ramono [sic.] or Romano [Clare Camille Romano] was, was my instructor, and she was an excellent printmaker.  In fact, somewhere around here I still have one of her, one of the prints I did in her class.  But she was well known at that particular time.
Story_ID: 622644
Speaker 1: And up to this point, had you had any exhibits of your art?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact I have a number out now, exhibits out now.  And you mentioned the civil rights struggle.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is when I first got involved with the civil rights on my paintings, with my art work.  And you can go down to--I did a mural at Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] that's outside the museum there, civil rights museum [National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African American Culture, Montgomery, Alabama] there.  I've done a number of paintings for that museum that they purchased, commissioned me to work on.  In fact, one's down there, two of 'em are down there now that they purchased.  The museum [National Civil Rights Museum] in Nashville, Tennessee [sic. Memphis, Tennessee] dedicated to Lucille, on Lucille Street [sic.], where Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was, got killed.  That's a museum now.  They have two of my works in there.  Several other museums, the APEX Museum [Atlanta, Georgia] downtown have several of my images on slavery that they've purchased that are down there at the museum there.  So a number of my works are out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I understand for today, but I wanted to know up until 1977.
Speaker 2: Okay, '77 [1977]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to today, I see.
Speaker 1: No before.
Speaker 2: Before '77 [1977]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: The only thing that I've done related to civil rights, you're saying?
Speaker 1: Just any exhibits at all.
Speaker 2: Oh, before that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the only exhibit I had, I had one exhibit before that, was at, in Gary, Indiana.  My first one man show was, I went back to the church that I attended when I was a child there, and they gave me a one man show there at Gary, Indiana.  It's where I sold my first bit of artwork was there, two or three portraits that I'd done, one of Nina Simone and sold several other caricatures.  Then my next exhibit was at Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois] when we, when Dr. Colvin [William Colvin] and I went to pick up these works in New York [New York] or at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and bring a show back to Illinois State, they would all include the graduate students, art students.  So I would be included in one of those shows. Yeah. Those were the only two at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said those were both one man shows?
Speaker 2: No, that was a group--the second one was a group show.  The first one was a one man show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was on, the one man was Gary, Indiana.
Story_ID: 622645
Speaker 1: When you finish your fellow in New York [New York], do you come back to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Come back to Atlanta, right.  And we're in a building process going on at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I suggested to them that we put a gallery in.  And we were able to, in historic Fountain Hall, do our first art gallery was in that building, Fountain Hall.
Speaker 1: What was that, in 1979?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, about '78 [1978], about '79 [1979], right.  That building was completed in about '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: In, in Atlanta during that time also, the missing and murdered children episode was going on here [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders].  As a faculty member and as a parent, what were your feelings or thoughts about what was going on in the city at that time?
Speaker 2: I was very cautious.  I, my kids [Jennifer Ransaw Smith and Lee Ransaw, Jr.] were visiting for the summer, and I got upset if they stayed out too long around the, even around the corner.  I'd have 'em come in the house.  It was a very frightful time for the city for everyone.  I remember taking him for a ride.  We went over and looked at the house where Wayne Williams was, had lived, drove by there, and it's almost like a parade of cars going by looking at where this man lived at that particular time.  But everybody was very cautious during this time.
Speaker 1: Now, back at Morris Brown, who's the art chair at this time?
Speaker 2: I am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is '79 [1979].  You are the, you become the chair?
Speaker 2: I become the chair.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what the program was like at--I know you say you put in an art gallery, put a new building.  Tell me what else is going on?
Speaker 2: We brought, I was able to bring in two new art instructors and one in ceramics, one in art education to shore up the art education program because as a coordinated program we, at Morris Brown, handled the art education.  Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] handled the graphic arts and the printmaking and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] handled the, the fine arts program.
Story_ID: 622646
Speaker 1: And what else happens?  What's next?
Speaker 2: Okay, next we were, we moved into another building.  We moved into Jordan Hall [Frederick D. Jordan Hall].  Now, we're getting into the '80s [1980s] now.  We're getting into the '80s [1980s], and the Olympics are coming to Atlanta [Georgia], and two years in advance before the Olympics around '86 [1986] or something like that.
Speaker 1: The Olympics, that wasn't until the '90s [1990s], 1996 [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so '82 [1982], the 'Centennial Mural' [Lee Ransaw]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's when I did the 'Centennial Mural,' right.  I did a mural, I did two murals for the campus.  One was the 'Centennial Mural.'  It was a national contest to have someone to do the one hundredth anniversary of Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And this mural measured something like eight by twenty-six feet long, eight feet by twenty-six feet long behind glass over in Fountain Hall.  We put up, and I won that competition.  Coca Cola [The Coca Cola Company] sponsored that.  It was a Coca Cola sponsored thing.  And they put up microphones in the ceiling, in the wall so when visitors came through, they can hear the history of that mural.  It would go from Frederick Douglass and slavery all the way up through the building of the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] library at the end on the right hand side of the mural.  That was a one year planning process where lots of people were involved in trying to make a decision who goes on it.  It became very political, who shouldn't go on this mural, you know.  There are certain people that shouldn't be on it, certain people that should because we're Morris Brown, this person shouldn't be on because of this and that.  So I ended up slipping some people in that shouldn't have been on that.  They didn't know anything, they didn't know the difference (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who do you feel shouldn't have been on it that you put on there?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna say that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, we won't talk (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Everybody would be alarmed if I said these names would come out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we did a secondary mural, and I did a second one.  This wall is Morris Brown 'Centennial Mural,' but I did another one on the end wall down there.  That included bishops and other people that was left off of this mural, historically, historical figures, Richard Allen and all those people were on the second mural.  And then when I brought the new faculty in, the early part of the new faculty, we did another mural, two more murals that were supported by a beverage company, and I did the one on Egypt, Egyptian history of Egypt on that mural.  And I had two student mentors that worked--I was mentoring two, two students on that one, and the other murals the same way, by other faculty members.
Story_ID: 622647
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year was it that you taught art at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I started teaching art there in two tho- it was 2000 and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's later on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's later on.
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's see.
Speaker 2: I also taught at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], taught art history over at Emory as part time during the early '70s [1970s] before I went to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Now, you compete, let me see, in 1984, the piece 'Dance of the Chicken Thieves' [ph.], it's a mixed media on paper.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Those were works that I did at [HistoryMaker] Paul Jones, in his collection.  He purchased some of my work that went to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] in the Paul Jones Collection [Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art].  So that was one of the purchased pieces that he bought there along with about three other jazz pieces that's in his collection.  So you can go online and see those, those works under the Paul Jones Collection under my name.

Speaker 1: So tell me about your work at this time?
Speaker 2: Okay, we're at present, right (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are you doing? No, no, I'm saying at this time, but we're still in 1984 to '85 [1985] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Still in '84 [1984].  Okay, my work, basically, now, I've talked about my art work, but there're other things that I was doing, 'cause as I said, I was wearing many hats.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One was grant writing.  And I wrote a proposal to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for $1.2 million, which was funded.  And since I was head of the art department [at Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was in charge of this grant, it was for the liberal arts program.  And it allowed me to help a number of people in other areas to travel.  And this was our first trips abroad as a group.  So we were able to take about seven or eight people to Europe, to Paris [France], to France, to Italy, to various places.  That was part of the grant; others to, to get equipment for our departments.  We get, we got audiovisual equipment and things of this nature.  Others to support different areas.  Also for student support, I was able to take a couple of students down to Trinidad, Tobago as a research trip to do that.  Another part of it, we was able to take several members of other faculties from other schools with us to Europe on a trip.  So that was another one of the hats that I was wearing.  A third one was doing, you said during this time, I was coordinate--I was president of the Black Artists of Atlanta [ph.] which is made up of local black artists.  And we did a number of local exhibitions here in the city at various hotels and centers downtown and other areas that we did, did those.  So that was another one of the hats that I was wearing there.
Story_ID: 622649
Speaker 1: About this time in the, the middle '80s [1980s], in Atlanta [Georgia] especially, a lot of the art stores where you can buy black art, prints mainly, not--you didn't find a lot of original art, but a lot of black people started collecting black prints, you know, 'cause I don't wanna say black art (laughter).  But at that time, and a lot of local artists appeared.  What did you think about that time when people were trying to learn about how to collect art?
Speaker 2: That was a very important time.  The '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] because Atlanta underwent a renaissance of its own in the arts.  You had a number of black artists moving to Atlanta, people like Evelyn Mitchell, Lev Mills came from Florida, and even [HistoryMaker] Paul Jones was a collector.  He moved in town.  I moved here in the '70s [1970s], and we had a new breed of artists with new ideas.  And we were able to write grants and put on exhibitions at, or run community centers teaching elderly how to throw on a wheel, how to paint, how to draw and do things like that.  So that was an interesting time.  As far as printmaking and as far as buying prints, it was a time where there were a few that was in vogue.  And I first started doing my first prints during that particular time, during the '80s [1980s].  They were rather crude, but I thought they were good at that time.  Looking back, "Did I do that then?  My god, and I was selling that, trying to sell that?"  So it was a time when we all were trying to find ourselves as artists, you know, at that time.  Still there weren't any galleries that we were getting into.  There were a few black places that--there was one gallery uptown that was run, run by a young black woman, and she later closed down within a couple of years and moved to New York [New York].  And, but other than that, there were few opportunities for places we could really have our work out and show.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, at the art--well, Tolliver [William Tolliver] had a studio here at one time.
Speaker 2: Tolliver came in, right.  In fact, yeah, Tolliver had one uptown, in the Buckhead area [Atlanta, Georgia].  He lived a couple of doors down for a little while from me here.  And, but he was prolific worker.  He worked real hard and kind of overworked.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who else during that time locally?  People like Paul Goodnight [HistoryMaker Paul D. Goodnight] and Biggs [Janet Biggs] and Carl Owens.  Do you know any of them?  Gilbert Young--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Paul Goodnight didn't live here.  I don't think Paul Goodnight, but Carl Owens, Gilbert Young and myself and several others, we'd have classes over to--drawing classes together over to Carl Owens' place, at his house.  So we, we all met there and Charly Palmer and Morris Howard and a few of us did a Wednesday night drawing sessions here.  So we kept that artwork going then, during that time.
Story_ID: 622650
Speaker 1: Fine arts by, by tar, when people say, "Fine arts," tell me what does that mean to you?  What does fine arts mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in the context of which she may have been using it is that you get the very best of, not jewelry, not crafts, but you get either originals or first edition prints, like that.  But basically, that's what that means.
Speaker 1: Okay, and would you clear up, I guess for me, but for other people who might wanna know, about buying a limited edition print or lithograph or--tell me how does that work?  I mean what do the numbers really mean?
Speaker 2: Okay, the numbers are important (laughter).  The first thing that comes out of the artist, off his, off his line, a very good print, and he would put down AP for artist print--artist proof rather.  And that becomes the most special of all of his proofs.  If you get a proof before he pulls his edition out, you got the most expensive or the most important of his collection.  Then he'll start numbering them, one through whatever.  If it's one through twenty, that means he's only made twenty of those, and he's gonna destroy the original at some point.  If he's made a thousand of 'em, you don't want them.  You know, it's too may.  You don't want number 998, 999 because it's so many of 'em out there on the market.  So if you're a collector--unless you just want the artwork--but if you're a collector, then you go for those low numbers on those proofs.  One through twenty-five or thirty or something like that are always, always good numbers.  Now, if you're a big time artist like Jacob Lawrence or something like that, number 225 is good, number three hundred is good, number five hundred is good (laughter).  You're in there with the big time.  You've got one of the few that's doing that, you know.  So that's what those numbers mean.
Story_ID: 622651
Speaker 1: So now, around 1987, the National Black Arts Festival is founded.  Were you involved with that at all?
Speaker 2: I was originally, yeah.  I was, I used to have exhibits.  We'd be out in Piedmont Park [Atlanta, Georgia], and I did some work out there originally, but later on I, I didn't participate in those as much.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you think about the idea?  Was it something that was needed and, I mean, well, obviously, it was because it has expanded from every other year to every year.
Speaker 2: Which I think is too often.  I think every year sort of dilutes the importance of the artwork.  I think, you know, you become a meat market.  You get up there and everything you see you buy it this year, and the same thing is up there next year and the following year and like that.  I think it's too often.  I think the original idea concept, every other year, worked very well, you know.  Artists were coming in from everywhere doing that.  But venues began to shrink.  You got less places where you show later on than you were originally.  They were, you could either go--when they first started, you can go to this place which was probably Greenbriar [Greenbriar Mall, Atlanta, Georgia] or, or South DeKalb Mall [Gallery at South DeKalb, Panthersville, Georgia], and you knew what artists are gonna be there, and you go looking for that, collectors would come in looking for that, for those pieces.  So I think over a period of time, they, for some reason, they changed the format.  And also, not only did they change the format, they changed the support for the arts.  More funding went into the performing arts than for the visual arts.  And you get less funding for the visual arts and you get less attention paid to where you are gonna be located, and that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Did you know Stephali- [HistoryMaker] Stephanie Hughley who founded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did I know her?
Speaker 1: Yes. You knew her.
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew her, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 622652
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, we're in 1989, and you have an exhibit 'Black Artists, Atlanta, Past and Present' that was at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Do you remember it? Curated Jenelsie Holloway [Jenelsie Walden Holloway].
Speaker 2: Jenelsie Holloway.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay, I think on that, it shows right there--I'm try to recall.  I think she pulled some of the local artists who she thought were important to that show.  Yeah.  I don't know too much about, I don't recall that show that much (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, so tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She pulled some stuff out.
Speaker 1: All right, so then tell me what happens next?  What's important in your life next and we're at the end of the '80s [1980s], going into 1990.
Speaker 2: Going into 1990?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, what's important next?  I think for me during that particular time I was looking at promotion and tenure [at Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia]--well, I had tenure, but promotion to full professor and preparing for that as well as trying to improve the department, looking at ways in which we can improve the faculty of the department, trying to get exhibiting faculty in, those that would be showing, that could show their works and making conferences.  I was involved with the National Alliance--I'm sorry, the National Art Education Association on minority concerns committee.  I was working with them on that.  Let me see, attending College Art Association meetings and those are the kind of things I would do in that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, is the piece 'Remembrance, Tribute to Ancestors' ['Remembrance: A Tribute to Ancestors,' Lee Ransaw], is that an important piece for you?
Speaker 2: It was, it's in Paul Jones Collection [Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art] too.  That piece is not in, I don't have that piece anymore.
Story_ID: 622653
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], and this is 1996.
Speaker 2: In 1996, the Olympics, we knew the Olympics will be here in '96 [1996], and all of the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] schools were vying for funding to do some special projects on their particular campus.  And ours was basically the stadium, build a new football stadium over on our campus.  I think Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] did a gymnasium, and others did different things.  But in addition to that, we wanted to bring in an artist that would help us with a piece on campus.  And we hired Fred Ajanogha from Nigeria, Benin artist from Nigeria to work in our department as an artist in residence.  And he created a beautiful piece out in front of the administration building that's dedicated to education and teachers and students' education.  But in addition to that, I was able to get some funding to do a new gallery.  The first gallery was about fifteen by forty feet, and that's the size of the first gallery we had in historic Fountain Hall [at Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  This new gallery, we got the whole lower level of Jordan Hall [Frederick D. Jordan Hall], which was a cafeteria and some other things.  And so we got funding from the United Negro College Fund and a couple more areas to hire, put out bids for an architect to design this building, facility down there.  So we got a beautiful gallery down there in the lower level of Jordan Hall.  But this gallery wasn't gonna be complete exactly in time for the Olympics.  So we were worried about where we were gonna have this exhibit, this Olympic show.  And so we went upstairs to another musical auditorium up there.  And we got funding enough to change that into an art gallery.  And we had the, the largest exhibition of national and international artists that's been in Atlanta [Georgia], I think historically, because they came from all over the world, pieces came in to that specific site for that show for the Olympics because people would get off the train going to see the soccer match at the stadium, they had to come by that gallery.  And we had doors open on both sides.  And it was a beautiful exhibit.  And thousands would come by almost daily just to walk through the gallery and go to the, to the exhibit.  So it was a wonderful thing.
Story_ID: 622654
Speaker 1: Then in 2000 you found, founded (laughter) the National Alliance of Artists from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  And tell me the importance of this organization.
Speaker 2: This is probably the second largest black arts organization in the country, besides the National Conference of Artists, outside of that.  At present, we have approximately eighty some members of active artists in this organization.  It's interesting how it started out because my curator of the, of the gallery at that particular time, we sat down, and we talked about having a local show of statewide artists.  And then we expanded that conversation to talk about, well, why not have all the historically black colleges [HBCUs] come for an exhibition here.  And so we, I sent out letters to all the department chairmen, "Why--would you like to have a show here with students and mentoring," and what have you.  And I got a response from about fifteen or twenty.  So we decided to have a meeting here.  And we had our initial meeting, and from that initial meeting we decided to become an organization.  And that's how it began to grow from that point on into an organization.  We started out with thirteen members originally, and now we have some, eighty some members from historically black colleges all over the country.
Speaker 1: So this was a way of art departments communicating with, and letting know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, for the first time.  And what made this available, because you can--can you imagine that from 1850 when they had first, the black colleges first started, all the way up to the year 2000 that departments hadn't gotten together in this manner before, was--it's the age of technology.  I was able to go on the Internet and to talk to people and to communicate and say we're gonna have a meeting here or let's, to a phone call here, let's get together.  And that's what brought these people together.  We were able to communicate with each other.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other people involved and some of the other schools?
Speaker 2: Charnelle Holloway from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], she was involved.  Tina Dunkley from Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] was an original member.  Dr. Peggy Blood from Savannah State [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] was an original member.  E. Asihene [Emmanuel V. Asihene] from Clark Atlanta was an original member.  Louis Delsarte, Hasaan Kirkland from, Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] was an original member.  Anita Knox from Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] was an original member.  These were some of our original members.  You got another name down there?
Speaker 1: William Anderson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill Anderson from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], he was an original member.
Speaker 1: Phillip Dotson.
Speaker 2: Phillip Dotson from LeMoyne Owens [LeMoyne Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].  You should have one more name.
Speaker 1: Let's see, Marvette Pratt Aldrich.
Speaker 2: Oh, Marvette from Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], yeah, you got 'em all down there (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think we've got, I think that was it.
Speaker 2: There's one more guy.  It should have another man in there someplace.
Speaker 1: I had Anita B. Knox, you said Talladega.
Speaker 2: Anita B. Knox, yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't see another man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So the organization forms and comes together, and you hold your first major exhibit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we held our first major exhibit--our first exhibit was in Atlanta [Georgia] in, I think, 2000 or something like that.  We had our first exhibit, and that's when we had the workshop.  We'd invite students up.  They stayed in the dorms.  We had a master teacher.  Delsarte was teaching drawing and painting.  We had exhibits of all the artists at that time, but our next major meeting was in Dallas, Texas.  That's where we formed our constitution a couple of years later at the Academy of Arts and Letters [Black Academy of Arts and Letters] there.  We worked there and did that.
Speaker 1: And so you had a traveling exhibit, 'Visions Within'?
Speaker 2: 'Visions from Within' was our first traveling exhibition, yeah.  And it went from Dallas where it was the first one, then to Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and then to Claflin [Claflin University] in South Carolina [Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Story_ID: 622655
Speaker 1: And for you personally, you become the dean of arts and letters at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: At Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Morris Brown, I'm sorry. (Laughter) I'm sorry, Morris Brown.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was dean of arts and letters for a couple of years there at Morris Brown.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year?
Speaker 2: Was it 1998 to 2000 or something like, or 19-something, in that era.
Speaker 1: It was for three years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for three years, I think.
Speaker 1: And then you, after this is when you receive a Ford Foundation fellow?
Speaker 2: No, Ford came many years before that.
Speaker 1: Before, okay, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ford, yeah, Ford was at Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was Ford.  But I received the UNCF fellow now which is in the '80s [1980s].  That was a major, yeah, it was around '88 [1988], United Negro College Fund distinguished fellow in '88 [1988] which allowed me to live in Europe and here, both back and forth going to those museums following up on the research that I've done on black imagery among master artists throughout the world.  So that was a really nice grant.
Speaker 1: Can you think of anything, any other grants or fellows that we did not talk about before that time?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Brown's jubilee--grants or fellows?  I had Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation], Ford, no, I think--Andrew W. Mellon [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation].  Those were the three major grants that I have.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then you have, you participate in the exhibit 'Homecoming.'  That's with local artists.
Speaker 2: 'Homecoming'--
Speaker 1: It's about 2005.  It's at the City Gallery East [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  That was master artists.  They, they use, they called us master artists at that particular time, and all of the artists that they deemed relative or important in this area were involved in that show called 'Homecoming' down at the City Gallery East downtown, right, I (unclear) in that one.
Speaker 1: Okay, I notice that Amalia Amaki, another one of our HistoryMakers was on that list.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And a good, very good friend of mine, Flora Hammond, who just passed away.
Speaker 2: Flora was a good friend of mine too, yeah.  Boy, I'll tell you.
Story_ID: 622656
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your relationship with Dan Moore [HistoryMaker Dan Moore, Sr.] and the APEX Museum [Atlanta, Georgia] because you have an exhibit there that's something that's very important.  So talk to me about that.
Speaker 2: About Dan Moore or the exhibit?
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Dan first--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --another one of our HistoryMakers (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dan, Dan and I--in fact, I was supposed to go to a board meeting after I leave here with him.  But Dan and I go back into the late '70s [1970s] and Dan came to me, over to Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], and he was looking for a space to have, to do his museum really 'cause I had just got back from New York [New York] under that grant to work on museums.  And so I went to the president, and we found a space down on, let's see, what street is that?  It's Ralph David Abernathy [Boulevard], over by Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], a street, a building over there that Morris Brown owned.  And we put him, and he was in there first.  And so that was the first Collections of Life and Heritage, where it started off over there.  And then he acquired space down on Auburn Avenue where he is now.  And I was put on the board there.  I was on the board for that space down there, and we've had a close relationship ever since.  I helped him out on acquiring his first collection.  I went nationally with artists from around the country that I knew, and I told them how about you contributing a piece to the APEX Museum, to be on long, long, long term loan.  So in case something happens to APEX, you can get it back, you know, but it would be on long term loan.  But they're actually permanent exhibits.  So we got Benny Andrews and all the big names, gave us nice pieces for that show, for that--not the show, but for the first original collection of that.
Story_ID: 622657
Speaker 1: You mentioned Benny Andrews, and, and tell me about your relationship with him?
Speaker 2: Benny, we used--once, once we got our corporate title incorporated as the National Alliance of Artists, Historically Black Colleges [National Alliance of Artists from Historically Black Colleges and Universities], we wanted to do the 'Visions' exhibition ['Visions from Within'].  And I wanted a big name for the, for the forward of the catalog that was coming out.  And I asked Benny would he do it.  And he said yeah, you know, he taught at Fort Valley [Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], started a black college [HBCU].  And so we used him.  He wrote me a letter and said, "This is--how does this look?"  And so we got it, got him to do that.
Speaker 1: He was notorious for boycotting a lot of stuff (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know if a black artist wasn't in an exhibit, we're not going to it (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 622658
Speaker 1: So tell me about the exhibit at the APEX [APEX Museum, Atlanta, Georgia], 'Coming by Force' ['Coming by Force: Overcoming by Choice']
Speaker 2: 'Coming by Force,' that's an interesting exhibit.  One day I was down at the APEX, and was talking with Dan [HistoryMaker Dan Moore, Sr.], and he said that he would like to have an exhibit down, wondered would our organization do one for his building.  And, and so I went out of his room and out of the meeting and came into the large exhibit room area, and had no idea what, what we're gonna show.  So I sat down in a chair and started taking down some possible titles for shows.  And, and I turned around, I turned the chair around and was looking at this blank wall.  Then all of a sudden there appeared in my mind, imagination on that wall a slave ship.  I said, ah, this is possibly something that we can do, an exhibition on slavery.  So I went back to Dan, and I said, "We'd like to do an exhibition on slavery."  And he said, "Well, this is the kind of museum we have.  Let's do it."  I said, "Well, I've gotta get with my board members at the national alliance [National Alliance of Artists from Historically Black Colleges and Universities] and see what we can do."  And I threw it out to them, and they all agreed that we can do that.  Let's do that.  So instead of just a regular exhibit, I wanted a slave ship, an actual ship on this exhibit.  So on this blank wall, we envisioned putting a slave ship there or a miniature, proportions of twenty feet long, about seven feet out and about eight feet tall on this wall and having murals done by leading artists on top of that.  And on the left of that mural we're gonna have before slavery, life on the, in Africa before slavery and plantations, the slave ship, all of the grief and sorrows that these people aboard that ship went through.  Then post slavery, after that, on the plantation, on this other wall and up the hall, and then the legends.  So that was the concept that we went through to the artists.  And so we sent out a prospectus to all the artists.  They jumped on it.  We'd love to see this show there, and they all worked hard to get this exhibition together.  And so we got the exhibit together.  They all came for the opening.  We had jazz and we different things, the drums.  [HistoryMaker] Jean Carne was there, and she was--some of the musicians performed.  Not only did we have art, but we had a multimedia presentation.  We had the exhibit going here.  We had poetry reading by African Americans for the Arts in another room.  We had in the area where they have the films, we had the post-Reconstruction things, things going on in there, history of Auburn Avenue going on in there.  So we had a live show going on there.  It was photographed in Time magazine, The New York Times did a photograph on it and it appeared in the Time magazine.  So we're very proud of that show.  So, the APEX liked it so much, Dan bought the ship, paid for the ship.  And we had to do another one down in Alabama.  And they wanted a ship.  So we sent our team of ship builders down there.  They built a ship.  They kept their ship down there, and they had the exhibit.  And then it went to New York, went to New York up at Nassau Community College [Garden City, New York].  We did miniature paintings of the ships, but we didn't do the actual ship.  So it was a very successful--I think it was our most successful show.  I'm very proud of that one.
Story_ID: 622659
Speaker 1: Okay, so moving along, tell me what's next or what are you doing at this time now, and, and what are you doing as far as your artwork?
Speaker 2: Okay, artwork, we're working on an exhibit, I'm working on two or three paintings right now.  One is on, we're gonna have in Savannah [Georgia] in June.  It's call 'Whiteness,' ['Perception of Whiteness'] how do you interpret whiteness.  And all the artists are charged up.  We don't know what anybody's gonna put.  It doesn't have to be about black and--just white people, but it's about different things, you know.  So that's one show that I'm working on.  I just finished a portrait of Porter Sanford III.  It goes in, that will be unveiled on May 6 there at the center [Porter Sanford III Performing Arts and Community Center, Panthersville, Georgia].  But I think one of the exciting things that I'm doing now is working on two chapters in our first historically black college national alliance [National Alliance of Artists from Historically Black Colleges and Universities] book, art book, college level book that's gonna be published by Kendall Hall [Kendall Hall Publishing Company].  And the two chapters I'm doing is, one is on the growth of African American black architects.  I found that very interesting, and a second one is on black imagery by European masters aesthetics now of that.  So I'm working on two chapters of that.  So those are things that I'm working on right now, keeping up with my artwork and doing the writing.
Story_ID: 622660
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we did not talk about that you wanna talk about?  I know that you remarried.
Speaker 2: I remarried.  Her name is Cheryl Johnson Ransaw now.  So we've been married for thirteen years and very happy, happily married, living out here.  She's a water person, so we're living on a lake, out here on the lake.  She likes the water.  So she's very helpful with me and my art.  She's, she gives me positive criticism, feed dialogue, and what have you.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about that we did not?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I think that might be, that might cover it.  I'll probably think of something after you leave.
Speaker 1: Always.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 622661
Speaker 1: Because this is gonna viewed by future generations, if you had to send a message to the future generations, what would it be?
Speaker 2: Well, it would probably, I could probably send a message to the, those that are interested in arts.  I think I'd like to address the art world better, more so than everybody else because the arts are very important today.  They are being actually deemphasized by the government, state government, national government, local schools.  They're cutting out art programs.  You're having now to make a choice between music or art, and sometimes you don't get either.  So I would suggest that those that are interested in art, in spite of the fact that they may not have the support they're looking for financially or educationally in the schools to continue to pursue that, that area.  I would also encourage them to, they have a better opportunity to look at the sources of those legends that have been successful in the creative fields, more so than what I did, especially the black artists.  When I was growing up, I didn't have an opportunity, until I got to Illinois State [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois], to, well into my college years [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], to look at, see who some of these accomplished artists are.  I think The HistoryMakers make it, give a very good opportunity for them to, as a starting point, for them to look at, see who some of these artists are and to follow their careers, and they can see who some of the other artists are that they may want to emulate or to pattern some of their life skills after.  So those are some of the things that I would suggest.

Speaker 1: And I, I pray and hope that you will live for many, many more years, but what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, at least that, that I've tried.  I've done as much as I thought I could do with what I had available at the time.  And I continue to try to strive to, for excellence, and I think that's important.  I think there are a lot of areas and people that I look up to in different areas that I would like to take a part of, someone over here in art history, someone over in fine arts, someone over in history, someone over in another area, music.  I would like to take something from each of those as I continue to build those things that I like to do.  I can't get up there with all of them on those levels, but it gives me something to shoot for.
Speaker 1: Well, if there's nothing else.  I'd like to thank you very much for your time.  I know you're very busy.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for coming out.  I--my wife [Cheryl Johnson Ransaw] said, "Oh, you think they're gonna come?"  I said, "I don't know.  They said they'll be here," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, thank you so much.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
