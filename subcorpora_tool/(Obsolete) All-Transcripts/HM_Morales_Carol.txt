Speaker 1: Let me start out by asking you about your mother.  If you can give her name and what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Gloria Altacracia.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-L-T-A-C-R-A-C-I-A.  Maiden name Pennyfeather, P-E-N-N-Y-F-E-A-T-H-E-R, Morales.  She was raised here in New York City by two Caribbean parents.  One of five siblings, all girls, very close knit family.  She--education, graduated high school here and went to work in the garment district.  And that's where she retired from.
Speaker 1: Now when you say she was born of two Caribbean parents, what were their, their--from what, what, what island, what island?
Speaker 2: My maternal grandfather is from the islands of St. Kitts, it's in the British West Indies.  And my maternal grandmother is from the Virgin Islands, St. Croix.
Speaker 1: But do you know how your grandparents actually came here, or when?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure of the year, but I think they both came over here in 1930s.  My grandfather was a merchant seaman, and that's how he met my grandmother in the Vir--St. Croix, Virgin, like I said the Virgin Islands.  And they married there and they immigrated to this country with I think my oldest aunt and all the other children were born here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother talk any about her growing up here in, in New York?
Speaker 2: Not really.  They grew up here, right in Harlem [New York].  In fact the building that they were raised in is still standing on Fifth Avenue and between 119th and 120th Street. (pause) They had so much fun growing up.  That time the, the areas were living in the community, everyone looked out for each other.  I remember when I was young watching my mom and dad get dressed to go to the Rockland Palace, the Renaissance, some of the famous ballrooms on the weekends for a dance.  At that time they would be in the kitchen cooking up you know, food to take to the restaurant, it was a real party.  I couldn't wait to get grown so I could experience that.  But of course when my time come, those places had closed down, things had changed.
Story_ID: 119881
Speaker 1: Now your father, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Wilbur, W-I-L-B-U-R, Archer, Archer, A-R-C-H-E-R, Morales.
Speaker 1: And his--and similarly about his background.
Speaker 2: His background, his parents--his father is from Puerto Rico, his mother was part Native American and I don't know much about their background.  My father was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and at some time the family moved to New York City, to Harlem [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: In junior high school, they were junior high school sweethearts.
Speaker 1: Did your father talk at all about growing up in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No, he did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was very young.  He did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would they, you know, did they ever describe the--well okay he came here after, when he was a young man I take it, okay.
Speaker 2: Very early age I assume.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, but to, but to New York 'cause he grew up in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: No, to New, to New York, he came to New York I'd say maybe about eight or ten.  So he did most of his growth here.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Did they grow--did they talk about the Harlem that they grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you share some stories?
Speaker 2: Well that was during Harlem's heyday.  You know we have so many of our famous artists and politicians lived right here in Harlem.  I remember all the time when Fidel Castro came to Harlem and was staying in 125th Street, you know how much excitement that generated in the community.  You can walk the streets any hour of the night.  There was so much activity and so much life going on in Harlem.  It was a time when it was stressed--you know education, education, education.
Story_ID: 119882
Speaker 1: And what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Harlem [New York]?  There was so many activities going on at the time--the friendships, you know you bonded with the, the whole neighborhood, the whole street, we call it the block.  And everyone on that block knew you, they knew your parents.  You had no choice other than to behave yourself.  Any of the elders could come and reprimand you if you weren't doing something correctly or you, you were doing something wrong.  There were the, the community centers after school.  There were the track meets, there were the races, there were the concerts on the weekend.  There was so many things for the children to do.  We had--it was Minisink, even though I was not a, a part of that, my brother participated in camp Minisink.  There was just so much activity in Harlem; there was so much life.
Story_ID: 119883
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: I lived on 117th Street [Harlem, New York].
Speaker 1: And can you describe the block, who some of the neighbors were?
Speaker 2: They were called, what you call tenement houses now.  None of the stories--the buildings were over six stories.  We lived in one--there was only two floors, two apartments to a floor.  My fondest memories are the summer time when all the kids would hang out in the street, the street would closed.  They would block off the street.  We'd have double dutch con--challenges.  Baseball games for the older men and younger men.  Mothers in the neighborhood would get out and, and sometime cook corn and you know, fry chicken and kids would just come up and eat.  The ice cream vendors coming around.
Speaker 1: Now those are sort of sights.  Do you have memories of any smells and sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds.  There was always noise.  The first sound you remember, you know back then, the, the refrigerators--we, we didn't have refrigerators, you had to buy the ice.  The man would come around and sell the ice.  And you would hear him coming; that was one of the sounds.  Of course, the garbage trucks, and then of course the ice cream man.  I see you smiling.  Right, those were the sounds.
Speaker 1: Would the ice cream man say anything?  Would he have anything he would say or--
Speaker 2: Just, "Come and get it."  You know, and you hear the bell ringing or the horse cow horns.
Speaker 1: And what about, what about smells?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood, the smell of the neighborhood smelled so good.  And I realize nowadays that smell is not good for you.  It was the smell of the grease from frying hot french fried potatoes, fried chicken and putting that hot sauce on it.  That smell it is mouthwatering.  That's the smell that I most--always remember.
Story_ID: 119884
Speaker 1: Can you describe some--now you had--did you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one brother who is deceased and one sister.
Speaker 1: Where did--give their names and where you fit in the birth order.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.  My brother was next, his name was Wilbur Archer Morales, II, and my sister's name is Sandra McGee, M-C-G-E-E.  Well it should be Morales-McGee.
Speaker 1: Right.  Do you--can you talk about events and family times or just memories from childhood?
Speaker 2: Well we grew up in a very close family as I said.  My mother's [Gloria Altacracia Morales] one of six siblings.  And anything one member of the family did, it went around to all of the family members, all those six--other five siblings and their families.  My brother and sister and I were very close.  We grew up under the premise that we all had to watch out for each other.  If I went somewhere, my brother and sister had to go with me until I was at age of maybe sixteen.  We took family trips in the summer time, those were very memorable.  We used to go at least two weeks back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Back then, we--that was far away for us.  There was always the family outing in the summer time up to Bear Mountain.  That was a long way off, you know because back in that age it took a while to get there and it was an all-day outing that we looked forward to.  Then there was the summer trips to Coney Island [New York], you know, all the rides and eating up the hot dogs and the pizza and coming home sick.  And that was Mom and Dad and, and the three of us.  I remember our first car.  Daddy had to get a second job when we got that first car and boy it was so much excitement and running around.
Speaker 1: Did--well as the oldest, were you told that you had specific responsibilities?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well my mom [Gloria Altacracia Morales] and dad [Wilbur Archer Morales] was at work.  At a certain age I was responsible for my brother and sister.  And they knew they were supposed to respect and listen to me.  There were times when my brother got to be a certain age of course, he grew taller than I, bigger, and he didn't wanna listen.  And they used to be some verbal battles going on and.  The neighbors would tell my mom coming home and meet her at the corner.  You should have heard the noise coming from that apartment there.  And of course mother would set things straight.  But we were raised that the oldest, you always respect the elder.  And so they had to listen.  And we were very close.
Story_ID: 119885
Speaker 1: Now any other memories of growing up?  You know you talked about Bear Mountain and you talked about your block.  But any other, you know, things around family time or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the things in the street was the, among the older--the card parties, or we called them back them the rent parties.  And if somebody on the block was short that month on the rent, you know, the rest of the block would get together; the wives would cook, you know, dinners and sell the dinners.  The men would sit down and you know play cards, and the kids would always be peeping around, you know you're not supposed to be--you weren't allowed in the--we were a part of it.  And you looked forward to that.  Let me see.  Then we had to go to church every Sunday.  There was a close knit tie to the chur--to the church.  We are Episcopalians.  My grandparents started out in that church, my mom [Gloria Altacracia Morales] and dad [Wilbur Archer Morales] was married in it, I was married it in and it's gone on down the line.  We're still a member of that church.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me the church's name?
Speaker 2: St. Philips Episcopal Church.
Speaker 1: And who, who was the minister at the time?
Speaker 2: Back then it was Father Bishop.  I don't remember Father Bishop's first name, but it was one of the pillar church right here in Harlem [New York].  Under that leader, after Father Bishop left, we came with Father Harrison who married my mom and dad, also married me.  Father Anthony and then Dr. Westin.
Speaker 1: So your family had a long tradition in that church then.
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119886
Speaker 1: And so life--you had your family life, there was the church life.  What about school?  Can you tell me where you went to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to elementary school right down the street, P.S. 184, okay.  It was a wonderful experience.  And back in those days, the classes went from like grade, first grade, A-1, 1-2, 1-3.  I was always in the top one to three classes.  I did very well in school.  I enjoyed school.  And I don't know whether that--I had no choice.  Mom [Gloria Altacracia Morales] and Dad [Wilbur Archer Morales] made it very clear that education, education came first.  And they had to work every day to make sure that we were provided for.  And they better not have to take time off from work to come to school because we didn't do our part.  That's all they asked, that we do our part and study and get the grades, and I got the grades.
Speaker 1: So from the beginning, are there any, you know, subjects you liked or things that you, you know, gravitated to?
Speaker 2: Well I was defiant in some way because I grew up tall and thin, and everyone kept saying I was gonna be a model.  And I had--I wanted to prove that I can be more than a model, that I had a brain upstairs and can tackle the science.  So I struggled, but I did it, I tackled the math and the sciences.  I always gravitated towards those courses.
Speaker 1: Well why was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I really don't.
Speaker 1: And why were you so against, against being a model?  Was that something your parents were saying?
Speaker 2: I guess I wasn't very informed, okay.  That if I knew better, I might have reconsidered.  If I know what I know today, I might have reconsidered that profession.  But I don't know.  I just thought at that, that time the thought of models and anybody that was attractive as being light headed, not as well endowed with brain capacity.  And so I guess I always fought and shunned away from that.  Another thing that help foster that opinion is that my mother worked in the garment district.  She sewed very well, everyone liked it.  People were always giving her material and stuff.  She made all of my clothes.  And in my neighborhood and to this day I was--we were known as the, the two sisters--I was tall and thin, my sister's a little shorter and stout.  And the ones that were always dressed very well.
Story_ID: 119887
Speaker 1: Now were there--what were you like as a, a young person?
Speaker 2: I was shy, precocious, what else, curious.
Speaker 1: And what were you curious about, what things?
Speaker 2: Life in general.  My maternal grandmother liked to play what you call, I think they call it the jiggetts, the, the numbers.  And she was very lucky with them.  My aunt, my mother's [Gloria Altacracia Morales] youngest sister is eight years my senior, we were very close.  My grandmother sent her to nursing school and she was responsible for me starting to travel.  My first trip was taken at the age of sixteen. We went to the Caribbean to St. Kitts, spent a month there, spent it with relatives.  And after that, every year I wanted to be--I was off traveling till I became eighteen, I would go with my aunt.  She was a nurse.  The nurses association always had these trips you can take advantage of.  And that's how I started my traveling.
Story_ID: 119888
Speaker 1: And so you were curious about the world around you is what you're saying.  Now in, in elementary school at P.S. 184, were there any teachers that influenced you or that you feel, you know, you have memories of?
Speaker 2: There was one.  She was a German--I wanna say German/Jewish background.  Her name was Ms. Herschenel [ph.].  And I guess at that time I was her favorite in the class.  And she let me know that I can do anything I want to do, and it was up to me.
Story_ID: 119889
Speaker 1: So you, so you were pretty motivated as a student, you know, and did well.  Now at--where was [James Fenimore] Cooper Junior High School [New York City] located?
Speaker 2: On 120th Street and Fifth and Madison Avenue, 19 on 20th.
Speaker 1: And that went from what--sixth to eighth grade, or eight--
Speaker 2: It went from seventh to ninth grade I think.  We were the first girls, it was a all boys school, we were the first girls that integrated that school.
Speaker 1: So how was that then?
Speaker 2: That was wonderful.  There was like three men to every girl.  That was wonderful.  I have nothing but fond memories of my--and these were all public schools--and back then public schools really educated you, okay, we did well.  And I guess I was one of those fortunate--I was always the curious child.  Always came to school well dressed, well behaved, well mannered.  I didn't have any problems.  Mom [Gloria Altacracia Morales] and Dad [Wilbur Archer Morales] was at home, they always came to Parent Teacher's Association.  The, the school knew that they were around.  They would, you know, stop by.  So I was one of the fortunate ones.
Speaker 1: And in junior high, what year was that, that you were in junior high?  19-- what?
Speaker 2: I'm not good at-I'd have to ask Enrique to count back for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You--but your birth date again you said was?
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], okay, okay.  So, so we're really sort of in the '50s [1950s] you know.
Speaker 2: Probably, yes.
Story_ID: 119890
Speaker 1: Are you aware of, you know, of the world around you, you know as sort of a, a teenager?  Or are you really sort of not aware of--
Speaker 2: Not so much aware of the whole world around me, but you see in the '50s [1950s], there were so many things happening in Harlem [New York] around that time.  I was aware of, you know, those things.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Happening around--thinking of the '50s [1950s]--I'm getting my time confused.  There were all of the, the prominent politicians coming to Harlem.  At that time, you know America still was very much segregated.  They couldn't stay downtown in one of the hotels, say like the Hilton or where you're staying now.  If they were a person of color they had to coming up to Harlem.  That's where the old famous Theresa Hotel.  So I was aware of those kinds of things, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were the politicians that were of note here at that time?
Speaker 2: At that time, none other than Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.].
Speaker 1: He was, he was a legend, right?
Speaker 2: He was a legend.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any Adam Clayton Powell stories or stories about him?
Speaker 2: The stories I remember about him were not the most favorite ones 'cause those were later on his years when I was--became--I would say I was old enough, okay, to recite them.  But I knew, knew many people who went to his church Abyssinian [Baptist Church], and many people said that he has being a tremendous help to them, okay, around.  In fact, one of my patient, a man that lives upstairs now, Bill Meeks, I think he was working for, gosh, okay let me not tell that story 'cause I'm not sure who he was working for at the time.  But Adam Clayton Powell was very instrumental in helping him out of an incident that was sort of racial in, in nature.  But he was that kind, and I heard stories of--Bill Neeks say there was a club here on Lenox Avenue, I think it was called the Lenox Lounge where the politicians used to come and frequent in the evening.  And they all had their own table that they will sit at and hold court.  And people would come in.  And those are the kind of stories that I grew up hearing about because I was too young to actually venture out to any of these places.
Story_ID: 119891
Speaker 1: Now in high school--so when you, you're about to go to high school.  You went to Washington Irving High School [New York City, New York].  Where was that located and--
Speaker 2: Fourteenth Street in Manhattan, in Irving Place.  That was one of the top rated schools back at that time.  It was an all-girls school and their reputation is when you wanted to go into college, those were one of the schools--that's one of the schools that you would go to.  And at that time, the, the diploma you went after if you wanted to go onto college was an academic diploma.
Speaker 1: And how did you get a--did you have to test into the school or do you know how?  'Cause that was cross town.
Speaker 2: Right.  You did have to be--I had to take a test, okay.
Speaker 1: And were there students from all over the city?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that a different experience for you, 'cause it sort of took you out of your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yes it, it was.  We met students from all over the city and the school was integrated where our neighborhood schools was mostly predominantly African American and a few Hispanics.  But there you had all ethnic backgrounds.
Speaker 1: And did you find that you know, was there, was there any adjustment for you in, in that?
Speaker 2: Not that great adjustment.  My personality and the demeanor was such that I'm--I really wouldn't say I'm aggressive.  I am even-keeled.  I am, I would say I was about myself that I am fair-minded.  And so I didn't have a problem with adjustment.  I had friends of all ethnic backgrounds in school.
Speaker 1: And what are the--some of the things that you were involved in, in school?  You were still leaning towards science and math?
Speaker 2: I was still leaning towards an academic diploma.  So there was only so much science and math you took there in order to prepare yourself for the Regents Exam.  I was involved in the background of the Drama Club.  I tried the, the, the singing, but I wasn't very good.  I found that out.  And the other--it wasn't many other things involved.  Back then we did have sports, okay you had to take a gym course and all of that, you take a little baseball and things like that.
Speaker 1: What was--what--explain to me about the Regents exam.
Speaker 2: The Regents--you know what?  I really don't know if it was similar to the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test].  But anyone who wanted to go onto college had to take the Regents.  And if you, you passed the Regents with a certain, of course grade, of course it would help your entrance into one of the schools of your choice.
Speaker 1: I see, so they had--so that would help.  So the Regents exam had to come out of the Board of Regents, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so that was, that was sort of an additional thing being done here.  Okay, so you have two exams to get into--to school.
Story_ID: 119892
Speaker 1: Now what are you thinking where you wanna go to school?
Speaker 2: For college?  I wanted to have the experience to go away, okay which I didn't do.  I wanted the experience of living in a dorm and going away.  And we really couldn't afford it.  So I wound up going here to City College [City College of New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what were you majoring in then, or what were your thoughts about--
Speaker 2: Well I was majoring in chemistry.  I started out as a major in chemistry because I knew back then I wanted to go into medicine.  What branch, I didn't know at the time.  So I had to have a science major.  And I never (unclear) only negative thing I can really remember in all of my school years at City College [New York, New York] you know and I was gonna major in chemistry.  I had go to see the head of the Chemistry Department and I was asked why I wanted to major in chemistry.  I was told--and I was told that you know this is going to be really hard and, and difficult, and maybe you might want to reconsider.  So of course I threw my defenses up and I started off majoring in chemistry and I did the majority of my--I took most of all of the basic science courses that I need to make sure that I did have a major in chemistry.  And I minored in economics.  And after a while I said well I'm beating my head up against the wall.  I had--I graduated a bachelor's of science degree.
Speaker 1: You mean you--did you drop the economics?  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: No, I picked up economics.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 119893
Speaker 1: How many women in your class were there?
Speaker 2: There might have been about six women and I think there was only--always in the class no more than two African American.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who are your role models at this point?  What are--you know who are you looking at and saying I wanna be like this person, or you know what, what's sort of influencing you at this--
Speaker 2: Say I wanted to be like this person.  I, I wouldn't say I wanted to be like this person, but my number one role model always in my life has been my mother [Gloria Altacracia Morales].  For a woman who just has a high school education, she is so bright.  She can look at something and figure out, you know, how it should be done.  Then there was my uncle, my father [Wilbur Archer Morales]'s oldest brother who was a physician.  He was right there in the background saying you know, you know you can do it, you can do it.
Speaker 1: Did you ever work at his office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  But when I decided that this is the route that I wanted to go and he put me in touch with two of his classmates.  He is a Howard [University, Washington D.C.] graduate and I think he graduated from Howard about 1944, '43 [1943] or something, right before the Korean War.  And most of the professional schools at that time, medical, dental and law, they all housed together, lived in the same dorm.  So they got to know each other very well.  So he put me in touch with two of his classmates who are dentists.  And one is a Dr. Eric Thompson's deceased now.  And my mentor who I came into this practice is, as an associate, Dr. Marcus Moore, okay.  And I got a feel to see which branch of medicine I wanted to go in.  And I decided on dentistry.
Speaker 1: Now who--Dr. Marcus Moore, when did you first meet him?
Speaker 2: In the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe '69 [1969], early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's, that's before you went to dental school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you graduate from City Colleges [New York, New York], are you thinking you want to be a dentist at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.  I'm thinking I wanna be a dentist at that point.  But I was married at the--got married right in--between then.  And I was married to a gentleman who really didn't want me to go on.  He wanted me to be more or less a home wife and you know, he'll take care of everything.  And of course that marriage was dissolved.  I came to work part time for Dr. [Marcus] Moore.  Took some refresher course to prepare me for the DAT [Dental Admission Test], and went on to dental school.
Speaker 1: Now why did you wanna be a dentist?  Where did that come from?  That just--
Speaker 2: Well I wanted medicine.  Again, back in those days it was a little difficult for us females to get into dental school, even to medicine and to see.  And like I said, I always wanted a career just opposite where people look at me and thought I was--my profession would be.  And I fell in love with dentistry.  I guess by luck.
Story_ID: 119894
Speaker 1: And, and tell me about Dr. [Marcus] Moore, what was, you know what was his practice and you know what was his background?
Speaker 2: Dr. Moore was raised in the South, Fort Pierce, Florida.  His father was a, a schoolteacher and he was one of about I'd say seven siblings.  Very bright, very astute man.  Went to Howard [University, Washington D.C.] Dental--no, first he was a teacher.  He taught in the public schools down in the south and he realized the kind of lifestyle that he wanted, that he would never be able to support himself and a family on the money that he was making then.  And I guess the opportunity presented itself to go to dental school and he went to dental school.  Came north to New York.  Had a prominent practice in the Bronx [New York], I guess you would call it South Bronx.  Back then a number of prominent people lived there on that street.  Sidney Poitier lived on that street, [HM] Harry Belafonte, gosh a number of physicians and dentists now, they were patients of his on Jackson Avenue.  And he knew that his--he wanted to grow his practice and he said that he didn't think the Bronx would do it.  He needed to be in Manhattan.  The opportunity came for him to come in this new development that was just being constructed.  And he had the personality such that you know, people just liked him.  He came in, the owner of the new development was a man named Olnich [ph.], Mr. Olnich.  He was the first person to buy and rent.  Mr. Olnich carried his construction people to work and construct this office the way Dr. Moore wanted.  You knock on that wall, it's all concrete and the walls in the room are lead-lined.  And he had the foresight.
Speaker 1: So this was Dr. Moore's original office?
Speaker 2: This is Dr. Moore's original office.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 119895
Speaker 1: So you come and you work, you work for him [Dr. Marcus Moore], right?  And for how long a period?
Speaker 2: About three years before I went on to dental school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were--now was there, was, was, was that an agreement?  Did you know you wanna go--wanted to go to dental school when you came here or did--
Speaker 2: Yes he knew that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He knew that.  It was just a part time and short thing.
Speaker 1: Okay and what types of things were you doing for him at that time?
Speaker 2: I was a dental assistant and of course they let me do more than that since he knew I wanted to go to dental school and he would take a lot of continuing education courses.  And he would take the staff and we would go take a course.  So I was really prepared.
Speaker 1: And that's what I'm saying.  So you--now it's--what are you thinking where you want to go to dental school?  Was it assumed that you were gonna go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I only applied to one school, Howard.  Foolish, but I only applied to Howard.
Speaker 1: And why do you say foolish?
Speaker 2: Because what if Howard turned me down?  Okay.
Speaker 1: So you, so you went--but he had gone.  You said Dr. Moore.
Speaker 2: Had gone to Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 119896
Speaker 1: First of all have you been out of New York much at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had been to the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Okay and your, your aunt had taken you--okay.
Speaker 2: I had been to Brazil, South America, I traveled.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  Had you been back to your--you know had you ever been back to Puerto Rico?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  And let me ask you were, were you raised thinking that you were--what was, what was sort of the messaging in the house?  Were you, were you--did you consider yourself Puerto Rican or black American or what were you--
Speaker 2: Always African American.  That old adage, if you have one drop of African American blood or negro blood or black blood, we'd call it back then, you were, was always African American.  My grandfather on his birth certificate says white because he was a, a white Puerto Rican according to the hair, you know, the physical features.  But he was also African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119897
Speaker 1: And so when you get to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], what is your experience there and how many--what--you're entered the class of what, 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many--at this point in time things have sort of opened up.  How many women are in your class?
Speaker 2: When we first started out, there was maybe thirty, thirty-five women in the class of I don't know, maybe over 100 and something.  But of course they know after the first year, a good 30 or 40 percent of those drop out, they drop off, they didn't make it.  So we finished with about maybe twenty women in the class.  And how many graduated with the original class?  Out of that twenty, I'd say maybe fifteen or twelve graduated with the original class.
Speaker 1: So all--so you graduated with the original class, okay.  Now tell me what your--you know you've, you come in more prepared than others I would take it.
Speaker 2: Only from dental aspect, but not for the, the first two years where you have to take the basic science.  You were in class with the medical students.  We're all learning everything that we need to know about our bodies from head to toe.  So no, that was all new, in depth, long hours of studying.
Speaker 1: And did you ever have any trepidation for having, you know, chosen to go.  Were there any times when you said maybe I didn't do the right thing?
Speaker 2: No, because at Howard we felt we were all in it together.  The majority of the class was African American.  There was like 20 percent other ethnic groups, majority of that was Caucasian.  One or two Asians and I'd say one or two Middle Easterners.  But the majority were African American, and we felt that we were all being treated the same way.  We couldn't call--cry racism or anything else.  So, no I didn't feel that I made the wrong choice there.
Story_ID: 119898
Speaker 1: Now who was President of, of the--of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at that time?
Speaker 2: [HM James. E.] Cheek.
Speaker 1: Cheek, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Cheek was President then.
Speaker 1: And we just interviewed him recently.
Speaker 2: You did?
Speaker 1: That's why I was wondering.
Speaker 2: I wondered if he's still alive, great.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's still alive.  I think he's like ninety-one or something.
Speaker 2: Bless his heart.  Cheek was President.
Speaker 1: Now, now who was head of the dental school though?
Speaker 2: At that time, the first woman dentist [sic, dean], Jeanne Sinkford.
Speaker 1: And had she been dean for a long time when you got there?
Speaker 2: No, I think our class--she was the first year.  The dean previous to that was-I have to ask Enrique--doctor, doctor, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: It'll come back to me.  But Enrique's class, he was the class ahead to me, went out on strike.  I mean that news went all over the country.  And that help ended the previous president's career.  And Dr. Jeanne Sinkford came in with my class, '75 [1975] taken over.
Speaker 1: Now was--were there--did she do okay as dean during your time there, or did she have a hard time as a female?
Speaker 2: We always have a hard time as a female being the first, but she did really well.  Men and women both respected her, okay.  She was alumnus.  She graduated from Howard Dental School and she stayed in the community.  She went on to post-graduate work.  She was well known.  She's done--she did all the right things, okay, and she did a lot for the dental school under her tenure.
Speaker 1: Now what were the--what, what were some of the teachers that you had, you know that were sort of legendary on campus, or that you particularly liked?
Speaker 2: Okay.  In the medical school--you said I particularly liked?  Well I wouldn't say I particularly liked and there was a, a Dr. Lee.  He was so strict, but he was so thorough.  And he taught biology.  And you either knew it or you didn't.  Of course most of us at that time didn't appreciate that because we were under pressure and he was adding more pressure and we knew either you had it or you didn't have it with him.  I respect him for that and he made me buckle down.  You had to pass that course, and those that didn't pass that biology course--those were the ones that were--didn't make it after their first year.
Story_ID: 119899
Speaker 1: And was it always anticipated that you were going to come back to Harlem [New York] after you were in school?
Speaker 2: No, it was anticipated I come back to New York at that time. I really was thinking about coming back and starting a practice in Westchester County [New York].  They were just starting to build out there in White Plains [New York] area.  And that's where I envisioned to come back.  But after I graduated from school, I was one of the fortunate ones to get a dental residency.  In dentistry it's not required that you have a residency.  Those who get one are in the top ten of their--percent of their class and are very fortunate.  And I was able to get a residency over in Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx [New York].  I was the second African American female they took in.  And upon completing that residency, a lot of offers were made to me and Dr. [Marcus] Moore made me an offer that I couldn't refuse.  To come in, work with him for two to three years.  I didn't know that he was ill at the time, and buy in the practice.
Speaker 1: So you knew at the time that you came in that you were gonna inherit the practice?
Speaker 2: I was gonna purchase the practice, right.
Speaker 1: I see, okay, 'cause that--I mean the significance of that, can you just talk about that?
Speaker 2: There's a great significance in that--I mean for a young person coming out of professional school, first of all we come out with such a debt, and to know that you can come into a well-established practice, and also know that you can buy into it and eventually it's gonna be yours.  You don't have to open up a, a practice just from the start, you know, track patients, build your reputation and the whole nine yards; that's tremendous.  But also it is negative to, negative side to that.  I've taken courses where they talked about older doctors taking advantage of young doctors coming in, making promises of an association and no--which would, which would lead to a buy-out, which never occurs.  Or the practices are so--need so much work, it doesn't work out.  It will not be fruitful for the younger dentists to stay.  And so I was advised on both sides of the issue; whether this would be a good deal or not for me.  But I trusted Dr. Moore.  He told me, "Carol, you come in this practice, you work for two years and you start buying it out."  He said, "You'll make it."  He said, "I will guarantee that.  You can do it."  And I did it because during that time, there weren't many female dentists.
Story_ID: 119900
Speaker 1: One of my worst experience as a, a, a resident at Montefiore Hospital [Bronx, New York], was an elderly woman of color, she was about eighty years of age.  She refused to have me work on her 'cause she didn't believe I was a doctor.  She'd never seen a black female doctor.  Of course you know I looked much younger than I am now, and the head of department--he was gonna take a hard nose and say well then she couldn't be seen in the clinic.  And I said no, that's not the way to handle that.  That could be my grandmother, you know.  So I was very fortunate when I came into this practice, and I think I finished my residency in 1980, and I came right into--it was the time of women's lib.  Women were looking for other women practitioners, lawyers, women were supporting other women.
Story_ID: 119901
Speaker 1: But you started on your--so the two of you didn't really get together and, and, and, and did you get together in medical school?
Speaker 2: Yes we did.
Speaker 1: I mean dental school.  So did he come back--was he [HM Dr. Enrique Riggs] part of the practice?
Speaker 2: He came back before me, okay.  He came back before me, he was a year ahead of me, okay.  He did his internship at [unclear] Hospital and he opened up his own practice.
Story_ID: 119902
Speaker 1: So here you're back, you're working with Dr. [Marcus] Moore.  I mean but that's after a year of having your residency, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're coming back now.  Are you building--you said that you know this is a time of women's lib.  Now are you building your practice and what was, what was--was his practice healthy?  You said he would--you know he was ill.  So had it sort of gone down?
Speaker 2: Sort of gone done.  He had Parkinson's [disease] and he really couldn't do a number of the procedures, okay.  Still patients respected what he did before and he still had a, a decent practice.
Speaker 1: And so what do you do then to build your, your part of the practice?
Speaker 2: Well we had a consultant come in and find out how the best thing to aid me into the practice.  We did all of the marketing things, sending out letters and announcements.  Gave them my bio, I'm--how I'm raised, where I went to school and everything and that I'm back and people came in.  They would start referring.  And he taught me so much about running the business because we tend to forget, that medical practices are businesses, okay.  Then most of his relationships with the Dental Society, the courses that I needed to take, all of those things I contribute to Dr. Moore, contribute my success to Dr. Moore.
Speaker 1: So now what did he teach you?  What are some of the things that you learned that have stood you well?
Speaker 2: First of all, you can't come in here with a white coat on and thinking that you're the doctor and the patients is down there.  You have to form a relationship with your patient first.  You have to build that trust; that's the most important thing.  Secondly, he gave a quality service no matter what you're charged, he gave a quality service for the fee that you're charged.  And if you do that and stand by your work, no matter how bad things get at times, you will always have a business.
Speaker 1: And, and so what was the--when you did the survey, what did it, you know, what did the survey tell you that you needed to do to build?  Like you said you brought people in and you start advertising.
Speaker 2: We started--well we really didn't advertise per se, like in a magazine.  We sent out announcements to our patients already on our mailing list or patients already started with the office, with announcements out in the, the neighborhood and some of the stores that was back.  Had management put my name on the marquee outside, and also at that time cosmetic dentistry was just starting to get new, you know.  Back then we didn't call them composites and bondings--they called them bondings, right, they were called bondings.  People were coming in looking for those types of services.  More crown and bridge work; people wanted even more so today, whiter teeth.  So we incorporated some of those services.  Young women who were starting businesses, you know, entrepreneurship was up--we had more women coming out of medicine, more women coming out of law school, grad school.  And they wanted to look their best, they were interested in cosmetics.
Story_ID: 119903
Speaker 1: And so these changes; when you say cosmetic dentistry was sort of coming into its own, what, what were some of the developments?
Speaker 2: Bleaching started back then, okay.  We were bleaching teeth back then with a lamp, you know, and a solution that really was like a bleach that you put on the teeth.  Like I said, the cosmetic bondings that--filings that we put in the teeth.  Back then that's when that thing--people stopped wanting silver fillings, they wanted white fillings put in.  A lot of work came in with porcelain crowns.
Speaker 1: And what was the--why, why did they start using porcelain crowns?  Why did the, you know the dental industry go that route?
Speaker 2: The beauty of it.  Like porcelain china.  You don't get a better material.  It's glass-like, it is a glass.  The color is stable, it doesn't change color.  Only problem with them back then it was the--they were so fragile.  The common brand couldn't really afford it--they break, they have one replaced.  I remember when we did porcelain crowns on Mr. [Sidney] Poitier back then, he always kept one or two spares in case one broke, he can come here or if he was in California, we can ship it to California.
Story_ID: 119904
Speaker 1: And so when you--so you're--this is, you know '75 [1975] to '80 [1980], is that the--?
Speaker 2: No, this is '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980], this is 1980, okay.  And Dr. [Marcus] Moore stayed with the practice how long?
Speaker 2: Physically he was coming in till about 1986.  He wasn't practicing dentistry, but he would come in, I let him come into the office, gave him something to do.  He was like--he was my marketing tool.  People loved him, okay.  They remember.  This office has changed a little, but it's pretty much on the same order.  We always had a very modern office, a comfortable office.  We always reinvested in the office.  And because of that, the other doctor--doctors around fixed up their offices, okay.  So Dr. Moore physically I think back to 1986, then he could no longer physically come in.  He would--his wife would bring him in, myself or [HM] Dr. [Enrique] Riggs would take him home.
Story_ID: 119905
Speaker 1: Now, now at what time do you and you know, your husband [HM Dr. Enrique Riggs] get together in this practice?
Speaker 2: Right after the purchase in 1984 he started coming in some.  His practice was on 90--I'm sorry, 86th Street.  And we decided that would be a good location for him because 86th Street you have such integrated, you know, population, but it didn't work out, okay, it didn't work out.
Speaker 1: So was there a lot of discussion about whether the two of you could work together in the same practice?
Speaker 2: Well we were never here really at the same time 'cause Dr. [Enrique] Riggs always had--he always had a mind for business, and he was always wanting to--I say cultivate his entrepreneurial ideas and venues.  And at that time, he was working on a, a, a small business stock market, okay.  So a lot of time was devoted to that.
Speaker 1: So he was more of the entrepreneur and you were more the traditional dentist, okay.  And so--
Speaker 2: Still is so.
Speaker 1: It's still the same, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 119906
Speaker 1: Now you--I'm just trying to sort of, you know, touch upon the important parts, you know, of your practice.  Now--and you have to--you know if you could help me out.  What--the building that, you know your practice is housed in, does it have--what, what is the nature of the people who live in the building and, you know and it's--I think you were starting to tell me some of that.
Speaker 2: Well this was one of the first premier buildings in Harlem [New York] that was built supposedly for the middle class.  Back then, the average blue collar workers like my mom [Gloria Altacracia Morales] and dad [Wilbur Archer Morales] could not afford to live here.  Back then it was mostly physicians, dentists, a lot of athletes, a number of the Knickerbocker players and other, you know, teams that were housed here in New York lived in Lenox Terrace.  So that's the tradition.  That's what the owners wanted for this complex.
Speaker 1: And did you find that you had a lot of clients that came out of the building?  Was that helpful to you or that wasn't necessarily?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, somewhat.  We do have a--there's only a small percentage, okay.  Back then it might have been a larger percentage.  But today we're more on transition, you know, we, we move around a lot.  So it's a smaller percentage, but back then, it was a larger percentage.  And also this whole corridor, doctor--this office was the dental, next door was OB/GYN [Obstetrics and Gynecology], and across the hall was the internist.  In fact, Dr. Childs who used to own the practice there was just here this morning.  And so we'd just refer to each other, okay.  But the majority of our patients come from all over, as they still do.  Patients come from Westchester [New York], I have a patient that comes from Queens [New York] and Long Island [New York].  Back then in the '80s [1980s], we used to have patients that come in from the Caribbean, from the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico.  You know they take their summer vacation, they come to New York, get all their medical work done and sharpened, and some things like that.  Washington [D.C.], also used to have people come up, some educators would come up on the spring break.
Story_ID: 119907
Speaker 1: Now you, you got involved also in other dental societies and things like that.  Can you talk about that and what, you know when you got involved like the New York County Dental Society?
Speaker 2: I've always been a member of the New York County Dental, and I work with them every year.  The Greater New York Dental Meeting is one of the largest dental meetings that we have in this country.  I think the second largest is the Chicago mid-winter meeting that's after our New York meeting, which is always the weekend of November, of Thanksgiving.  The weekend in November of Thanksgiving.  And dentists from all over the world comes to that meeting.
Story_ID: 119908
Speaker 1: So you were, you were talking about your practice, you know between--you said that you got married in 1983 and, and how your practice was sort--you know the partnership, your marriage and partnership and the practice.
Speaker 2: We got married in 1983, bought the practice in 1984 and [HM] Dr. [Enrique] Riggs started coming in a good deal in--I'd say starting in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: And how, and, and talk about the, the different roles that you play here.
Speaker 2: Pretty much are equal, I'd say equal roles.  That I'm here on all day--I'm here every day.  Dr. Riggs might be in two days a week, okay.  He's the more--I would say he's the more easygoing person.  I'm the more disciplined one and keep things in charge as you can see, I was pulling and you have a timeframe, you know.  He would sit down, he'd--patients love him because he's a people's person.  He likes to interact and talk with you--but you can't do all the time in business.  We have a, a schedule to meet, we can't keep people waiting.  So I'm more the disciplinarian.  So I think him being here two days a week is a, is enough, okay, to keep the marriage healthy.
Speaker 1: So, so I want to talk about that, you know with, you know because it's not often that couples can you know, work together and live to--you know be in business together.  And I would just like you to sort of address that.
Speaker 2: Well I think it helps.  We are completely the opposite, but the one thing that we are--we do have in common, first of all I think it's our background.  We both were raised in I'd say Caribbean families.  Dr. Riggs is so honest and has such an integrity, okay.  We think alike on those terms.  It's never been a question of whether to do the right or the wrong thing.  We're both Episcopalians, okay, we grew up in the, in the same church.  I still go to church occasionally.  I'll let you ask Dr. Riggs about his.  So those things that we have in common, where we balance each other out is I guess you would say maybe I'm more of a Class A personality, or more hyper.  I like things to go right, I plan for things.  Dr. Riggs, he can plan or not plan.  Whatever works out, he will deal with it, okay.  He doesn't get excited about anything.  I can get excited.  So we balance each other out.  My patients love him.  The women patients, you know, is Dr. Riggs gonna be here?  The men, he has such a, a bond be--with them also because he's a, he's a fraternity person.
Story_ID: 119909
Speaker 1: Now you know I wanna ask a couple of questions like when AIDS came out.  How--you know that was a, a disease that, you know, affected the dental industry.  I mean affected others, but you heard about you know, well that it can be transmitted and, you know, the dental industry became concerned about that.  And I was wondering, you know, do you remember that time period and--
Speaker 2: That was such a frightful time period because especially in dentistry the way they were saying that AIDS could be transmitted and anybody working in dentistry at that time know that they have stuck themselves numerous times with the injection needle.  And so that was a major concern.  That was the only concern that we had here as far as using face mask and glass--gloves, I have always done that, okay.  That was just my personal--I never liked putting my basic hands in someone else's mouth and saliva and everything else and getting blood.  So we always wear face masks.  And I think Dr. [Marcus] Moore started with that because he had an allergy, he had to wear face masks.  He always had a runny nose.  We've always had an autoclave so our instruments, surgical instruments were always heat sterilized autoclave.  The other instruments were cold sterilization.  So when AIDS came out, the only thing that changed for us is that everything started to be heat autoclaved and sterilization.  And we kept on top of the AIDS situation and kept reading, kept reading how it was transmit--transmitted.  And they come to find out there's very--AIDS trans--transmission in a dental practice.  First of all, the AIDS virus cannot live in the saliva.  Your saliva and mouth has so much, so many bacteria; it's one of the dirtiest orifices on the body, okay.  And AIDS bacteria cannot live there, okay.  And because in dentistry, we very seldom drawing blood or anything like that, we usually injecting in, we're not drawing anything out.  So as more knowledge became available, we realized that we were very--we were at very low risk.
Speaker 1: And when did those developments come out?
Speaker 2: The late, early '90s [1990's].
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was that period of time where everyone was a little panicked.
Speaker 2: There was only one time when everyone was panicked, and there was some dental office, I forgot whether it was in Texas, where a young woman said that she caught AIDS from a dentist and come to turn out, you know, that story got a lot of publicity.  But the, the, the follow story did not, is that she didn't catch it from there, okay.  And that she was not a virgin.  She caught the virus somewhere else.  So the dentist was not responsible.  There has not been one case in this country of AIDS being caught in a dental office.
Story_ID: 119910
Speaker 1: Now you know the other thing that I've heard just re--in recent years about dentistry, is the high suicide rate.  You know that dentists, you know that it's a lonely, you know occupation.  And, and when I say lo--you know I never thought about it, that they--you know 'cause the--you can't really talk.  No one can talk to you while they're in the chair.  And do you find that or don't you agree with it?  But I have heard some statistics.
Speaker 2: I don't agree with that and from my experience only, but then I can understand it.  We don't have that problem.  Most of my patients, people who are my patients, they have become our friends.  They come, they look forward to coming in here; they look forward to seeing my staff; they look forward to seeing me.  We interact with them.  They make dentistry so much easier if you have a relationship again, with the patient, also with the doctor.  Unlike most doctors, I put that saliva injector in your mouth and ask you to open up, and I'll ask you a thousand questions knowing you can't answer 'cause your mouth is open, you know, open.  And [unclear], but we--I have to allow time, at least ten or fifteen minutes, for that interaction with my patients 'cause they look forward to it, okay.  I enjoy coming to work.
Speaker 1: And so you've very much enjoyed your career, your dental career.
Speaker 2: I have a very good career, I think very blessed.  You know times are here, it's hard, or I should say times are hard.  A lot of medical practices are really suffering, especially dentistry.  Because dentistry is still we call an elective serv--service.  A lot of people only come when they're in trouble and they're in pain.  It's not a life and death situation.  But we still have good business.
Story_ID: 119911
Speaker 1: And why do you--what do you think the, the, the key to having a successful business has been?
Speaker 2: First thing is caring.  You can tell that, okay.  The average person can tell if they come into this office, they look around, they see the decorum of the office, they can tell that we care, we invested in the office so they would be comfortable.  To keep up-to-date.  There's continue education courses that we take every year to stay up-to-date on the new technology that's out there.  My staff is very highly trained, I'm very proud of them.  Almost all of those young ladies I trained here myself.  I gave them a career and a profession.  Then you have to stay up with the business.  You have to learn the business aspect of it, it is a business.
Speaker 1: Now Dr. Morales do you, you plan to--I mean you're still young, so do you plan to, you know, do this till you retire?
Speaker 2: I would hope if I'm blessed to be able to do it for another ten years, 'cause I like what I do.  I, I would miss it.  I would miss not coming in and seeing the patient.  I like the cosmetic work and I'm good at it.  So I like to take a mouth and start off from A and turn it around to something that's in most cases, not only beautiful, but functional, okay.
Story_ID: 119912
Speaker 1: And what are some of the trends that you know are happening in dentistry?  The things that are, you know, becoming sort of more popular?  'Cause you know people like my--okay go on.
Speaker 2: No, no finish your question.
Speaker 1: Well my father, you know he keep--I re--and I remember you know when I was young, my first visit to a dental office and someone screaming.  You know but things have changed.  But you know they were there and you would see the, the, you know the whatever--the--
Speaker 2: The forceps and that, right, and all the stories of you see that they--caricatures of someone pulling the tooth out and you pull out all their organs with it.  Well first of all it's easier today.  The technology with the injection, the needles are so fine you don't have to be uncomfortable, you don't have to be in pain with dentistry today.  The high speed drills are so fast and now you know, we're working on lasers for dentistry.  We haven't perfected them yet where they can be used generally, but in some cases if you come in with a virgin tooth that has decay in it, you don't have to have an injection and you know you don't use the drill, you can use the laser to clean out the decay and put the filling in.  These are the most I said exciting, you know technology that's coming around in dentistry.  And the other most exciting thing that we know that there won't never be a robot to replace us as dentists.
Story_ID: 119913
Speaker 1: Well that's true.  Now I wanna ask you, you've also been very civically involved.  And you know one of the organizations has been the Links.  And I want you to talk about your involvement in the Links and you know when you first, you know, became a member.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I would consider myself a relatively new member to the Links.  I've been involved I'd say six years.  I'm a member of the Westchester County Chapter of the Links.  And you know anything about the Links organization, our model is community service.  Most of our projects deal with young kids, kids and the elderly.  The project that I'm most proud of is about two years ago I co-chaired our 50th fundraiser.  And we wanted to raise enough money to give the Princeton Review to disadvantaged young people in Westchester County [New York].  Most people don't think of Westchester County having disadvantaged youth, but they do.  We have towns like Yonkers and Mount Vernon that's predominantly minority, African Americans and Latinos.  And they could not afford to take the Princeton Review course that would improve their chances of getting into a good college.  And Princeton Review had a program out that in some of these disadvantaged areas, they will lower their fee for the course.  Instead of being 1,000 dollars per person, they lowered it to about 275 dollars.  And so we had to raise the money in order to provide that service to a couple of the high schools in Westchester County.  And we raised over 50,000 dollars.  And we had about five or six young people--it's in its second year, that came back that got into good schools.  The Princeton Review tutorial helped improve their grades and over, in some cases 100 percent.

Speaker 1: And what other civic involvements have you had?
Speaker 2: I'm involved with the Uptown, or they call it the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, okay.  Of course in that involvement has been with the, the health fairs in the early days.  I'm involved with my Dental Association.  They have a program in Harlem called the "Ice Hockey Program.  It's a really--an after school program to encourage kids to stay in school and study.  And then we teach them how to play hockey.  Not we per se, the American Hockey League has taken up that aspect of it.  And they come in and teach them to play hockey.  Our involvement is that we fit the kids for mouth guards so that they can play safely without getting hurt.

Speaker 1: And do you have--so you're half in Westchester County [New York] and half in--now what is the history, you know is there--what is the African American community in Westchester County like?
Speaker 2: We're so spread out and diverse, okay.  And I guess there are several organizations like the Links who are trying to make it more cohesive.  It was surprising to me to know that even in this day and age, a number of other ethnic groups don't--still doesn't realize that we have a black middle class.  So our Westchester County chapter of Links, we have--we call a roundtable, is an involvement of other ethnic groups so that we can get to know one another, know of our history and also involvement.  It's hard to say.  We, we are so diverse.  From all the other little counties in Westchester County, we are spread out.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: But you--is your, your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gloria Altacracia Morales] is.
Speaker 1: She's still alive.  So she's been able to see your progress and growth, okay.
Speaker 2: She is so proud.  My mother still lives here in Harlem [New York].  She lives in Esplanade Garden [New York].  My patients can see her come in any day and bring me a little brownie bag.  Some days she'll come down, she's retired, she would bring me lunch.  Almost everyone that lives in her building knows that I'm a dentist.  I have a number of patients from there.  But she's also proud of my sister also.  I don't have any children; my sister has two children.  So she has her grandchildren from them.

Speaker 1: And you--when you look back at the, you know at Harlem [New York], you're--you know, what do you see in terms of this community that either you're excited or you know, or fear--you know or, or concerned about?
Speaker 2: I'm excited about the, the development. They call it the "New Harlem Renaissance."  There is so much going on in Harlem today, so much construction is being done.  There's so many different other ethnic groups are moving into the area because of that.  This is prime real estate right here.  From this area you can reach any part of New York City.  All of the highways will stop here at 135th Street.  All of the bus service.  And we have the New York Transit sta--service, everything stops here in Harlem.  So I'm excited about that.  A little concerned about the displacement of the older businesses that have been here all during the trenches.  We might call of them mom and pop stores, that are being forced out.  And because of that, you know Congressman Charles Rangel lives in this building.  And he was responsible to help influence the President Bill Clinton to come to this area.  He was also helpful in, in having Bill Clinton--I call it--they call it the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation, to start a small, small business initiative here in Harlem.  And with that initiative was designed to do is identify about--I think they chose like eight small businesses in Harlem, and to bring in technical support of those businesses.  To show them how to compete with the new Harlem that's being developed.  And our office was one of those businesses that were chosen.
Speaker 1: So, so what are--what are your plans then for your business under that program?
Speaker 2: To continue to grow.  Possibly open up another office.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And that--so what, what have you, what have you not done in your life that you would still like to do?
Speaker 2: Play the piano.  I've always had a desire to play the piano, but I've never had the time to sit down.  So I keep saying that when I retire there's two things I want to do.  Take piano lessons and go to a French culinary institute.

Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That she was a--not only a good dentist, but a great dentist and gave good service to the community.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: The quality of work that I've done.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: And what, what advice do you have for other, you know, couples who are working and you know, live, you know have--are married and yet working together?  What advice do you have?
Speaker 2: One, of course you have to set up goals.  And two most important, you have to have private time for yourself.  Somewhere along working together, you have to take time out.  You don't have to be there every day together; you have to have some private time for yourself.
Speaker 1: And any other advice along those lines?
Speaker 2: Make sure you're always the boss.  Don't say that, just teasing.
