Speaker 2: La Donna Tittle; capital L-a, capital D, o-n-n-a, capital T i-t-t-l-e.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Three thirteen, [3/13], which I'm on the eve of my birthday today, March 13th.  And it's Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been a disc jockey in Chicago for over thirty years.  And I also was a teacher.  And right now, I've been concentrating on my acting and filmmaking and theatre.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So, I'm actress and a total artist.
Speaker 1: And, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is March 12, 19... no, 2003.  (Laughter).  I almost gave the date of my birth...  Okay, never mind.

Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions we always ask.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they just require a brief and short succinct answer.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: And the first of these questions is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, I'm scared to tell you.  (Laughter).  Favorite food... I like pastas, I love frog legs... I like oysters, and occasionally some good old ribs and fried chicken... and some chitterlings, maybe.  But I guess my favorite, you know, it's hard to say what my favorite is.  I guess they're all my favorites.  I can eat just about anything.  Don't like Brussels sprouts, how about that?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: They're good.
Speaker 2: I can't stand Brussels sprouts.  But you know what, my mom always said, "Eat them, it's a green vegetable, they're good for you."  So, I have tasted them at least.  I still don't like them.  That's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Because... being in art, I like all colors.  And I guess my favorite colors are the colors of the rainbow.  I tend to like red, of course.  Blues are nice.  Yellows are great.  Greens are good, especially when they're in my pocket.  (Laughter).  And purple is always a nice color.
Speaker 1: So, you like color?
Speaker 2: I like colors.  I'm a colorful person.  Isn't that something?  Because I don't have on any color today, but I thought I'd just look simple and, you know, plain today.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer, summertime, my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I like going anyplace where it's warm.  I love the islands, I love Paris; I love Paris.  I love Amsterdam, I love Jamaica; yeah, I like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Um, let's see, a favorite phrase.  Well, let's see.  On the radio I used to do this thing where I'd say, "Bye," all the time or "Bye"; "Tittle in the middle" I guess is a famous phrase, a name that I got from being on the radio, being in the middle at, between 10 and 3 on 95-J, which was WJPC.  So, that's where the "Tittle in the middle" came from.  Let's see.  Yeah, that's about it, I guess.  You don't want to hear the other favorite phrases.  They are curse words.  (Laughter).  And I do have a favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright, I'll go past that one.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 81342
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell me something about your family history?  I mean not the whole family, but what do you know about the origin of your family?  Where did your family come from, and do you have any... are there any stories in your family from the nineteenth century, say, or way back?  Do you have any knowledge of what your ancestors were doing back during the times of slavery and before the Civil War, or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.  Isn't that terrible?  That's terrible.  I do have a book that I have not started reading.  It's about the Tittles.  And so, as far as I know, it's what my father [James Tittle] and my mother [Juanita Tittle] and my grandmother would tell me.  And I know on my grandmother's side, which is my mother's side--and by the way, I was named after my grandmother, both my grandmothers.  On my mother's side, my grandmother was named La Donna, and my father's grandmother was Theresa.  So I was named La Donna Theresa Tittle.  My father was from Kansas City... Topeka, Kansas.  My mother is from Chicago.  My [maternal] grandmother was adopted by a family in North Carolina, in Wilmington.  She is from Puerto Rico.  So, as far as I know, it all starts there with this family of teachers and educators and so forth.  So, she used to talk about Wilmington quite a bit, Wilmington, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: So, now this book you're talking... you're referring to, this is something that someone in your family produced?
Speaker 2: No, it's something that you send for, like when you want to know, you know, what the names of your--I guess you would call it your surnames... your Tittle... the Tittle family--where Tittle originated and so forth.  And I haven't gotten into the book, so I didn't do my homework yet.  But I do have it in my possession.  And I don't know if it's for real or it's, you know... but supposedly these... How do you send for this thing?  You know, somehow or ever I just came upon this book.  It's... it's more or less... yeah, people that have these subscriptions for when you want to find out your heritage and so forth, and you subscribe to it and they send you this book.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have to specify your nationality when you--
Speaker 2: No, it's just... the Tittles.
Speaker 1: Just the name.
Speaker 2: The name, Tittle.  So, I started reading some of it.  And I don't know if it's England...  Well, most of our names are from... you know, surnames and so forth.  But I haven't traced that part of my history back.  But I know it's something deep.  I know it's somewhere... you know, we're all like gathered from the same kind of origins and backgrounds.  And I'm sure if you go deep enough--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we all have a certain amount of ancestry.  We just don't know, we don't all know what it is.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know, and when you look at my whole family--when you look at my family you can see the diverseness with the skin colors and so forth.  But my father spoke Spanish very fluently; my [maternal] grandmother, too, at one time, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you have a Puerto Rican ancestry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said that you had like educators in the family, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My [maternal] grandmother was adopted by a family in Wilmington.  I said... what did I say, North Carolina?  Okay, I believe that's North Carolina, okay.  And that's basically where her roots came from.  And she came to Chicago and she met my grandfather, and then they got married and so forth and so on.  She had two children, my Aunt Marguerite and my mother, Juanita Tittle.  And my aunt has one child, Cousin Tony.  And my mother had five. So, it's five of us, I'm the oldest.  I have a brother named James, a sister named Donita, another sister named Iris, and a brother named Michael.
Story_ID: 81343
Speaker 1: Now, can you give me the name of your father and spell it for us, and then give us the date of his birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father's name is James Olden Tittle.  And he was born on Groundhog's Day, February 2nd, as far as I know, in Kansas City, Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his full name for us?  I mean it's for historical reasons, that's why we ask.
Speaker 2: James is J-A-M-E-S, Olden is O-L-D-E-N, Tittle, T-I-T-T-L-E.  My mother is Juanita Tittle, and--
Speaker 1: You said your father was born in--
Speaker 2: Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Topeka, and when?  Do you know exactly when?
Speaker 2: I have no idea what year he was born in.  I just remembered his birthday was February 2nd.  My mother was born in Chicago.  And she was Juanita, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, Tittle, T-I-T-T-L-E.  And she was born July 4th.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea what year?
Speaker 2: Well, she was 78 when she passed, and she passed away in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I would say 1923, somewhere in there.
Story_ID: 81344
Speaker 1: Alright, well, can you tell us something about your father [James Tittle]?  What was he like, and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father was a businessman.  He basically had a couple of pool halls along 47th Street, 47th and Forestville, I believe.  He was a strict disciplinarian, he was very strict about education.  We didn't have TV, so to speak.  You had to come in, you did your homework, and you did chores.  And I can remember having to clean up the kitchen.  And there was a certain way and a certain proper way you went about cleaning up the kitchen.  You know, you would do your dishes, you would do your glasses; you would do your pots and pans.  Then you would wipe off the refrigerator, the sink, the counter.  Then you'd sweep the floor, and then you'd mop the floor.  That was the way of doing the kitchen.  And you had to do that every night.  And besides that, you had your homework to do.  And he was the kind of person that, he was very skilled in games.  My whole family knows how to play chess... checkers.  This was something you had to learn.  We had to sit and do our multiplications all the time.
Story_ID: 81345
Speaker 1: I can remember going over to my grandfather's house, who was Daddy Wiley on the Northside.  Because I had family that lived on the Southside, Northside, and the Westside.  So, my exposure to Chicago was always all over.  It was never just about staying on one side of town.  And we would go over to my grandfather's house, which he would babysit for my mom [Juanita Tittle] and dad [James Tittle].  Because when they got married, my mother is the one that wanted children.  My dad didn't want kids.  So, I don't know whenever he wanted kids, but once he got them he was a pretty good dad.  We would go over there.  And my grandfather was a great Cubs fan.  He had to be the world's greatest Cubs fan.  All the kids loved him in the neighborhood.  He was a maintenance man; he took care of a building over there.  And whenever we would go over there and stay, it was so much fun.  Because not only would he take the neighborhood kids to the store and get them candy, but everybody went to the store and got candy.  And he would go and he would sit and watch his baseball game, and we would sit there and have to do our timetables, our multiplication tables.  I guess that's why I don't like baseball today.  I thought it was just the most boringest thing to watch.  We weren't supposed to be watching it, but when a grown parent is sitting there babysitting you, they have to keep their eyes right on the kids, right.  So naturally, us sitting on the couch, the eye was right on us.  So, we would do our multiplication problems.  So, that was great.
Story_ID: 81346
Speaker 1: My mother, she used to manage various places.  She was the manager of McKie's Barbershop for many years.  As you know, McKie Fitzhugh was on the radio station.  He was also a disc jockey with [W]VON along with Al Benson.  Now, mind you, I never knew at the time that I wanted to go into radio.  So, she would work there, she was the manager.  She would put the records in their proper styles.  And sometimes when the jocks were late getting to the window site to broadcast, she would jump in there and be on the air for them until they came in.  So, I watched that, you know, growing up.
Story_ID: 81347
Speaker 1: We always had, like I said, chores.  When you came home, there was always something that you had to do.  One time we came home early.  I went to Shakespeare [Elementary School] on 47th... 46th and Greenwood.   And one time we came home early and caught Mom [Juanita Tittle] and Dad [James Tittle] making love.  They took us out of grammar school and put us in St. Ambrose so we would be in school all day.  (Laughter).  So, that was kind of cute.  Yeah, so we were at St. Ambrose for a while.  And then I graduated really from Kozminksi Grammar School.  They thought my mind was a little bit too mature for my class, so they kicked me out of Catholic school and I went to grammar school (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 81348
Speaker 1: --Let me... you've gone a little fast past a lot of stuff, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I want you to kind of reflect back and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood you grew up in.  Now, where did you grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, basically along 47th Street, you know, 47th and Greenwood from the time that I can remember at Shakespeare [Elementary School].  But there was also a time before that where we would go to Michigan--Covert, Michigan.  And my brother and I, we stayed in this home of this lady who actually took care of kids.  And she was in Chicago.  As a matter of fact, she was around... I can't remember the street.  But I never will forget the fact that she took us to Emmett Till's funeral, you know.  And we had to go and see this funeral.
Speaker 1: It was over at Rayner's, wasn't it?  Or was it--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was on like about 43rd and State Street, or 44th and State Street; it was a church there.  And we didn't live too far from there, and I'm trying to think about where.  But I know we were in that area of 44th Street, 45th Street, from the time I can remember.  And we would go to Michigan because they had a home down there.  And she had a, she took care of about six kids.  And so, during the winter months for school we were at Covert, Michigan.  Kindergarten... and those were some of my favorite times of just being alive, those wonder years I should say.  So, we were back, you know, to the city and then back there for about, I guess during our kindergarten years.  First and second grade, I was here in Chicago at Shakespeare.  And from Shakespeare to St. Ambrose, that was 47th Street.  My [maternal] grandmother [La Donna Wiley] and my [maternal] grandfather [Daddy Wiley] had a building on 47th and Evans.  And from 47th and... from 46th and Greenwood we moved to 55th and Drexel.  Then from 55th and Drexel, where we used to walk to school every day--my father [James Tittle] was like... car fare, bus fare?  Unheard of.  "I had to walk to school, so you have to walk to school."  (Laughter).  So, some of the kids I see today, man, I'm like, "Boy, that wasn't us."  So, we walked to school from 55th to 47th Street, which was fun, because you kind of picked up along... the other kids walking to school.  So, we had to walk to school and walk back to school.  So, that whole area, I kind of grew up around that whole 47th Street area, which is now... what is it, Bronzeville now?  Gee whiz.
Speaker 1: They didn't call, you didn't call it Bronzeville then?
Speaker 2: No, Babe, it was just 47th Street.  (Laughter).  That's what it was, 47th Street.  Of course they had the nickname for those streets during those days, you know.  What is it, 47th Street, "Colored Folks' Heaven."  Forty-third Street, something else, you know... territory.  So--
Speaker 1: Four Trey.
Speaker 2: Four Trey, you know.  Thirty-Ninth Street was something like that.  But--.
Story_ID: 81349
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, 47th Street... and it was during its heyday, I guess you might say.  Because you had your Woolworth's... your Terry's.  You had the original Regal Theater, which I thought was the most beautifulest place in the world for entertainment.  And so, I thought it was so pretty that that was my first job.  I had to bump my age up, you know.  But I wanted to start working and earn my own money, you know.  And my father [James Tittle] didn't, didn't mind that, you know, as long as you came home and did your homework and did your school chores, and did what you were supposed to do.  And I think back on that, too, as I was pretty young to be going back and forth to 47th and King Drive.
Speaker 2: How young were you when--
Speaker 1: Gee whiz, I don't know.  I had to be somewhere in there.  I know I was probably not of age to work.
Speaker 2: But I had a job as a candy girl at the Regal Theater.  And my goodness, I must have started that job--
Speaker 1: Were you ten or eleven?
Speaker 2: Really, I was that young.  I was that young, I was a candy girl.  But I didn't look ten or eleven, I looked fourteen or fifteen, you know.  I mean I couldn't wait to wear Max Factor makeup... all that stuff.  And I was a candy girl.  I never will forget bringing some candy backstage for Stevie Wonder who was performing on stage at the time.  So, I was right in there, you know.  And I think it's either my mother [Juanita Tittle] or my god-sister used to come and pick me up from work, you know.  But I had a little job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So how long did you work at the Regal [Theater]?
Speaker 1: Well, gee whiz, I don't know.  I feel like I'm a hundred.  I feel like I've had every job there is in the world. (Laughter).  I must have worked at the Regal probably during... Gee whiz, I don't know, you know.  What seemed like a long time could have been maybe a matter of six or seven months or something.  But I know that I remember when Stevie Wonder was there.
Speaker 2: That's not, that's not... how long is not important, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But did you meet any other entertainers or anything?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I met the Blue Notes and--because you know, anytime somebody wanted something backstage, one of the entertainers, I guess we were like the runners, you know.   We had the popcorn, we had the candy, you know.  "Take Mr. so and so a couple of pops," you know, or something like that, and you went back there.  You know, it was just a different kind of world, you know.  You'd see the guys sitting around and sometimes you'd see somebody saying, "Oh, you can't have..."  I remember the guy telling Stevie [Wonder], "You can't eat that much candy.  You know, you shouldn't have that much candy."  He'd just be standing there looking, you know, a little blind boy on stage singing and everything.  You didn't know he was going to blow up to be so big.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stevie was still a kid then, right?
Speaker 1: He was very much a kid, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were both kids, let's put it like that.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Sure you were.
Speaker 1: We were both kids, yeah.  (Laughter).  Yeah, so that was pretty exciting.  But still not knowing that I would one day in the business of entertainment, but at the same time, can still understand it.  You know how one kind of flows in that direction.  So, I'm not surprised.
Story_ID: 81350
Speaker 1: Being, having access to entertainers--you know, behind the scenes--did that you give you a sense of confidence or, make you know, sense of being--of having knowledge other people didn't have about entertainers?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  At the time, like now, you know when people say, "Oh, yes, remember Al Benson," or, "Remember McKie Fitzhugh," or doing those days of [W]VON, The Good Guys.  Yes, all of those things come back as a reflection.  And, you know, "Wow, well, Gee whiz, McKie Fitzhugh lived right across the hall from us."  You know, at the time that we were growing up on 47th and Greenwood, he lived in the same building.  You have no idea how those things are going to play out in life in your later years.  But as far as radio went, getting a job in radio was not because of my mother [Juanita Tittle] or my father [James Tittle] you know, having the musical knowledge.  But the fact that they did have musical knowledge helps me today of what I used to hear in the house, what kind of music they listened to; they liked jazz.  My father played a horn, you know.  He played in a little old group, and he was also a manager of a couple of the hot places around 47th Street at the time.  You know, the Brass Rail, the Rhumboogie [Cafe], you know.  And I would hear my mother and him talk about places like that.  "Oh, ain't no more places like this, or "ain't no more places like that," just like we would talk about places that we went and hung out--you know, they're not there anymore.  They've been replaced by something else, or they haven't been replaced at all.
Story_ID: 81351
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about school.  Now, what kind of a little girl were you?  And what did you think about school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I went to everybody's school.  When I got in high school--because by that time, we had moved to 55th and Maryland.  And my father [James Tittle] and my mother [Juanita Tittle] had broken up then.  And when they separated, it was a little hard on her, because I had to, in a sense, just take over and just kind of help the family along.  And so, I went to Dunbar Vocational High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And once I got to Dunbar, we moved down to Robert Taylor [Homes] at the time, 45th and Federal.  And at the time, Robert Taylor was brand new, so it wasn't the condition that it was in, let's put it like that.  Because now in the year 2003, they have really wiped out Robert Taylor, which I got footage of all of that as it went down.  We stayed in Apartment 1308 at 4525 South Federal.
Speaker 1: It those days, it was considered upscale; I mean better housing than--
Speaker 2: Of course.  I could stand there and actually look from the 13th floor all the way to 47th Street and Lake Shore Drive.  And the thing of it is, other than it being a high rise--nice... heat good, hot water good, no problems at all.  Towards the end of the sixties, like about '67' [1967], that's when things started changing.  And I'd say by seventy... maybe even as late as '78' [1978] or so, they were like all the way gone, you know, that way.  Um--
Speaker 1: People have written books about the deterioration of Robert Taylor Homes.
Speaker 2: The deterioration was awesome.
Speaker 1: And the political corruption that led to it, and the, I mean federal funds being diverted to other things other than the upkeep of the building and all that.  But did you all have a sense at the time when you were in it, that this was--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely not.  You know, one of the greatest and most fun times living in Robert Taylor was the sense of community.  You had all your friends in one building; you could go visit.  You didn't have to worry about walking out in the street at night, getting hit in the head.  You could go up the elevator, up the steps, down the steps, without having your mother wonder where you are.  If you did something wrong, somebody else's parents would tell your parents, you know, if something was wrong.  And Halloween, Halloween was the best time.  Because you had--there are sixteen apartments on one floor, and you have sixteen floors.  So, multiply that with the candy you pick up for Halloween is tremendous.  We would be sick as dogs, because we'd eat candy for two weeks.  You didn't have people checking your apples to see if razor blades was in it.  You didn't have people checking your candy, or your parents checking your (unclear). In this case, my mom, a single mom--you didn't have people that said you can't eat this unless I check it out first.  It just seems like towards--well, I moved into my own place, which I worked very hard to get.  Because by the time I got to be a senior I had one class, and that was shop, and which I went to work.  I was working as a legal secretary at the time, because that was my major, business.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I don't want to take you too far past--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --high school.  But--
Speaker 2: But I went to everybody's summer school, everybody.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to--
Story_ID: 81352
Speaker 1: Now. Oh, just more thing about Robert Taylor [Homes].  Now, I heard... I also heard that, just from talking to people in Chicago, that there were a lot of recreational things in Robert Taylor Homes.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And people would come from other neighborhoods just to take advantage of the recreational facilities there.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you.  Furman House was where I got turned on to acting.  That's where I met at the time Harold Johnson, who was is now Okoro Harold Johnson [HM], and Joan Brown, who is now Abena Joan Brown [HM].  I met them during...  It just so happens that one of the teachers, instructors, had taken off, she was ill.  And Okoro came in, because they worked with the Park District.  And they did the acting, the drama class there.  Now, I was, I'm very athletic, I like volleyball.  I mean even today, I rollerblade, I love my rollerblades.  I, I, do all of that.  And so, then Okoro came in.  We did a drama class, and we read "Dial M for Murder."  And that just turned my life on.  From then on I wanted to do theater.  That's just how it happened.  Not still thinking about radio; I haven't even crossed that bridge yet.  It's like acting, this is where I want to go.
Story_ID: 80205
Speaker 1: What grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Grade school, okay, there was the school up in Colvert [Michigan] I told you... kindergarten.  And then Shakespeare [Elementary School], and then St. Ambrose... Kozminski [Community Elementary School].  And then from Kozminski to Dunbar Vocational High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Dunbar Vocational High School... I went to everybody's summer school.  So, some people think I graduated from Parker, Hyde Park [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  What other summer school?  It's one in between, Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, they were all in my area... and DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So, they were in all my area, but I wanted to go to Dunbar.  For some odd reason, I wanted to go to Dunbar Vocational.  Because most of the kids that graduated from Kozminski either went to Hyde Park... because Kozminski was on what, 53rd and Ingleside.  Or, they went to Phillips or DuSable.  I wanted to go Dunbar.  I wanted to go to a vocational high school because I wanted to be... well basically, you know, your parents tell you, "Get a good education and be a teacher."  So, that's what I wanted to be, a teacher.
Story_ID: 80206
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any role models as teachers?  I know you mentioned Abena Joan Brown [HM] and Okoro [Harold Johnson, HM] at the rec center, I mean at the center.  But what about the--
Speaker 2: Well, my [maternal] grandmother [La Donna Wiley]... my grandmother coming from a background of teachers in Wilmington [North Carolina]... and educators.  Because she would always make a point to let me... one of her sisters, you know, her adopted sisters, was in education.  My grandmother was in more or less entertainment.  She was one of the dancers with the Ziegfeld girls at the Blackstone [Theatre].  I can remember going to see her, and sitting in the balcony.
Speaker 1: She was in the Ziegfeld Follies?
Speaker 2: The [Ziegfeld] Follies thing, yeah, that used to come, that would be dancing in Chicago.
Speaker 1: I didn't know they had black people in--
Speaker 2: She looked white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She looked--
Speaker 1: They didn't know she was--
Speaker 2: They didn't know she was black.
Speaker 1: But you had to go up to the balcony.
Speaker 2: We had to sit with Aunt Fannie.  Aunt Fannie was her best friend, and she was a, Aunt Fannie was the color of our clothes, my dress.  She was a very dark- complected lady.  And my grandmother also worked in the homes and took care of kids, too.  She was a domestic when she wasn't entertaining, you know, dancing.  So, she was into dancing for a little bit of theater there.  So, I don't know, maybe all of that came into play.  When you think about what you're doing now, as to--um, well, you know, remember seeing those kind of things growing up--you know, entertainment, entertainers, the arts, you know.

Speaker 1: When I met... first I met Okoro [Harold Johnson, HM].  And then we were--well, you know, they'd compliment you on your reading, because our reading skills...  My reading skills were good, because of the background with my father [James Tittle], who was just a strict disciplinarian; you just had to do your homework.  So, that was engrained in us, you know, up to... up to the time I started going to high school--you always did your homework.  It was always about education, and you just didn't get away with bad grades.  There was never bad grades, you'd get a whipping.  You'd get a whipping, you'd get a whipping.  You bring a bad report card in, it's "Oops, upside your head."  (Laughter).  If you didn't clean a spot in the house right, didn't sweep it up right--you'd get a whipping, period.  Well, I stopped getting a lot of whippings because I would do my stuff right, and do my chores right.  Because whippings hurt; you didn't want to get a whipping from Daddy.  You'd rather Mother [Juanita Tittle] give you a whipping, but not Dad.  And she wouldn't whip you.  She was like, would throw a shoe at you or something like that "Get out of the way."  She had those throwing habits, you know.  But that's basically the way we were brought up.  So, when I went to high school [Dunbar Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], I was just into that mode.  Because coming out of grammar school, it was like when you came home you did your chores; you did your homework, or either you went to dance class, music classes... piano classes.  I had ballet classes, I had dancing classes.  Maybe this was the way to keep the kids out the way for a minute.  But by seven o'clock when you got home, or six o'clock, you were tired; you were ready to go do bed.  It was no problem with me going to bed.  You know how some kids get up, can't go to sleep, "Well, I don't want to go to bed."  Not in my house.  There was a time for this, and a time for that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so a lot of discipline.
Speaker 1: A lot of discipline, yeah. So, the importance of education was profound.  The fact that I did go on to teach at Parker High School [Chicago, Illinois]... because after graduating from Dunbar Vocational High School [Chicago, Illinois], I went right on to Loop Junior College [currently Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois], and then from Loop Junior College to Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois]--
Story_ID: 80208
Speaker 1: Now, just before we get all the way out of school, I want to ask you one thing.
Speaker 2: I was still working though.
Speaker 1: About your childhood... you mentioned earlier that your... I think it was your aunt that took you all to see the funeral of Emmett Till?
Speaker 2: No, this was the lady--
Speaker 1: The lady that babysat you, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that baby-sat.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about that, because that, that funeral and the picture of Emmett Till in Jet Magazine--
Speaker 2: And the glass coffin.
Speaker 1: --of changed the lives of black people all... and other people, too, all over the country when they saw that.  And you were there, so I just wanted to ask you what impression it made on you at the time.
Speaker 2: It scared me to death, it really scared me.  I can remember Aunt Fannie and Miss Glenn, that's what we would call them, it was Aunt Fannie and Miss Glenn.  Aunt Fannie was this big, black lady.  And she, oh yeah, she was a really nice lady.  I said if I ever had kids, I would want them to take care of my kids, you know.  But they're probably all dead now.  But Aunt Fannie and Miss Glenn were just two of the nicest little ladies, you know.  And they would make sure we were well taken care of, and just took care of us, you know.  When my mother would drop us off there, no problems; we would stay there the week.  Because we would go to school somewhere close there where were going to school at.  And when we got old enough, you know, we were at home, and we were going to Shakespeare [Elementary School], and then finally to St. Ambrose.  But at the time... so we had to be--
Speaker 1: I mean but, but--
Speaker 2: So it had to be in my kindergarten, first grade years that we went to see Emmett Till.  So, what is a kid about that age?  About five or six?
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea of what you were going to see when you went there?  Did they tell you--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what you were going to see?
Speaker 2: I remember sitting on the porch and, you know, getting our hair combed.  Because they would sit you in the middle of their lap and put that growing grease in your hair, and be braiding that... be braiding that hair.  And yeah, they called it growing grease. (Laughter).  And they were getting us ready to go to a funeral.  And when you say funeral to a kid, it was like we were...  Well, it was church, because we did go to church every Sunday.  We went to church down in Colvert, Michigan, too, to a sanctified church.  Because we used to get up and try to shout like everybody else, you know.  And it's like if you're shouting, if somebody touches you, you're supposed to shout too, get the spirit.  (Laughter).  So, when we went to this church to see Emmett Till, it was like this huge crowd of people out front.  And just, the church was just packed.  And it was a big church; and I can't think of the church, but I'm pretty sure either it was on 45th or 46th and State Street; I don't know why that area.  Because remember that railroad track that used to cross like on State Street?  It was either 45th Street before you, right before you got to 43rd Street, where this funeral was, you know.  That would probably take a little research, because it was in Jet Magazine, that's the truth.  So, you know that Jet Magazine was in existence then.  And just chronicling this, the image...  Well, we had to walk... because you know people would walk past the casket to look.  And that was the first time I'd ever seen anybody in a glass casket, because it was a glass over his casket.  And his face was disfigured, and it was scary.  I just remember it just frightening me to death.  And there was like... from that point on, I guess I thought all white folks were detectives or FBI agents.
Story_ID: 80209
Speaker 1: It was, it, it... I don't know.  It's not that you come to think of white people as being bad, because there were white people that I went to school with at St. Ambrose.  Every school I went to, there was white people.  Now, once I got to high school at Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], you didn't see as many whites.  In fact, none.
Speaker 2: You didn't see any at Dunbar.
Speaker 1: You didn't see any, really.  I mean you saw different hues of black folks.  But per se, Caucasian people--and of course you had Caucasian teachers.  But white students didn't exist.  Hyde Park, when I went to summer school at Hyde Park [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], they did exist; they did have white folks there.  And DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], no.  Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School], no.  And well, I said, Hyde Park.  DuSable... didn't see any white children there. St. Ambrose, we had a mixture of German, white, Jewish.  Because on one side of 47th Street was one type of housing.  On the other side of 47th Street, south, is the mansions.  So you had doctors, lawyers, educators, and so forth living in these huge mansions at the time.
Story_ID: 80210
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Did people try to explain to you all what happened to him [Emmett Till], and why it happened?
Speaker 1: Well, the story--
Speaker 2: Was it tied into the Civil Rights Movement, I mean was it tied in like... abouth black people?
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?  The Civil Rights Movement hadn't really taken off then.  The Civil Rights Movement kind of happened when I was like when I was in high school, '60' [1960] to '64' [1964] at Dunbar.  Because I would, I can remember the day that Kennedy got shot.  I mean it was like I was a junior.  You know, we had school.  All of a sudden you're going home.  I remember when Martin Luther King [Jr.] got killed, you know, I remember that.  Emmett Till, it was--
Speaker 2: That was a year before the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know that Martin Luther King had come here to march on the Westside to show that there were, there was discrimination in housing.  And it was like, I didn't know what it was, I really didn't.  The black history that I had to read, it wasn't assigned to you at Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois].  You had to read it on your own.  So I became very militant in that movement, a rebel so to speak.  I had an Afro bigger than Chaka Khan and Angela Davis [HM] put together, you know, during those days.
Story_ID: 80211
Speaker 1: Now in this... okay, so at Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], at Dunbar you were... this is an all-black school basically.
Speaker 2: Basically.
Speaker 1: It's, yeah, named after Paul Laurence Dunbar.  It's curious that it's a vocational school named after a poet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  A writer, literature, isn't that something.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they really... in school, they didn't press those kind of things, even though the arts are very important in school.  And the more I see them try to take away that writing... artistic... music... you know, it's just horrible.  Yes, reading, writing and arithmetic as it was called then.  Now it's reading, writing, arithmetic and computer.  That's important, too, but at the same time, the arts are important also.
Speaker 1: Now when you were in school, what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Well, my subject basically was business.  I wanted to be a secretary.  I wanted to be a legal secretary, that's what I wanted to be... and besides being a teacher.  So, I started doing legal secretarial work.  With the first company, it was an insurance company that I worked for.  And they had Dictaphones then, where they would talk into a Dictaphone and you would transcribe what the executives were saying.  And of course, you would always get those ones with cigars in their mouths, you know.  "Well, Dear Mr. so and so."   So, that was a good job, you know, at the time.  So, I worked there for a while and then I went over to the Civic Center, and all while I was going to school.  I always worked going to school at the same time.
Story_ID: 80212
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Chicago State?
Speaker 2: Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois], that's where I graduated from, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And with a degree, a bachelor's degree in art education and high school secondary education.
Speaker 1: Now, were there some, any teachers at Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] or at Chicago State that stand out as teachers that were really interested in your development, and tried to help you, or that you admired?
Speaker 2: All through my school year I admired my high school teachers, Miss Dawson, Miss Smith... Miss Tabron.  Miss Tabron was very influential.  She was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: T-A-B-R-O-N.  We called her Tabbie for short.  (Laughter).  You know every teacher...  Miss Deal, Miss Deal was our Business Ed [education] teacher.  Also, she taught the secretarial typing and shorthand.  Mr. Abbott, who is still there.  I work with Mr. Abbott on the alumni now.  They have the Hall of Fame at Dunbar.  So, I'm in the Hall of Fame.  They inducted me into the Hall of Fame.
Story_ID: 80213
Speaker 1: I do a lot of mentoring there.  So, you know, going and taking it back--you know, to take it back and deal with the past as well as the present, and try to influence other people to do, to follow their dreams and to do what they want to do, as long as it's a good thing, of course, educational wise; and to try to give some guidance to kids who are looking to get into the communications field, or radio and so forth.  Because everybody wants to be a jock on the air, and sometimes you can't be that.  Sometimes it may take you in another direction.  So I try to make them know that, you know, there are sales; there's being a general manager; there's, you know, all kinds of other things to do besides that--just in case you can't make it to being on the air, so that you don't get stifled and say, "Oh, I'm not going to do this."  Some kind of way you can fit into this entertainment business some kind of way.  Or, grow up to be a good interviewer like yourself.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: There you go.
Story_ID: 80214
Speaker 1: So but, okay, when you were at Dunbar [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you participate in a lot of extra-curricular activities?
Speaker 2: Yes Sir, anything I could get extra credit for.  I just wanted to hurry up and get out of high school and start working.  And isn't that something?  I was kind of in a rush to live.  But I did want my own place, my own apartment and so forth.  I didn't always want to stay in the projects, because eventually you could see where--
Speaker 1: It wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I mean we didn't always live in the projects.  This is something we moved into because of, well, they used to call it urban removal instead of urban renewal.  So, when they tore down all of 55th Street to make room for the University of Chicago, it was like that whole area was going--gone.  Now, people who had homes, like brownstones and, you know, along that street from 55th going north to 47th Street, that's a pretty stable neighborhood.  And most of those buildings are still there.  They didn't knock down too many buildings, just all of basically the south side of 55th Street.  So, yeah, well, they did knock down quite a few places.  Let me just think.  Because we had shows along 55th Street, the Frolic Theater. So, yeah.  Now, where we lived, is a big track, field and track.
Speaker 1: Stagg Field.
Speaker 2: Stagg Field, right, 55th and Cottage Grove.
Story_ID: 80215
Speaker 1: So, yeah, when I...  I couldn't wait to get out of high school [Dunbar Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois] and start my job and so forth.  Which... I worked at Liberty Mutual; that was the first one, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, yeah.  So, I worked there for a good while, and then went on to be--
Speaker 2: And you say you became more politically aware during this time?
Speaker 1: Oh, for sure.  You know, politically awareness came, I guess really with my last two years in high school.  Sixty-Three [1963], '64' '1964', those were turbulent years, so to speak.  So, you knew you wanted to be something, you knew you had to be black and proud.  And you know, there was a whole kinda 'nuther thought going on, besides what's going on today.  I, I mean it's still going on.  But sometimes it's, I don't know, even know how to explain it, you know, what's happening.  Some people just don't care about what's going on, or they don't see where they have to take things to get things done, or how serious they have to be as far as being who they are and keeping our history alive, our rituals alive, our educational values alive, our family values alive, disciplines on being educated and not getting caught up into the system, as we so well can do.  So, all of those things are important.
Story_ID: 80216
Speaker 1: Okay now who were some of your favorite instructors at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  There was Dennis Nordin, who is now a writer of books.  He is now with the, Mississippi State [University, Starkville, University].  And he was a white teacher by the way.  He was very nice.  This, this teacher knew more about black history than black people.  So, he was an instant hit at Chicago State University.  As a matter of fact, it was like--you know, at the time everybody was saying "Yes, we want black history classes, we want black history classes."  And once they started instituting some of those classes, nobody was taking black history.  Most of the people that were taking black history were white people which, you know, is great because they're learning another culture.  But he was one of the professors that taught black history.  So, he was an instant success there.  And let's see, who were my college teachers?  It's a funny thing.  My mother [Juanita Tittle] used to tell me, "No matter what, you'll remember your high school days." College, you remember some things.  But high school... and I guess it was because I couldn't, I didn't have enough money to go away to college.  So, most of my college was right here.  So, besides Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], I went to the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]; I got seven hours towards my master's.  And also, I would study on Northwestern's [University, Evanston, Illinois] campus, because they had this nice, plush library on the lake.  So, I would go up there and study.  And to--you know, the library at Chicago State--at the time that it was on 67th and Stewart... 69th and Stewart--it was very small, very limited, you know.  So, I was like, I just would go where I could know where books are, and to the library, of course, you know.  See, you have to sort of seek out things.  Some things just don't come right to you.  So, you have to seek them out if you're planning on doing whatever, or being knowledgeable about your own history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're working and going to school at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] at the same time?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And were you still majoring in business?
Speaker 2: Yes, at the same...  When I was going to Chicago State, though, I majored in drama, journalism, and basically art.  That was my primary, art.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 80217
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, were you in any plays at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do any plays.  Isn't that something?  But you know what I started doing?  Professional modeling.  So, I would have, I would have to like get my classes coordinated, because I started traveling back and forth to New York.  I was doing market, what they call market.  That's when you go in about four times a year and you worked for, like, Gossard, lingerie companies, you know.  And they would have these marketing shows three times a day, so people would come in and buy merchandise, you know, for their store.  You'd model.  They had like three or four shows a day.  That was fun, because you get a chance to go around to some of the other houses, the designer houses, and you could get clothes cheap and so forth.
Story_ID: 80218
Speaker 1: So, I really enjoyed traveling at the time.
Speaker 2: Had you had any training as a model beforehand?  How did that happen?  How did you end up--
Speaker 1: Well, I was living in Robert Taylor [Homes] at the time.  And I was, I had just graduated from Dunbar Vocational [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and was just moving.  I was going to Loop Junior College [currently Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois].  And I met a young man and we got married.  And while I was getting the apartment straight, he went to Vietnam at the time.  And while I was getting our apartment straight, he got killed in the service.  He got killed in a car accident, believe it or not, in Fort Hood, Texas.  This was Ronald, his name was Ronald Horton.  And so, after that I met another young man, and we were together for quite a few years.  So, during that time I got my own place.  My first place was on 72nd, right off Jeffrey, my first little five room apartment.  I was really happy and going to Chicago State.  And, you know, just like anybody who starts working... and they get their car and, you know, this is what life is about.  You know, you get your own stuff, your own little place, and your own things.  So, I felt real good about that.  So, after Chicago State, I...  Well, that's when I really got into, I was doing a lot of traveling, still held my classes down.  And got my degree.  So, I started doing film.  I got my first TV commercial for Purex Bleach, did photo bookings, did voice-overs, you know, basically what I'm still doing right today.  So, I found out that was a good little ting to have, because when you start working in radio--and it's such a routine--every day, every day, five days a week.  And while you're going, you know, up and down in this business, you know, and so forth--that to me was, is still a good little background to have, with the film, the theater; because I enjoyed doing it all.  I just really enjoy doing it all.  I enjoy being a total artist.
Story_ID: 80219
Speaker 1: I guess what I was asking is... how did you... did somebody approach you about being a model?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, yeah.  Not really being a model, it's really with radio.  I don't even know how I got started in that.  I think all of that came out of the center, the Robert Taylor Center.  You know, when you...  because when you go there, you are surrounded by people telling you different things that you should do--or you can do this, and somebody gives you... says, "Oh, you need to go down to Shirley Hamilton's and register."  And at the time, and she still is, one of the main talent agencies in Chicago.  So, that's how I got started.
Speaker 1: Did you have a like a--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --photo taken?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you have a photo--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get you to describe the process, so people can--
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  You have the... you, you, you have a photographer do some photographs of you.  And you take those photographs to the agency.  And they'll pick out what they think you look best at.  And they'll say, "Okay, you should have this blown up."  So, basically then you had a photograph... well, a lot of different photographs.  You may want to show yourself eating some cereals, or holding a cereal box, or hugging a kid, or putting some clothes on a kid--just a photo that will show you in a different light, with your picture, black and white picture.  And you submit that, and they submit it to various people for jobs.  So, that client will pick your picture, and they'll say "Okay, we want La Donna Tittle."  And the agency will call you and say, "You've got a photo booking."  And back then, being on time was important.  At the time that I started there was a group of black ladies who had boycotted the agencies, because they weren't hiring blacks.  So, you went through those kinds of changes, too.  And I felt so in the middle, because here I am just starting, and I'm just jumping into a fight.  (Laughter).  It was like, oh, my God.  But that was the times, you know, where people had to fight to get hired.  And I used to make up really dark, so I would look darker, you know, when it came to photo prints or something, to get the job.  And so, you know, you go through that phase--or the industry goes through that phase.  And they still go through that phase, they really do, believe it or not.  Not too much has changed.  You know, more blacks are getting more work, true, but it could be a lot better.
Story_ID: 80220
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you finished Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And you know, what were you thinking when you... you were already working someplace, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was traveling quite a bit, still doing jobs in New York.  I was traveling to Florida, and I was working with this one company called Gossard.  And they do girdles, bras, lingerie, and so forth.  So, it was keeping me pretty busy.  And then I started doing a lot of theater; I started doing more theater.  I really got back into theater in '83' [1983], really seriously.  That's when I did "Change is Going to Come" with ETA.  At the time when I met Abena [Joan Brown, HM] and Okoro [Harold Johnson, HM], ETA [Creative Arts Foundation] was a dream; they always wanted to get a theater going.  And then it went from the Furman House, which that was called at Robert Taylor [Homes], down to Stateway Gardens.  And that's where I met Oscar Brown, Jr. [HM] and Phil Cohran [HM], and basically got my little acting on, and music and so forth.
Speaker 1: Were you part of the Afro Arts Theater group and all that?  And did, or did you ever do down there for shows and performances when Phil was doing that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure, oh, yeah.  He did a lot of stuff at the ETA, really.  He did a lot of stuff with Abena at ETA--music teaching and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about the beach at 63rd Street.  Did you go--
Speaker 2: Oh, we wore that beach out.  The Congo playing, oh yeah, they'd be playing those Congos.  We'd be out there on the 63rd Street Beach... nothing like it is now.  I don't know if that's a good thing, because it was so much fun.  You know, you could just play your instruments.  Because I started playing the harmonica, you know.  I mean you could just get your stuff and just chime in.  We would stay out there, yeah, late.  We got plenty of whippings for getting in late, hanging around that beach.
Speaker 1: It seems people would just bring their drums or whatever they had--
Speaker 2: Bring their drums, whatever they had, any night, seven days a night.  You know, the hotter the better.  When the sun set in front of 63rd Street Beach, you'd get people just starting to play.  It would be a big old circle around there with the gathering.  I never had fights; I never seen any fights, you know.  We'd hang out on the beach.  The police would come and kick you out at eleven, and we'd be right--
Story_ID: 80221
Speaker 1: Let's see, where did we leave off at?
Speaker 2: Alright, we were--I need to ask you about how you got involved in radio?  Now, you were modeling (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was modeling.  And I just happened to go up to my agency one day, which was Shirley Hamilton.  They were in the Stone Container Building, right there at Wacker Drive and Michigan.  And I was waiting on the elevator, and I saw these two little odd men standing there.  And they came up to me and they complimented me on my looks and asked me, they were curious as to what I did.  And I told them that I was a professional model, because back then that was the word then.  It wasn't an actress or whatever--it was professional model.  And I told them that I'd just completed a course, just graduated from Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois], that I was going to the Art Institute to get my master's in art, and--I had just gotten my certificate from Midwestern Broadcasting School [Chicago, Illinois].  So, they said, "Hm, would you like to be on radio?"  And I'm like, "Well, I don't know."  You know (laughter), right then it's like traveling and modeling was the thing.  I was in Mannequin Guild; we did all of the top fashion shows, Marshall Field's, the Ambassador Hotel, you know.  Then, runway modeling was really big.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it is now, too.
Speaker 1: Well, it still is, I should say.
Speaker 2: People are, you know--
Speaker 1: It's still is.  I've just moved on to other things, you know.  But, yeah, doing the automobile show, narrating and so forth.  But those, it was just bigger, seemed like, you know.  So, they said, "Well, this is what you do, we have a radio station upstairs, WBEE."  Marty Faye was on at the time, Merri Dee [HM] was on.  And they said, "If you can find your way out to Harvey, Illinois, you can come out there and start doing some of our public service announcements."  I'm like, "Okay."  Well, I didn't exactly jump right on it at the time.  It wasn't until I was on an audition, a voice-over audition, and I met Merri Dee [HM], and she said she had worked at [W]BEE.  And I said, "Oh, the general manager was saying, you know, if I could find my way out there, I could do, you know some voice-overs for public service announcements."  So, she showed me the way, how to get out there, because she worked out at that site.  There was a broadcast site at seventy- at 75 East Wacker Drive.  Marty Faye was at that site, but the all the other jocks were out at the site in Harvey, Illinois, Markham so to speak, which was at 159th Street, right off the expressway.  So, I went out there, I started doing public service announcements, started learning the board and everything.  And I was in my last semester at Chicago State University.  Well, by this time I had been working and going to college for like, now going on seven years.  And my boyfriend used to tease me, "Are you going to become a professional student?"  Well, I didn't mind, you know.  I'm the kind of person, I like school.  I enjoyed it; I enjoyed the atmosphere.  It was like that's where all your friends were, you know.  I just always liked--isn't that something?  It's probably really geeky, but I like school.  So, I'm like, the teacher tells me, she says, "You know, you only got a couple more credits and you can graduate."  I'm like, "Really, I'm ready to graduate?"  I couldn't believe it.  So, that's when I got my degree.  And the semester before I got my degree, Lawton Wilkerson, who was the program director at BEE, offered me a job.  And I turned it down, because I wanted to get my degree.  And after I graduated in January of '71 [1971], the spot came up again, and I took it.  I took it, that's when I started on radio.  Yeah, I took that job, and it just started--and the rest is history--
Story_ID: 80222
Speaker 1: --what job did you have in the beginning?  Did they give you--?
Speaker 2: I was on the air from 1 to 2, playing jazz.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [W]BEE is primarily a jazz--
Speaker 2: A jazz station.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And it still is, 1570.
Speaker 1: AM right?  AM jazz station?
Speaker 2: AM jazz station.  And AM was quite big back then, you know.  FM started kind of slipping through, I would say my [W]BMX days.  You know, [W]SDM, the station with all the girls.  Remember Leonard Chess with SDM, [W]VON.  And another station that was in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And I did a super big ad for them long before I'd gotten hired as a radio disc jockey.  So, that just shows you how the mediums cross each other.  You know, ads, radio, TV--you know, voice-over, all of these things are interchangeable, you know.  So, that's the beginning.  I guess, you know, my eyes were wide open to that.  So, you know, it's like you want to do it all, you know, everything.  So, I had that kind of energy, and still do have that kind of energy.  Because I enjoy what I do, I really do.  Now that I've learned what I'm doing, I'm still, there's still nuances to what you're doing.  Now, things are cable radio, web satellite radio and stuff.  So, I do a web satellite radio show now.  So, I mean they just evolved, you know.  When they say the global... we're closer than we are... we are, we really are.  Through technology, we are.
Story_ID: 80223
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, you were at [W]BEE?
Speaker 1: BEE.
Speaker 2: For how long?
Speaker 1: Let's see, I was at BEE when I started there in '71' [1971], because... right out of college.  I did take the job, and I stayed there for a couple of years.  Then I went to--from WBEE I went to [W]BMX.  That's when it was Golden Oldies, and they turned into BMX, the Black Music Experience.  And I was at BMX, and it was automated.
Speaker 2: Well, BMX, was it 103 point something?  Or was it, what was it?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It's the same dial... now its V-103 today.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, it's--
Speaker 1: The same letters.
Speaker 2: 102.7.
Speaker 1: Exactly, 102.7.  And it's still Oak Park, Chicago, believe it or not.
Speaker 2: They're operated out of Oak Park Arms Hotel, right, in Oak Park?
Speaker 1: Oak Park Arms Hotel.  But the thing of it is, is that you get your license...  Most licenses for radio is public service.  It's incidental that they play music and entertain.  But now, naturally, that's the big revenue--music.  The FCC [Federal Communications Commission] has relaxed a lot of their rules on ownership of radios.  So, basically most radio stations are public service first.
Speaker 2: They're supposed to be.
Speaker 1: They're supposed to be.
Speaker 2: That's how they get a license.
Speaker 1: That's how they get their license.
Speaker 2: Public airways.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  So, stations who have their license under that domain keep their license for that.  Of course, now you have more stations who are union, because they talent doing the radio shows.  So that brings in another element of trying to get paid for your services as a talent.
Story_ID: 80224
Speaker 1: So, coming from [W]BEE to [W]BMX, which was an automated station--and then [W]VON was a big part of radio in Chicago, The Good Guys, playing 45's and the hits.  That was a big part.  And so, BMX came into playing album sides, and they were FM, because it was the new wave.  I mean, little did I know that it was going to be such an impact in radio.  Little did I know that La Donna Tittle would have an impact on radio, in this genre.  Because when I started... really, when I went over there, it was a rough start.  Because men somehow were not, not really--other than [W]SDM with all the girls--and then of course, you know, Yvonne Daniels, the great Yvonne Daniels was there.  And then Bernadine C. Washington at VON--women had a rough time in radio, having their own show, and especially on radio with other guys.  So, you had a little sanctuary where it was all women.  And then you had your general manager, Bernadine C. Washington.  And then of course, you heard about other women in other places--like I've heard about the Vivians... I think her name was Vivian Carter in Detroit.  She was a hot jock.  So you know, my name was, you know, emerging up there.  And it was a good time, you know, it was just a good time--
Story_ID: 80225
Speaker 1: So you came along at the time of the ascendency of FM, the FM urban station--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with--
Speaker 1: --that now dominates a lot of the air waves around, in the big cities.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And the demise of the AM music stations.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, you know, most cars were equipped with AM.  You know, it was a, it was the thing to have.  And an AM and FM radio was like hot stuff.  And then you had your high-brow FM listeners, you know, your jazz and very sophisticated--
Speaker 1: And classical--
Speaker 2: Classical, you know.  And people were like, well, they were FM'ers, you know.  And that was that.  So, for an FM station to come on the airwaves playing R and B [rhythm and blues] music was a hot ticket.  And then Golden Oldies, we replaced Golden Oldies, because it was WGLD.  And there was of course white Golden Oldies, you know.  And so, it turned all black overnight.
Story_ID: 80226
Speaker 1: And when I saw this happen, next thing you know, they were hiring people at [W]BMX.  It's like, it was owned by Egmont Sonderling.  He came in one day, told the staff--
Speaker 2: What's his name, I'm sorry
Speaker 1: Egmont Sonderling.
Speaker 2: Egmont?
Speaker 1: Egmont.
Speaker 2: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: E-G-G-M-O-N-T [sic], Sonderling.
Speaker 2: S...
Speaker 1: S-O-N-D-E-R-L-I-N-G.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a white guy?
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: Okay. Egmont Sonderling.
Speaker 1: Old white guy with a lot of money, (Laughter), Egmont Sonderling.  And he owned WGLD.  And he owned a couple of radio stations.  Well, I guess after making all his money off of these stations, once they started going union, where you had to pay talent...  See, talent, somehow or ever I guess wasn't supposed to exist or something.  Even though talent was in radio... you had big talent.  You had your Marty Fayes, your Howards.  What's the guy who used to sell the vacuum cleaners and stuff?  You had your, your E. Rodney Jones, your Herb Kents [HM] and your Pervis Spanns [HM].  These were big guys in radio at the time.  So--
Speaker 2: So, they were starting to join, what is it, AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists], the--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the thing of it is that when radio, when these radio stations wanted to become union, all of a sudden there was like a big to do.  It was a big to do, because it was about paying talent.  Now, it's not about so much overhead.  You know, stations make their money off commercials.  Salesmen get paid big fees for bringing in clients to do commercials on radio stations.  Well, they don't think about paying talent, the people who make these stations happen.  So, you know, that's beginning to take effect.  So people are really sort of seeing like, they're not making as much as they should.  So, the whole face of radio started changing--more personality oriented driven radio.  Well, [W]BMX at the time was trying to introduce automated radio so they wouldn't have to pay talent.  Because of all a sudden, these stations now are looking at the union to come in to make them get paid right.  So, that changed a whole lot in radio.  It changed a whole lot of thinking, the way records were played--you know, that was a big part of it.  They had a big stink and things going on with Plug-ola and Payola, and all of that stuff happening with radio.  So, it was very interesting times at the time--
Story_ID: 80227
Speaker 1: But basically, my growing up-in, so to speak, happened with just coming through that chain of [W]BEE Jazz, and to [W]BMX, and then [W]JPC.  I really blew up with JPC, blew... really blew up, with "The Tittle in the Middle, Right in the Middle 95."  Mr. Johnson was going to attempt to get his 24-hours license, because JPC was a day timer on AM.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, when he--they said he was getting ready to put some serious money behind there and was looking for a new staff--we were one of the people that came over, you know, myself; Tom Joyner went over as program director.  And for a day timer, we were in the top ten for many years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess the Tom Joyner Show was first in the morning.
Speaker 1: In the morning.
Speaker 2: And then you were in the middle.
Speaker 1: In the middle, 10 to 3, Tittle in the Middle.  Of course my neighbor gave me that name.  He used to come down the street and always say, "How's my Tittle in the middle?"  I said one day I'm going to use that.  So, you know, when you're going from FM to AM, I was criticized a lot.  I was criticized because, you know, AM was kind out the box; everybody was crazy, loose, wild.  You know, it wasn't like formatted like FM is.  And it wasn't as sedate as FM radio was.  It was more like in your face radio.  We did promotions.  It was--you know, you could holler, scream, talk loud, and all that stuff.  So, but it turned out to be my best, you know.
Speaker 2: People do all that on FM now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do on FM now.  It's just as crazy.  You got your Howard Sterns, you've got--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, they do crazy things now, you know.  But that's just where it was going; that's just where it was going.  So, it's still... FM is big now, FM is big.  But now it's back--they were trying to automate you back in the seventies; now they've perfected it.  Now, radio stations are automating overnight.  They're automating certain day parts, such as mid-days.  They may only have a live jock morning drive, afternoon drive, and maybe in the evenings will be automated.
Story_ID: 80228
Speaker 1: And to tell the truth, I mean, something I've noticed just over the past couple of years, is that a lot of the radio stations that are in my age group--and I'm over fifty--we listen to now are... start off with Tom Joyner in the Morning.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, syndication.
Speaker 1: He's everywhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's all over the country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where there used to be--there used to be a local person in each city doing that show.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And all these local guys don't have jobs anymore, I guess?  Because Tom Joyner's got their job.
Speaker 2: Well, true.
Speaker 1: Then they re-run Tom Joyner on Saturdays.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And sometimes even on Sundays.
Speaker 2: Big money.  Tom is--
Speaker 1: He's on re-runs, too.  So, you can hear him almost any time you turn on the radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's really awesome, isn't it?
Speaker 1: The Tom Joyner Show, like, he's knocked every, all the other... I mean I just thought... I mean a lot of jobs have been lost, haven't they, because of this approach to syndication?
Speaker 2: Well, the approach is... true enough, true, that's true; a lot of jobs have been lost, morning drive.  But most of them are in smaller markets.  In your major markets, you still have people that do, you know, morning radio.  He's only on one station, you know, V-103, that's it.
Story_ID: 80229
Speaker 1: But the fact that Tom [Joyner] is a visionary--at the time that-- well, you know, [W]JPC, Mr. [John] Johnson [HM] decided to go out of radio in '89' [1989].  A sad day.  (Laughter).  That was the best job I ever had.  I worked with that corporation for ten years, for ten years.  And it was very nice.  I would say the Jet Magazine displays--you know, being in the center-fold--and Mr. Johnson and the Johnson family has just always been very, very good to me.  So, I never had any complaints.  At one point they used to tease me, because I was the one that was making more money than anybody on the air.  And I used to wonder about that, you know.  I'm like, okay, I don't feel bad about it.  I mean back then, making $55, $60 thousand was a big deal, you know, in radio, especially working for a black radio station.  Because all the other stations were white-owned, you know.  And they never did pay that amount of money back during that time.
Speaker 2: That's true, that's true.
Speaker 1: So, from '78' [1978] to '89' [1989], that was nice money to make, you know.  And then it just grew and grew and grew.  So I would say, you know, 75, with a combination of making your money with film and with theater, too--you know, a hundred thousand dollars--that was big money.  But now, you know, people get that being on the air if they sign a good contract.
Story_ID: 80230
Speaker 1: Tom Joyner saw the vision of doing syndicated radio while at [W]GCI, because he went over to GCI.  I came over to GCI part-time, because I was going to L.A. to seek my film career.  I said, gee whiz, I'm beginning to feel like George in It's a Wonderful Life.  Every time I try to leave Chicago, there's something that pulls you back.  But it's still a wonderful life.  As long as I'm healthy and can work and still, you know, audition for those parts... and hopefully get a few good ones every now and then.  I have had some good parts that have come along.  But radio, yes.  Syndication, yes, big thing, big thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--
Speaker 1: He got with ABC, he got a good deal, you know, and was able to keep it.  Because believe it or not, a lot of them say, "Well, no, let's not..." because his show costs money.  So, if you can buy a syndicated show, and you don't have to worry about paying insurance--you know, health insurance, salary--stations now are looking at the bottom line and want more money.  It's a point of just greed, greed, greed.  They want to get more money, and they charge more money for advertising.  So, now, if you don't have to worry about a morning drive jock, and you can just get so-and-so to come in and do some traffic with how they have it set up with syndication, yeah, you'll save a few bucks.  But to me, people are not stupid, you know.  And what I'm saying is that if Tom hadn't been a big hit in Chicago when he was doing his regular show, believe me, his show would not survive here now.
Speaker 2: I think he--and I'm going to stop talking about Tom Joyner.  But he, you know, by doing two shows in Chicago... and in Houston, was it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, traveling back and forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he kind of demonstrated, too, that he could do, you know--
Speaker 1: Fly Jock, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that he could be popular in two different markets.  And I think once he established that...  What do you think?  Do you think that's what--?
Speaker 1: Well, the way he went about it, was the fact that if you get New York, LA [Los Angeles] and California, that's national, that's considered national.  Even if do a commercial--like I've got a Disney commercial that's running--that's national, if it runs in those three markets.  Now, if it runs in St. Louis, Detroit, or whatever, you still get paid.  But they'll just automatically pick those up.  So, by him being in New York, California, and Chicago, all the other little stations just come right on in.  So if you got a smaller station, or maybe not so small station, and you want to put a morning drive guy on that you know is going to get some ratings, then yeah, they'll fall to somebody who's a proven point.  And being with ABC is not bad either; you've got a little help there to promote this and get it going.  So, that's the one thing that he did that was smart.
Story_ID: 80231
Speaker 1: Well, let me get back to you now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wish I had of came along.
Speaker 1: You-- (Laughter)...
Speaker 2: I can't wait to be syndicated.
Speaker 1: But you're known for your voice.  You have a very, you have a distinctive voice.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And it's a heavy voice; it's not, you know.  And it's, it's an interesting voice to hear on the radio--to hear a woman's voice with this kind of timbre on the radio.  And what do people say about your voice?  What, what, what's the--
Speaker 2: Well, they know it's mine (Laughter); that's a pretty good thing.  I just wanted to do more, I really do.  I like doing documentaries, narrating.  I did do a Haitian art exhibit in which I did this narrating piece.  That was one of my greatest things to do.  And then I can go back to the museum up in Milwaukee and hear it through the headphones.  I'm the voice of, what you call Alita, this health exhibit in Hinsdale at the Health Museum.   It explains all the different parts of the body, and the functions.  The voice-over for Fashion Fair, I've done a lot of Fashion Fair in the past.  And I just want to be the voice.  I would love to be a voice like James Earl Jones, you know, where it's just recognized, and you get all of these dollars... dollars, manna from Heaven, that flows to earth.
Speaker 1: I think most people from Chicago, when they hear your voice, they know it's you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They definitely know it's you.  They don't have to worry about--
Speaker 2: Well, I've had a few people tell me...  It was one girl that called me, she says, "Girl, I know you're on this Riceland Rice commercial, I know that's your voice."  It wasn't my voice.  (Laughter).  I swear, it wasn't my voice, because I didn't see the residuals coming in the mail.  So, but I try to use it whenever I can, of course.  And my voice, basically my mother [Juanita Tittle] and I sound just alike.  Well, we did sound just alike.
Speaker 1: So, did you make any attempt to modify your voice or add something to your voice at any point?  Or did you have any...  Because there are people I know that spend a lot of time trying to perfect a certain sound.
Speaker 2: Oh, perfect a certain...  No.
Speaker 1: Because if you sound like your mother, I guess that's not true.
Speaker 2: No, just a voice.  I went, when was in radio school, speaking correctly, like saying "wahter" instead of "watter", "months" instead of "munts..."  You know, you do all of these things to get it right.  One time I had a Dial commercial for Dial Soap.  And I swear to God, I was so happy to get this voice-over.  I went home, I'm like, "Let's celebrate, I got this voice-over."  They called me back at ten o'clock a.m. the next morning to do it over again.  I'm like, "What, do it over again?  But it was so perfect."  "Well, we want you to say, 'watter' and not 'wahter.'"  Okay, no problem.  They pay you a session fee all over again; they pay...  You know, I mean you get paid, you know, you get paid again.  It's like, it's not your mistake; it's the creative person's mistake on directing you on how they want you to speak.  And I said, "Damn, you go to school, you learn this correct thing, you know, speech.  And then you go get a voice-over, and they want you to break it back down to where you were before.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What did they, they would want you to sound black on it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly
Speaker 1: To make sure that people--
Speaker 2: To make sure that you're, you're ethnic and so forth--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to sell a product.  And to me, I tell you... to me it's, it's not bad to sell a product that way.  But at the same time, they stopped doing that.  Some black agencies stopped doing that, breaking that down--and we want you to say "yo," instead of "your" or something like that.  Yeah, so, a lot of people just refused to just talk like that.  We talk the way we talk; everybody talks different.  Not unless you're trying to really, you know, be slang, or that's the way the product is going to be sold, you know.  Then you, then you play the character voice that you want to play.  But yes, I would love to do something bigger and better, and keep sounding the way that I sound, hopefully.
Story_ID: 80232
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when... I guess the most recognizable female voice in the black community, maybe before you came along other, than Merri Dee [HM] I guess would be Bernadette C. Washington?
Speaker 2: And Yvonne Daniels, too.
Speaker 1: Yvonne Daniels.
Speaker 2: A very recognizable voice.  I would say Yvonne Daniels and probably Merri Dee.  You know, they have distinctive voices.  Now, it's Oprah Winfrey, you know, they have distinctive voices.   So, you know, and so, nobody can mistake, "Well, she sounds just like so and so."  You know, a lot of times they try to group everybody in one little jellyfish bowl there.
Speaker 1: They're all definitely diverse, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they're all definitely diverse.  We, you know, when we have these melodic, heavy voices.  You know, so, when we were all on the radio at the same time, believe me, you knew who La Donna Tittle was; you know who Yvonne was; you knew who Merri Dee was, as far as, you know, black radio announcers go.  So, we all... and distinctive styles, too.  So, it wasn't like we were all trying to sound like the same kind of person, you know.  Some were up tempo and some laughed more; some were very serious; some were more smooth and sexy, you know.  So, I'd just be me.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 80233
Speaker 1: Well, my impression is that most people saw you as a fun personality already, somebody that was upbeat and fun, you know, basically.  Is that what you were trying to project, basically?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Basically yeah, fun person, more or less.   Would comment... wouldn't be afraid to comment on something or issues, whether it be light or heavy.  I hate to do sad things on radio, you know.  Some things... you know you have to say, "Well, this has happened and that's happened."  But basically, upbeat, yeah.  And that's the way I approach my television show that I write and produce myself, with Channel 19.  And that's because I just wanted to learn more about the business that I'm in, with film, hoping to write my own stories.  And hopefully... I've written my one woman show, which I do little excerpts on open mics at some of the clubs around the city.  So, just trying to perfect my own thing.
Speaker 1: And I want to ask you about acting; I'm not going to forget that.  I wanted to ask you about the radio stuff and get that, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --down further, and then just...  And you made a lot of personal appearances.  I think all of the disc jockeys on [W]JPC made a lot of personal appearances.
Speaker 2: Oh, we were out there with the community.  We were out there in the streets all the time.  As a matter of fact, even with [W]GCI... you know, GCI.  Basically with GCI, I did morning drive, I did afternoon drive... of course a lot of public appearances, a lot of promotions and stuff that you do.  That's just, you know, something that comes in with the whole territory of being on the air.
Story_ID: 80234
Speaker 1: I, if I was more techno-oriented, I probably would have my own syndicated show on the air.  There's a young lady by the name of Delilah who is a syndicated show, just like Tom Joyner's is.  And I could have seen myself there many years ago.  So now, I'm playing catch-up, so to speak.  I have started doing my first web satellite radio show.  I'm on www.wgcr, which I have no, I didn't name these call letters, but it's why God created radio.  It's owned by the Formans.  They operate out of 20th and Michigan.
Speaker 2: Is this a gospel--
Speaker 1: No, it is a radio station that plays R and B, gospel, classical, poetry.  It is a radio station that can be dialed up on your PC, wgcr.freeservers.com is how you get it.  And that's f-r-e-e-s-e-r-v-e-r-s.dot.com.  They tell me in computer language, those dots are important, because you'll wind up in Cyberspace somewhere else.  (Laughter).  So, it's wgcr.freeservers.com.  I'm on from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.  Now you can dial me up on your PC [personal computer], you can dial me up on your DSL [digital subscriber loop], you can dial me up on your telephone, you can dial me up on public domain access.  You can dial me up on your PC and go offline, and bring it right through your digital cable TV.  It blew my mind when I heard that.  So, that's how you get it.  And it's, it's new, you know.  And these very same people are planning to get their own live frequency.  Right now, they reach 294 countries, and they're on seven continents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, that's what they reach.
Story_ID: 80235
Speaker 1: I wanted to take you back to WJPC.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the promotional stuff they're trying to do.  What kind of day, what was your typical day?
Speaker 2: Crazy and a lot of fun.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How long did you have to...  Because now you're on the air a lot, and you have personal appearances.
Speaker 2: Right.  Basically, I hit the floor about seven or eight, thinking about what I'm going to play.  Basically I would do my, what you call show prep the day before or-- I'm one of those information gatherers, you know--what's going, what's hot, what's not; something topical, interesting to talk about.  Sometimes the news makes your day.  You know, you're going to get in there and you're going to say this and you're going to say that.  Probably one of the most exciting times was when Harold Washington ran for Mayor in Chicago [Illinois].  That was an exciting time on radio.  Oh, yeah, we were saying, "Punch this number," and giving out little clues how to punch, because you know, you just can't say, "Vote for this person, and do that."  So, you know, we had little rhymes going.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: People knew what you were talking about.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, people knew what you were talking about.  It was like, Chicago politics.
Speaker 1: Like that thing where we don't do shout-outs.  But if I had to do one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a plug.  You know, if you had to plug somebody, you knew how to plug them, right.  So, that was very interesting, that was a lot of fun.  And then when we went 24 hours-[W]JPC did--we had the Parliament Funkadelic in all night long on the radio.  So, that was crazy.
Speaker 1: They were in the studio?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All night long?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because we went... we went 24 hours on this particular day that... we went 24 hours, when Mr. [John H.] Johnson [HM] finally got the 24 hours.
Speaker 1: Look, I know enough to know that George Clinton can get real funky.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they were funky.  Oh yeah, George Clinton, Bootsy Collins.  (Laughter).  So, it was a long night.  It's like, if Mr. Johnson had ever hit that fourth floor, we'd have all been fired that day. (Laughter).  So, it was like a lot of fun.  A typical day for me was just getting up and feeling happy that I had a great place to go and work.  And of course, going up to the tenth floor and eating for a dollar good food all the time.
Speaker 1: They had an excellent chef up there.
Speaker 2: Excellent chef.
Speaker 1: At [W]JPC here.
Speaker 2: Excellent chef.  Being invited to the celebrity parties that Mr. Johnson would give when certain celebrities would come in town.  And also, the fact that they would come and be on the air with us--Richard Pryor... golly... Sammy Davis, Jr., Liza Minnelli.  I remember him giving a reception for Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis, Jr.  And of course, the menu, there was always fried chicken on that menu.  (Laughter).  So, they just had some of the best food, all the booze you wanted to drink, you know.  There was always a nice reception in the building.  And they still have that going on, the Johnson family and so forth. Of course, Linda Johnson [HM] now does most of the, you know, overseeing the magazine and so forth.  But you still have a real sense of family in that building, you know.  And I just enjoyed all the years, every day that I went to work.  So, for a typical day it was going to work, being there at 9:30, and leaving at 3.  You know, 9:30 you get in.  If it was any commercials for you to do, you did your commercials and then you went on the air.  At 3 o'clock, you could basically leave.  You know, you didn't have to stay.  At that point, you didn't have to stay.
Story_ID: 80236
Speaker 1: Now at [W]BMX, a lot different.  It was a day that started sometimes... well, I did news and I did the automated show.  So, a typical day would maybe start at midnight.  I had to be at work at midnight.  I did my automated show in the studio.  Which took five hours, only took me twenty minutes.  Because you had tones that you put on the tape, so you just voice-tracked.  Everything we did then, they're doing today.  This is all about saving money and having a bigger revenue, you know, more money for the boss or the owner.
Speaker 2: So, at [W]BMX you're saying that you weren't there all night.  You'd come in and you'd... but you--
Speaker 1: No, I was there.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: My typical day started at night.  And then I would do the morning drive news.  So, it was an eight hour shift.  It was an eight hour shift.
Speaker 2: But you were, but then your voice is on all day long?  Is that what you're saying, basically?
Speaker 1: Well, basically, you did your show and did your commercials.  They would always have commercials for you to do.  So, I did my own production work in the studio.  It was hard.  (Laughter).  So, you know, you... but you had work.  Believe it or not, it was the next morning.  So the news, 5 a.m., we'd start the news.  But you started gathering your news at 3 a.m.  Most of your people who were on the air at 6 and 5 a.m. get to the station at 3.  And some of them may get there during the night.
Story_ID: 80237
Speaker 1: So, does the news come off the wire or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the news comes off the wire.  So, you get your AP [Associated Press] news, your UPI [United Press International] news, and your city news off the wire.  Well, some stations stopped that; they took the wires out.  They did it at [W]GCI.  [W]JPC... JPC we weren't that news oriented, but we did have news in the back.  But you know, you had your morning drive news and so forth.  And they did have their AP; that's right, they did have their AP and UPI wires.  But now what they do is, they pay another service.  And they pull down the news, and you just leave a tape going, and that tape kicks off automatically in the morning at 4 a.m., and the news comes down the wire.  You may get a CNN [Central News Network] news service, other news services that have--you know, down the wire, on tape.  So, you don't have this clutzy machine any more.  Now, you do have certain machines that do send news, entertainment news, and so forth.  And you have to subscribe to these news things.  So, sometimes you wonder how jocks know everything about who's doing what?  It comes off the news wire.  And you put it together, of course, you know, in your own format.  Or you take what you can use, and you just leave the rest.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you don't want to talk about all of it?
Speaker 2: Oh no, it's so much coming off the, you know, who's doing what.  If it's not about scandals, it's about something else.  You know, nowadays it's crazy.  So, yeah, you have a lot of information that you can use besides playing music and talking about the artists.  Show prep is important, you know, even though people want to hear music.
Story_ID: 80238
Speaker 1: I like, I put my own show together.  And now with MP-3, they don't have a lot of bulk with CD's [compact discs] or...  That's one thing you miss, is people bringing by their new CD's.  You know, I mean that's how you get your library together, too.  But some of the hit records, now you can pull them right off the internet and do your show.  You know, it's so high tech, so to speak.
Speaker 2: So, do stations keep these huge record libraries now?  Or CD libraries?  Or tape libraries?
Speaker 1: They do, and they don't; they do, and they don't.  You can... what they do is they'll take the CD, they'll download it onto the computer.  And so, when you play the music, you're punching a number; you don't even see the record.  If the CD... now you do have CD players.  So if you get something new or something like that, and the program director says, "This is hot, play Cut 7," you play Cut 7 for a couple of days.  Then the engineer downloads it into the computer, and it has a number.  They say this is to prevent records from playing over the top of each other.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And also it prevents you from getting an un-cued card.  Like music was on cards.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you stuck it in the machine and you played it, right?  When you finished playing it, that card re-wounds to the beginning.  A lot of times, people would stop the card after it finishes to put another card in; they might have a commercial on it.
Speaker 2: And it wouldn't be cued up?
Speaker 1: And it wouldn't be cued up.  So, when the jock goes to hit a button that's supposed to fire the music, you would have dead air.  So, supposedly that solves all of that.  But guess what?  During a bad thunderstorm, the computer will crash, too.  (Laughter).  So that's always fun to see, how no matter what, the divine spirit can come take over and say, "Look, this ain't working," and you're off the air.  Yeah, I can, I can remember when [W]JPC, when Mr. Johnson first got cable satellite, and the satellite dish, and all that stuff.  He said, "I'm going to be able to talk to God pretty soon," you know, (Laughter) because of all of this electronic equipment.  And sure enough, it was a bad thunderstorm, and it just knocked us right off the air.  The whole building went dark.  And of course, you know, with a little fuse tapping there and so forth, we were back on in about ten minutes.  But yeah, so all of this new kind of digital stuff is to just keep you on the air better, or help you get back on the air better.  But there's been times where machines shut down, whole stations shut down.  Or what do you call it?  Computer crashing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It just crashes right out.  So, you turn it off, give it a few seconds, and turn it back on; it boots itself right back on.
Story_ID: 80239
Speaker 1: Tell me, now--
Speaker 2: That's exciting days (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright.  What I want to ask you about is some of the excitement, because I know you probably have a lot of stories.  What are some of the outstanding stories, or the funniest stories, or the most memorable moments of being at JPC, with all that activity going on all the time?  I mean, you had a job that I think that a lot of people would probably kill to get, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I used to get teased--
Speaker 1: All the personalities, with people coming in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What are some of the stories that stand out (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess... you know, a lot of times when people see you coming in and you're being, you know, you come in and you do your job.  They don't, they don't know that you didn't just get there--that you worked, you know, to get to a certain point.  And sometimes you don't even realize it.  You know, because everything is... every day this is what you do; this is how you make a living.  Some of the exciting times are... I don't know; just every day was exciting.  You know, every day was exciting; it was always something exciting.  The sets we used to do, and the things people would do to win a contest, you know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well can you think of anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh, yeah, gee whiz...  We used to do this set out at the Copper Box.  And we called it the Big Split contest, you know.  And, you know when they talk about a split, right?  There would be ladies who would do splits on the stage.  There would be ladies dressed in certain ways, you know, to win a contest.  We could... the promotions that were thought up.  And Tom [Joyner], basically, you know, he was a good gimmick person with thinking up different contests.  So, you know, you have your basic dance contest.  I guess... you know, there were dog contests.  You know, ever since George Clinton came out with "Do the Dog," you know, that was one of the big contests.  And I guess some of the exciting things were going on trips, you know, the perks that you get when you do work a drive time shift.  Working drive time is an awesome thing to do, because it's a lot of pressure because you got to get numbers.  And basically, that comes off how a program director programs the station.  And if they're not paying... if they're not playing musical chairs with personalities, then you get a chance to really sit in a spot and establish a connection with your audience, and grow, you know, with the audience as you grow, too.  So, it's just, I don't know if I can just pick any one particular story.  There are probably, I could probably... I probably can think of a lot of them when this is over.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: If you can think of one any time, during... you know.  I think one or two good ones... you know, stories would probably do a lot (unclear).
Story_ID: 80240
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  I guess, oh, wow.  I don't know.  You know--
Speaker 2: You're trying to figure out one that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, one that I can talk about.
Speaker 2: That you can repeat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right, that's what I'm trying to go through.  One that I can actually--
Speaker 2: Maybe the one at [W]JPC--
Speaker 1: Oh, that was, that was a hell of a night, I'm telling you.  It was, it was fun.  All the food we wanted.  Everything.  It was just a fun time.  And it's amazing, because we did this overnight opening of JPC, and still had to work our shifts during the day. (Laughter).  So, because basically we... well, they didn't start filling up the overnight shift.  You know, they'd have one guy that did maybe midnights till 5; somebody else who did... I can't even remember who did... well, yes I can.  Seven to 11, then 11 until 3, and then 3 to 7; or 3 to 6, when Tom [Joyner] would come on.  So, that was always fun.  My fun thing was when I came to JPC, I was a size ten.  By the time those years had went past, I was a size twelve, fourteen, because of the food.  And that would be like... I would go up the back steps, back stairs, the back elevator.  And technically, you were not supposed to have food from the cafeteria downstairs.  And I would, I would get my food and come down that back... by the back elevator all the time.  I'd have a plate of food sitting in the control room.  And it so happens that the control room, you had these windows.  So, it's like you had to hide your food underneath the desk like this.  And it's like if anybody came in that room, it would be smelling like whatever we were eating--chicken, spaghetti, or so forth.  But that was always fun; that was fun, too.
Story_ID: 80241
Speaker 1: Speaking of your size, I mean when you first started, you had that famous picture of you with the [W]JPC--
Speaker 2: Oh, the bumper sticker.
Speaker 1: Those were bumper stickers?
Speaker 2: Well, now, that's a very interesting story. Because they said, "Tittle, how would you like to do a swimsuit in the centerfold?"  I'm like, "I don't want to be in no swimsuit, you know.  Just a swimsuit, what does that mean?"  He said, "Well, what do you want to do, wear bumper stickers all over yourself and be in the centerfold?"  I'm like, "Now, that's a good idea."  So, we made the bumper stickers into a bikini.  And I'm telling you... ooh, that hurt... pulling them off.  (Laughter).   Well trying to get them straight.
Speaker 1: The real inside story.  I never thought about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, getting them straight like a bikini, you know.  And it just so happened that I had a brown bikini.  So, the bottom part, we could get the stickers around the bottom part.  Another interesting shot was when we did the mink coat shot in the Jet Magazine.  It was, we got these mink coats.  Tom [Joyner] was in one, I was in one.  And so, everybody would ask me, "Did you really have on anything under there?" you know, because my legs--
Speaker 1: It looked like you didn't have anything on?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And I'm sure you'll see that picture there; that's one of the pictures I brought.  So, I can't remember if I had anything on under there or not.  Probably not.  I was very daring, so you know.
Story_ID: 80242
Speaker 1: And they--you know, it's amazing.  You all work together... ain't nobody really paying attention to you, because everybody's trying to do their own thing.  So, but we were really, we were really a nice happy family.  We could party together and work together, which is really good.  Because most of the time you see people, you see them getting along in public, and they can't stand each other behind the scenes.  But we actually liked everyone.  We liked each other, you know.  We all got along.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it never seemed phony.  I mean it seemed like it was really--
Speaker 1: We really did.
Speaker 2: --a fun place.
Speaker 1: Now, [W]GCI was totally different.  I mean you, there were, there were rivalries--you know, people who didn't like people because they weren't in that spot or this position.  And really it all comes from either the program director or the general manager.  So, why dislike your fellow man?  But sometimes you have people now who are coming into the business like I'm the baddest one in the west, and I'm going to put you out.  And you know, that kind of competitiveness--to me, that's not healthy competition at all.  Because it's not really about that.  It's what... basically it's a numbers thing, how your ratings do.
Story_ID: 80243
Speaker 1: I've always gotten good numbers.  Whenever I'm in a spot, I'm always a good numbers getter.  And a lot of times, that doesn't matter.  Because now, it's such a... who wants you on and who likes you to be on, or something like that.  It's, sometimes it's not even about talent, you know.  Because if they want to put on you and promote you, people will go for whoever's on the air.  So, you know, there's smart radio and there's radio where I just want to hear my song--I don't care who's on it, you know, I don't care who's playing the song.  And maybe that's... you know, a lot of times that's what's happening with this automation thing.  But to me, any time we replace ourselves... you know, with something that's mechanical, we're replacing ourselves, and we should be conscious of that.  And I still think people want to hear radio.  And when they hear their favorite songs, they want to know what they heard.  They want to know that I'm listening to Barry White's Love Serenade, or I'm listening to Quincy Jones' Walking in Space; I'm listening to Eminem, Eight Mile.  They want to know the names of those people that are playing.  So, when you're playing music back to back, a lot of times listeners get frustrated when they don't know what they're listening to, so they tend to change the dial and go someplace where they will announce it.  You know, it's, it's, it's different; but then you know everything that goes different, comes back to being the same... how's that saying goes?  You know, everything that changes, comes back to being the same.  So, you have this 360 degrees where, okay, personalities--maybe personality radio is getting smaller. But at the same time, there's still personalities that are doing radio, that's what I want to say.
Story_ID: 80244
Speaker 1: So, when the game starts changing and they don't want to give you proper pay, proper work, or a proper contract, then you have to seek other things to do, you know.  And that's why I can say that one of the businesses that I do love is about theater and film and so forth.  Because--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --if I just had radio to depend on--
Speaker 2: I want to ask you about that next.  And, but your heyday was until '89' [1989] when [W]JPC went off the air, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Why do you suppose he went off the air?  It seemed like a perfect--
Speaker 1: Perfect thing?
Speaker 2: --marriage between Jet Magazine and Ebony--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Fashion Fair, and all the other activities of the Johnson Publishing Company--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and the radio station.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, as most businessmen see... they can see a change coming before we can see a change coming.  And radio had changed.  Mr. [John H.] Johnson [HM] would say all the time that he could never make the amount of money in radio that used to be made from radio.  His biggest income per se was his businesses, Ebony Magazine and then Jet Magazine.  And he, a lot of the businesses that he had, he sold those and, you know, condensed down.  He streamlined down.
Story_ID: 80245
Speaker 1: So, he started scaling down.  So, scaling down meant magazines were going to be shut down.  Because you've got other magazines coming into the business, like your Essence magazine and so forth.  With radio... radio... I can't say that other black radio stations came in to make a big force.  I think it was just his decision to take his later years a little bit easier and slower.  And also, to turn the reins over to his daughter, Linda, who is now...  He's CEO [chief executive officer], and Linda [Johnson Rice, HM] is now President.  Of course, his wife [Eunice Johnson] has always been Treasurer and Secretary.  He has always been a wholly-owned subsidiary, other than having probably interest in Essence Magazine, and some other interests like property and real estate.  One of the books I made sure I have in my library is Against All Odds by Mr. Johnson, a good book.  And he said that; he said that... it's not that he didn't like radio or anything.  It's just that radio is not a tax deduction for him; it was a business and a property.  And that's why he sold the station.  And he really didn't sell [W]JPC until a few years ago... that finally the deal came through.  And he finally got rid of it for the $10 million he was asking for.  That station did not sell until... Power 92... the Crawford people bought--
Speaker 2: 92.3?
Speaker 1: Right.  It was 106-FM.  He had the AM and FM of JPC.  AM was 95; JPC and the FM was 106.  So, he sold both of those... $10 million.
Story_ID: 80246
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Muhammad Ali was just getting his license back.  So, I met him--I was walking my dog, King Solomon, who was an Afghan hound.  And all of a sudden this guy comes driving down the street on 72nd Street, pulls over, gets out of his car and walks back to me; starts flirting, asks me could he take me out to dinner?  He said that his name was Muhammad Ali, he was Cassius Clay.  And I'm like, "Oh, yeah.  You're that boxer, you know, yeah, that they're talking about.  Yeah, I think you're right on, you know, don't fight in Vietnam," you know.  I mean, he was a people's champion.  And so, he asked me to dinner.  And he picked me up, and we went to his apartment, which was then on, was it Crandon?  I think they had a place on Crandon, 69th and Crandon.  And I went there, and before dinner got served I was sitting in the front room.  And he started doing his little boxing steps in the middle of the floor, took off his pants, had on his boxer shorts.  And he boxing, he was trying to wrestle me down to the floor.  And I was like, "No, please don't do this.  I don't want to wrestle," you know.  And I just like felt, you know, but he was a gentleman, put back on his clothes and took me home (laughter).  Gee whiz, I could have been one of the wives.
Speaker 1: Did he serve you dinner?
Speaker 2: I couldn't even remember eating, you know (laughter).  I can't--I was just so taken.  You know, I was like sitting there on the couch.  And then all of a sudden, he was like, he decided to give me a show, you know, dancing around and boxing like this, "And I'm about to get my license back, and they don't think that I should be out in public."  You know, so that's why I agreed to have dinner with him at his home, at his apartment, I should say.  And it was a Muslim there; it was a brother there, you know, looked like his bodyguard or whatever.
Speaker 1: He was there the whole time you were sitting there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--well, no, he wasn't there watching or anything.  He was like, whenever he summoned him to, you know, come do this or come do that, he came and did that.  And of course, I think he did summon him to take me home, (laughter) because I was a bad date.  But, I was a good date.  But that was, that was something that was unusual that happened while I was at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois].  Yeah so.
Story_ID: 80247
Speaker 1: So that was fun.  But I had an encounter meeting him [Muhammad Ali] again later on.  And of course, he didn't remember who I was then--it just shows you how many ladies were around this man here--when I was with Melba Moore [HM], who was a good friend of mine.  And at the time, I hadn't even started in radio.  I think I met her when I went to see "Hair" in New York.  Or, was it "Purlie Victorious"?  So, it was one of those plays.  And then she was on the road by herself.  And a group of girls, we decided that we were going to take her a plate of food to Wisconsin; she was at the Playboy Club.  And it just so happened that we all got together and we went up there.  It was a bus trip going to take people from one of the radio stations.  I'd just started with [W]BEE.  And I think it was either [W]VON that was going or [W]SDM that was going.  And there was a group of people... you know, you could take this bus trip to see a show and then come back up in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  And we met Melba, and she was very nice.  And we had a plate of food, you know, soul food.  And she was very, very nice, and that's how we met.
Story_ID: 80248
Speaker 1: And then later on while I was doing a gig, I think it was in Florida, I hooked up with her [Melba Moore, HM] again.  And she was staying at one of the hotels, and we just happened to be staying in the same hotel.  And that was the invitation to [Muhammad] Ali, who was on this boat.  And that was fun because he wanted, he invited Melba [Moore].  And Melba had her entourage, which we were included in her entourage, and a couple of other girls.  And we went on this boat, and it was like a houseboat.  And I never will forget.  This one lady, I guess she was with another party--because he had a lot of people around him all the time.  And this lady decided to try to get his attention.  So, she decided to go swimming in this water.  Now, you know, in Florida waters they got alligators and everything, you know.  (Laughter).  So, but this rudder was turning on the bottom of the boat, and this lady was almost pulled into it.  She almost got her legs chopped off.  And somebody threw her a, you know, told her not to come in--
Speaker 2: A life line?
Speaker 1: A life thing, yeah, to pull her out of the water.  But I guess she got attention, but she didn't get Ali, I don't think.  I don't think she wound up being one of the wives.  But then he had come to see Melba, and he thought she was a great singer.  He was always a gentleman, it seemed, you know, very different from the Mike Tyson reputation.  You know, he was considered to be somewhat of a gentleman; ladies' man, you know, but a gentleman.
Story_ID: 80249
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me about your acting career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you, I think you indicated that the first big re-entry into acting was in 80--
Speaker 2: In '83' [1983] I did, well, '84' [1984] really, '84' [1984], '85' [1985], I did "A Change Gonna Come" with the ETA Theatre [ETA Creative Arts Foundation].  And ETA Theater, as you know, it used to be Ebony Talent Theater.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: They were sued by [John H.] Johnson [HM].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For using the name Ebony.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And I was there working at the radio station [WJPC-AM] at the time.  And I was doing this...  Well, Abena [Joan Brown, HM] had come to me and said, "We're going to have a fundraiser."  They had gotten some of the sports guys who had agreed to be on the auction block.  So, you know, in other words you could come and bid on them and, you know, go on a date.  Or either you would just pay for the date, and the money went to charity.  This was all funds in raising... to build a better ETA Theater.  Well, it was ETA Square, it was Ebony Theater.  It was really Ebony Talent Agency.  They were going to be a talent agent like a Shirley Hamilton--like a, well, let's see, who else was... besides Shirley Hamilton, because she was like the biggest.  There was another one, Lawrence, the lady who just passed.  Golly, I can't even think of her name; she was quite big.  And there was Getty's.  Well, it just so happened that Mr. Johnson came to me and... because my--
Speaker 1: Harold Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: This is John--
Speaker 1: John Johnson.
Speaker 2: John Johnson that owned Ebony and Jet.  Okoro [Harold] Johnson [HM] and Abena had Ebony Talent.
Speaker 1: I know.  I just wanted to--
Speaker 2: Exactly, you're right, all these Johnsons, right.
Speaker 1: I was trying to make sure that we--
Speaker 2: Okoro, yes, Okoro Harold Johnson [HM].  That's one Johnson, he was the director of the theater along with Abena, the owners of Ebony Talent Agency.  Well, Mr. Johnson pulled me to the side.  He said, "Miss Tittle," he said, "Maybe they didn't tell you," he says, "But I have a suit in all courts against anybody who uses the name Ebony."  Because it's a generic name, but he has the trademark with Ebony.  So, anything that starts Ebony automatically goes into court.  And being that Mr. Johnson can afford to keep anybody in court longer than you can afford to stay there to fight, makes--basically he would make a settlement.  So, he just told me that he would appreciate it if I did not associate with them until this suit was over.  If they agreed to settle with him, he would even give them a donation.  Well, I just said, "Well, you know, Mr. Johnson, that's alright with me."  I mean I had my contract, the biggest job I've ever had.  I didn't mind saying, "Well, I won't have anything to do with them.  But I wanted you to know, Mr. Johnson, that these were the people that I sort of grew up with in Robert Taylor [Homes], being that I met them a long time ago when I was living in Robert Taylor, and they started this ETA Theater."  Well, Ebony Talent Agency was also a theater, but it was also going to be something like a talent agency.
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: So more or less, they were looking at a two-pronged thing.  As it is, it's basically all theater.  And I think that was always the direction they were going in.  But the fact that their name was Ebony was the problem.  So, once they settled in court with that, it was a done deal.  I could do the play or anything; he never held it against me for doing that.  Because when I came from [W]BMX to [W]JPC, that's what I was doing.  I was modeling, I was in film, I was in theater, and I did voice-overs.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that you had to take a little hiatus from that because of the lawsuit?
Speaker 2: Right, but it wasn't for long.  Because when they came back and they wanted me to do "A Change Gonna Come," there was no problem, because they had changed their name from Ebony to ETA.

Speaker 1: Now, from what I remember, you had a fairly substantial role in that play.  And the play was about Sam Cooke.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Could you explain to us what the play was about?
Speaker 2: It was called the Death of Sam Cooke, the trial of Sam Cooke, I should say, "A Change is Gonna Come, the Trial of Sam Cooke."  I played Susan Drake, the lady that was supposed to have tempted him to the hotel.  And that way... the hotel manager shot him, but I'm the one that took the money and ran out the back door.  And of course, my best line was, "I am not a whore," which she was.  (Laughter).  But you'd be surprised.  The audience would say, "I believed you when you were on the witness stand testifying, "I did not do this."  "Well, what did you do for all that money, Miss Drake?"  "Nothing."  (Laughter).  And I couldn't believe some of the people that would sit there watching this whole trial scene, and would believe my story.
Speaker 1: It did a real--I mean theater is special, isn't it? I mean, cause in the--
Speaker 2: It's so special.  And you get to do it live every night.  You get to get into this character more and walk in their shoes, and be them, and be another person other than yourself, you know.  Talk about exciting lives!  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 80251
Speaker 1: In the black community, the audience talks back to the stage.
Speaker 2: Don't they though?  Well, you know who they almost put out of the theater because she loved the play, was Dorothy Tillman [HM].  (Laughter).  Dorothy Tillman...  "Yeah, she did it.  She, she got him killed."  And we had went from ETA Square over to the Beverly House Theater.  Well, it just so happened that... Golly, what was the name of this guy that owned this place?  He wouldn't get the roof fixed.  We could sit out... we had the theater built out... the stage upstairs on the second floor.  And you could see the water dropping, dripping on people's heads.  You know how the lights are, you know, and you're looking out at the audience?  You could see water dripping.  But Dorothy Tillman came to see the play.  She supported the theater.  And we've been friends ever since.
Speaker 1: Did she have a big hat on?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, at [W]JPC we bought her a hat once day she came up to be on the air; we bought her a hat.  And even today... because she [Dorothy Tillman, HM] has hired me to emcee her shows at the Roots Festival.  And I said, "Dorothy, do you still have that hat we gave you at [W]JPC?"  Because we all chipped in to buy her a hat, because she was coming on the air.  I think she had just began to be the force that she is today.  But during her younger days as alderman, she was very vocal, very vocal... loud vocal, (Laughter) and would speak her mind.  And I think that's one thing I've always admired about her.  But when she came to see the Sam Cooke Show... and then we got Red Foxx there.  My girlfriend was, she worked with Red Foxx as a secretary in his office.  And when she, when Red Foxx was coming in to appear at one of the comedy places here... I think it was really not a comedy place; I think it was the Chicago Theater or the Arie Crown, one of the two, or McCormick Place.  He came in a day earlier to come to our play.  And he told us some of the interesting history of Sam Cooke.  He said he was the first one that gave him his bow; he gave him his bow on stage.  And so, he was delighted to come in.  And nobody, you know, we weren't going to ask him to do any kind of jokes or anything.  But when we... we were so glad, as a cast, to have him come see our play that he just walked on stage.  And you know, once you get a comedian on stage, it's just a natural for them to start doing stuff.  So, that was a very memorable time.  So, the whole cast just was like, "Tittle, you know so and so and so and so."  So, besides being on the radio, who you can pull in to come by and say Hi to the cast is really nice, too.
Story_ID: 80252
Speaker 1: Now, your co-star in that play was Lambus Dean.
Speaker 2: Lambus Dean.
Speaker 1: And you all are co-stars now in another capacity.  Can you explain that to us?
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lottery ball.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Lottery ball.
Speaker 2: Lottery ball, one of my exciting jobs.  And I'm going to tell you something; I enjoyed being a lottery ball, because you got paid for it.
Speaker 1: Now explain that to people, who maybe three hundred years from now, they won't know what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The lottery ball--and we were the first lottery balls, believe me.  They made these heavy balls out of this material.  It's this heavy, hard equipment.  And those balls must weigh about sixty pounds.  So, us marching down King Drive in those balls... now, they got lighter balls.  But they're made with a lighter equipment and they don't weigh, they're like putting on a heavy overcoat or something like that.  But these balls that we would wear... I would carry a big old cold bottle of water inside my ball, so it would be like a refrigerator in there.  (Laughter).  They would make you hot.  Yeah, they were heavy balls. I'm one these--
Speaker 1: Seems like your body's a big lottery ball.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Your legs sticking out--
Speaker 2: Legs sticking out, arms sticking out, and your head sticking out.
Speaker 1: And you had a big number on your...
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like a big eggshell, and then a number on it.  But those eggshells were heavy.  Golly, I can't believe I walked from 31st to 55th Street for many years.
Speaker 1: In the Bud Billiken Day Parade?
Speaker 2: In the Bud Billiken Day Parade.
Speaker 1: You were on television too, for... in commercials, too, with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --outfits on, right?
Speaker 2: Television commercials were always another product, you know, not necessarily the lottery.  I just, believe it or not, just got a lottery ball commercial, and me and Carl Wright is dancing together.  Carl Wright is an actor--
Speaker 1: Reverend Carl.
Speaker 2: Reverend Carl, the Reverend Carl Wright, the comedian Carl Wright.
Speaker 1: Who appears with Pervis Spann [HM].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On "Blues and More."
Speaker 2: "Blues and More," yeah.  Well, Carl is getting a lot of play, a lot of jobs too, with the field in film and everything.  And by right he should; he's a standup comedian, and has been for years in Chicago.  It just shows you how things work, you know.
Story_ID: 80253
Speaker 1: I auditioned for a couple of big things, which other people got.  Like Irma P. Hall [HM], we auditioned for Big Mama together with Soul Food.  She got it, and she ain't never looked back since.  The "Family Thing," she really took off with the Family Thing, with her and James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall.  So, but those auditions came right through Chicago.  And hey, it's, you know, what the... what the client sees is what he wants.  A film that came through that I got that was really big for me was "The Relic," in which I play a teacher.  This was a horror movie directed... well, it's really kind of a sci-fi movie, directed by Peter Hyams.  And Peter Hyams is one of the leading journalists, he was in Chicago.  And he had a passion for directing, went on out to LA [Los Angeles], and the rest is history.  So now he's... I think he got an Oscar for, oh God, I can't remember the movie name.  When I think of it, I'll say it.  But he did The Relic, and I played a teacher in that.  So that was a good movie, residual-wise, for me.
Speaker 2: You were a teacher taking some kids to the Field Museum?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It happens a million times a year. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And those were some of the nicest kids I worked with.  And it's amazing, when you see the film back, the cut was like they're all facing me.  You can see my face, and then all you see is the back of their heads, you know. (Laughter).  I'm like oh, gee, they were so cute.  And a couple of scenes that we did in the museum going up the step...  And I go, "Eyes only, children, eyes only."  They cut that, they cut that part.  So, I didn't even get my big second scene in there.  But that's okay, because once you talk in a movie and you're a principal, then you're eligible for those good old residuals.  So, I did that.  I did "Turks," which is a drama series that ran in Chicago, police drama series.  It had a short run, but it doesn't matter, because it'll go to other markets and you'll get a nice little check in the mail, maybe for thirteen dollars or so.  (Laughter).  Don't plan to get rich off this business by doing one or two little films; it takes time.
Story_ID: 80254
Speaker 1: And my latest film is "Ali," in which I play Bundini's [Drew Bundini Brown] landlady.  And my scene is directly with Will Smith.  We shot that on 41st and King Drive at the Ritz Hotel.  And it may look good on the outside, but that is... they have not changed one thing inside of those doors.  They still got the chipped marble, all the notes on the door saying "Pay in cash."  If it's New Year's Eve, it cost more money, a dollar more."  It is still... and they finally closed that hotel down.  They finally closed it down, so--
Speaker 2: I think they have some plans to remodel that.
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is... I'm sure it is.  This is all a part of Bronzeville.  And I'm sure nobody put the money to make the outside of the building look good and didn't think about the inside.  But you know, when films come in, they have to get props.  They didn't have to get no props with this.  Everything was original, the same pissy mattresses are still in the hotel room.  And this particular room, they had to really make it look dark and dingy, with drugs in it.  Because Bundini summons Ali to the hotel to tell him that he's so sorry for what we did to him, by denying him, you know, and so forth--he must come back in the fold... and that he sold his belt for five dollars and some drugs.  So, that's that scene, you know, and--
Speaker 2: He sold [Muhammad] Ali's championship belt.
Speaker 1: Championship belt for five dollars and some drugs.  Now, you know, Bundini was his hype man, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He gave him all the lines, "Sting like a butterfly, float like a bee," you know, "Thriller in Manila."  He was the hype man.  You know, that's why Ali took him on the road with him.  That's what he did to keep him up there, punch him up.  And Bundini, who was played by Jamie Foxx, I never did see on the set.  He was there, but he wasn't out like Will Smith was.  And then Will had this huge motorhome, that $10 million motorhome.  Of course, my little trailer was right in the back of his big trailer.  But that was, that was kind of neat.  I was right there, you know; that was nostalgic, too.  And I had one of the guys take a picture of me with Ali--with Will--and the director, Michael Mann.  And the picture didn't come out too good; it was kind of foggy and dark, you know.  So, I tried to get another picture.  And by this time, you know, the set had broken down, because it was just a full day's shoot.  But... and they didn't use me until about 6 p.m.  And, but you had to be there at 6 a.m.  But it was still an exciting day.  You get to eat all day, and think about your one line, and how you're going to say it.  And then the minute I went on the set, Michael Mann changed my lines around.  (Laughter).  So, it's good to be a quick study when you're acting.
Story_ID: 80255
Speaker 1: Theater-wise, I've done some very good plays, and really good reviews over the years.
Speaker 2: Do you have some check-offs?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did, with Organic Theater.  Gee, what was the name of the play that I did?  Oh, "The Wild Duck."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The other play, God, what was the name of it?  It was a really good play.  It was real deep--those deep plays, those deep theatrical plays that get you ready for other things.  I did "The Old Settler."  I did Ma Rainey's "Black Bottom."  I worked with Jonathan Wilson, who is one of the top black directors in the city.  And Marlo, who is a white sister who started traditional... non-traditional casting in the theater, meaning that she started casting black people that were normally played by white roles, you know, white folks.  I should say black people who were into white roles... that were normally white roles... she started casting black people in.  So, she was one of the first--
Speaker 2: Check-off player, yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  There was one play they did an adaptation of.  This girl did it, I can't think of the name of it.  That was a good play to play.
Speaker 2: You were in "From the Mississippi Delta?"
Speaker 1: From the Mississippi Delta, right, at the Goodman [Theatre].
Speaker 2: Ida Mae Holland?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Ida Mae Holland.  She's a very nice lady.  She's a real, she's a real good writer.  From the Mississippi Delta is just a good play.  So, yes, I worked that at Goodman.  I was really an understudy at Goodman with that.  The girls wouldn't let me go on, so everybody stayed healthy during that run.  But it was just good to just work that, and be there involved in that whole process.  A play as extensive as Mississippi Delta is really good, because you get to play a character that changes and goes into another character and so forth, explaining this one story about this lady in three different characters--a young girl, middle aged, and then an old lady.  So, that was real good.  Let's see, just recently I did "Five Rooms of Furniture" which is by a new playwright, Donna Marie Branton.  We got very good reviews on that.  So, basically when you finish one, you just hang loose and wait for an audition for another thing to come up--
Story_ID: 80256
Speaker 1: And like I said, being out in L.A. [Los Angeles], you're on the tip of what's going on.  By the time films get to Chicago, they're smaller roles.  They're generally one liners or three liners or something, but they're bit parts.  You do... you may do better by going out to L.A., and then maybe again you may not.  You know, sometimes... Lucille Ball said it best.  She said, "In L.A. it takes twenty years to become an overnight success."  (Laughter).  There you go.  So, you can be batting around at this for a while.  But you get that one break... and I think that's what we all are in hopes of, is that one break that lets you in the door to do something.  It could be a series, a sitcom or whatever.  And I guess that's why I'm writing and producing my own stuff, because I just... the thought of just waiting to be selected to do something will drive you crazy.  You know, you know, so you just got to write and do your own.  So, we're doing some little things that, you know, on Channel 19 to get ready for the onslaught of, "Sign right here on the dotted line.  We're picking this up, we're picking that series up."  So, that's what you go for.
Story_ID: 80257
Speaker 1: I want to ask you, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, that things get better.  Always, you know, there's always hope that things will get better.  My hope is that we become more conscientious of our heritage as a people, more... can I say less violent towards each other, definitely.  Crime, black on black crime, I'd like to see an end to that.  Of course, opportunities, better opportunities job-wise.  Whatever we want to do, hoping that you can excel without prejudice, racism.  I don't know if we'll lever see an end to that in our lifetime, but I definitely am hopeful of it.  Just more conscientious things.  I'd like to see us in more things, you know, more things that represent us more or less, definitely in film, theater, those aspects... advertising.  I was looking at the nominations for the soap operas today.  I noticed not one, you know, person in there of color.  There was other ethnic groups, you know, Hispanic, but I didn't--I guess you could say they're of color--but I'm talking about for the African-American.  And you certainly see people, African-Americans, in soap operas--but getting those roles, you know, those substantial roles.  It's not enough to see a Denzel--and thank God, you know, finally Halle Berry--but when you say after 69 years nobody is good enough to have gotten an Oscar for best actress--you know there's something wrong with that picture.  Because we've had a community of black... good actors, of good people that represent us on film.  You know, so you can pick one person out and just ride it to the end, but there are other people, too.  So, I would like to see that happen, yes.  Just a whole conscious lifting thing of our culture and who we are as a people, and I guess more appreciation, definitely.  As far as I see, I would like to tell more black stories, you know, my own vocal power, use my influence to educate as well as be a part of.  A lot of times we're asked to come in and tutor and mentor and so forth, but people have to realize that we still want to make a living at doing those things, too.  I'm not exactly wanting to retire and hang up my shingles, you know, you know what I'm saying?  I still want to be a part of the working element.  So, I would hope for that, too--that we don't say, "Oh, well, yes, so and so used to be in the business, you know."  And don't look to those griots to continue to help us in the business, or passing along the torch.  And I think people talk about being legendary in the business.  You know, unless you can continue to work at your legacy, you know, being a legend is just some word that they use.  A lot of people get awards and compliments.  And all that is fine, but I think the reality is to make a decent living at what you do--your craft, so to speak.  So, yeah, I would like to see that happen as far as our black culture, black communities go.  We just need to be more... I don't know if it's political as much as it is conscious of politics in a sense.  Because you get a lot of politicians now who are just in there for their own greed.  And this is black, white, whatever color.  So, you want this to be a better kind of situation.  I don't know if those things will ever get better.  Preachers and politicians, I'm always leery of.  (Laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: But you did say earlier that you were--one of the highlights of your career was being on the air during the Harold Washington campaign?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Well, I thought that he was just a different kind of person.  You know, it's just another conscious level that was going along at that time.  Now, we tend to sometimes want to just put people in because they are of color.  Well, that doesn't make them good.  So, we need to make our black politicians more accountable to what's going on with our situation.  And that's not happening.
Story_ID: 80258
Speaker 1: Tell me, at this point--and I know you're still doing a lot of things, and you have like a lot of hopes and a lot of projects that you're moving on now that point toward the future.  But at this point, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, radio, one of them, you know, being that I'm trying something new with web satellite radio.  It's not the biggest, highest paying job that I've ever had, but it's definitely something different.  So, yes, I would like to continue to do that.  And basically, just being a person who was out there in the spirit of the people and representing--as they say, representing, you know.  And fulfilling whatever potential lies before me to be good at what I'm doing--if it's in theater, if it's in film, getting more work, getting better jobs, better scripts, better parts, bigger parts--of course I see that.  I want to do that; you know, more narrating, more vocal things, and I do enjoy teaching, I really do enjoy teaching.  So, yeah, I see that happening.  You know, as you get older, you try to see yourself I certain situations, like okay where am I going here?  What am I going to be doing the next ten years?  What am I going to be doing the next twenty years or so?  Well, besides just having a good time, (Laughter), shopping when I want to, going on vacation when I want to--basically doing what I want to do.  And so yes, I've put myself into learning different things to make a living.  But at the same time, I like doing what I enjoy doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, right now it's writing and producing my own show with CAN-TV, which is a learning situation, so that I can go on to do something like what you're doing--interviewing big celebrities and people that make history.
Speaker 1: Like you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Laughter).  Exactly.
Story_ID: 80259
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question is--and this is, in light of all the things that you plan to do--and this may seem like a weird time to ask this, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good person, a hardworking person who liked to enjoy themselves and have a good time, and enjoy the spirit of someone's company.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Is that okay?
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Is that educated answer?  Is that--?
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: It's like, she just wants to have a good time.  (Laughter).  Don't we all just want to have a good time, you know?  Can't we all just get along?  (Laughter).  It's so much better.  But yeah, I would want to continue that.
Story_ID: 80260
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was the [W]JPC promotion.  They wanted me to do a centerfold for JPC.  And I didn't want to do it in your, just your regular bikini outfit.  So, Mr. Mutrie, who was the general manager at the station at the time says, "Well, what do you mean, you don't want to do it in a bikini?  You want to just wrap yourself up in bumper stickers or something?"  I'm like, "That's not a bad idea.  Now that's unique."  So, that's why we got the JPC swimsuit.  You can't believe how many orders they got in for the JPC swimsuit.  Now, that would have been a good promotional idea, but nobody followed through on that.
Speaker 2: So they actually made a JPC--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: No, they didn't?
Speaker 1: They didn't.  This was out of bumper stickers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can't you see them stickers on me?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I thought maybe the station got wise or something.
Speaker 1: So, they like cut a piece off, put a 'Tittle' under there, put 'La Donna' over here.  And so it was like in little patches, really.  So, you can imagine when you stuck one on, and it wasn't stuck right... so you had to take it off and stick in on right.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was "ouch-ing" going on.  Now the swimsuit, the bottom part wasn't too bad, because I had a brown bikini bottom.  So, the stickers fit right over, so I had a little piece of material at least going under there.
Speaker 2: What's on your belly button?
Speaker 1: That's the JPC belly button sticker.  We just cut it out, and somehow or ever we got JPC in there or something.  But that was the middle of Tittle.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So that's how that all came about.
Speaker 2: This was one of Chicago's favorite photos.  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's La Donna, that's La Donna Blanton, my grandmother whom I was named after.  And she was a very sweet grandmother.  She'd always give you a dollar or something when you came over. (Laughter).  I'll never forget the one time she gave me a ten dollar check for my birthday, and I never cashed it.  And she kept saying, "When you gonna cash that check?  You're throwing my account off."  That's Grandma La Donna.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This was the photograph that I had taken during a series of photographs to find a decent headshot that would be representative of me for the business.  And I wound up using another shot that was better, that got me more work.  However, I always thought this was a good photo.  And one day somebody will think so, too.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is affectionately called "My Mother."  In the business she would be on radio with me, and the public knew her as Mama T.  That was her handle on radio with me.  I started doing little shows with her.  She would be my consort for information with girls that would call up, wondering what should they do about this love life, and what should they do about that love life?
Speaker 2: She used to give advice on the radio?
Speaker 1: She actually gave advice on the air.  And we did a lot more of it on GCI.  That's my beloved mother, Juanita [Tittle].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is one of my better photographs at WJPC that I absolutely loved.  A very interesting story.  If you pull back more of that picture, the top that I had on there actually was a beautiful blouse.  My boyfriend took me shopping, and this was when was women started wearing pants a lot.  And he decided that I was buying too many pants, so he went shopping with me to make sure that I bought skirts and blouses.  (Laughter).  And of that came this wonderful top from Bonwit Teller, and I wore it to do this photograph, which they used as a headshot for JPC.
Speaker 2: Wonderful smile.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: We hired nothing but the best high-tech equipment.
Speaker 1: I heard that, I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is one of the better headshots that I had.  This headshot, I got work for, believe me, for the last--it lasted me ten years, this one headshot.  And every time it was submitted for anything, I would get the job for it.  That was the best headshot, and I still use it today.  I'm still using that headshot.  But the one you just passed, no, I have another one that's current.  Well, you can tell the difference, you can tell.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: That is the lottery ball.  And those are the big, heavy balls that we used to wear down the street.  They looked light, but they weighed about seventy pounds at least.  That's more than me.  Lambus Dean and I used to make these balls do wonderful things.  (Laughter).  And we started doing the line dance, you know, and so forth, in the street.  And that's the greatest gig; it's the best gig that I had during my radio station days at [W]GCI.  Because they never paid you to roll down King Drive.  You just got up in the morning and had to get out there and be on the float.  But when I discovered the lottery ball people, we were paid $125 for walking that whole strip that day.  So, what other way can you make $125 for the day, and have fun too?  Which... the Bud Billiken Day Parade is the best parade in the whole wide world.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: Jerome, what is...?  Simmons.  He is a photographer, he's been around for a number of years.  He takes pictures of all the, most of the singing stars that come in for different labels.  He has his own shop on 79th Street.  And he presented me the Griot Award one year.  And of course, griots are those people who take information, cultural information about their heritage, and pass it down to others.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: AS you can see, I am with a very sassy, classy Millie Jackson.  And I just recently worked with Millie Jackson with the Roots Festival.  And she's a very nice lady, and I really liked her.  And I was on the air at GCI and she came on as my guest.
Speaker 2: Alright, ready.
Speaker 1: I am in my character outfit, and my character look, as a teacher with Peter Hyams who is a director of movies.  He is also an Oscar winner for the film Outlander; that was the film; I couldn't remember it.
Speaker 2: Sean Connery and--
Speaker 1: Yes, Outlander.  And you know, he films in this kind of contrasting light kind of thing.  And so, he did the movie, "The Relic," in which I played the teacher.
Speaker 2: I can't think of who the star of that was now.
Speaker 1: Well, she was a sweet lady to work with.  She, that's Linda Hunt, and I'm in my character look as the teacher in Relic.  And it was just a fun job.  We took that picture at the museum.  And she was very kind to take a picture with me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of the Jacksons.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of WJPC Radio.  As you can see, we had the very big nice studios to play on the floor.  And you see the windows over there, that's where the studios were.  And oh, that guy right there is... yes--
Speaker 2: Jermaine.
Speaker 1: Jermaine Jackson, that's right, Jermaine.  That was Jermaine Jackson.  As a matter of fact, I interviewed all of the Jacksons at one point in time during my days at [W]JPC.  Jermaine just happened to be there.  And I don't know if Michael and Marlon were there on the same day.  But I can remember somehow or other... I think this is Jermaine when he did the hit with Pia Zadora.  Yeah, and he came in and was promoting that.  But there he is.
Speaker 2: Okay, next one.  Tell me who that guy is, do I know him?
Speaker 1: Oh, wait till I tell you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You're going to be surprised.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's myself, we were... I emceed the show at the Auditorium Theater.  That's Millie Jackson in the middle, and I believe that's Harold Melvin of the Blue Notes.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: That's him.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't have guessed.  I know I'd seen him, but I couldn't think of who he was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were having fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mr. Johnson hosted the Black Film Festival in Chicago, and what a magnificent festival it was.  The building at Polk Street and Dearborn, the Polk Street Station--
Speaker 2: The Dearborn Station?
Speaker 1: The Dearborn Station.  This was before they had completely renovated it.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: And they were giving little soirees there while they were still getting it together.  And they hosted the Black Tie Black Film Festival.  Ruben Cannon is the young man that I'm standing with.  As you know, today he is a big casting director in L.A.  Come to find out that we also went to Dunbar Vocational High School together.  And all I could say was, "Was I nice to this man?"  (Laughter).  Was I a nice person?  Okay, he's a casting director in L.A.  I only saw him one time in L.A., and believe me, he was so far ahead of the game it's like "I can't look at this one script.  I have a lot of scripts to look at."  And that's the infamous Oprah Winfrey at the table.
Story_ID: 80261
Speaker 1: I should say the billionaire Oprah Winfrey.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, she's a billionaire.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Doing great.
Speaker 1: I know.  Oh, you're right behind her being a billionaire?  Is that what you mean?
Speaker 2: In a relative sense.
Speaker 1: Is that right behind her?  I like to feel that way, too.  Yeah, I mean why not, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were nice and skinny.  Oh, these are some of the fun promotions that we would do at WJPC.  To, I guess it would be your left, or your right...  That's Diane Thompson, Tom Joyner, and myself.  We were selling money; that's when we were doing one of our money promotions out at Seaway Bank.  So, we would sell like denominations.  For one dollar, you'd get two dollars.  For two five dollars, you'd get ten dollars.  For two ten dollars, you got twenty dollars.  That's the way we were selling money.  And then we would buy the plastic back--everybody's plastic cards from every station--we'd buy them back and give you a JPC plastic card.  Remember "Fantastic Plastic?"  That was the name of the game.  Always a promotion, to get people to get involved with what's happening with the stations.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That was one of our centerfold pictures that we did.  Evans, I think it was Evans that was doing their mink coats or... either it was getting ready for the fashion show every year that JPC would have.  Well, they decided to use the disc jockeys to promote that.  So, this another great centerfold--Tom Joyner, myself, and B.B.D. Banana.
Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot all about him.
Speaker 1: This was at the black film festival that Mr. [John H.] Johnson [HM] hosted.  And that was Lee Roscoe, Roscoe Lee--
Speaker 2: Roscoe Lee Brown.
Speaker 1: Roscoe Lee Brown, Roscoe Lee Brown.  We were dancing, and I didn't know I was dancing with another girl.  I thought I was dancing with a...  He went all the girl, baby, all the way girl.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: All the way, broken wrist.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: I don't know if we should say that.  But yeah, he's in the life, you know, I understand.  Little did I know... you know, then it was big news.  It was like, "Girl, do you know...?"  Now--
Speaker 2: So, he is a she, is it?
Speaker 1: She is a she, you're right.  I think I put another photo in there, too.  That is, that's Vanity.
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Remember Prince?  Yeah, Vanity, that's Vanity.
Speaker 2: Yes, she's dressed... they all kind of dressed like vampires.
Speaker 1: Don't they, though?  That was then, wasn't it?  Yeah, that was Vanity.  That was taken at WJPC in the control room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was at the actual promotion party later on that evening.  I forgot what club set it was.  But a lot of times we would have the artists--whoever we were doing a promotion with--would come to the station and do an interview with us on the air.  And then later that evening, we would be out at the club jamming with them.  So, I was trying to be a Vanity girl then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is one of our great JPC blowout picnics.  Boy, did we have fun doing these outdoor picnics, until somebody rushed the stage when we had Larry Graham there.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And Mr. [John H.] Johnso [HM]n was sued, and that broke the outdoor festival.  But I cooked all of the, I grilled, brought my grill out there, and I did all of the barbecuing.  And I was feeding Isaac Hayes.
Speaker 2: Now, where were you all having these at?
Speaker 1: Grant Park.
Speaker 2: Grant Park, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the old Bandshell site.  And really, Johnson Publishing is like right directly across the street, you know.  So, we set up the picnic area, the stage.  And so, you know, backstage we'd be cooking and fraternizing with the superstars;  This is me doing the Automobile Show.  And this outfit that I had on was all of these little mink pelts, and they were a different color, from brown, black, to white.  And I emceed the Automobile Show.
Speaker 2: Feeding Isaac Hayes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Are you ready?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the one that made the prize.
Speaker 2: Tom's funnier.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is.  Tom and B.B. used to actually try to bribe Linda [Johnson Rice, HM] to get her dad to put them in the magazine.  I am not kidding, I did not know that.  I only learned that years later, you know.  And so when Tom finally got to be a millionaire from his show, that is when he, the first time he was ever in Ebony Magazine; I am not kidding.  Otherwise, it was like a group photo or promoting the radio station.  But that's, that's the one that made the centerfold with the magazine.
Speaker 2: Okay, are you ready for another one?  Now, this is the same shot.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a fun shot.  The best parade in the whole wide world, this is the Bud Billiken Day Parade.  Of course, that's Cassandra Swazer, who is still on radio.  She does a show in Kentucky.  That is Graham Armstrong in the middle.  Graham Armstrong now handles and is publisher of one of... writes with one of the magazines that is owned by Clear Channel.  And of course, that's me waving to all the good people at the Bud Billiken Day Parade.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: At [W]BMX, and I'm a person who always likes hats.  So somehow or other, this was a brim that was cut off, and we were doing another promotion.  I look the same way today.  (Laughter);  And I'm trying to figure out where exactly we were.  I don't, I don't know where this photo was taken at, because I know that when she came to [W]GCI... it wasn't at GCI.  It had to be either JPC... but I'm thinking, I'm thinking JPC, but I'm thinking BMX maybe, too.  I don't know.  That one, I couldn't... I couldn't... that was a disappointment to them, but I was just happy to meet her.
Speaker 2: Tom Joyner--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is when we made the March to Washington to make Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday a holiday.  And they were setting up the stage for Stevie Wonder.  He had just made his album, "Hotter Than July."  And we took all of these people to Washington, D.C., two busloads full.  And we were quite the revolutionary troopers marching along.  Thompson, Tom Joyner, Gorgeous Gordon--okay, Gorgeous Gordon... Janice Gordon--who has a show now in Memphis, and myself and Chilly Childs;  That was when we went to Disneyworld.  Okay, Disneyworld.  And of course, they have this place where you take these crazy pictures and be on the cover of a magazine.  And so, I chose this one.  And the other one that I had was me giving Mickey a whipping in this wedding veil. (Laughter).  But somehow or the other it got wet, and the whole top of it was kind of destroyed.  But this one here was with a Goofy hat.  So, you can like make yourself up and be these characters, and they take a picture of you and give you this.  And it looks like you're on the cover of a magazine; Oh great, that is the current Tittle.  We finally caught up with her; that is the current tittle.  That photograph was taken at GCI.  They finally got a professional photographer at GCI to give us some professional pictures.  And it came out so good that I'm using that as a headshot for my other business, other work.  So, I get calls on that.  So, that's me now.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's great.
Speaker 1: That is from school days at St. Ambrose, in which we had to wear a uniform, in '55 [1955] to '56 [1956].  And somehow or ever, Bucky Beaver was my favorite character, and I'm smiling like Bucky Beaver. (Laughter).
