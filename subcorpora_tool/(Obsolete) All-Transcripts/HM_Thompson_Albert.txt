Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: I'm Albert Nelson Thompson, Jr.  That's A-L-B-E-R-T, N-E-L-S-O-N, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N, J-U-N-I-O-R.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It's October 31st, 1946.  I was born in Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor of chemistry at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I'm also chair of the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 20th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the conference room in the Science Center at Spelman College.
Story_ID: 21262
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a warm-up.  And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like shrimp.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Caribbean.
Speaker 1: All right, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I probably take one from my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson].  She always said that "You can't get blood out of a turnip", but as a chemist (laughter), another one is that, "If you knew the answers, you couldn't call it research."
Story_ID: 21263
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.], but we'll start with your mother's side and try to keep 'em separate until we put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Martha Viola Furgess Thompson.  That's M-A-R-T-H-A, V-I-O-L-A, F-U-R-G-E-S-S, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's date of birth is December 3rd, 1923, Columb- Hopkins, I'm sorry, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hopkins, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: It's about eight, twelve miles outside of Columbia [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: At least to great, great grandparents.  My mother's mother was Josephine Neal Furgess, and she came from a family of three girls.  I think there was a boy who died in childbirth.  Her father was Weston Neal.  He had two other brothers, and I can't remember their first names, but they were both, as I was told, they were teachers and also ministers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Green Neal was one brother and, and it will come to me later.  And my, I do know that the Neal family had originally the name Devaux, and that's D-E-V-A-U-X, but somehow during slavery, the Neal's bought the Devaux's because they were brought from somewhere in West Africa, a French colony, as the French name.  And we found at a family reunion about forty years ago that we were related to the Devaux's in Eastover, South Carolina as well as Hopkins, South Carolina.  So, and we're sort of related to the Ikencutters.  That's Rev. Ike's folks because a Devaux was sold to an Ikencutter down in Buford, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Ikencutter, now, how do you spell Rev. Ike's name?
Speaker 2: I can tell you a story about me meeting a Neal in Rome, who was Caucasian (laughter), who happened to be from Hopkins, South Carolina, and we found out that we were both related to the Neal's and Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Rev. Ike is a famous Evangelist--
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: --from New York.
Speaker 2: But someone on his father's ancestry married a Neal from the Hopkins' side.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories on that side of the family about the end of slavery or Reconstruction [1963-1977]?
Speaker 2: No, from what I understood, you know, as I said, they were preachers.  They bought land.  I know there's still some property that my grandmother had.  It's about twelve acres that was divided amongst the brothers, you know, in the, during the Reconstruction period.  So that land is still in the family.  It probably would be subdivided by over a hundred people now.  But it was my grandmother's property, and she had fifteen children.  So if you divide twelve or eleven acres by fifteen, that's not very much.  But, you know, as I said, they were schoolteachers and landowners as far as I can think back and I was told.
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite a legacy though, coming out of those days so they were involved in some kind of professional life--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --going way, way back.
Speaker 2: And began to get college degrees, I think in the early 1900s.  Many of them finished Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina.  That's, my mother has her undergraduate degree from Benedict College in 1945 was when she finished, 'cause she finished high school in '41 [1941], she and her twin sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother went to Benedict?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was the first of the family to get a college degree that had a sister who earlier did the three-year registered nurse degree.  And she eventually moved to New York [New York] and was a, her career was spent as a registered nurse in New York.  She retired at Mount Sinai [Hospital, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So your mother's degree was in education?
Speaker 2: That is correct, elementary education.  And she did her master's in education.  She was a first-grade teacher, half of her career, kindergarten.  She retired as a kindergarten teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Started teaching in Columbia, South Carolina, and then we moved to Texas.  And then she taught in Texas until she retired in 1986.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have any memorable stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let me see.  No, because she came from a family of fifteen, she always talked about sharing, you know, when the three of us didn't agree on things, she always said that we, we needed to share.  You know, they had to share.  And they all helped each other.  My father was an only child so, obviously, there was, you know, a little, little difference in philosophies there (laughter).
Story_ID: 21264
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, let's go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr., and that's A-L-B-E-R-T, N-E-L-S-O-N, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N, S-E-N-I-O-R.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is March 5th, 1920.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: So what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  I can start with his father's side.  I never met his father because his father was deceased before I was born.  But his father's name was Albert Henry Thompson.  My father didn't take his middle name because he had an aunt who was named Elsie Nelson, who didn't have any children.  She was a school teacher, and she wanted her last name in my father's.  So that's why I'm not the third.  His father, from what I understand, did a technical certificate at North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  So he was a contractor, bricklayer.  In fact, there are some places in Columbia [South Carolina] my grandmother showed me where he built, you know, brick walls and things of that nature.  He and my grandmother divorced.  And my grandmother remarried, and that's how she took up the name Logan.  But this was after my father went to college in 1936.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name then?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Ella Evelyn Lewis Thompson.  And do you want me to spell that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's E-L-L-A, Evelyn, E-V-E-L-Y-N, Lewis, L-E-W-I-S, Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.  She was a, a teacher, and she went to Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] also.  And she began her teaching career in Columbia, South Carolina, but at the time, there was a ruling that if you married, you couldn't teach (laughter), and so she ended up resigning her teaching position to marry.  And she ended up teaching in rural South Carolina most of her life in the county schools.  Obviously, they needed teachers and it didn't matter if they were married or not.  And so, so she retired, I believe in 19--well, she was born in 1891.  So she retired around 1957 as a second-grade teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is your--did your father tell any stories about growing up to you, what he--
Speaker 2: Well, it was mostly about growing up in the segregated South.  And I remember my father telling my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson], well, telling my grandmother that he didn't want his children to grow up like he did.  For instance, when he went into the department stores, he had to keep his hands folded because he didn't want, she didn't want him to be accused of stealing, shoplifting.  And so I remember him telling my grandmother, you know, when we were kids and went in the stores, "I don't want my kids to go under this kind of pressure."  And I can talk later about my father and his involvement in Civil Rights in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 21265
Speaker 1: My father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] finished Tuskegee Institute [now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in 1940.  He was in education, and he started teaching in Columbia, South Carolina.  Not long after, he was very young when he went to college, I think fifteen.  He was probably nineteen when he came out.  He had difficult finding a job because he looked young, very young, but I remember my grandmother [Ella Evelyn Lewis Thompson] telling me that the superintendent would not hire him because he looked like a boy.  And my grandmother also said that this superintendent didn't even have a college degree himself (laughter).  My father ended up getting a teaching job with the Columbia school system.  That's how he and my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] met.  But in 1944, my father, with the assistance of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], filed a lawsuit because there was unequal teacher pay during that period.  And this was happening around the country.  Their counsel was Thurgood Marshall, but the local attorney who handled it was Lawyer [Harold R.] Boulware.  And I always heard my parents talk about him.  Well, anyway--
Speaker 2: What was his name again?
Speaker 1: Boulware, B-O-U-L-W-A-R-E.  I can't think of his first name, but he handled a lot of Civil Rights cases.
Speaker 2: B-O-W--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: No, B-O-U-L-W-A-R-E.
Speaker 2: U-L--
Speaker 1: It might be an "E" in Boulware, something.  I don't think it's W-E-L-L.  I think it's Boulware, right.  And whenever we went back to South Carolina--we left in 1950, late '49 [1949], '50 [1950], my father would always take us up there to the courthouse and tell us the story about his court case that he did win.  The judge was J. Waites Waring, who was the same judge in South Carolina that ruled on that '54 [1954] decision, 'Briggs versus Clarendon County,' you know, and then there was the Topeka [Brown versus Board of Education, 1954] case and the Virginia case.  And we all know that the South Carolina case should have been the first one on the docket because Briggs comes before Brown alphabetically.  And the story goes that Strom Thurmond [James Strom Thurmond], you know, cut a deal because he didn't want South Carolina to be known.  Well, some, some, by default, my father and mother had to leave South Carolina because they could no longer get employment there, probably because my father was a member of the NAACP.  And, you know, that was outlawed at that time.  And, you know, I've heard my grandmother say, well, things always happen and you have to move on.  So my father went, taught for a year in rural South Carolina.  Again, we lived in Johnston, South Carolina, right in the same county where Edgefield [South Carolina] is, Strom Thurman's county (laughter), Edgefield County, Edgefield, South Carolina.  Then he went on to get a masters degree from NYU [New York University, New York, New York] in the late '40s [1940s].  My sister was actually born in New York City [New York] at Harlem Hospital.  And then he took the teaching job at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And then some years later, he eventually finished his doctorate degree at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And he retired from Texas Southern after teaching there fifty years (laughter).  So in 19-, I guess '99 [1999], somewhere in that time period was when he retired from Texas Southern.
Story_ID: 21266
Speaker 1: Okay, let me get your parents [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr. and Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] together.  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I imagine they were in the hallway because they both taught at the same school.  And my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] was probably teaching there when my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] came in because my father finished college in '40 [1940].  My mother finished in 1945.  And she and her twin sister finished the same year.  Their father was a custodian at one of the elementary schools in Columbia [South Carolina].  So he sort of knew the superintendent and the superintendent said, I could hire one of your girls, but I can't hire both.  So with my mother being the youngest of the twins, her older sister took a job outside of Columbia.  And back then, you know, women roomed with other people.  They didn't have apartments or whatever.  So my mother got the job, luckily, 'cause I wouldn't be here teaching at a school called Booker T. Washington Heights Elementary School [now Watkins-Nance Elementary, Columbia, South Carolina].  And that's not to be confused with the Booker T. Washington High School that was in Columbia where both of my parents finished, but at different times.  So they obviously met there, and they were married in 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I assume that's how they met.  I don't think they knew each other before that time.  My mother had to be around eighth grade when my father finished high school, although they were in the same building because that high school went from seventh grade to the twelfth grade.  But she said she vaguely remember him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they met at Booker T. Washington Heights--
Speaker 2: Heights Elementary School.
Speaker 1: --Elementary School.  Okay.
Speaker 2: in Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right, now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have, my mother and father, there were three of us.  And then my father remarried.  She had two sons.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in the early days when your parents were together, it just--
Speaker 2: Just three.
Speaker 1: Just the three of you.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, and then I have a sister [Zenobia Thompson Guillory] who is maybe thirteen, fourteen months younger.  She was born in '48 [1948].  I was born in '46 [1946], and I have a brother [Robert Thompson] who was born in August of '49 [1949].  We were both born in Columbia, and my sister in between was born in New York [New York] when my father was working on his masters at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you think about your parents' dispositions and talents and their proclivities and their habits and their looks even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my relatives say I look more like my mother than my father.  But I've had people who will look at a younger picture and say I have my father's looks too, and definitely his mannerisms, you know, in terms of how I move my hands or whatever.  My father was a piano player.  And he played piano, mostly Jazz, though he took lessons.  He always told me that when he was twelve, his piano teacher could not teach him anymore.  He probably wanted to play Jazz more than classical.  And so there was musical talent on his side of the family.  His mother played a little piano, but he had cousins who were saxophonists.  And they, they played professionally.  They actually joined the military during World War II and played in the band.  My father wanted to join, but he didn't, and I think he evidently had some clash with some sergeant.  My father was a very outspoken person.  And he was probably called something that he didn't like, and he, he left.  And so he never served in the military.
Speaker 1: So was he drafted or did he join?
Speaker 2: They were, they actually wanted to join.  See, this had to be '41 [1941] 'cause my father was out of college in '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: Okay, during World War II.
Speaker 2: World War II, right, and they were trying to join the military band.  And his cousin did play in the [United States] Navy band, and he was a very good alto saxophonist.  And his, (unclear) Gaten, but his mother was a Pickney.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was a Gaten?
Speaker 2: He was a Gaten.  Gaten is--
Speaker 1: G-A-T-E-N?
Speaker 2: G-A-T-E-N, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as I mentioned, my dad was an only child, and his mother was an only child.
Story_ID: 21267
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember moving to Houston [Texas].  I had just turned three in October, 1949, and we moved to Texas, Christmas Day.  It was a train trip.  I remember coming through Atlanta [Georgia].  It was December.  It was very cold, and my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] had my sister [Zenobia Thompson Guillory] and I were walking, and my brother [Robert Thompson] was in her arms.  And my sister was not very cooperative.  She wouldn't let anyone help my mother.  But I remember that train trip just like it was yesterday, changing trains in Atlanta, changing trains in New Orleans [Louisiana].  My father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] met us that morning.  And I remember leaving Columbia [South Carolina].  I actually can remember back to about two and a half, two and a half because my grandmother lived in a two-story house.  And I remember swinging on the porch.  I don't remember when my father left to go to Texas 'cause he took the job in January of 1949, and we didn't move until late December of '49 [1949].  Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] was a very new school.  And so he took that job.  He had several offers.  He took Texas because it was a new adventure and the salaries were good, from what I understand, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, I can remember pretty far back.
Speaker 1: All right, so, Houston, Texas.  Now, is Texas Southern in the third ward or in the fifth ward or--
Speaker 2: It's third ward.
Speaker 1: Third ward, okay.
Speaker 2: It's third ward.  And I've often asked how was there so much property there in 1949, you know, 'cause it's a large, relatively large campus.  They've actually bought other, you've seen the campus.  I don't know if it was a forest preserve because there are pine trees on the campus which is very rare in Houston.  But as you move to East Texas, you see pine trees.  So the pine line sort of stops somewhere just a little bit west of Houston.  So East Texas looks more like Georgia than Texas.  And if you go up in East Texas, you see red dirt.  And then I mentioned the cities have some of the same names.  It's hot, it's humid.  As kids, we never really liked Texas, and I think it was because we didn't have relatives there.  And, you know, you couldn't fly overnight.  It was, it was a thirty-six hour drive.  And you're familiar with 'Ruth and the Green Book' [A children's book by Calvin Alexander Ramsey published in 2010].  We lived that because we couldn't stop anywhere to get food to eat.
Story_ID: 21268
Speaker 1: Explain what the Green Book [The Negro Motorist Green Book: An International Travel Guide] is.  Now, I know but explain it 'cause people watching this later on will not know.
Speaker 2: Well, 'Ruth and the Green Book,' well, the Green Book was a book that was, I think it was Mr. Green, I'm not sure exactly what his first name is, but it started in the '30s [1930s] if I'm not mistaken.  But it was a, it was a travel book for African American families.  It told them where they could stop and friendly places to get gasoline, where they could eat.  And a lot of people opened up their homes for overnight guests.  I actually have a copy of the book, and I looked for cities like Houston [Texas] and Columbia, South Carolina, and I recognized some of those black businesses and some of the homes of people that opened up their, their homes.  I've made copies for my daughters so they can know what we went through.  We, we had to make sure that where we bought gas, we could also use the restrooms.  I also remember my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] always carrying his gun.  That was the first thing he put in the car before we packed our suitcases.  And we were children.  We didn't both with pistols, but my father would always say, "Nelson, put my gun in the car."  It was always under the seat because we had to stop on the side of the road to sleep.  Many times we had to stop on the side of the road to relieve ourselves, and so we always had a four-door car 'cause those two doors would open and I'll never forget that my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] and sister [Zenobia Thompson Guillory] had to squat down out in, on the side of the road because they couldn't use these restrooms.  I remember a time where my father asked to use the restroom, the person was filling up the car with gas, and he said, no.  And my father said, "Stop it right there."  And he paid cash for it.  There were no credit cards then, you know.  So, but we never really had any serious incidents, you know.  We would go through small towns.  There were no interstate systems at that time.  And I always remember the, the cops, the sheriff following us from one city limit to the other, you know, when the speed limit was fifteen miles an hour.  You can barely coast through these small, Georgia, Alabama towns.  We never drove through the middle of Mississippi.  We always drove on the coastline, U.S. 90, Gulfport [Mississippi], Biloxi [Mississippi] because you only had to spend about 90 to 100 miles in Mississippi, although the rest of the South wasn't much better.  But Mississippi, you, back in the '50s [1950s], you didn't wanna spend any time in Mississippi, you know.  We didn't live there, so we didn't know, although we had friends there.  But it was a thirty-six hour drive.  So we had to pack our food and lunch.  We had to do the same thing on the train because in the South, the dining car was still segregated in the early '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 21269
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Rain.  When it rained, smelling the rain hitting the dirt.  I always remember that as a kid.  I remember the smell after lightning.  I didn't know what it was until I started taking science, and they explained to me that that's ozone, and I explained that to my students because the energy converts the oxygen to ozone.  And the ozone smells like a shortage, you know, when you're having an electrical shortage, that smell is ozone smell.  But as a kid I always wondered, why does it smell funny like this after lightening?  And so, and so it sort of got me interested in science.  I was always inquisitive as to why, you know, and if my parents [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr. and Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] couldn't answer the question, I was persistent.  I asked why or tried to find out the answer, you know, or they would try to get the answers for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what other sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: As a kid, I remember, well, we didn't have air conditioner in our homes back then, and in the car, so you could hear the honking horns when you were driving, kids playing out in the yard, things of that nature.  It wasn't a lot of loud music like we hear now, but just, just activities of people, people walking around.  For the first few years in Texas, we actually lived on the campus for about four years.  There was faculty housing there.  So, you know, we interacted with children of the other faculty members.  It was nothing to see the president of the university walking around, you know, or walking through the building.
Speaker 1: That was--I've been told that James Farmer's [James Leonard Farmer, Jr., civil rights activist] father, I think was associated with, was he around when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, I know he was at Wiley College [Marshall, Texas], 'cause you know, the movie they made, 'The Great Debaters,' and I didn't know that until I saw the movie, but I suspect he may have actually taught at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  I do know Tony Morrison taught there in the '50s [1950s], and my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] mentioned, she, she mentioned, went back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to teach her alma mater, but she taught English at Texas Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did hear that James Farmer was at Wiley [College] which was one of the top private schools back in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 21270
Speaker 1: Now, did you, when you were growing up, did your family take advantage of being near Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] for programs and I mean did the school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --bring lecturers in to--
Speaker 2: At my father's [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] memorial service, I spoke and my brother, half-brother spoke, and most of my talk was about the privilege of growing up on that campus during segregation because they had a nice big auditorium.  So we were able to go to plays, classical, ballet, things of that nature, speakers, things of that nature.  My father also worked in an area back then, now they call it media.  He was the audio visual instructor.  So he taught a lot of teachers in Houston [Texas].  That meant that they also showed films on campus for the students.  And so we got to see a lot of the movies (laughter), when, you know, a Friday night movie or Saturday night movie for free.  We just sat up in the balcony, but, yes, growing up on the campus was a very, very good experience.  And, you know, although we moved away to a subdivision later, we were still on the campus at least three or four times a week (laughter).  In fact, we got a lot of the campus.  And the library, I mentioned that in my father's memorial.  Because public libraries were segregated, they did have a few in the city [Houston, Texas], but we had access to the library on campus, and there was a children's library.  So waiting on our father, if he had a late class, we spent a lot of time in the library checking out children's books and things of that nature, in addition to doing the homework.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here.
Story_ID: 21271
Speaker 1: Yes, so I was asking you about your father's [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] AV [Audio Visual] responsibilities and you were just explaining all the different kinds of AV.
Speaker 2: He was over the library, the film library.  He, that's actually how he got that position because I think he, he had a certificate in photography.  During one of his summer stints, he worked for one of the army, Signal Corp or something.  It was a summer job.  So he, he always had cameras around.  I remember seeing the first videotape which was black and white (laughter).  In fact, he has, he made videotapes of my grandmother [Ella Evelyn Lewis Thompson] and all of us, you know.  And I'm glad we have that now because that was the only movement we have of my grandmother other than still pictures.  She didn't wanna do it, but we did it.
Speaker 1: That sounds like an exciting, you know, with him having all the access--
Speaker 2: Now, the drawback was that every teacher or every other teacher in Houston [Texas] knew me by my name, so I couldn't get away (laughter).  They would say, that's not your father.  And I'd say, yes, it is, and evidently, he was a very rigid teacher (laughter), very, very rigid and very demanding.  In fact, I'll tell you the story quickly, if you want to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] was in line to register for her masters at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], and another teacher asked her what was her schedule.  And she said, "There's a person who you do not wanna take this course from.  His name is Thompson."  And my mother said, "Okay (laughter).  Ten, fifteen years later, she found out that that was my father (laughter).  And my mother said to her, "Don't worry, he is very tough" (laughter).  She said, "I couldn't deny what you were saying."  But I was always asked that question.
Story_ID: 21272
Speaker 1: So did you go to elementary school on the campus [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have a lab school.  I went to a elementary, two different elementary schools, Blackshear and  [Savannah] Kay.  Blackshear was within walking distance of the school, and, but we didn't have a lab school like Southern and South Carolina State.
Speaker 1: So did you start at Blackshear?
Speaker 2: Yes, I started first grade when I was five.  My mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] didn't teach the first couple of years when she moved to Texas because she had three little children.  So she spent a lot of time teaching me.  And so she didn't send me to kindergarten because she said I could read and write.  So I went to first grade because I could read and write.  And I remember other teachers coming to the room to hear me read (laughter).  And I could print.  I didn't write.  I could print.  And that was good.  The bad thing was that I was always the youngest in the class and the smallest (laughter).  So, 'cause there were kids who were, had already turned seven, you know.  And I was five years old.  So I just turned six before I went to second grade.  So it was, I was always the baby in the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your classmates like you?  How were you able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, most of my friends liked me.  Yeah, you know, as I went up to high school, they said that I was a little stand offish, but once they got to know me, they really did like me.  And they gave me nicknames and things of that nature, so I had some very good friends in high school.  I played in band in high school.  I was part of the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps].  So I was pretty active, you know, a lot of after-school programs.
Speaker 1: Now, in grade school, now, you come from an academic family.  So, I mean, so was school easy for you, you know?
Speaker 2: Science was easy for me, math was moderate.  I, my toughest subject was always English.  I, when I think back, English.  And, now, you know, I think I write pretty well.  I just resisted it.  I resisted memorizing things.  I was, I never entered the Spelling Bee because I didn't want to memorize words.  I enjoyed, things that I enjoyed, I did well in it.  I knew my time tables.  I didn't memorize my time tables, but I knew that multiplication was a process of addition, and I remember the teacher making me sit down because I could go on and on and on.  And she said, "You haven't memorized your time tables."  No, I hadn't, but I was adding numbers (laughter), so I was penalized for my process, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, I remember my, I remember my first grade teacher, you know.  It, it puzzles me when people say they don't remember their teachers, and evidently, they didn't have a good experience.  But I remember my first grade teacher, my second grade teacher.  We were, they were, you know, like mothers to me.  Third grade teacher, it was not a great experience.  She spanked a lot (laughter), but I had a second half third grade teacher who I thought was much better 'cause I changed schools, and I went from Blackshear to Kay.  And fifth, fourth, fifth and sixth grade teachers, they were great.  I think my sixth grade teacher was the one that really guided me toward science.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you move from Blackshear to Kay?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother transferred to another school, and we had moved from the Blackshear area to another section.  So I really wasn't eligible to attend Blackshear anymore.  But because my mother taught at Kay--I didn't live in Kay's area, she was able to bring us over to that school.  So, again, I was at a school where I was still under my mother's umbrella.  So we were always (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, was Kay a predominantly black school?
Speaker 2: Everything was predominantly black (laughter) then.  I finished high school in '64 [1964].  Integration didn't occur until maybe '65 [1965], '66 [1966], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Savannah Kay, was that a black educator?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  Her name was Savannah Georgia Kay, interesting name because whenever I went to South Carolina and my grandfather would take us around the neighborhood, and he'd say, tell them where you go to school.  And I'd say Savannah Georgia Kay, and he would say, you don't live in Savannah, Georgia.  I said, but that was the lady's name (laughter).  And she was the principal of an older elementary school, and when they built the new school, they named it for her.  It was in the section called the Harrisburg section of Houston [Texas] near the ship channel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So we got a mixture.  I was, that was a neighborhood that had a lot of longshoremen's children.  It was more of a transit neighborhood, but, you know, we were able to mix with a wide range of children.
Story_ID: 21273
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were first exposed to science in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Sixth grade, and when I think about it, but I mean I was always involved with little projects with my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.], you know.  We had, we had to assist him.  We had to work, you know.  We learned tools, and my father believed in, what you call 'handyman' type jobs, you know.  His philosophy was, why pay someone for something that you can do, and you're gonna learn to do this.  But I would say the sixth grade, my sixth grade teacher had a science project.  And I sort of took the lead there, and I remember having to improvise something.  And, and I grew up during the Sputnik [Russian satellite launched in 1957] era, was it '57 [1957], '58 [1958].  And there was a call scientists, and being black, I never thought that that's something I couldn't do because I grew up in an environment where we were always encouraged.  And so I said, I'm gonna be a scientist.  I didn't know chemist, but I wanted to be a scientist, and I learned later that there are physicists, mathematicians, chemists, engineers.  I just said, scientist, you know.  And so sixth grade was called junior high back then.  I took mainly biology courses, and I didn't like biology (laughter) at all.  I went to high school, and I took biology in the tenth grade, and, you know, I passed it.  I did okay, but I didn't like it.  It was the eleventh grade when I took chemistry.  And I remember staying up, you know, staying up till 11:00 at night was pretty late, working chemistry problems, and I just enjoyed it, balancing equations, working chemistry problems.  So I excelled in chemistry, and I did well in physics in the twelfth grade.  So I knew then that I wanted to be in chemistry.  I met Dr. Wilson when I was in high school.  He came to a career fair at our high school.
Speaker 1: This is Dr. Ray Wilson?
Speaker 2: Dr. Ray Wilson, yes, and talked about--
Speaker 1: He's--
Speaker 2: --talked about the field of chemistry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's the chemistry professor at, former chair of the department at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Texas Southern, that's right.
Speaker 1: --back in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: And he's somebody that we've interviewed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, so he was on the campus, and you knew him before you--
Speaker 2: Yes, my parents [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson and Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] knew him, you know, and we knew his, we knew his first wife 'cause she was a chemistry teacher in high school and actually, I found out later that they published papers together, yeah.  But, you know, Dr. Wilson always talked about his advisor at U.T. [University of Texas] Austin, which was Aires, who was an analytical chemist who wrote several books.  And so after he went to U.T. Austin, several of his former students went to U.T. Austin.  I decided I wanted to leave Texas (laughter), and so, you know, they thought I was gonna go to U.T. Austin.  And I would say at least eight, eight of the Texas Southern persons did PhDs at U.T. Austin.  I decided I wanted to go East, and I chose Howard University to do my degree.  I, although I had been accepted at other, other graduate schools--
Story_ID: 21274
Speaker 1: Well, I don't wanna get you there.  I want get you to high school--
Speaker 2: Okay, Wheatley, yes.
Speaker 1: --high school first.  So, you know, and we can't skip over the great Phyllis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Let me tell you about, now, I went to William Miller Junior High School [Houston, Texas] 'cause I went to Savannah Kay Elementary [Houston, Texas].  And I, based on where I lived, I should have attended E. O. Smith Junior High which is in the Fifth Ward.  What's the boxer's name?  He went there, George Foreman.  But I went to Miller.  It was a new school, well, it wasn't new.  Third Ward was going through a transition in the late '50s [1950s].  Whites were moving out, blacks were moving in.  They always lived in Third Ward, but they lived more where the Elgin Street.  Then they started moving to that area where a lot of the Battlestein's, the store owners lived, the Sackowitz's, and mostly Jewish families.  And that's another story about housing, Jewish versus, you know, Anglo-Saxons.  So anyway, I went to Miller.  It was Albert Sidney Johnson High School, and in the transition, it became William Miller High School.  I don't know who it was named for.  So around 1958, it became a black school.  And I spent three years there.  I should have gone on to Yates because Yates was the feeder school.  I mean Miller fed Yates.  My father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] felt that I should go to Wheatley, which was in the neighborhood.  He said I should go to the school in the neighborhood where, you know, there were kids I grew up with.  He also felt that I should go to a school where it was not as elitist (laughter).  And, and so my junior high classmates or they may have been a few years behind me, were a guy named Tex Allen, whose sisters, Debbie Allen, Felicia Allen, they all went to Miller Junior High.  Some of the musicians like the Laws, I mean [Herbert] Hubie Laws--
Speaker 1: Ronnie Laws.
Speaker 2: Ronnie Laws, yeah, they all lived in the Third Ward area.  And my father looked at Wheatley's history, and Wheatley had turned out quite a few good graduates.  And I didn't want to go to Wheatley because my friends were going to Yates.  Well, here's a case where my father's decision was the best because I went to Wheatley, and I really did thrive at Wheatley.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Houston people really talk about those high schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Wheatley, Yates, there used to be a big Thanksgiving game there for years, and, and the reason they had to stop the Thanksgiving games because after integration, the play-offs had to occur before Thanksgiving.  But we would get thirty-five thousand people in the stands and maybe another five or ten thousand just around the track, and that was the annual--
Speaker 1: For the Phyllis Wheatley and Jack Yates High School--
Speaker 2: --and Jack Yates High School and Wheatley.  I know Jack Yates' name for Yates who was the minister at Antioch Baptist Church.  And I heard he came from Virginia, but we knew his daughters.  Yeah, they were the Yates.  The Yates family ran a printing company in Houston [Texas], and their house is, is a historical house.  It's sitting somewhere near downtown.  Antioch is still there.  The city has tried to buy it, but it's in the shadows of the skyscrapers.  That's old Fourth Ward.  That was the black business area, which is no longer there, and Fourth Ward is very adjacent to River Oaks, which is a very rich neighborhood, you know, where the Bushes [Presidents George Bush] and things of that nature.  And I know why it's there because the black servants could easily get to the mansions in River Oaks.
Story_ID: 21275
Speaker 1: But I loved Wheatley [Phyllis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], and it took me about a semester to say this is the best place for me.  I thrived in the band there, and--
Speaker 2: Now, what did you play in the band?
Speaker 1: Clarinet in high school.  In college, I played both clarinet and saxophone.  But clarinet was what I--we, we played music at home.  My father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] played piano, and I played clarinet.  My brother [Robert Thompson] played drums, and my sister [Zenobia Thompson Guillory] played the cello.  So we had this dream of maybe this Thompson quartet or whatever.  My mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] wasn't a musician.  She didn't sing and they would always ask my mother what was her job.  And she said to keep them fed and keep them healthy (laughter).  But when we had company over, we always entertained my parents' company by playing or singing.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you, were you--did you run for office in high school?
Speaker 1: Let me see, Student Council, probably.  It wasn't president, but it was some student council office.  I didn't win (laughter), but I had an elected office in the band, you know, in the band club.  I was a part of some of the social clubs, sort of operating like high school fraternities.  But, yeah, we wore blazers and things of that nature.
Speaker 2: Did you have a name, what's the name of your group?
Speaker 1: It was called the Knights of the Purple Shield and Wheatley's colors were purple and white.  And every other school, after that club was formed--it was there when I got there, they had a very similar club that wore blazers and they had a little medallion, you know.  And it was sort of the group that the younger boys looked up to.  You know, you couldn't join until you were in eleventh grade or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you, how were your grades?  Did you rank high in the class?
Speaker 1: I, I was, I finished with honors in high school, and I was the first boy, above me there were maybe nine girls (laughter).  And so I was the highest ranking boy, but the girls were higher.  But I was a very active, I played in the band and track for a little while.  So, you know, I had a good mixture of, you know, academics.  But I was probably, in my class, I know I was the top science student, top science student.  So I made "A's in physics and chemistry.  Biology, I made B's (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is, you graduated in 1964.
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hum.
Story_ID: 21276
Speaker 1: Okay, and now you said now, it, was your father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.], did your father continue his activities in Civil Rights in those days?
Speaker 2: No, he basically, it was none.  No marches.  I remember the sit-in's at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  I was still in maybe junior high.  They followed Greensboro [Greensboro sit-ins, 1960], and actually, we knew, we knew the family of one of the young men who started the sit-in's.  It was at Weingarten's which was a grocery store in Houston [Texas] that had a lunch counter there.  And it was right across the street from Miller Junior High School.  So I remember the protest signs and, you know, the picket signs and things of that nature.  And we actually boycotted the store.  We wouldn't buy, buy food from the store.  What Weingarten's did, they just took the lunch counters out, period, and had what you call the take out.  That's how they dealt with that situation.  But I remember the downtown five and ten's, Woolworth's, Kresge [S.S. Kresge Co.], Grants, having lunch counters that said "for colored only", usually in the basement, and upstairs, they had the regular lunch counters.  Yeah, I remember those signs.  I remember the bus signs, you know, the back of the bus, you know.  So we didn't ride the bus very often, and I think that was because of the segregation, you know.  I don't remember my father riding the bus until well into the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Now, there was a story I heard about how the buses were desegregated in Houston.  Do you have a story about that at all?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, it--from what I remember, it occurred after Montgomery [Alabama].  Montgomery was '55 [1955], but it had occurred without incident from what I understand, you know.  Just all of a sudden, there was an announcement that there was no more segregation on the buses, but there was a little sign there, right behind that back door that had white and colored, and it was a little small section in the back, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you ever encounter time, you know, that was a crisis, getting on a bus in Houston?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was an incident, and I was a little boy.  I'll never forget that.  I took a seat in the front, and I think my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] and brother [Robert Thompson] and sister [Zenobia Thompson Guillory] moved to the back.  And I didn't really know what was going on until the bus driver said, "Hop up, son."  And I did move back with my mother, and what happened was this woman said to the bus driver, "I can't sit here next to him."  I remember that.  But I didn't, I didn't know what was happening until I got off the bus, and my mother explained to me what happened.  And I remember my mother saying, "Let's not tell your daddy about this."  (Laughter)  And so we never told him.  I never told him, you know, even later in life, but it probably would have made him very mad, mad at us also (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so he just avoided riding the bus.
Speaker 2: That's what he did.  And, and so we did not go to any carnivals, things of that nature.  We didn't go to any movie theaters and sit in the balcony.  You know, I told you we saw the movies at, at the campus [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  But when I went to South Carolina in the summer, and I was with my cousins, we would go to the movies and we would sit in the balcony, but never told our parents about that, you know, 'cause I was in South Carolina with my cousins.  But I know that he wouldn't have approved of us doing that.  He said, you know, you don't spend your money where you're not welcome.  That was his philosophy.
Story_ID: 21277
Speaker 1: Okay, now, all right.  So in 1964, you graduated.
Speaker 2: Yes, from high school.
Speaker 1: From Phyllis Wheatley [Phyllis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], and you went right on to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  Now, did you ever have a thought that you wanted to get out of town and go someplace else?
Speaker 2: I did, actually.  I didn't start out at Texas Southern.  I went to West Virginia State [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], and because I had a cousin there from New York [New York].  And I, I stayed one academic year, and then I came back.  And then actually, I came back, I didn't come directly to Texas Southern.  I went to Prairie View because I didn't want to attend the school where my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] was (laughter).  So, you know, and so I did two and a half additional years there, and then I was getting drafted, around '67 [1967] was coming up, Vietnam.  And I was going up and down, drafting, getting a deferment, back and forth.  And so eventually I had to go in the military.  I got out in '72 [1972] and finished my degree and really a semester (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, what happened in your military life?
Speaker 2: In my military, I went in as an enlisted person.  I ended up as an E5 when I got out.
Speaker 1: This is the Navy then, right?
Speaker 2: No, the Army?
Speaker 1: Army?
Speaker 2: I went to the Army.  I didn't go very far.  I went to Fort Polk, Louisiana for basic, Fort Sam Houston for the medical training corp, and 'cause I had this chemistry degree.  And so I was a laboratory technician in the military, in the hospital.  And I rose to NCO in charge of the blood bank in the military.  And so I, what I did actually, I signed up for three years so I wouldn't have to do combat, but I got out in two years and two months (laughter), during that period Nixon [President Richard Nixon] was giving an early out.  I got out in January of '72 [1972], enrolled in school, got out that Friday and enrolled back in school Monday and basically finished my degree in one semester.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't, you never left the country or anything?
Speaker 2: Never let the country, no.
Speaker 1: This is during the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: But my youngest brother, well, younger brother at that time, did go to Vietnam, and he spent thirteen months there.  So we both could not be there at the same time.  I was on orders to go to Germany, but that never happened.  And so, he got out of, he went in before I did, and he got out--I got out in January.  He got out in April of '72 [1972].  So he spent more time than I did.  So, so I never experienced Vietnam except, you know, seeing the persons come back injured.
Story_ID: 21278
Speaker 1: So then in 1972, you go back to Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Texas Southern, and I actually--I didn't really march until '73 [1973], but I finished all of the coursework in '72 [1972].  And since I was early in finishing the coursework, I just went on and began graduate courses.  I had the GI Bill, and I said I need to just continue on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, let's see, so you go on to--so you got your BS in '73 [1973].  And, well, tell us about, now, Texas Southern, you said that Ray Wilson was like a mentor to you there.
Speaker 2: He was, he--
Speaker 1: And so what is your relationship with Ray Wilson and just talk about, you know, that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I did meet him when I was in high school.  And I didn't know what type of chemistry he did.  I do know that he was a person who received a lot of grants.  I remember reading, you know, the Welch Foundation grants, National Science Foundation.  I didn't know, you know, you read the titles of his grants.  I didn't know what it was all about.  But he taught me a physical chem course as an undergraduate when I returned from the military.  And then he taught, I actually took four courses from him, physical chemistry as an undergraduate and physical chemistry as a graduate student.  And I was his research student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did a masters under him.
Speaker 1: So what was he like?  Now, he's quite a personality.  We've interviewed him--
Speaker 2: Yes, (laughter).  I guess, very demanding, but you have to be independent to work with him 'cause he's not gonna be in there holding your hands in the laboratory.  You know, he gives you deadlines and expect you to have your work, but he was very supportive.  I remember in my masters defense, there was a question asked, and he would not allow them to put me in that block of answering that question.  So he was totally in charge.  So I felt very, very comfortable.  I remember rewriting the thesis several times (laughter), you know, I came in with it typed, not written, and I remember him just tearing it apart, you know.  And so, I just went back and retyped it and redid it, maybe about three or four times until he got to the point where he said, this looks good, but I want someone else to read it (laughter).  And so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, let's see.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, he was instrumental in supporting me because I taught there at Texas Southern one year after I got my masters.  And I, and I'm certain--he never told me, but I'm certain that he supported me, he and another guy named Edward Booker, who's no longer living now, because I was a tutor at Texas Southern.  And so they knew I did a pretty good job of helping students, and they thought I would be a good teacher.  So I spent one year teaching chemistry laboratories and physical science course to non-science majors.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Texas Southern doesn't offer a PhD in chemistry?
Speaker 2: Not in chemistry, but after I left, Bobby Wilson started a doctoral program in toxicology, which is, you know, closely related to chemistry.
Story_ID: 21279
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so did Professor [Ray] Wilson advise you about Howard [University]?
Speaker 2: He did, and the thing that helped me make the decision was, there was a visitor from Howard who came and gave a seminar.  And I guess based on the questions that I asked him, he, after the seminar, he asked me what were my plans?  And I said, I'm not certain.  He said, well, why don't you apply to Howard?  I said, well, I hadn't thought about it.  I had received, you know, some offers from other schools.  And he said, well, just send me a letter, and I'll send you an application back.  And I filled it out, and I heard from him in about two weeks.  And he said, send your transcript up and within about a month, I was accepted.
Speaker 1: Now, is this Dr. [Lloyd] Ferguson?
Speaker 2: No, he had left Howard.  It was Moddie Taylor, Moddie Taylor--
Speaker 1: Moddie Taylor, okay.
Speaker 2: --was the chair.  Now, interestingly, when I got to Howard, he was no longer the chair (laughter).  And so I said, oh, this man got me up here, and he's, he's no longer the chair.  But the new chair was Dr. Joseph Morris who was also a great mentor to me also.  But I did meet Lloyd Ferguson, you know, later 'cause he had, he left and went out to Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, California]
Speaker 1: Right, right.  He just passed away last year.
Speaker 2: I always tell the story to people when I give talks about African Americans in chemistry, Lloyd Taylor, I mean Lloyd Ferguson wrote several textbooks, undergraduate and graduate textbooks.  And in '64 [1964] when they were rioting at Mississippi, they were using Lloyd Ferguson's textbook in the graduate level.  One of my other mentors, Peter Hambright, who did his degree at the University of Chicago, said he used Ferguson's book as a graduate student at Chicago.  So that just tells you something about the quality of his textbooks back then.
Speaker 1: I think I'll repeat what, you might have heard this that people say that when black students would try to get into the southern colleges, Lloyd Ferguson was already in there with his textbooks.
Speaker 2: With his textbooks, and it's true.  That is true, yeah.  That is really truth (laughter).
Speaker 1: We're gonna pause here again.
Speaker 2: Although there's a story about a person who attended the University of Mississippi before [James] Meredith.  I don't know if you, but his name was Murphy, very fair-skinned black person who lived in Atlanta [Georgia].  And one of his relatives worked at AU [Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was in 'JET' ['JET Magazine'] some years back where he showed this I.D.  And it, but he only stayed there a semester because he feared they might find that I'm black, you know, kill me.  But he was actually a student there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I have to look that, yeah, check that out.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Murphy is his last name.
Story_ID: 21280
Speaker 1: All right.  We're ready to roll.  Okay, so, Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and you're working on your doctorate--
Speaker 2: Doctorate degree, yes.
Speaker 1: So, and this is in organic chemistry?
Speaker 2: Inorganic.
Speaker 1: Inorganic.
Speaker 2: Inorganic is my area, which essentially means not organic (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  So when I say it fast, and so (unclear) understand (unclear), (simultaneous)--, it's in--
Speaker 2: In, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So inorganic chemistry.  So, now, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Synthesis of water soluble porphyrins, and that's spelled P-O-R-P-H-Y-R-I-N-S, porphyrins.  And these are biological-like compounds, very similar to heme that you find in blood, chlorophyll and there are many books written about it.  And it's called the, some of the books talk about the colors of life because these are highly colored compounds.  And we made some synthetic compounds.  In fact, my professor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] always joked about moving into a neighborhood and a person heard that he was a very famous--he studied porphyrins.  And so the woman didn't know what that meant.  She thought he was a sociologist and she wanted to know did someone study "rich friends" since he studied porphyrins (laughter).  And people said, that sounds like a chemistry joke or it would be a chemist.  It's very funny to us (laughter).  And he told that story at a conference and everyone just fell out.
Speaker 1: So porphyrins are responsible for the red color of hemoglobin, I believe?
Speaker 2: Yes, the heme.
Speaker 1: The heme.
Speaker 2: The heme, right, because there's iron there, and that's where you get the red color.  Chlorophyll has magnesium.  Certain worms or fish might have different metals there, and so that's why you might see blue transport.  It, the, it transports oxygen in your body, in your living systems.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, well, what did you find out about them that was new that was--
Speaker 2: Well, we were, in our research, we were synthesizing new ones, new water soluble systems.  Porphyrins are also used in cancer treatment.  It's called photo-dynamic therapy.  So you're looking at a variety of water soluble ones that could probably be ingested or injected in the body for cancer, localized treatment that maybe have low toxicities, things of that nature.  And so it's known that these compounds accumulate in cancer-type cells.  And because they are very dynamic compounds, you can shine laser light on that once it's accumulated in the tumor cells, and it will kill the cells and not kill the other cells because it only accumulates there.  Now, that works because it excites oxygen in a high oxidation state, and that excitation kills the cells.  So when you shine light on something, you're sending electrons to different orbitals (ph.), and when they fall back down, they give off energy.  And that energy kills the cells.  And so there is a company that's called Photopfrin (ph.) and was formed by a chemist who was a porphyrin chemist.  I think he's now in British Columbia [Canada].  And so it's used quite a bit in addition to the traditional drugs like Cisplatinum which is very toxic.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: And there are other uses also, but, you know, that's, that's medical.  It's probably one of the most important.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were working on your PhD, did you, was this, you know, I mean what would be your typical day in the laboratory.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  The first year was mainly coursework.  Because I had a masters, I transferred some of the coursework.  I actually began research the second semester of my first year.  So I was able to finish my degree in three years which is kind of unusual.  Now, it's five to seven years, and so beginning that first summer, I was basically in the lab from maybe 9:00 [a.m.] until 9:00 at night (laughter).  And the next year, I only took a few courses, so basically 9:00 to 9:00 was a typical day, some weekends.  Sometimes you spent late nights in the laboratory because you had to monitor experiments, and you needed a block of maybe six hours.  You didn't need any interruptions.  If you were running some low-temperature experiments, you had to make sure that it was not run in the day when it was very hot (laughter), you know.  So sometimes I would leave the lab at 5:00 in the morning, you know, go there at maybe 10:00 at night, leave at 5:00 in the morning.  And so, that's a typical day of a graduate student.  In addition to that, you know, you may be teaching some under graduate laboratories.  I was fortunate enough to get a MARC Fellowship from NIH [National Institutes of Health] which is which is Minority Access to Research Careers which meant I was able to teach less and devote more time to research.  So there were several of us who were sort of on an accelerated track.  They expected us to finish in three to four years (laughter), and back then the fellowships were maybe five thousand to seven thousand a year which was not bad money in the mid-'70s [1970s].  Graduate students are now getting thirty thousand plus on some fellowships.  But probably in today's money, it's probably the same.
Story_ID: 21281
Speaker 1: Okay, so after graduation--now, you graduated in 1978--
Speaker 2: Seventy eight [1978], the summer of '78 [1978].  I didn't march until that spring, but actually, you know, when you defend your PhD, you're through.  You're Dr. Thompson, and I had a post-doc offer at Drexel [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I had a offer at Rohm and Haas [subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company], my second offer at Rohm and Haas.  I had an offer at Rohm and Haas in Houston [Texas] after I finished my masters.  I had an offer at Rohm and Haas in Pennsylvania after I finished my doctorate.  I decided to go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I, at that time, I knew that teaching was the area I wanted to go in with a tremendous cut in salary (laughter).  It's not a cut if you never had it.  So I started out at Fisk at about fourteen thousand dollars a year versus twenty-five thousand in industry.  But I did enjoy teaching, and I enjoyed the two years that I spent at Fisk.
Speaker 1: Now, what's, that is low for those days.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: I can remember as a, I was a CEDA worker for the City of Dayton then, you know, with the government-supported CEDA program, mid-management, making twelve [twelve thousand dollars].  So that--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --so fourteen [thousand dollars] for a man with a PhD is low I would think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's low.  An HBCU [Historically Black College or University] that was probably--and Fisk was having some financial issues at that time.  And that was the reason I left.  I spent one year at Fayetteville State [Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina], and I was boosted up to twenty thousand immediately.  And I only spent one year there because I didn't see the growth that I wanted there.  It was more of a military town, Fort Bragg [U.S. Army base located mostly in Fayetteville, North Carolina].  For my professional meetings, I had to either drive to Raleigh, Chapel Hill or Durham [North Carolina].  And so when there was an opportunity to leave, I came to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did that opportunity arrive?
Speaker 2: It was an advertised position, and I applied.  I applied for the position.  And I was considering maybe even going back, doing a post-doc at that time, and I took the tenure track position.
Story_ID: 21282
Speaker 1: Okay, we also have a note here that you became a faculty research fellow at the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine [San Antonio, Texas].  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yes, that summer before I left Fayetteville [Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] and came to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I spent that summer in San Antonio, Texas.  And so I did research with a Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] grad who did his masters under Lloyd Woods and Ray Wilson was his teacher also.  His name was Dr. Lovelady, which is very interesting (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Dr. Lovelady.
Speaker 2: Lovelady, yes, and--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind his name?
Speaker 2: No, that's a family name.  He's from very close to Dr. Wilson's area, Giddings, Texas.  That's where Dr. Wilson is from.  There is a Lovelady, Texas, but it's in East, Texas.  In fact, when he would call me at Spelman, we had a switchboard operator.  We didn't have direct calls, and the switchboard operator stopped me one day.  And she said, "There's a Dr. Lovelady calling you and leaving a message.  Is that really his name?"  I said, yes, that is his name.  So were looking at porphyrins as a detector for Hydrazine.  Hydrazine is a chemical that's used in jet engines.  If the engine flames out, they need to start it up very quickly, and Hydrazine is there to start it up very quickly instead of the fuel.  But it's a very toxic and possibly a carcinogen.  So they needed a way to detect leakages.  And so we were looking at different compounds that could maybe form colors, and they could know if the Hydrazine was leaking or something 'cause the people on the flight path, you know, were exposed to that.  So, and, you know, they also looked at other medical research there.  There was a centrifuge, 'cause, you know, the pilots had to come there every so often and get retraining and experience, you know, several G's of force, things of that nature.  And, in fact, I met a German scientist there, and I can't think of his name, but he was a German from World War II who came over and helped set up that School of Aerospace Medicine, just like [Wernher] Von Braun [German born rocket scientist/aerospace engineer] did, you know, come in Huntsville [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Hermann Oberth [Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and engineer considered one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics]and--
Speaker 2: Yes, so I met him, and I actually have a book where he signed his name, you know.  But that place is shut down.  I think it was taken over by a private company in San Antonio [Texas].  But I know the Air Force no longer runs it.  Brook Air Force Base was a non-flight place.  It was just a research facility.  They had some old flight paths there, but they never used it.
Story_ID: 21283
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], did Spelman have a reputation in the sciences when you came?
Speaker 2: They were building, and that was what was impressive to me.  There was a division chair, and I guess I'm in her position now, Dr. Etta Faulkner.  She was a mathematician, and she interviewed me.  She knew that I had gotten some research grants before coming to Spelman.  I had some grants when I as at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I was probably, you know, I think I came at a time when the President, Donald Stewart, was trying to bring more black males in.  In fact, there was a professor here by the name of Bill LaFleur who taught biology, an African American from Mobile, [Alabama].  Interestingly, our life's paralleled because his father was involved in Civil Rights back in Mobile, Alabama.  But he, and he was taught by Lloyd Woods at St. Augustine College [Raleigh, North Carolina] and Lloyd Woods was the chair of chemistry when I graduated from Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  But he was saying, I'm glad to see you come here, you know, and have more males here.  But Spelman had started the dual degree program with Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] some years earlier.  And so we were building.  I liked the fact that we had quite a few science majors here.  We were about third, about 1,500 students when I came here.  We're over 2,000 now.  But at least 400 to 500 of the majors here were science.  And I had never taught at a school where there were so many science majors, you know, mathematics, chemistry, engineering.  We didn't have physics, but we have that now.  We have computer science now.  So, I would say within '81 [1981] to '91 [1991], we were known around the country for turning out young ladies who were able to go on and get graduate degrees.  When I came here, I think in '81 [1981], we had maybe three young ladies who had gotten PhDs in chemistry.  We now have over fifty who have gotten PhDs in chemistry.  In fact, one just emailed me this morning.  She finished Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill].  She's in Illinois.  We had one who is a professor at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] now with tenure.  We have one at Delaware [University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware], one at Cal-State, L.A [California State University, Los Angeles].  These are all chemistry grads, you know, who have gone on to get PhDs around the country.  A few have finished Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], four at Chapel Hill, three or four at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], one at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], just places all around the country, Colorado; some have done work in atmospheric sciences, been to the South Pole, things of nature.  So we're very proud that our young ladies have gone off and done well.  We have maybe about twelve who are now in PhD programs, now.  We've finally got two to go to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] with Isaiah Warner.  You know, he was here at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] at one time, and he went back to LSU.
Speaker 1: He's a colleague of yours here in the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, through the ACS [American Chemical Society], but I knew him before.  I knew him when he was at Texas A and M [Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University, College Station, Texas], and I met him at the Black Chemists Society--are you familiar with NOBCChE, National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers?  That's when I met him.  I had considered trying to do a post-doc with him when I was gonna leave Fisk.  And Sharon Neal who's at Delaware did her degree with him at, when he was at Emory.  And so, so we've had some success.  We have a young lady who's a candidate for PhD at LSU.  We just sent one down this year to LSU.  And they're just everywhere (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you're building upon, you know, the reputation was building--
Speaker 2: That's true, that's true.
Speaker 1: --when you came on board.  In '86 [1986], you submitted a paper to the National Science Foundation called 'Acid Precipitation at Southeastern--
Speaker 2: --Urban Sites', right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, the reason I got into that, 'cause my area of PhD was porphyrins.  And I submitted a grant and wasn't funded, became a little disillusioned, and I met some people who were at Georgia Tech, some tennis partners 'cause I played tennis for a while and a former Fisk colleague, Ron Mickens, you've probably interviewed who teaches at Clark Atlanta [Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  We were, started, I started tennis when I was at Howard and then Fisk, and I met these guys.  And they were in atmospheric sciences and so they said, well, Al, why don't you consider looking at a project in acid rain.  So we submitted a grant to NSF [National Science Foundation] and it was funded.  Spelman was the lead institution, and we had, we subcontracted Georgia Tech.  So that was funded for about three years.  What happened, at the same time that I submitted the acid rain proposal, I submitted another proposal for the porphyrins, and they both were funded (laughter).  So, I had two grants going at the same time, and we didn't have this nice building then.  Our research project was out at the Milligan Building that belonged to the Atlanta University Center at the time, but now Spelman bought it.  So I was back and forth between this little building we have over here, and there, trying to run two projects, one here and one there.  But I had money for student support, didn't have a post-doc or a research technician, but eventually, I got one.  So after the acid rain project, I devoted my time back to my original research effort.  And my advisors at Howard were sort of glad that I did that (laughter), and I've co-published some papers with them and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 21284
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right.  So, in 1990, you were a visiting professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison [Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: You were there for the whole year?
Speaker 2: No, I spent the fall semester.  I was scheduled to go in January of 1990, and they advised me that I should wait until the winter is gone, to come there in the summer and let the winter come on me, not coming to the winter.  At the time, Donna Schalala was President of Madison, University of Wisconsin.  She and Johnnetta Cole [first African American female president of Spelman College from 1987-1997] were very close friends because they worked together at Hunter College [New York, New York].  I think Donna Schalala is in her third presidency because she was president of Hunter College.  She's now at Miami [University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida].  So we had a sort unofficial faculty exchange program.  There were professors from Wisconsin who came here.  One wrote a biochemistry book, 'Lehninger' ['Principals of Biochemistry'], David Nelson, and in fact, he acknowledged some of his experience at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in his biochemistry book.  He redid the 'Lehninger', which was a very well-known biochemistry book.  We had a mathematics professor to come here.  I went up there, and I taught there for a year and did research with one of the professors, Art Ellis, who eventually became director of chemistry as NSF [National Science Foundation].  And then he went to U-C, San Diego [University of California, San Diego].  So I think that's how that came about.  But it's interesting, when I was an undergraduate at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University], they had a collaborative program with Wisconsin.  So when I went to Wisconsin, they met me, found out I finished Texas Southern.  And they were asking me about people I knew back at Texas Southern (laughter).  And so it was really interesting, some of the science faculty members.  So it was a good experience.  I taught a class that had more than 300 students in it.  It was the largest I ever taught, about four African Americans in the entire class, nice facilities, nice support.  But it was an adjustment because I didn't get the interaction with students that I have here.  So, no question and answer--
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Three hundred students.  It's just very difficult.  You're with a microphone, you know, and how do you give credit to 300 students, you know (laughter).  You never learn their names.  In fact, David Nelson said when he spent--he spent a year here.  He said this was the best experience because when he wrote a recommendation letter for someone from Spelman, he actually knew that student, not just on the grades and, you know, papers.  He actually, personally--he could write that in the letter.
Speaker 1: Well, that's very, that's sad, it's really sad that somebody would have to recommend someone they don't know.
Speaker 2: That's right, you don't know, right, you don't know them, unless they were someone who talked every day, you know.  And then that was a small class.  There were some that had 400 and 500 students in it.
Story_ID: 21285
Speaker 1: Okay, now in '92 [1992], you became the chair--
Speaker 2: Chair of the chemistry department.
Speaker 1: --of the Chemistry Department.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  And I did that for two terms, '92 [1992] up until '98 [1998].  And I wanted to get back to my research.  During that period that I was chair, I had so much to do with administrative duties, I really couldn't get involved with research.  I felt a little bad about it because I didn't have the time to spend with students, that I did (laughter), as you know, a regular instructor.  I was lucky enough to get a research, post-doc to come here to work with me.  She was in the same research area I was in.  She was a summer student in one of the programs we had earlier in the '80s [1980s].  She was a University of [The] Virgin Islands [St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands] grad.  We brought her here one summer when she was a junior.  She eventually went to Southern Cal [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] to do her PhD.  So she spent some years with us.  She actually took an assistant professorship here, and then she went on to take a job at Georgia College in Milledgeville [Georgia].  She had an endowed chair.  She runs some educational programs as well as she teaches chemistry there.  And so, so that, so I stepped down from that position in '98 [1998].  But I was doing a lot of administrative work because I was running a big grant (laughter).  So we had a large grant from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] called the Model Institutions for Excellence [MIE] Program.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was the co-PI.  Dr. [Etta] Faulkner was the PI.  When she retired in '02 [2002], I continued as the PI for that program.  It was an eleven-year funded program.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you got a NASA, this is--okay, we just talked about NASA.
Speaker 2: That was the MIE program.  It was funded by NASA, yes, and a very comprehensive program.  We were invited to Washington [D.C.], Minority Serving Institutions, that's Native American, black, Hispanic.  I think about sixty to seventy schools were invited for a forum on this program.  This was a program that I think was initiated by Walter Massey when he was director of NSF, I guess, the second African American to be the director.  And we wrote a short, I guess white paper proposal, and fifteen made that cut, and we were amongst that fifteen.  And we wrote four proposals and five made that cut.  We were in that fifth, the fifth and actually, they added a sixth school.  So it was Xavier, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Bowie State [Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland], a school in Puerto Rico, the Universidad Metropolitana, University of Texas, El Paso, Hispanic serving, Puerto Rican-Hispanic serving, and Oglala Lakota [Oglala Lakota College, Kyle, South Dakota].  That's the Native American school.
Speaker 1: And Lakota, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so there are a lot of publications on the success of STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] students as a result of that support from NASA.  We had students who got scholarships.  We had students who were research involved.  We brought scholar teachers which were post-docs in, and there were some funds for renovations.  Some of the building that we have here was supported through NASA grants.  It was roughly about a million dollars a year over eleven years, yes.  So we were the envy of a lot of schools around the country.  But we sat down and wrote a very good proposal.  And under Dr. Faulkner's leadership, we would sit around the table, and we all contributed to the grant proposal.  And we would massage it until we knew it was a very good proposal.  And so that's been a history of Spelman in writing very good grant proposals.  I hear it started with Shirley McBay [former division chief of natural sciences at Spelman College].  I don't know if you've met her yet.  It started with her, and so when she left Spelman, Dr. Faulkner sort of carried on the tradition.  And obviously, this building has Dr. Faulkner's name on it from her contributions.  We had a program funded by NASA called the "WISE" program, Women in Science and Engineering. A lot of the young ladies who went to get PhDs were a part of that NASA WISE program.
Story_ID: 21286
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about, it's time to explain another paper to us.  Now this--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --1998 paper entitled, 'Effect of Halogenations on the Nonlinear Optical Properties of Porphyrin and Substituted Porphyrins.'
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Was that a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] paper?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, co-authored that paper with a colleague who's currently here.  She's retiring this year, Beatriz [H.] Cardelino.  She's a theoretical chemist, and so she looked at our porphyrins in terms of non-linear optical properties.  So she and some NASA scientists, I think, are listed on that paper.  So they used some compounds that we synthesized.  And they did most of the theoretical work and the calculations on it.  We supplied the compounds there.  And I think I have another paper there that I did with Hambright (ph.) with some people at the National Institute of Science and Technology.  It used to be called the Bureau of Standards.  That may have been '98 [1998] also.  And, again, that was some compounds that I synthesized and they did most of the measurements at the Bureau of Standards, well, National Institute of Science and Technology.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, okay, now, there's a--now, is this a significant grant here, the grant from the Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore Research Grant?
Speaker 2: Yes, let's see.  What is the title?
Speaker 1: It's called, it says you secure a grant from the Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore Research Grant program and the title, let's see if there's a title here?  It's about, it had something to do with Dr. Bruce Tartar (ph.) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to remember.  Is that a research grant or a programmatic grant because we did get some grants to support students.  We were doing research, but it was more general research, not specific.  And this may have been a grant where students were doing work here, and then they'd go out to Lawrence Livermore in California in the summer.  I believe that might be that grant.  Is there a Bhatia, B-H-A-T-I-A on that also.
Speaker 1: No, I don't see it.  No, it has to do with U. S. Nuclear Deterrents through the design of nuclear weapons.  That doesn't sound like it (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't, yeah, I don't know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe it's just, maybe they got this one--
Speaker 2: Got it from someone else.  We've had some, some dealings with Lawrence Livermore and as well as Lawrence Berkley.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they might have mixed up another Thompson.
Speaker 2: Right, mixed that up, right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 21287
Speaker 1: But, okay, also here is another one, an article, 'Kinetics of the Reaction Between Zinc II and Tetrakis.'
Speaker 2: That was mainly my dissertation.  That was one part of the dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So on the back of the sheet, if you turn that sheet all the way around, that's a porphyrin ring there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and it's a cyclic compound, and the metals are inserted in the middle there.  We call that the porphyrin hole.  So we were looking at the rates of the metal going into that ring.  And so that's, that's what that was all about.  We can look at, you know, about eighty different metals can combine with that ring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in '99 [1999], you received the DuPont Faculty Research Award.
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember that award because Dr. [Johnetta] Cole, and I went up to visit DuPont in Wilmington [Delaware] the day after commencement.  Commencement is always on a Sunday, and we flew out early Monday morning.  At the time, Earice (ph.) Armstrong, one of my former students, was a chemist at DuPont.  She's a PhD out at Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee], and she made arrangements for us to come up there and visit DuPont.  And as a result, four faculty members from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] were awarded, I think the total award was maybe a hundred thousand dollars.  And so we, we split, twenty-five thousand a piece and so we had free reins to carry out what kind of research we wanted to do.  And so Earice (ph.) has left DuPont.  And she actually went to Corning, and now she's in nuclear medicine, now, still in that area.  She was an '82 [1982] grad at Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay, the, now, the--tell us about the first International Conference of Porphyrins and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that was the one in France?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes,
Speaker 1: Dijon--
Speaker 2: Was it the first conference?  It was the first ever, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says the first one in 2000, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, that was the first one in Dijon, France.  Yeah, we presented a poster there, and that was Rosalie Richards, the person who is now at Georgia College [Milledgeville, Georgia].  And, and she actually gave an oral talk, but she was my scholar teacher at the time.  So she actually ran the laboratory 'cause I was still the chair (laughter) of the department at that time.  But it was an excellent experience.  We met porphyrin chemists from all around the world.  In fact, we have submitted a, an abstract to present in Korea.  It's a, what is it, biennial, every other year.  I've attended only one other, but it's been in Japan.  It's been in Moscow [Russia].  It's been in this country a few times.  And I think even in South America, so one of my students now, we've submitted an abstract to present in July.  So we're waiting to hear, but that's a--there is a journal of porphyrins [Journal of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines]  now.  There wasn't a journal when I finished graduate school, but there's a journal of porphyrins.  And there's this international conference that was put together by some porphyrin chemists.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, you lectured in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've actually been an invited speaker there.  I've done some research posters there.  My students have done research posters.  I've actually done a summer program, final program speaker there.  That school was part of our MIE [Model Institutions for Excellence] group.  So I would say I've been to San Juan at least twelve or more times, based on that relationship that we have.  We still have a close relationship with that university.  We've had research students from their university to spend time at Spelman.  We've sent students down to that university, and so we support each other in terms of cooperative, you know, support in terms of grants and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 21288
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, tell us about the 2002 article on Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] which was featured in 'Ebony Magazine'?
Speaker 2: 'Ebony Magazine,' and it's that edition when they do the colleges, I guess the college edition, HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] edition.  And they interviewed several faculty members at Spelman in different areas, the humanities, social sciences.  So they interviewed me as a natural sciences and mathematics division.  I wasn't division chair then, and I basically talked about our success in preparing young ladies for graduate study, medical school professions, even students who go on and do well in law school.  And so there's a little short quote there from me.  And there's a picture.  I think you have that picture that they took, and so that was--I remember my brother [Robert Thompson] calling me.  He said, "Man, you're in Ebony" (laughter).  I didn't even know it was out.  I didn't know when it was coming out.  But, you know, he, he saw it on the shelf.  He said, oh, they're talking about you in the barbershop (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there, do you have a sense that Spelman has the resources it needs to really do what it, to accomplish its mission?
Speaker 2: I think so.  We can always use more.  As I said, our president said, "We might be rich, but we're not wealthy", you know.  There's different levels of riches, but certainly, I've been able to get mostly what I want, maybe not immediately, but we're in pretty good shape.  I was asked, the American Chemical Society did a telephone interview.  And they were looking at liberal arts colleges and HBCUs, some of the restraints that you might have.  And I said that, we are not as restrained as even some majority liberal arts colleges.  We have a pretty decent teaching load, maybe three courses a semester.  That's pretty large when you look at a research institution, but there are many who teach four and five classes per semester.  And that happened under Johnnetta Cole, as the president.  When I came here, I did teach more courses, and, obviously, if you're teaching, you can't do the research.  Now, you can do it if you get a grant and get release time.  Spelman has always honored our release time, and so we've done pretty well, especially when this building was built in 2000.  So I spent, what is it, nearly nineteen years in a very small building with, but there was always an effort for fundraising.  And when this building was built, it was paid for (laughter).  It was paid for, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: And we were fortunate when Bill Cosby gave the 20 million dollars because we also needed a Humanities Building, and so that was essentially paid for.  So the efforts were basically toward the sciences.
Story_ID: 21289
Speaker 1: Okay, well, can you tell us, can you give us--what is your philosophy on STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have two.  I think that every child is inquisitive 'cause I know I was inquisitive.  And you don't wanna turn your children off.  You know, I hear parents say, well, I didn't do well in science.  I can understand it, but you don't normally hear parents say, I didn't do well in English so, that's an excuse not to do well in English.  I didn't do well in mathematics.  Well, it's always mathematics and science.  I think if you encourage them or try to find someone to encourage 'em--a mentor, that they can do well in science.  If you're interested in it, you can do it.  But as a kid, most, most children are inquisitive and you have to be inquisitive to do well in science.  You have to have that drive to investigate.  So that's my philosophy.  You have to delay some of your enjoyment in life because it does take a lot of study, a little more, I think, than other areas.  But I always felt that if you like something, you're gonna do well in it.  And so that's the number one thing.  I find that some students come, they wanna go to medical school, but they're not willing to put the work in.  It takes a lot of hard work.  They have the ability, but they realize it's gonna take a little hard work.  If you're not challenged before you get to college, you can get a false feeling of where you can go.  So challenge is always good.  I look back and the teachers who we said were the difficult teachers, those were the ones who really prepared you well, you know.  They were fair, but they were challenging and expected a lot of you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's my philosophy.  With my daughters, my daughter [Amber Thompson] majored in economics.  She didn't major in science (laughter).  And my younger one [Tayloir Thompson] says engineering.  I'll see.  She's taking chemistry now, so, but I have to constantly remind her that she has to study every day.
Story_ID: 21290
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell us about the, about being--you were appointed chair in 2011.
Speaker 2: Yes, this is my first year as chair of the--
Speaker 1: division [Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Spelman College, Atlanta Georgia].
Speaker 2: Division.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We went back to that structure.  I think, under Dr. [Johnetta] Cole, we got rid of the divisional chairs, and we went to just department chairs.  We added some layers of associate provost and things of that nature.  Under our current provost [Johnnella Butler], she felt that we needed to go back to that divisional structure because we needed to do things within the division before we bring it forth to the provost level.  And so I think faculty are in agreement, probably 95 percent agreement that this, that the divisional structure is working well.  There were some issues as to why the divisional structure was dismantled, and I think those issues are no longer here.  It had probably more to do with the persons who (laughter) were in the positions then, the position itself.  Dr. [Etta] Faulkner was the divisional chair.  She was reappointed as a social provost during her period, so she operated like the divisional chair in a sense.  That was under Ruth Simmons who was our provost for two years.  And you might know that she went on to become president of Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] and eventually Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  Ruth Simmons is a Wheatley [Phyllis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] graduate.  She was a year ahead of me in high school.  I remember her very well.  In fact, when she interviewed for the job here as provost, I kept looking at her, and I said, she looks familiar, Ruth.  And she had Ruth S. Simmons.  And, see, she was Ruth Stubblefield when she was in Houston [Texas].  So she left her number, after she interviewed, and I called her the next day.  And I said, "You wouldn't happen to be Ruth Stubblefield."  And she said, "Yes."  I said, "Well, I'm Al Thompson.  I remember you were in the drama class, and I was in the band, the group that made all those, the noise," you know.  But she was salutatorian of her class.  I think the valedictorian went on to get a PhD in physics.  She was in the class with Mickey Leland, who was our congressman.  You know, and he was married to a Spelman grad when he died.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she, she finished Spelman, went to Georgetown Law School [of Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], Alison, and he had twin boys when he died.  And his brother was in my high school class.  Now, they were both pharmacists.  But Mickey really never practiced pharmacy because he went into politics.  And they said, the story was, I think I was in the military at the time, but he led one of the most successful student boycotts on campus (laughter).  So, again, I go back to my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] sending me to Wheatley.  It was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Right, well, Wheatley grads really know how to talk about Wheatley.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right (laughter).  Yates beat us a lot at football, but they didn't do too well in basketball.  I don't know if you remember Dwight Jones.  He played with the [Atlanta] Hawks [National Basketball Association team].  He was a Wheatley grad, and, in fact, they won the state championship two years of the three years I was in high school, and that was what they called the Negro Interscholastic League.  When they integrated, Wheatley won it three years in a row, three years in a row.  And so, I don't know.  It was something about Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] and basketball that worked well.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Fifth Ward.  That's also the home of the Geto Boys [controversial rap group that gained popularity in the '90s].
Speaker 2: That's right, the Jazz Crusaders went to Wheatley.
Speaker 1: Jazz Crusaders [American music group popular in the early '70s], right.
Speaker 2: That's right, they went to Wheatley.  Illinois Jacket, Gene, not Gene Ammons, Arnette Carter.  I don't know if you remember the saxophonist.  They all would come back to visit, visit us.  But I remembered when I was in high school, and we had assemblies.  And, you know, and you had this hierarchy, you know.  You either sat in the balcony when you were a first-year student, and then you moved down.  We didn't have a balcony at Wheatley, but you had to sit in the back as a tenth grader.  But I remember the principal standing there saying that Wheatley had more of their graduates to go on to earn PhDs than any of the other schools in Houston [Texas] and barring none.
Speaker 1: That's any of the schools in Houston?
Speaker 2: That's what he said.  And I eventually met some of them.  I talked with one at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], George Neely who was a physicist PhD.  And so, and then Ruth Simmons is one, you know, so we can just go down the list.  And I guess you can include me.  I don't know if that's happening now (laughter).  Wheatley is, it's different now.
Story_ID: 21291
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the, just kind of, what's your vision for the future of the sciences here at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: At Spelman?  Oh, I think it's very bright.  We, when I came here, we only had biology, mathematics.  Chemistry was a two-year department.  Our students had to finish their courses either at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Clark College [now part of Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time.  We're a four-year department.  We started in 1990.  We've added computer science.  We've added physics.  We have five physics faculty members, an African American female in physics.  We have environmental sciences now.  At one time, the mathematics department had more African American females PhDs than any department in the country, you know, five African American female PhDs.  Nobody could come close to that.  I don't know how many we have now, maybe three or four.  But they're bringing in another one in the fall.  So, it's one, two, three--maybe we're about five or six.  And then we have others who are teaching in the Atlanta [Georgia] area who at one time taught here.  So I think the future's bright.  The numbers are down a little.  We were one time a high of 38 percent of the majors at Spelman.  I think we're down around 30 percent.  But that's a national trend also, and one year we brought in 50 percent of the entering class in science.  During the period I was chair, we graduated thirty-five chemistry majors.  We dropped to the high teens.  We're back in the twenties now, but two years in a row, we graduated thirty-five.  And when we told the story around the country, they couldn't believe it.  We still have over a hundred students majoring in chemistry, over a hundred students, 300 in biology.  So quite a few science majors.  So I don't see any change in the next, my next four or five years here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community, period?
Speaker 2: Oh, African American males.  I've done a little work with them, you know, in visiting high schools, that they can look at other areas and not put all of their hopes in sports, that they can do well in other areas.  I have a former summer student--you know, I told you I work with the Project SEED program which is funded by the American Chemical Society.  I've had high school students in my laboratory.  I'm proud to say, this person wasn't in my laboratory, but he was in the SEED program that I coordinated.  He worked in Isaiah Warner's laboratory as a high school student.  He went on to get a PhD from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  He came from the inner-city high school here in Atlanta [Georgia], and he's published papers.  And, in fact, one of his papers is cited in a Nobel Prize-winning paper, yeah, Noble Prize-winning paper, for very classical, theoretical work that he's done.  Reggie, Reggie Little, Reginald Little is his name.  So that's some of my concerns that, that we should look at areas like marine biology and, you know, aerospace engineering.  Your chances of being successful in those areas are probably greater than being a pro athlete, you know.  So I elect, I played, you know, unorganized sports when I was a kid, but, you know, my father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] always reminded me that, you know, you're not gonna be a pro star, concentrate, balance your time, you know, in academics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how is it different teaching here at Spelman from teaching at a co-educational school?
Speaker 2: Not much difference because I do get males in my class, not as many as females.  I remember when I came here in '81 [1981], Spelman females were very assertive.  They wanted to know how I felt about females being in the science area because, you know, it wasn't that many.  And I always told them that I was brought up in a family where we didn't have girl jobs, boy jobs, you know.  And so, and I said, I have a sister.  I have cousins who are females, and at that time, I didn't have any daughters, but I want them to be able to move into any area that they want to move in.  So I, I don't think it's any different than coed.  First of all, our young ladies do take classes at some of the other, at Morehouse and Clark Atlanta.  So they're not in isolation, you know.  I hear high school young ladies, they'll say to their parents, well, Spelman's all female.  I don't know if I wanna be there, and they don't realize the close proximity of the institutions.  So you don't really feel that you're in a isolated all-female environment.  And then you're in Atlanta so, that helps, that helps a lot.
Story_ID: 21292
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done in your career to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, probably more so in preparing students for their careers and being a mentor, probably.  You know, I think about some who were having difficulty in first year chemistry, and I always tell the story of those who have gone on to get PhDs because--never discouraged them.  I had a young lady from another college--I won't name it.  But she came here on exchange.  And she said, I heard you tell a young lady to continue to try.  I knew a professor at this other school, told a student that maybe you're in the wrong field.  And the student had done poorly on one exam, you know.  A young lady came to visit me from Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin, Madison].  She, you know, being the only African American in that chemistry department as a visiting professor at the time, out of more than fifty faculty members, there were students who knew I was there.  Some didn't get a chance to see me, but she came to visit me after I came back to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And she said she was just amazed at how the Spelman women were confident.  She just felt, just, just to look at them, the way they walked and held their heads high, and they didn't feel beaten down.  And she was a senior at Madison [Wisconsin].  So it becomes an issue of being able to afford to attend here versus going to a state university, you know.  Everyone can't come here.  We're talking about over thirty thousand [dollars] a year.  That's, that's a lot for an African American family, especially if you're a first generation college student.  And so that's one thing that we need more at Spelman is academic scholarships.  We do lose students because they can't meet that financial obligation.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on what you've done to this point, again, is there anything differently that you would do if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: I, I sort of wish I had, took that post-doc when I finished.  It would have given me a little more research experience, things of that nature.  I took the teaching job first, but Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] was a good experience.  And it was a struggle because the, the financial base was not there.  So when I look back, although it was a good learning experience, I probably should have done the post-doc.  And I do encourage my students to do that now, you know.  But the thought was, if you have a job, take the job.  The post-doc is just preparing you for the job.  I remember when I finished, and I told my mother [Martha Viola Furgess Thompson] I was thinking about doing a post-doc, she said, "Haven't you done enough? What is a post-doc?"  Well, in science, you really need to get that broader experience.  And it sort of depends.  If you want to teach at a research institution, you mainly have to do a post doc 'cause they don't expect you to come in with, ready to be competitive to write grants.  So, but we have people here who are very good scientists.  They publish a lot, and they chose Spelman because they didn't want that pressure of having to get grants, constantly get grants.  We have a very, very good scientist here.  He's a Wisconsin grad.  He came here, interviewed before I became chair, but he's gotten a career award from NSF [National Science Foundation], presidential award.  We've had three Spelman Alums, one in math, one in chemistry and one in physics, who were NSF Career Awards.  And, and one is tenured at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], one at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] and one at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  So, I think having a person here who got a career award, gave them the encouragement that they could do it, you know.  And you hear the Spelman females say, having female role models here does help.  It really does help, you know.  And I think it's good for them to see African American male role models also.  And a lot of them come from families where they've had very strong father figures also.  But maybe not in science, and I often tell--you know, kids come here.  They want to major, they want to go into medicine because as a kid, what do you see first?  You see an M.D., you know.  I was fortunate enough to meet scientists when I was little, but many kids don't meet a scientist, you know.  I made one mistake.  I went to a high school, and I asked the students had they ever met a scientist before, and this young lady said, yes, my high school teacher.  I said, oh, yes, she is a scientist, you know.  I won't make that mistake again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: My what now?
Speaker 1: Your family.  You have children, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have children, but I'm divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two girls.  One is twenty-seven [years old] [Amber Thompson].  She finished here in 2007.  She was an economics major.  She's recently finished her MBA at Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] here.  I wanted her to go east.  She decided to stay in Atlanta [Georgia], and she did, she didn't do what I wanted to do.  She did what she wanted to do, which was the right thing because she has a job (laughter), and she has her MBA.  And she's with Internal Revenue Service as an analyst.  My younger daughter [Tayloir Thompson] is in tenth grade, and she says that she wants to come to Spelman.  So we'll see.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I have not asked you that we think, you think we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of right now.  We've talked about my career, being in the military.  I'm very close to my mother's family.  My father [Albert Nelson Thompson, Sr.] was an only child, so I had no uncles and aunts on that side, although I spent several summers with his mother [Ella Lewis Thompson].  But my mother came from a family of fifteen children.  So there were nine girls and six boys, five are still living, and so I had a lot of aunts.  And so I think that prepared me for working at a female institution 'cause my cousins say, you're very close to your aunts.  They, they always, you know, people always tease me and say you're a mama's boy.  I say, "Am I one?"  They say, yes, and an Aunt Boy, Grandmamma Boy, all of that, you know (laughter).  But I was close to my uncles also.  So I like living in Atlanta and close because I still have a lot of relatives in South Carolina.  I was just there two weeks ago.  And my daughters get a chance to go visit their relatives there, and obviously, they're in New York and places like that.  But I think that's about it.
Story_ID: 21293
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Remembered (laugher).  Remembered as a person who was dedicated to training students, as a mentor, one that a student could come to for advice.  I asked my daughter [Amber Thompson] who's a graduate of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] when she was maybe seven or eight years old, I said, if you ever became president of Spelman--you know, she talked about that at one time. I said, what would you say about your dad?  And she said, I would say that my dad worked hard here at Spelman (laughter).  And so I used to have her in the lab on weekends and things of that nature, and, but she said it was quality time that she spent with me 'cause her mother was a nurse.  And her mother worked weekends and things of that nature.  So, you know, we had to come here, and I had her in the lab in a stroller (laughter).  When I went away to Wisconsin, she, I came back for a weekend, an extended weekend, and I had to bring her to the lab.  I had work to do, and I said, oh, Amber, I'm so sorry I had to bring you to the lab.  She said, oh, I'm having fun.  She was having fun just being here in the lab with me, you know; said, "Mama doesn't take me anywhere. You always take me places."  So that's, I'd like to be remembered by my students and my students have brought their children by to meet me.  And some are at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] now, a few at Spelman.  So I'm at the point where I'm teaching the children of my students now.  But I won't be here when the grandchildren come (laughter).  I probably, you know, I can't just cold retire.  I'm thinking about some tutorial, working with high school students.  You know, there's this online tutorial, so I'm looking into those kind of, those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, thank you so much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay, surely, okay, thank you.  It's nice meeting you.

Speaker 1: My high school graduation picture, 1964, from Phyllis Wheatley High School.
Speaker 2: It's a picture of me, roughly around 1974, my first teaching job at Texas Southern University in the chemistry office.
Speaker 1: Roughly around the same time, 1974, a picture of me and several chemistry majors at Texas Southern.  That was the American Chemical Society group.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me with Dr. Sawyer, the president of Texas Southern at my Bachelor's graduation in 1973.
Speaker 1: This is summer research job at DuPont, Serrano River site, 1973, and I was working with a GC instrument there.
Speaker 2: This picture is in the early '80's [1980s], approximately 1983.  That's an experiment in the Spelman chemistry undergraduate laboratory.
Speaker 1: And this picture is somewhere in the late '90's [1990s] at a National science meeting.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture, it was taken in Dijon, France.  I remember this one very well at that International Porphyrin Conference.  I forgot the year now, but it was in the early '90's [1990s]. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: This was the picture in "Ebony Magazine", and that was taken around 2002.
Speaker 2: And this is a recent picture.  It was in 2011.  I attended a conference, the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers.  This is in Lagos, not Lagos, Nigeria, but Port Harcourt, Nigeria. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Did you name, do you know--
Speaker 1: I don't know those persons, but they were undergraduate students at one of the Nigerian universities.
Speaker 2: And this is a recent picture.  That's in my office.  If you notice, there is a periodic table in the back, and this is actually a self portrait (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father teaching elementary school, and he actually drew that map on the wall.  My father was sort of, a trained artist also, as well as a musician. INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, that's a good job.
Speaker 2: And he was probably about 23 years old then.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother.  It was I guess one of her school pictures when she taught elementary school, 1955.
Speaker 2: A picture of my father's mother.  She was a second-grade teacher, and the year there is 1951-'52' [1952], Ms. Ella Logan.
Speaker 1: A youth picture of my grandmother before she was married.  That would have to be in the early 1900s.  I would guess maybe 1918.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my great grandmother, Miranda Murphy, and that's my grandmother's mother.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of my grandmother's grandmother, Lacretia Pinkney, and she was actually born in slavery as a child. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Would that be South Carolina?
Speaker 2: South Carolina, correct, Columbia.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother's father, Curtis Furgess, and he was a custodian at the elementary school that my mother attended.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my mother's mother.  She was a homemaker.  She had 15 children (laughter) and one set of twins. INTERVIEWER:  Those are the twins.
Speaker 1: This is my mother and her twin sister, and they both finished Benedict College in 1945.
Speaker 2: From left to right, my mother's twin sister, the next person is her uncle, my grandfather's brother, Thomas Furgess, my mother is next and her oldest sister, oldest sibling, Elizabeth Furgess.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of my mother's mother and father and her 14 siblings.  My mother is the back, the second one from the left.
Speaker 2: And this is a later picture of the family, mother and father deceased and only one brother deceased, so a total of 14 living children at that time.  And they tried to get in the same position.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this was in 1996.  I was in Houston, visiting my brother, sister and father.  They both lived there at the time.  My brother, Robert, on the left and my sister and my dad.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother at her elementary school.  She was the collector of savings bonds at that time.  Her principal on the left, Mrs. Boliver and the students and my mother on the right.
Speaker 1: A picture of my mother during one of the commencement activities at Spelman, and so she had retired, and she was in Atlanta quite often.
Speaker 2: A picture of me and my daughters, my oldest daughter standing in the back, Amber, the youngest, Taylor at the bottom.

Speaker 1: A most recent picture in February.  My youngest daughter, Taylor, my oldest, older daughter, Amber and me.
Speaker 2: This is a business card from my grandmother's uncle, her mother's brother.  He was a funeral director, and his name was Thomas Pinkney and they referred to him as Uncle Tom.
Speaker 1: And this is a novel picture that they take at the American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco.  Okay. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
