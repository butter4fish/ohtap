Story_ID: 36649
Speaker 1: Well before we go into depth there are five light weight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer.  First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do, my favorite food is hot dogs and pork and beans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is black.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I really don't have a favorite location because every place is too special, it really is and I guess it reflects how I like variation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah. There are many, candidly, and I do (unclear), but the one I use most of the time is "Bring your A game."
Story_ID: 36650
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'm going to ask about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's side but separately then we will try to bring them together.  I want to ask you about your name because very few men have hyphenated names.  So is there a story behind the name Gordon-Bray?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was born Arnold Gordon and when I--right before my eleventh birthday the turbulence in the house got to be the point where my dad [Felix Gordon] was forced out of the house.  And right before--at the end of my tenth grade year my mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] remarried an Isaiah Bray.  Isaiah Bray was just a good man and he never tried to assert himself as my dad; just a good leader, a good human being.  And as I was in college, a place that he encouraged me to go versus a straight enlistment and a lot of successes that I was starting to know had occurred with people associating with Bray.  I made the decision when I was getting ready to get married to actually formally adopt the name of Bray.  But because I loved my real father I could not abandon both my blood and the relationship with my dad so I had my name in Montgomery County, Tennessee officially established as Arnold Neil Gordon-Bray because up to that point in time I was being known as kind of both.  If I went to Columbia, South Carolina they would still call me Arnold Gordon, if I was in Missouri they would try to call me Arnold Bray.  Either one was to not recognize the maturation and change of who I had become so that's why the name.  Now I didn't start really writing it except for Arnold N.G. Bray or Arnold N.G.B. until I was lieutenant colonel in the military because I started to see my name in print in different places and I would notice that my real father would--it would hurt him.  And I could see it on his face, so I then started to actually elongate the name and started to show it in that fashion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright that makes sense, thank you.
Story_ID: 36651
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for me?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray (laugh).  That's M-A-R-T-H-A, L-E-E, M-C-N-E-I-L, G-O-R-D-O-N (space) B-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's date of birth is 28 May, 1926, question mark.  Because candidly I think my mother may be older, but she doesn't say it and for a long time I thought she was thirty and holding (laugh).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born between Lackland, South Carolina and Bishopville [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said South Carolina?
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is either place near Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Both of those places are about sixty miles east of Columbia and maybe twenty or sixty miles east of Columbia.
Speaker 1: And you were in Columbia, right?
Speaker 2: I was born in Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: My mother's family can be traced back into the Bishopville, Lackland area.  And the person that I can kind of go back to I guess the longest would be my grandfather which is Winfred McNeil.  He was a--I know that he served in World War I and he was a cook and there is a piece of land that they actually purchased later on.  On the southeast corner of what is now Fort Jackson, South Carolina which is also where he is buried.  And he was allowed to be buried on his land and there is a tombstone provided by the United States Army that recognizes who he is.  I recognize that he had--he fathered the sum number of eight children that, my mother being the oldest of the eight, were in and around that area between Columbia and Bishopville.  They moved from that area of Bishopville, Lackland to what is an area just extreme east of Columbia, at some point in time when my mom was in grade school.
Story_ID: 36652
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother, Elizabeth McNeil was a laborer and I think she went to school up to the eighth or ninth grade.  And I don't know when she was born.  I know obviously she was born before the turn of the century.  I actually helped get her buried next to her husband because by the time she died in 1979 that was land was now federal land and so I actually used Strom Thurmond to initially pass a bill to get her buried there but it was a onetime exclusion.  Later my aunt died, my aunt Beth and she had requested to be buried next to her mother and so this time Strom Thurmond actually passed a bill that said any member of the McNeil family could be buried back on what was originally their property.  So my father kind of--my grandfather actually established that by his death.  So I can walk back to probably, I guess an understanding on my mother's side to about 1914, 1916 of what the family was like and I will give you some photos but there is one picture where they were all in the same schoolhouse.  So there is my mother Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] who is the oldest with my baby aunt, Aunt Dorothy who is a baby in arms at the time and the rest of the kids who were in school on the same schoolhouse back in this place somewhere between Columbia and Bishopville.  So that's the earliest photo I can see of them as a family (unclear).
Speaker 2: And the photo is from 19--what?
Speaker 1: That photo would be probably around maybe 1930 at that time, 1930 something.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Story_ID: 36653
Speaker 1: So now did your mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: My mother did in fact finish school but she got--she graduated, my mother graduated from high school in 1940, I'm going to say '46 [1946], '47 [1947] and somewhere thereabouts.  And she actually got a scholarship to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  She is also an artist, and a scholarship to Hampton but she was afraid to leave Columbia [South Carolina].  She still remembers the people that were prepared to house her under the scholarship and the university providing the tuition but she was afraid to go and then after a year and a half at Benedict College [Columbia] she met my dad [Felix Gordon] and I don't know all the specifics but I know my sister would appear somewhere around that time period.  So she stopped school in 1949 and she finished--in 1963 she went to the president of Benedict College and after working in Sumner Manufacturing Company, which was a rubber producing factory in Columbia, South Carolina she went to him and said this is not what I'm supposed to do and I need to go back to school and I don't know how I'm going to pay you yet but I will pay you to go to school.  In 1965, she graduated from Benedict College. And it was a great irony I was the only person in attendance for her graduation from the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had been what about twelve [years old]?
Speaker 2: I was nine at the time.  And my little brother, Michael was actually in kindergarten and so he was actually at Ms. Milligan's during that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, did your mother have any stories about growing up in--well out in Bishopville [South Carolina] and Columbia?
Speaker 2: The story she had, most of it really just about being in the woods and how many of them would actually go play around the waters and creeks and she couldn't swim so she actually avoided going near in the water.  To this day she still is pretty much afraid of going to the water.  She talks fondly about how she missed her dad [Winifred McNeil] because she didn't really remember him as well as she would obviously--and she is one of the oldest one but she talks about that but not a whole lot.  And of course, they moved to Columbia, moved into a little area called Ridgewood and that was--that's a small farm that my grandmother [Elizabeth McNeil] actually lived off of the things that she grew there to include chickens, pigs right there in that small backyard.
Story_ID: 36654
Speaker 1: We used to go back there [Gordon-Bray's maternal grandmother, Elizabeth McNeil's farm in Ridgewood, South Carolina] as a child and actually chase chickens and everything else a little small farm might have.  I was really--I was quite comfortable in the woods and I was very comfortable in a--in some of that environment.  But the funny thing about it is that--I'm going to skip a little bit forward--because that farm experience stays in my mind but when I was actually going to ranger school they picked somebody that they think is unfamiliar with animals to go get animals or do something.  And one of the things during ranger school is go catch--you got to catch the chicken-they put this like a chicken coop.  And they've got chickens inside because they are going to teach you how to use and cook it and so they thought I was unfamiliar with this for whatever reason and they thought like well he is a city boy (unclear). So they said Bray you're going to go do this.  I was sitting there laughing.  My brain goes immediately back to us chasing chickens and snakes and everything else.  And so I caught my chicken in less than two minutes.  I mean because you go in there and you just coral them and then you--and once you just fall on top.  Because most folks don't realize a chicken can fly not far, not fast so you have to come down on it and so I was able to do that.  And so--my mind was able to go back to some of those times back on the steep slopes of my grandma's house back on--back in Ridgewood.
Story_ID: 36655
Speaker 1: And of course, you know in Columbia [South Carolina] we're from a real huge family.  Both sides of my family--my mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] has seven siblings and so we were able to go back and do that.  I remember also my mother inspiring most her siblings to also all of them completing high school.  So that was kind of a transition because all the kids completed high school and because there is a sense of service, all of the males actually served in the military at some point even for brief periods among her siblings, and one sister actually served in the [U.S.] Air Force, my Aunt Beth, and she served about two, three years.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Story_ID: 36656
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to go into your father's side and can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Felix Gordon, Senior.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is 23 February, and it's 1925, I think that's right.  And his--I just never looked at the start date of when he was born.  And my dad passed on June 14, 2010.
Speaker 1: Now that's your birthday, right?
Speaker 2: That's my birthday.  Actually when he passed I was speaking in Ann Arbor, Michigan at a Flag Day celebration and I was driving home and I got a flash message to call.  It only hurt and stung honestly for about a minute or so.  I had just ordered a milk shake and I was sitting there and I sat it down and admittedly, like I said, it hurt a little bit for a moment.  Because the reality is two days before he and I had been sitting in his home on Florene Street (ph. splg.) watching the NBA [National Basketball Association] finals and he didn't like--he is a Celtic fan and I'm a Laker fan, I'm a Kobe Bryant fan, I like his tenacity.  And so he had complained about Kobe, of course Kobe had just tied the series up.  But on Sunday, the Celtics had went ahead--they went up 3-2 [score] and I remember us having the conversation about that win.  And so in my mind I said he only passed away with them up so that he could passed knowing the Celtics were up and I wouldn't get the satisfaction of watching the Celtics lose to the Lakers.  So it made me--it really did bring me incredible comfort.  The other part that was very comforting is that over the past few years he was--it was kind of difficult to breathe and his mobility had gone--because my parents [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] really are virile people--and over the past few years he had started to cough more, his mobility was gone, was waning.  Although it was still very unexpected because he was still mobile a little bit.  But I had also done a couple of other things which I had learned from watching people pass is I started making frequent trips to see him and one of the things that we--that I loved about being with my dad was fishing.  And I took my son and we just went down and I said dad we are going fishing and he said what, and I said let's just go fishing and he said I'm not sure that I know the good spots anymore and I said it doesn't matter.  Because I said I don't go fishing just to go fishing anyway, I loved being with my dad in a fishing environment because we would always get a Pepsi, get some crackers and some cheese and I could just be with my dad and hear him talk and think and just be around him.  Because he really had a very good mind and I was also trying to play catch up a little bit with things that I didn't recognize or remember about the family.  And so I was doing that because my relationship with my dad really was strong.  When my parents split it was painful for a lot of reasons.  In fact, even when I was in college later on I really got homesick, really two times of significance.  One of those times it was--I only wanted to talk to my dad; I wanted to talk to Felix Gordon and for whatever reason but that sense of paternal linkage is absolutely powerful to me.  So I--it affects a lot of what I do now and think now about where the dad's role is in the family.
Story_ID: 36657
Speaker 1: SO, now, how far back can you trace the ancestors on your father's [Felix Gordon, Sr.] side?
Speaker 2: My dad's family--we can go back to about 1835 and that's the birth period of Sidney Gordon.  Sidney was the--we know that Sidney basically was one of twenty-four kids, or actually had twenty-four kids and one of those was my great-grandfather [grandfather] which is Julian Gordon and then Julian had sixteen children which my dad is one of the--which is one of the sixteen and I know that they were from somewhere on the border between Georgia and South Carolina.  And ultimately Sidney established a family in Edgefield, South Carolina and there is still a section of Edgefield that is called Gordon Town.  The name, of course, principally derived from the owner and my brother will talk about the guy being called "Sir Gordon" for whatever reason and I don't know if that's because that's a real title he had and I'm saying that actually I don't know.  There are those in the family that would speak on it empirically that who he was, I don't know that.  There are several people in the family who have actually began an ancestry tree and one was published but I had just left a family reunion and nobody brought the book or the books and it was absolutely criminal.  And I told them for it not to be present because that's one of the things that make it powerful.  So that line is pretty clean, I mean, that part of my family still holds together pretty strongly.  We had a family reunion one time and had almost several [seven?] hundred people show up at various times over that weekend.  This weekend there was a 150-ish that showed up and that was pretty significant when you consider that from the Julian line only twenty-five or twenty people showed up because last week my father's brother, the baby, Robert Carver (ph. splg.) passed in Columbia [South Carolina] and about one hundred of the immediate family from different parts of the country converged on Columbia.  So to retool to come this week was probably (unclear) for many of them to make this trip.  But we can go back on this family to get multiple layers mostly around Edgefield, South Carolina.  By the way, it is also the home of Strom Thurmond and so you'll--I mean there is a close connection.  I know that when elements of his brothers moved to Columbia, they established businesses in Columbia.  First of all there was A.P. Gordon's Construction Company that was established when I was born and my dad worked for that company since before I was born and then he basically--I should have said since (unclear) before I was born and then he established his own F&M Drywall before he died and then he broke away.  But he was one of the principal subcontractors under A.P. Gordon.  They also established another large part of the family which is the Moores and Moores are interrelated to the Gordons and so there is a Moores Cleaner that was also linked and established.  And a couple of other businesses to include store ownership that was linked to a drugstore, (unclear) drugstore, but a convenience store established right there.  All of this was on--all these three different businesses and houses were established right across the street from Carver Elementary [School] and I don't want to say the road, but Carver Elementary School in Columbia, South Carolina directly across the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36658
Speaker 1: Now with a family--with a line you can trace all the way back to 1835 are there any stories of emancipation, what it was like when the slaves were freed?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure if it was necessarily emancipation but the Gordons were intertwined with their ownership and I think that's why there is such a thing called a Gordon Town that is in Columbia that is in Edgefield [South Carolina], that is in fact principally an integrated section, and the Gordons are extremely light, from in that area because there is a lot of intermixing with the Gordons in that area.
Speaker 1: So okay so the white Gordons and the black Gordons are--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: There is a lot of them down there and I--you can see that in them but at the same time because some of them were so light, you know that was both a blessing sometimes and a curse.  Some of them fled to New York and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the later years.  I'm not exactly sure who the first person was to go north.  I know my--the oldest Uncle Julian not Grandpa Julian but Uncle Julian went to New York and he is called "Bud" [ph.], Uncle Bud, but he moved up there and then started to basically call for others to come north.  By the mid '60s [1960s] a preponderance of my father's [Felix Gordon] brothers had all moved to Philadelphia as a matter of fact, from uncle--the baby was actually a graduate of high school, Uncle Robert Carver, graduated from high school in Philadelphia because they had basically all migrated to that area.
Story_ID: 36659
Speaker 1: Service was also extremely strong in the family.  My dad [Felix Gordon] joined the [U.S.] Navy in World War II and he was, in fact, he served on the USS Ticonderoga and he initially was going to go join but he had asthma.  One of the great stories he said he told--he said, "Well I've got asthma" and the guy who was signing him up he says, "Nothing like sea air to clear your lungs out" (laughs). And he said "I'm not a great swimmer" and he said, "I'm glad you brought that up because we can teach you how to swim because that is really important to know."  Of course, being on the USS Ticonderoga during the war they took a round out in the Pacific and ripped a hole in the side of the ship and they had several kamikaze strikes.  One of the great stories that's important that he shares is that many of the other cooks were not all that impressed by the capturing of the--what happened at Pearl Harbor by [Doris] "Dorie" Miller [a cook in the U.S. Navy noted for his bravery during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941] firing the weapon to shoot down the Japanese aircraft he says because all of them trained to do that and he said specifically he remembers when they were struck he said he can't swear that he hit any of the aircraft but he knows he was shooting at the aircraft and one of them struck the ship's mast near him after he shot it and he says he remembers his ears ringing and the--everybody responding because that's what they did.  Now what was remarkable is that they never could--all of the cooks were forbidden from sharing that they were trained to shoot the ship's weapons but when they went to sea, they did that and that--I think that reflected fears of America of putting African Americans behind weapons.  That story impacted me because just like everybody else of my 50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] era, I watched 'Combat!' [television series], I watched Vic Morrow and all those guys that's what I wanted to be.  You want to be a soldier, you want to actually be one of the guys to make a difference and be front line and my dad's story always haunted me in so many ways; that he took great pride in being able to fight, but he was recognized as being a cook.  That's one of the stories that pulls out.
Story_ID: 36660
Speaker 1: But as a family--as a family we all grew up going to A.P. Gordon's stores and things like that so we--with my dad we all knew each other.  I knew my dad's brothers from Robert Carver, the baby, all the way to him and their children extremely well before they went to New York and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But even then up to about 1969-ish which is also the period when my mother and father had separated we spent summers with each other.  I say we spent summers--they spent summers in the south so we spent a lot of time talking about what was happening up in Philadelphia and learning the dances that they were bringing, the boogaloo, etcetera, down to us and then showing them how we danced the music.  So there was always a lot of interaction with this family.
Story_ID: 36661
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me--so your father [Felix Gordon] served in the [U.S.] Navy during World War II.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [father and mother, Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] meet before the war?
Speaker 2: They met after the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was--when he came back in 1946 he got out, and he worked in Norfolk [Virginia] at the shipyards for awhile before he finally came back and started working for Uncle A.P. as part of A.P. Construction Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your father go to school on the GI bill?
Speaker 2: No, my father dropped out of school in ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay so he didn't go back?
Speaker 2: He did not go back.  He really is a person that probably--he expressed his regret about school multiple times.  Because he served jury duty back in the '70s [1970s] and they made him the foreman on jury duty, I don't know what the case was but he talked about it and he said you know when I was in that room, he said when they listened to me talking and they kind of followed my logic he said I realized that I probably could have done a whole lot more if I had stayed in school.  And I--you don't know how to have that conversation and I didn't push it because one is that the last thing I'd want to do to my father is instill any more regret that he may have.  And so I didn't push it--there were so many other questions I really wanted to ask, but I also understood the time that he dropped out of school was--it was not that uncommon, especially for African American males not to be out, if you could work and he had multiple skills.  So he was thinking that way but he was absent division [unclear] or even the role models in some cases to go forward.  Because A.P. was not even a high school graduate but he understood business.  And of course, A.P. ensured all of his kids did go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My dad is a handsome man, very handsome man, in fact, candidly most Gordons are recognized to be handsome folks and I don't say that from my perspective I say that from actually from my wife's family.  I will tell you a story in just a second but he was hanging out around Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] and he saw my mother and he told a friend of my mother's he said yeah I like that girl, I'm going to marry her and she ran over to my mother and said that guy over there says he is going to marry you.  My mother looked at him and she said he just might (laugh).  And they did in fact, meet and they dated and eventually they did get married and--she laughed, she says when I looked at him with his sleek dress and his gray-green eyes, she said he had me.
Speaker 1: Now, strip back just a little bit, my mother when--my wife when she was getting ready to marry me, she told a I don't remember Lauphne (ph. splg.) last name but she told a close friend Lauphne that she was going to marry Arnold Gordon-Bray, and they said where is she from and she said Columbia [South Carolina].  My wife told her yeah my finance's dad is Felix Gordon and Lauphne's mom said, "If he is Felix Gordon's son--" she said, "--he has got to be a handsome devil." And that was at Columbus, Georgia because (unclear) and candidly I don't think I deserved to be in that same category as my dad or even my brothers.  There are really a lot of beautiful people in the family.  Also her family is just a gorgeous group.
Story_ID: 36662
Speaker 1: So your parents [Felix Gordon and Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] get married and they are in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: They are working and living in Columbia.  And there's--he actually is living just outside of Columbia in a place called--they moved to a place called Wagner, South Carolina.  Just south of Columbia and they stay there for a couple of years.  I'm not sure exactly how long they stayed in Wagner because my sister and my two brothers were born actually in the house in Wagner, South Carolina.  They moved to Columbia sometime before my middle brother, Morris actually his real name is Lawrence Morris we never call him Lawrence but it is Lawrence Morris, before he is born.  Because Morris is born in--he and I were both born in Waverly Hospital which is the black hospital in Columbia, South Carolina in 1953, 1955 respectively.  So somewhere between 1949 and 1951 they moved back to Columbia, South Carolina, proper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36663
Speaker 1: Alright now when you think about your parents' [Felix Gordon and Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] personalities, their dispositions, how they walk, how they talk, their talents, their points of view, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of both of them.  My dad is really tenacious.  He also has a little bit of a temper and I had to temper mine.  Because one of my brigade commanders once told me, he says if you ever raise your voice you are yelling, I said yelling.  He says you are 6'6" [height] and you are massive.  He said when you stand in front of somebody it's intimidating.  So--but I know at sometimes I would in fact, show displeasure and it comes across much more forceful than I imagine it is, so I had to train that out of me.  But at the same time--my mother is a queen and she has a commitment to education.  She is also an artist and so I have that sense of pride in family, that sense of pride in people, that sense of responsibility that she had and has.  We absolutely could have qualified for governor's assistance which she would never entertain at all; wouldn't let it cross her mind and she had a distain for those who could still breathe, walk and do things like that.  I don't share that part with her but I do recognize that there was a commitment to always do as much as you possibly can with what you have and that's my mom.  And my son says, in fact I probably would not have said this had my son not said you got too much pride like your mom.  I'm grateful that I have that from her.  She is also my role model because when you need to develop spine in tough times, she always had it.  And you never know how much is on her because she doesn't share that.  She absorbs it and tries to find a way ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is your father tall?
Speaker 2: My mother is 5'10" and my father is 6'1" maybe a little more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I would say that that tall gene probably comes from more her, because 5'10" is significant to the average woman and 6'1" is still above average, but not so much.
Story_ID: 36664
Speaker 1: Okay. Are you the tallest in your family?
Speaker 2: I'm actually tied for tallest.  My brother Lawrence was--he hit 6'6" at fourteen [years; age].  I didn't hit 6'6" until I was twenty-four.
Speaker 1: So you kept growing (laugh)?
Speaker 2: I grew after graduation from college.  My program height was 6'6" [height] in college but my real height was 6'5" and I grew an inch between my twenty-second and twenty-sixth birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's not as dramatic as Dennis Rodman?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But still I think he didn't grow until he was in his twenties.
Speaker 2: Who was the other guy, the admiral now he grew from 6'6" when he was recruited by the Naval Academy to 7'1".
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's why he was surprisingly agile.  Had he been the 7'1" person he would have probably never have gone to the Academy, he would have probably had gone to some other college--school. He was a steal.
Speaker 1: I know in the [U.S.] Air Force there is a limit on height or is it one of the other branches, in terms of being a pilot?
Speaker 2: 6'6" is what they try to talk about as being the limit for a pilot because I actually took the fast test and I passed that.  I was going to be an aviator in 1982, but I couldn't do it because they found in my record that I was--I had sickle cell trait and so because I had the sickle cell trait, I couldn't become a pilot.  (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Altitude-(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Altitude was supposed to affect--now that was the [U.S.] Army because the Army didn't really quite understand what a trait was and so what they did was they used a different standard.  Because the white cells can coagulate at different altitudes and it is a disqualifier but in the Air Force that would not have been a disqualifier for fast movers because the Air Force had done their study on the effects of sickle cell trait.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36665
Speaker 1: Now can you name your siblings for us and put yourself in order?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah. My siblings are--my oldest is Feleen Haynie Gordon.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: It is F-E-L-E-E-N. You want middle names too?
Speaker 1: You don't have to do that.
Speaker 2: That's Feleen, and the last name is Haynie H-A-Y-N-I-E, and then the next is my brother Felix and he is Felix, Junior, F-E-L-I-X and then the next is Julian J-U-L-I-A-N Gordon and the next is Lawrence but I prefer Morris Gordon, he is deceased.  He passed in September of 2010. And he died of cancer.  Then Michael. And I fall between Lawrence and Michael.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is your household growing up?
Speaker 2: That's my household growing up.  My step dad, Isaiah Bray had a daughter, Doris, that lived with us a half of a year in 1971.  And then she left and moved back to Tuskegee, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to ask you about your step dad later on when we get towards that period of time.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 36666
Speaker 1: So, do you have an early childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As I told you I am very comfortable in the woods and right behind our house on (unclear; name of the road) road there was a--I call it a forest because it was about an acre and a half, two acres of wooded area.  And a young--one of the young Wineglasses their last name was called Wineglass, one of the young Wineglasses--and this would be before 1960, because I wasn't in school yet probably about three or four [years old].  We went in the back of the woods, and I had taken some hot dogs out of the house and I was going to roast hot dogs and so I pushed together some straw and put it on a stick like I had seen my brothers do multiple times.  We were roasting hot dogs (unclear)--and pretty soon the straw was pushing back a little bit and before long it had gotten a lot larger.  Well Wineglass dashed back to the house because we are now burning up a little bit of the forest, or that wooded area.  There is a water area down into the woods and now I was scared and afraid of what was going to happen so I ran to survive and jumped into the water down in the woods, but I'm still in the woods when I hear the fireman coming and the folks looking and hollering for me to try and find out where I'm at.  I'm watching the smoke go overhead and everything else but needless to say I'm not the woodsman I thought I was, but I did probably do an acre's worth of damage of fire.  I remember my logic flow of saying well, I would be safe in that water area that still had trees all over it and all around it.  I remember the repercussions of my actions.
Speaker 1: You were three or four [years old]?
Speaker 2: I was probably three or four.  I might have been early five, but I don't think so, because I didn't do-and one of the reasons is I didn't do kindergarten.
Story_ID: 36667
Speaker 1: Because the first day of kindergarten is when you are five [years old], I was in class and my aunt was pretty mature and I will tell you why I know that part.  Everybody else drew stick people, I could draw people; I could do perspective.  The teacher grabbed all of the other kids around my art work and she called multiple people in to look at what I was drawing and I remember being afraid and I told my mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] that I didn't want to go back and I never went back after the first day of school.  So I know I wasn't five yet, this was before then. And we went back. But the next year in my first grade year, there was an art contest for sixth graders, that was going to be--the winner of the art contest would have their picture of the drawing be the brochure for the City of Columbia [South Carolina] school system.  I won that art contest.
Speaker 2: This is in the--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: This is in 1960, '61 [1961].  And I won that art contest and I was six and I beat the sixth graders in the City of Columbia.  It was--what was supposed to happen is that--it allowed me to be taught in the Columbia Art Guild at (unclear) public school.  Well, the next year my mother put us in Blessed Martin de Porres [school] and so I was no longer eligible to receive the education because I was now in Blessed Martin.  And it kind of goes with who she was, she didn't like--she didn't believe necessarily that the education we were getting was the best that we could possibly get, and so we actually worked on weekends to be able to go to school there.  We worked at the school to maintain--to go to school there.  I did that actually till they [Gordon-Bray's parents, Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray and Felix Gordon] got divorced in 1966, then I was back in public schools.
Story_ID: 35084
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells growing up?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is Christmas for a lot of reasons.  My father [Felix Gordon] loved food and he loved breads and he loved Christmas.  And if there is ever a time period of absolute peace and prosperity even the feeling of abundance it was at Christmastime.  I cannot remember a bad Christmas.  I had a Christmas that was--the year that I realized that there was--that there wasn't a Santa Claus being both the best and worst Christmases in my life.  It was the best Christmas because it appeared that everything we asked for believed we wanted plus more we received.  And because--we always had fruit and we would always get fruit and something else to have and it'd be always out and you would smell that in the house.  And the music would play because I'm not sure who did it or why it happened but that was just a time period that was always special.  We would always go to midnight mass which is a tradition that I still carry.  Because it kind of puts the season in perspective but at the same time it recognizes the tangible nature that Christmas has become.  So the two things actually converge so much so that one I even passed the tradition on that you don't touch a gift or anything else until after mass so if you miss midnight mass you got to go to mass in the morning.  There are some great stories behind that and we can get to them if you want to but Christmas was special. (simultaneous)
Story_ID: 35085
Speaker 1: So tell us a midnight mass story.
Speaker 2: This is--we go to midnight mass and we had always come back and a lot of our relatives are not Catholic so sometimes they would get Santa earlier than us.  So we come back from mass and this particular Christmas I had peeked and saw some of the stuff that was inside of a closet.  And my sister [Feleen Haynie Gordon] tried to hide it from me and let me know that but anyhow so now I am anticipating being able to see some of the stuff.  For instance, we had the 007 radio-pistol combination.  I had my Mattel shooting shells in there, my brother had the huge Tonka toy.  We had the Strombecker race car sets that all of us loved to have the race cars, and so I'm anticipating all of this.  This whole Christmas--we come from mass and so I can't sleep, I'm trying not to sleep and trying to keep my eyes open because I know the deal now, you know (unclear) and know nothing is going to happen.  And my cousin Danny calls and he says hey Santa just came and hit us already and I've got these things.  He is laying them all out and so I'm now nervous and everybody else is in there and so my mom [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] says if he's already gone to Danny's house that means he has got to be close to this area.  And so we are laying in the bed and trying to go--because before the TV is out--we had a little Admiral TV and we're trying to track where he might be and my mom says you better go to bed.  So we go to bed and we pretend to go to sleep and of course, my brothers sneak up because they are older now and they help do all the set up and everything else, set the race tracks up and we all got three race car tracks and so finally somewhere around two or three [o' clock] in the morning we go to bed.  We get up (unclear) dark for Christmas so around four maybe or thereabout it is still dark, I jumped up and everything is out.  I don't know how they got me, when I phased off, but they got me.   And so now I look around and said wow how did they do that?  There were some things I hadn't seen and the smells were all round me.  I can smell the oranges; I can smell the peppermint, the little small candies and all of that stuff.  And so I'm excited I see--and [Lawrence] Morris my brothers told me he's not up yet.  But the older brothers have them all set up and there all down and so I look and I see the Strombecker, that's the big race car set.  I know that's not mine and then I see one that has battery operated changes and I said--and then there is one with just a 1963 Lincoln, gray car that you put on the track and it goes around in circles.  So I said well that could probably be mine or Morris' because we are so close in age I get to choose in my mind what's what.  And so I hook up the one that's got the two things, so I'm playing with it and I'm just by myself.  I'm up moving and I've got things going and one of the brothers say I think that one belongs to Morris and I said no this is mine.  And so when Morris finally gets up Morris said well this is mine.  And so we have a little tussle and Morris said well we'll decide.  So mama comes over and mama says baby that's Morris'.  So I look at mine and I have the remote control and I put it on the track and it goes around in circles.  And my gray beautiful little gray Lincoln that goes around the track without any control once I put it on the track.  And I look at Wynton (ph. splg.) they are racing--Wynton and Felix they are racing and I look at Morris'.  So Morris being the devilish fellow he is, Morris looks inside and says look at my controller.  So he teases me and so he didn't invited me to race with one of the cars he just says let's just see who can control it.  And so I get mad and I walk over, that's where the temper comes in, and I look at Morris and I actually kick him and so I spent that Christmas day in my room until about two or three in the afternoon.  And everybody else is playing and they are all outside and so some friends come by the window to the house and they are talking to me showing me what they got for Christmas and I'm sitting there inside and I'm feeling bad because I hurt my brother.  Morris and I are really close and I hurt him and I actually put a scar right there on his head that (unclear) because I always see it and I remember that day.  But it also put Christmas in perspective because after that Christmas I never asked for anything else for Christmas.  That's not true, I asked for a bike but I never asked for anything else for Christmas after that because once I realized that and when you realize your parents are struggling the magic leaves a little bit.  But at the same time I got such an appreciation for what my parents [mother, and father, Felix Gordon] were doing to make that a special time for me.
Story_ID: 35086
Speaker 1: So I--and I worked since I was twelve [years old].  I cut grass and everything else and I always made sure that my brother Michael had all the things he ever asked for.  I mean I bought him a bike at seventeen, I bought him all of the neat toys that I could as he was coming up to make sure that he liked Christmas like I loved Christmas.  And even my kids I did the same way.  So one of the neat stories from that one as I became a parent, first of all I used to hire people to be Santa Claus.  They would come into my house and place toys in the house.  So my kids didn't know that there wasn't a Santa Claus until they were in their teens.  Their friends would tell them that there is no Santa Clause and they would look for proof.  I let them sleep with me over night but then the toys would be there in the morning because I would have different ways of configuring it and trick them so badly where they were confused about where Christmas was.  One Christmas, in fact, Christmas in 1992 my kids came down stairs and--big Christmas, lots of stuff, bikes everything else.  They knew they didn't go to midnight mass and so they came downstairs and we are going to mass because it fell on Sunday too.  My brigade commander asked them, he said do you--what did you guys get for Christmas?  My daughter said oh no it's not Christmas yet.  And he looked at me like well they are telling you and I said I told them, you know.  And also it dawned on my daughter that they had never looked under the tree because I set up the day after Thanksgiving (laugh). I mean I'm on it.  I'll deploy to combat and I will spend whatever time it is, I get up and I go to the Black Friday every year.  I did it here from my brother's house wherever I'm at I go to Black Friday.  Germany, I go to Black Friday, and I don't necessary have anything in my mind, but I will be out because I like the feel of it.  So Christmas is huge in my mind, and it all goes back to one, sacrifices my parents [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] made to make that time of the year, that day special in the purest sense of the word and also for us as a family and I try and push that down to my kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now that's quite a story.  I think it was the longest Christmas story we've had in a long time, really.  I was thinking I'm surprised that a lot of people don't have more stories about Christmas.
Story_ID: 35087
Speaker 1: But--so you actually lived in this suburb of Columbia [South Carolina] until you were--well how long did you live there?
Speaker 2: It's funny you call it the suburb of Columbia.  Well that's okay, I actually lived--I can actually just about see the [South Carolina State] Capitol from my house.  Our house--we lived on Bonneville Road [ph.] until I was eleven [years old] and then we lived in Columbia proper until I--until a week before my seventeenth birthday.  And Columbia--I walked the railroads of Columbia and I even got a Boy Scout merit badge for civic--what's it called civic something that--civics merit badge for the Columbia Tricentennial because I knew Columbia.  I mean I walked the railroad tracks and I used to go around Columbia, as a matter of fact, I used to think Fort Jackson was a long ways away.  I had only left Columbia four times in my life before moving to Missouri.  I went for a night--a couple of nights to Charleston [South Carolina], once to Charlotte [North Carolina], once to Augusta [Georgia] and then I spent the summer before we moved to Missouri I spent the summer in Baltimore [Maryland] with my sister [Feleen Haynie Gordon] who had been married and even then I got off the airplane in Baltimore Washington [International; airport] drove to what was Cherry Hill, Maryland and I played basketball every morning and every night.  We went to go visit his sister Joanie, I think, once or twice.  But that was my tour of Baltimore and then I got back on the plane.  So I didn't see anything significant.  So Columbia is my world and I tell everybody that I'm truly a Carolina boy and I'm truly a Columbia--I know Columbia.  And I took folks on the tour to talk about Columbia's place in the [American] Civil War, Columbia's place in even the capitol being stuck by Sherman's cannons from the other side of the Broad River and even the Capitol building.  So I remember watching Columbia change from the places where I went swimming in Drew Park pool and I used to have to hop the fence and watch a bull, there was a bull you had to keep your eye on because you've got to run across this open field and the alternative was to go through where basically there was a place for an insane asylum but some of the mentally handicapped were kept.  And, of course, you have myths about what's there and how free they are but I was (unclear) at Columbia.  Right now where Rich Memorial Hospital sits, I was there.  And I-277 was actually part of our backyard and I watched our yard get severed from being about almost an acre of yard to now about a quarter--it's still pretty large.  And by the way, the reason why my parents [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray and Felix Gordon] were able to get that home is because my mother pushed for it because she saw a gentrification starting to happen.  So she actually went to an area that was starting to be--starting to transition to get more room.  So they ended up buying a house that was for about fifteen thousand dollars in 1965 [dollars] that stretched my dad to the point where I think it also strained the relationship.  But it was her stretch to take us out of a two bedroom house with six kids, [four room house?] and watched that transition.
Speaker 1: So now what was the name of the neighborhood that you lived in before you moved in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure it had a name.
Story_ID: 35088
Speaker 1: Well was Columbia [South Carolina] deployed with a black side of town, a white side of town or did black folks live in different pockets around town?
Speaker 2: Yes there are different pockets, in fact there was--where we lived on Louisa (ph. splg.) Street coming up, right behind there was a bunch of teachers that stayed behind us.  I remember Ms. Brittany Crew (ph. splg.); there was a lot of teachers, as a matter of fact, Tremane (ph. splg.) Street kind of was one of the middle class neighborhoods.  But the road we were on, was not, but it was still black.  Louisa Street it was truly workers because our next door neighbors to the right she was a teacher, as a matter of fact.  And to our left the gentleman was a truck driver and my dad [Felix Gordon] was a construction worker and my mom [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] now was substitute teaching.  But before she transitioned to that she was working at a manufacturing plant.  And then we moved over to Willow Street which is Colonial Heights, that is an area.  That was where I was from--my mother still lives there since 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 810 [unclear] Willow Street that was the address, as a matter of fact.  It's one of the higher points in Columbia, so you could actually zoom in and pick it up on the internet.  It actually gives you a place to actually tour to see it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35089
Speaker 1: So you started school on Louisa Street [Columbia, South Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: I started school on Louisa Street.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: It was Carver Elementary [School].
Speaker 1: Carver Elementary?
Speaker 2: I went in first grade.
Speaker 1: Alright.  You talked about the first day of school and they discovered you were an artist.
Speaker 2: First day of school my mom [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] had to work so my sister, Feleen [Haynie Gordon] actually walked me in to school and I remember that being a significant event for me because that also became the drawing that I imagined us going to school and the picture I drew was my sister and I walking into Carver from what would be the east side of the school.  And what I did was I actually drew the school and I drew it with every brick now having not seen the drawing since 1966 what I do know and I tried to capture me holding her hand walking into the school through the doors and I drew the bricks on the building.  Where they overlapped and where the perspective is of looking at the building going toward it.  I think it was probably picked--I can only imagine what it looks like right now but I would suspect in the archives it has to be there from the school board someplace.  I thought about one day trying to look it up but I-sometimes in my mind it is almost better to keep the image than to actually see what it is because you'll find that you have increasingly vivid memories of things that never occurred.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35090
Speaker 1: Okay, so, your mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] was an artist but--is that why you picked up art, you think it was just an innate thing or what was it?
Speaker 2: I think it's innate because every one of us can draw to some extent.  And I say draw, I mean see they can see and they reproduce what you see.  Every one of us had that talent, every one of us has the ability to understand to some degree the notions of perspective which really is the challenge of most people being able to see and reproduce.  Because everybody can draft, if you teach them how to view an object from the front, above, right and/or left side depending upon the requirements.  So every person can do that because that's an empirical view of the world.  But to be able to see and then reproduce our family can do that and so that skill is there.  Now the challenge if you said an artist, the challenge of being an artist, I think there are few of us that also have that unique ability as well.  To be an artist, and I think I've talked about that a little, there is an element of romanticism you have to have.  And you have to be able to try and capture what you are thinking and seeing anyway that you can express it where others can potentially feel what you feel when you complete.  There are about half of us can do that visually.
Speaker 1: Okay so we are talking about transference of image but also emotion.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right because that's when it's art otherwise you're just a copier--you're just a copy cat.  Emotions are original, always original and so-because otherwise like one of my friends when we were coming up there was Lorenzo.  Lorenzo used to love to copy other artists' work.  I would never, ever, ever draw another drawing, ever.  And even from an early age I thought that was--there was something wrong, I couldn't tell why it was wrong.  Because, for instance (unclear) say could you draw the Mona Lisa and I would say I can draw the Mona Lisa but that's not my idea, that's not my idea.  You know they say what makes it so special, and they talk about why is she smiling and some people say she is pretty and I say not relevant.  [Leonardo] da Vinci got you to staring at that picture and looking at it and asking yourself a myriad of questions and got you to feeling something.  It might be exactly what he was thinking, it might not be but he pulled you in and he did it by making your eyes dance and making your emotions dance as well.  And that's why I think when you say artist, that's what I look for.  It is also why I don't think I became the artist that I potentially could have been.  But I do remember from everything I have ever done, I remember the emotions I had behind what I was trying to do, and candidly it is also the reason why I don't keep very many pieces that I have actually done because, I never accomplished all that I was trying to make happen.
Story_ID: 35091
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this now.  Kids as artist often have to use materials that are available, shirt cardboards; you know paper bags and all kinds of different things.  Because your mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] was an artist too at one point and studied some art in school did she have materials available for you to use?
Speaker 2: No. There was not a lot of materials, as a matter fact, candidly in college the reason I ultimately shifted from being a fine artist to a (unclear) was because I couldn't afford the materials, it is very expensive and I couldn't afford it.  And by the way hopefully my mother will never see this because she doesn't know that and I would never share that with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your tools would be like a pencil?
Speaker 2: Pencil, pen, regular pens, those are the things I would use.  Whatever was available and if we had glue, I would use glue.  I could put together things with glue and create different configurations of something.  My son kind of inherits breaking stuff up to make something else out of it and unfortunately I've come so far away from what I used to be that sometimes I would actually chastise him from being all that he could be mentally as an artist.  To that part--if you ever ask the question of what I regret, that's one of the regrets I will say I have.  Is not letting him color outside the lines which is what another artist told me one time which is why I love realism so much.  And the reason why I became a soldier because to be an artist you have to be willing to be free.  You have to be willing to let yourself go and break outside of bounds that are both societal and also inside of your own value system.  I couldn't do that and I still--I'm bound by certain rules, and so I also kind of tamed him in some of those ways and I shouldn't say "tame" (unclear)--I boxed him a little more than he probably should be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35092
Speaker 1: Now you were at Carver [Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina] for just a couple of years?
Speaker 2: One year then we went to what was at the time Blessed Martin de Porres [school]. Now St. Martin was one of the first black saints.  The school was a combination of middle class and kids whose parents were just wishing for something better because it was not integrated except the teachers.  They were nuns, they were all nuns and they were strict.  I mean I had my hands spanked so many times I probably went to school expecting it to happen (laugh).  I was a little bit mischievous, I won't lie.  I was also credited with probably being brighter than I think I really was but they for the most part, there was a group of nuns that absolutely embraced me.  Unfortunately as time goes on the only one you remember is Sister Marie Leo and she is probably the one that was toughest on me just because--and because I think she was like the head at the time.  The rest of them--there was one nun that embraced me a lot and I thought she was attractive, I should not think like that but she was and she liked me a lot and I think she was actually of German descent.  But she--when I saw her I always felt comforted that it was a good day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were there from 1961 until 1966.
Speaker 2: '66 [1966] was a big deal because 1966 is also when the enforcement of integrated schools occurred in Columbia, South Carolina.  And there was an expectation in my mother's [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] mind that was going to make a difference in the quality of education, but very candidly my ability to read and even logic was better than the other kids that were there.  As a matter of fact, I at that point in time I could usually read--I could read a poem and be able to recite the poem after a couple of readings and be able to talk about what it was about.  But it also began what I call a bit of a slide in my desire when we transitioned.  Because now we were in schools where they were integrated, but it was--you didn't get the attention that you needed.  I think I needed more attention because for the next--truly for about the next four or five years, I was not the academician.
Story_ID: 35093
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were telling us about school and '66 [1966] you went over to another school as part of the integration--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Part of integration in Columbia, South Carolina.  That was the first year that we started integrating the schools and opening doors.  As you might suspect there was a little bit of tension but there was really not as much as you might suspect.  It happened at other places--(simultaneously) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you we didn't talk about this before but what was Columbia like in terms of did you have like black and white water fountains downtown, I mean the whole--(simultaneously) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I drank out of a separate water fountain until 1965.  As a matter of fact, there was a transition and we could see it up; the signs were still up.  One of the signs that stayed up "White Only" at a place until about 1969 but the reality was it was very clear that those were not being enforced anymore.  The other part I would tell you that about the issues of segregation is when you live in it and you're raised in it and you're brought up in it, it becomes the way it is.  You know, the old expression, but once you go to Paris it's hard to keep somebody down on the farm; that was starting to happen.  There was an exposure happening because every time relatives went north and come down they would ask some questions and so there was a period of enlightenment that was starting to occur.  And even in our home it was starting to occur because my brothers and sisters were getting restless.  I remember in some cases I used to question why are they unhappy, you know why are they unhappy because I was still ignorant of really the impact of racism, I really was.  I almost had to reflect back to the points of racism.  One of the earliest elements of racism that I experienced was my very first best friend was a kid named Bunky.  Back when we lived off of (unclear) Road in Columbia and I was just a really young boy before we moved to Louisa Street there was a carpet or some kind of manufacturing company, it was right next door to us, carpet company and Bunky and I played together every day and we were friends.  One day Bunky and I could no longer play together and my mom told me Bunky was moving and I saw Bunky--I would see him still and I couldn't understand why I couldn't play together.
Speaker 1: So Bunky is white?
Speaker 2: Bunky was white.  I couldn't understand why I couldn't play with Bunky.  It was not until I was probably forty years old that I realized the unwritten rules about blacks and whites playing together.  In other words when they go to an age of reasoning that's when you had to separate them and that was a white rule, I didn't know it.  And so I had to look back on that period.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when you couldn't play with him anymore?
Speaker 2: It was before first grade.  So there was a window of time somewhere between ages four just under six when that occurred.  In fact, I could probably say it was before five because before my sixth grade we moved to Louisa before I entered the first grade I was on (unclear) Road.
Story_ID: 35094
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the school that you integrated?
Speaker 2: It was Withers, W-I-T-H-E-R-S, Withers School [Columbia, South Carolina].  It was roughly five blocks from the house, I could walk to it.  It was literally straight down West Avenue and I could go in--and school there.  They did something else, they did a bracket based upon grades and my grades were probably about a B+, B somewhere thereabouts and they put me in a group with the average students.  When I looked at the material they had it was absolutely below what I had but since that's where I was bracketed that's where I stayed.  I remember spending the first half of the year just absolutely bored stiff.  But it was also in later years explained to me there were some things that happened.  Education is a building block process and so it was like Rip Van Winkle, I went to sleep in class and I woke up in that mode.  And so then all of a sudden there was a transition and that's why I said--but still when it came to things like reading and logic and obviously the innate talents of art, there was never ever an issue of catch up or ever an issue of understanding, and even when I went to the junior high school the next year at Heyward Gibbes High School when they talked of linguistics, I remember the teacher saying we are going to teach you all linguistics.  While the word was new the concepts were not.  One of the expressions that was used was-it was a book, they were teaching us how to avoid the name--the name was not known called Ebonics, but they didn't call it Ebonics.  The book--I will quote this for you. She said some people will read this sentence--there is a picture of a guy leaning on a rail and falling into the water, and the caption went like this, it says "Don't lean on dat rail. Naw it saw right. No I tell you it taint. Help, help. Told you not to lean."  That was in the book, linguistics and so she said how should that have read?  And it was "Don't lean on that rail."  "No, it's alright."  Then he falls and the next caption says, "Help, help." "I told you not to lean on that rail." And that's a quote, and I laughed when I saw it.  She explained to me, "Well that's how some people talk."  And I knew what "some people" meant.  And it was in a book.
Speaker 1: This had been institutionalized--this mock African American accent.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, it was in the book and so I look at that and I've always laughed.
Story_ID: 35095
Speaker 1: Now that would play itself out later on when I was sloughing in college and all my professors--one of my professors got on my grades and he looked and he says I just want to see something.  And at the time Creighton [University, Omaha, Nebraska] had this guy that was playing basketball for Creighton and he literally was illiterate and so the professor asked me because it was the art department, he says I just want to see something.  He said, read this and so when he put in front of me I started laughing.  He said why are you laughing, is there a problem?  I said no, no problem; I said you want it with or without an accent?  So then he called me a smart ass by about the middle of the sentence.  He said what's the problem and I said sir your classes are boring and I said and you are not challenging me to think.  And so that also began a period of shared respect but unfortunately it was also late--a little bit late in the game.  But I had enough fans that--I say fans I am talking about academic fans that I wasn't resting like I would have before.  But that was the probably that kind of feeling about how we speak, how we think also influenced me later on.  And I will talk about some of this as we start to go to combat and when we start to go places and we start to train people to think.  It helped me--all of these things helped me tremendously when I started to lead men and started to have to develop men.  Just as clear as I can recall those words they are all still in my hard drive.
Story_ID: 35096
Speaker 1: You're at Withers [School, Columbia, South Carolina]-(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Sixth grade, I'm eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Eleven years old.  This is about the time your parents [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray and Felix Gordon] split up?  How did that affect you?
Speaker 2: I don't like to want to believe--I didn't want to believe that it was as impactful as it was.  But at this point in time there was financial strain in the house, there was a level of tension--my brother now was graduating from high school, my oldest brother Felix, had also who was probably the most talented person I've ever met had been diagnosed with epilepsy and the tension in the house was you could cut with a knife because Felix ran a nine-nine hundred yard dash as a ninth grader.  Felix could dunk a basketball at six foot.  He was on the varsity football team and a starter at Cardinal Newman High School and all of a sudden his world collapsed around him.  And so that strain is occurring inside the house.  My brother Julian, who was very talented but just a hard worker was starting to look at his other options in life as he goes forward.  And he was entering Drea [ph.] High School and their tensions I don't know their specifics but you could feel their tensions because he is now also in a white high school.  And not just a white high school, a ranked white high school.  Which he still did not struggle with any of the issues, as a matter of fact he was selected to be an exchange student, but of course he could not financially afford it, so here are tensions of capabilities, options that are not being realized by my older siblings.  And, of course my sister [Feleen Haynie Gordon], she is the oldest and so now there are things that she wants and cannot achieve and you feel some of those things.  So I don't ask for anything, it's not my nature.  Morris [Lawrence] probably misses Dad more than anybody else but he never said it because that's the way Morris is.  And all of this is happening inside the house so now the goal for me is to try to take as much pressure off my mom as I can.  So I cut grass, I do anything I could and the funds that I received I don't claim for my own.  I actually put it back in the house to do what I can in the house.  Each of us has our own belief about how we are doing and what we are doing inside the house but mine is to take pressure off mom.  I don't see Dad very much anymore at this point in time.  This is--he stopped through because there is tension between them, and my dad and I talked about it later on.  And Mom is trying to deal with those challenges and this goes on for probably four almost five years.
Story_ID: 35097
Speaker 1: And then into the picture and somewhere two years or more before they decide [Isiah Bray and Gordon-Bray's mother, Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] to get married, Isiah Bray comes into the picture.  He doesn't come into the house until the end of my--beginning of my sophomore year.  The first time I know that there is a guy that Mom is interested in.  One of the points you brought up earlier which was occupying a house with so many kids, I'm a sophomore in high school now at C.A. Johnson [School; Columbia, South Carolina] which by the way I was supposed to go to Eau Claire High School after I leave my middle school which is Heyward Gibbes [Middle School] which by the way only had nineteen and we grew to thirty African Americans in the school.  I better not skip ahead too much, I don't want to spend a lot of time at Heyward Gibbes but that's where the linguistics begin.  But we were going to Heyward Gibbes that the second year of integration.  My brother, Morris [Lawrence] had been there the year before I got there and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: So this was like '67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: This is '67.  Morris explains to me what it is and we come to the school.  Of course, we're not--the middle school kids are just starting to try to figure this out.  There is a girl named Darlene who likes me but she is white and so Darlene and I only ever talked to each other when the hallways are empty because that's a major no no.  And the prettiest girl in school is a girl named Connie.  Connie likes to talk to him but she is also a little leery about doing that.  But the next year or a year and half later, Connie gets-her youngest sister comes into the school at the same time a friend of mine named Kenny Davis comes in to the school.  Kenny Davis transfers in from Orangeburg-Wilkerson [High School] out of Orangeburg, South Carolina.  His mother is the first Ph.D. in the state of South Carolina in English.  And Kenny comes in with a full package.  He has all the confidence, academic accomplishments, and athleticism of people well ahead of his years.  And Connie's sister falls for him hard and she doesn't care.  They started to change this and Kenny is popular, so talented, so everything, that you can't take anything from him.
Story_ID: 35098
Speaker 1: We [Kenny Davis] become best buds [at Heyward Gibbes Middle School, Columbia, South Carolina] and because we become best buds, you know everybody talks about you being a wing man, the effects of the wing man.  The effects of the wing man are tremendous.  Because one, Kenny drives me to start--to start--the first time of transition now I play sports.  I play football in the league downtown and I also by the urging of my cousin I join Boy Scouts and I actually made Life Scout in less than a year and a half.  I become the fastest ranking Boy Scout in the state of South Carolina and I'm picked for Order of the Arrow by the end of my freshman year.  I'm actually tapped out because my mother [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] actually finds the funds to send me to Boy Scout camp at the urging of her sister to do that because she sent her kids.  That was a big deal; that was a collision point because all of a sudden there is another level of inspiration and aspiration that Kenny Davis brings with his mom's package as well as just his physical talent.  The things that Kenny did with a basketball I didn't see until NBA [National Basketball Association; basketball games].  He also understood the game.  He got me to play--to even go out for basketball.  Made the team but it was surely just on the team, I was just on the team.
Speaker 2: So you weren't like--you didn't consider yourself a basketball player before that?
Speaker 1: I was but I was a street ball player.  I could shoot, I shot improperly.  My brothers didn't put me on the court.  My brothers were--Fel was so far ahead of anybody else on the street, my brother Felix.  He was so far ahead he could only play with high school seniors and college players.  That's how good he was, he really was that good.  And it probably helped change him because he always hung out with such an advanced crowd but it also hurt him.  He was always a big fish in a big pond so it looked like a small fish in a big pond and it affected him later on which he was always my big brother.  So that's what that was.  But Kenny Davis was reachable, he was tangible, he was talented.  Kenny eventually became an architect and we found each other ironically because he had transferred from Clemson [University] to Southern [University] as the engineer and we were fraternity brothers and we met each other.  Never seen each other at the time in almost ten years, at a party, and he started to actualize all the things that he was.  But his confidence was infectious and it helped me change.
Story_ID: 35099
Speaker 1: Now as we all were leaving ninth grade [at Heyward Gibbes Middle School, Columbia, South Carolina], the zone in Columbia hit.  Columbia was rezoning because they still hadn't got the integration right.  Heyward Gibbes [Middle School] talked about it was essentially still probably 2 percent or 3 percent African Americans even after three years of the change.  They are now trying to figure out how to get Eau Claire High School more balanced and Columbia High School and C.A. Johnson [school] more balanced but they were using maps.  I mentioned earlier that gentrification was starting to begin in the place where we first moved, so on the map they still thought of our neighborhood as being mostly white.  The reality is our neighborhood now had become mostly black.  So all of a sudden what was--over the summer my high school was Eau Claire, by the time the first day of school rolled around and the time I actually went in school, I went from Eau Claire to C.A. Johnson.  A school that was previously all black was now just more black than the zone was and the zoning.  So I was at C.A. Johnson for one year, my sophomore year.  Absolutely a shock to be at C.A. Johnson after having left Heyward Gibbes.  And good teaching, in fact C.A. Johnson has actually produced two astronauts.  But while I was at C.A. Johnson I was also carrying newspapers in the morning.  I would get up at four o'clock in the morning to deliver newspapers. Well early one morning I actually--I was running across a yard and I took a piece of glass that opened an artery in my left ankle.  I was losing blood and I told my brothers I said I had just punctured an artery; I need to get to a hospital.  He said boy you're crazy and I moved my hand and the blood just started spurting out and he panicked and I said just get me to the hospital.  I said I will be okay.  I did lose a little bit of blood and it made my leg weak.  And basketball practice was going to be again in a few weeks and I tried to get out on the court and play and I kind of opened that back up because it wasn't ready to do anything yet.  My leg has swollen up so I couldn't play that year and that set me kind of a downer that I couldn't play in sports and I was at C.A. Johnson.  In the spring they had golf try outs and because I had been on a golf course with Isaiah Bray p[Gordon-Bray's step-father] before, I was actually the number two man and I was horrible but I was still the number two man in Columbia, South Carolina so I'm playing against kids that were scratch golfers from other schools.  I lost my taste for the game and candidly haven't played golf three times in a year since.  But I did qualify for a letter however, on the last match of the year we were parking the golf carts and the golf cart I was on the brake went out on it and I tumbled and strained everything on my right side of my body.  The kid who gave me the golf cart told the team coach that I wasn't authorized to drive that cart but I had taken the cart.  I told him I said coach that's not true.  The captain of the team said no Bray--he said Arnold Gordon didn't take the cart and the coach said well look you're not going to get your letter because you shouldn't have done--I said I didn't do that.  The happy ending was that C.A. Johnson gave me my letter in 2010, after so many years because like I said, by that time I'm now general officer [U.S. Army] and I came back to tell them one more time to tell them I never took a cart, I never stole a cart and the guy just basically lied to you.  Of course, my word mattered a little more to them at the time.
Story_ID: 35100
Speaker 1: But because of the system being zoned, I no longer was there [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina] the next year we got zoned to Columbia High [School].  So at Columbia High I did my junior year.  And in Columbia High we--it was a sports factory, great school, good school downtown but now I have no allegiance to a school.  It's not part of my system.  The only good thing about it was Kenny Davis [Gordon-Bray's friend from Heyward Gibbes Middle School] was there.  Kenny was there and Kenny by the way was now an established star.  They had been to state twice, he's been a star at the school, he's a starter as a junior and they won back the state.  Kenny right now is establishing this and so he brings me back on his wing a little bit trying to get me to come out for basketball but by this time now I'm out of the system.  And the factory is--they got a pipeline from the junior high school and of course, Coach Barton (unclear) says really not sure you fit our system (unclear) but Kenny basically kind of almost persuades them to let me on the team if I want to and I know that I'm not part of it so I don't play anymore.  I try out but before the last cut I decide not to even come out because Kenny always tells me straight, he really didn't want you but I think he will take you and so I don't go.  So I finished that year and I'm actually floundering because I go through school, I'm downtown, I play pool I was pretty good at pool.  So I would skip off downtown and shoot pool but I had enough teachers who would always try to pull me in and keep me focused.
Story_ID: 35101
Speaker 1: This is also part of the toughest year of being without my parents, tough year.  Because my dad goes to Vietnam [War], my brother's in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: So your dad--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: My step-dad [Isiah Bray].
Speaker 2: He's in the--(simultaneously)
Speaker 1: He has now moved--they are now married.  They get married the summer of 1971 and he goes to Vietnam.  My brother, Julian, who we thought was going to go to the Academy, he goes to Vietnam.  Julian--now Julian used to always get these magazines, because he was a strong student at Drea [ph.] High School, he is not talented athletic, but he is very athletic.  The academies are interested and so I'm seeing all these great brochures he gets to the house.  West Point [Unites States Military Academy], Naval Academy letters of interest and he is asked again to go over and be an exchange student because he speaks fluent Spanish and so I'm thinking, wow this is pretty neat.  But--I really just liked the cool uniforms that they are wearing and I'm thinking that's pretty neat.  So I'm now--at this point in time I'm saying in two years I'm going to go join the military that's one thing I'm going to do and I kind of focused there.  So I go through my junior year and at this time (unclear) has already served about a year in the Signal Corps.  He is doing well and he says he is also trying to help Mama a little bit and we can see some things happening but at the same time Vietnam is Vietnam.  We are getting the letters back from him and there were some challenges going on.
Story_ID: 35102
Speaker 1: One of the biggest impacts that Columbia High [School, Columbia, South Carolina] academically that year is I read Malcolm X's autobiography.
Speaker 2: Now is this in school or--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: This is in school because this is--there is a course I take called Black Studies which by the way is a shift for me because at this point in time we are struggling being colored.  Colored was the, it was a challenge because in my household and in my psychic my dad Felix Gordon is--he is against all the radicals, I mean the radicals he is against all of them, absolutely.  But my brothers and sisters are actually pro Stokely Carmichael and all those kinds of guys and they are doing that.  And at the same time, I'm siding with my dad in many ways, why are we trying to upset this apple cart?  But when I read the book and I look inside of what's inside of Malcolm X's radical ideas and revelations, I start to sense a change both in him, America and in me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35103
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to take you back a little bit to--you were--I guess you were in junior high school when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: That raises a great connection.  Dr. King's philosophies as well as Malcolm X's philosophy were starting to become alive in my house.  I mentioned the fact that my brothers and sisters were starting to struggle with where would they be in the positions of non-violence versus "by any means necessary?"  It was very clear in my dad's [Felix Gordon] mind don't trip the apple cart even though in his own world he was very staunch when dealing with a lot of his white clientele because he repaired homes in a lot of places.  He was still more of the Booker T. Washington mind set.  And my mom [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] was absolutely about being everything you are capable of being and competing at every level to show them that you are the best.  Those are not just feelings that was basically words, "You are as good as anybody" and all you have to do is just do your best because your best will be better than most.  And so she would say things like that and so there is that struggle and so we're in school--I remember when--when King died in '68 [1968], Jeramiah Johnson, when he died-when King died, he was more radical at Heyward Gibbes High School.  He said nobody better not bother me today and I remember him getting--bucking up if you will and so all of his friends would kind of buck up similarly.  But the day actually went pretty quietly at Heyward Gibbes or the period went pretty quietly.  There would be some folks who would speak under their breath but nothing happened at the school.
Story_ID: 35104
Speaker 1: But in Columbia [South Carolina] there was a [civil right] movement.  My sister [Feleen Haynie Gordon] was active with the movement, sit-ins and all those kinds of things, she participated and so some of that would make it back into the house but--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now was the movement like centered around a college?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sitting on the state house steps.  There was another young man called Redfern--Jimmy Redfern II (ph. splg.) who was also starting to become very vocal in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: What I was asking though was the movement--did it emanate from Benedict [College, Columbia] or was it a community based?
Speaker 1: It was both--Benedict had some impact--but not so much at Benedict. And I don't want to get my years mixed up but things were happening in South Carolina.  I can remember '68 [1968] or '70 [1970] but there were some murders that occurred down in South Carolina State that started to cause some disturbances in the community is where people were starting to become active and agitated.
Speaker 2: I think '68 [1968] or '69 [1969] Orangeburg [South Carolina] massacre in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: That is exactly right.  And so that period you could feel the reverberations there.  And my brother Julian used to ride down to Orangeburg a lot.  Because he was also trying to figure out which college he might decide to attend.  He was getting scholarship offers and like I said he was also influencing me by what he was looking at and letting me see these glossy brochures to go forward.  But at the same time the tension of the nation was still felt in the house.  And I remember my dad [Felix Gordon] for all the things that he said, he would say that Dr. King is a fool; I wouldn't let anybody hit me like that.  But I also remember him talking about the fact that the whites are people to do what they want to.  As a matter of fact, my sister said that [Ku Klux] Klan can walk right down that street and we couldn't do anything about it.  And so there was a fear at the same time that that caused because they were still alive and well in Columbia, South Carolina.  I mean, even today there are those that especially in West Columbia where there are still an element undercurrent that you can still feel in parts of Columbia.  I mean, now having said that as there are in parts of every city in this country and indeed, in the world.  But for all of that we started to work past that and you could see people's mind sets change.  I talked a little about Connie and her little sister.  At the local level Connie and Kenny Davis changed Heyward Gibbes [School] because all of a sudden here was a person that was as talented as anybody else, now he should have been athlete of the year but he wasn't--it was given to a guy named Vince who played a couple of sports.  But the reality is that Kenny was a track star, a basketball player, but Kenny is black and it was very clear that he was not going to get that for all those reasons.  Plus the people were upset because he had absolutely captured the imagination of all the girls at the school, black and white.  He was a special kind of a person not to mention the fact that he also influenced me to realize that if you do certain things you will cross the barrier will tolerate you crossing them.  If you have all the talent you can cross those barriers.  That was pretty interesting.  So the King impacts were absolutely aptly felt in households in the communities.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35105
Speaker 1: Now, if I may shoot forward now to junior year [of high school, Columbia, South Carolina] because this becomes--this is really is a big transition for me.
Speaker 2: Now you are reading the autobiography of Malcolm X and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Autobiography of Malcolm X because I sense some of the feeling of ignorant that he had early on and also the world that was around him but I also sense the brilliance of who he was as a human being and I start to share some of the unpreparedness that he had in having to deal with Elijah Muhammad but I also saw the revelation at the very end once he is now exposed to people not of color who also understand his plight and are willing to reach across lines.  So much so that I then start to look at Dr. [Martin Luther] King with another view and I get a chance to look at the March on Selma [march from Selma to Montgomery; Alabama; 1965] and see Viola Liuzzo, the only person to die in the March on Selma and she is a white woman with five kids.  And so as I am looking at that I start to see change has to be something that is blended, has to be.  It lets me drop a little bit of my guard of what I was starting to transition to by this point in time.
Story_ID: 35106
Speaker 1: My brother [Julian Gordon] also comes back from Vietnam at the end of my junior year [in high school in Columbia, South Carolina] and he comes back with all of the fire that a segregated war brought into him.  He was--he had not been a front line soldier, he was an aviation repairman so he brought back his point of Vietnam and of course, if that's the part of Vietnam that you hear, that's what Vietnam War. Now my dad [step-father, Isiah Bray] was an infantryman--he didn't stay the whole time because Went [ph.] made the sacrifice and told them since my mom had a husband and a son, he said both of them shouldn't be there.  So Went (ph. splg.), my brother Julian, told them only one of us needs to stay and he said I'm staying, to push my dad out.  My step-dad tried to change that, but he said I'm very glad Went made that decision. He said, 'cause I would be an infantryman going forward.  And an infantryman went forward--their camaraderie with their white counterparts is totally different than those who were back in the rear areas where the maintenance and the mechanics were as much more segregated.  Wint brought a lot of that back, as a matter fact, he talked about Vietnam and the world and he brought back some of the anger that many of us may have felt but he brought back the anger of African Americans across the country.  He was very radical; I remember him coming back, and he was taking on causes and the gentleman I spoke about called [Jimmy] Redfern II, he had partnered at least in philosophy with him in many cases to look for change in Columbia [South Carolina].  And he came back and he did go back to school on the GI bill and re-enrolled, enrolled into Benedict [College], but he didn't stay long.  But he did get married, and he married a white girl. And by now--by the time he married her we had just moved to Missouri at the very end of my junior year.
Story_ID: 35107
Speaker 1: And that decision, by the way was one that my step-father [Isiah Bray] opened to the family.  When he came back [from the Vietnam War] he said I'm being stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and he said do you all want to go?  Being I was a senior my mother asked me and not having been in a single high school for more than two years and looking for the chance of change I said absolutely I want to go to Missouri.  My little brother didn't care, Mike [Michael Gordon] liked having the stability that having Isaiah Bray brought because he was absolutely calming.  Calming effect and more importantly the financial stability for the first time probably in six years inside the family and the family grasped.  We moved to Missouri a week before my seventeenth birthday.
Speaker 2: This is in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 1: This is 1972.  And when we moved there we moved to Waynesville, Missouri. What was interesting about Waynesville is it was my first time actually leaving a five mile parameter around Columbia [South Carolina] and I drove through Atlanta [Georgia] and other places and I got a chance to start to see how big America really was.  But I also got a chance to start to see the similarities in our nation.  As you might suspect, as you probably know now I did not know Southwest Missouri is not a whole lot different from South Carolina.  In both ways the people that like you are very friendly of all colors those that don't will have pre-prejudices or precognitions about who you are.  They hold them until you can change them.  The difference was in this community I had a gym four blocks from my house and I moved to a place where I didn't know anyone and I was able to do a lot of things.  I got my first job with a stamped pay check bearing the Army/Air Forces exchange and I was able to--I could work there and I would play basketball every waking minute that I could.  My leg had healed over and it was now, you know virtually a hundred percent.  I met a young man named James Johnson who's probably got the best legs I've ever seen, could jump out the gym and so he became the person I worked with to compete on a daily basis and we played ball all the time.  More importantly over that summer Ted Oglesby was this guy who played for the Denver Nuggets [professional basketball team] in the early years.  He was at the gym playing against myself and James and he asked us what unit we were in, military unit.  And, of course, he knew James before he asked him if he had graduated yet and James said no but James didn't really know him.  He had seen him before and he asked me where was I going to school and I said some school called Waynesville [High School, Waynesville, Missouri].  He said you don't play basketball for them and I said absolutely not, I said I'm a senior and I was used to the Columbia system where if you are a senior you can't walk on the court and be a player.  And he told me he said I think you could probably play for them and start. And I told him I was a senior and he said now I think you could probably play for them as a start and I said no what makes you say that?  He said well I'm the coach, he said and I'm sure you could play from the start.
Story_ID: 35108
Speaker 1: He started working with us and sure enough when I went to Waynesville [Missouri] I told my dad-I said--step-dad [Isiah Bray] I said I got an offer to play ball and he said aren't you going to play and I said no I've got to work and he said why and I said because I need to work and he said you don't need to work.  He said if you want to play, I want you to play.  That was when I started to realize that he was just a neat man, just a neat person because--by now we had never lived in a house for real because he had been overseas while they were married.  And he is now in the house and I got a chance to watch him and I would do things like--I would shine his shoes for him at night so he wouldn't have to do them.  I learned how to shine shoes and I washed the car so that I could get the car, he took me to get my license because that hadn't happened before.  In fact, my Uncle Johnny had taught me how to drive a car in Columbia [South Carolina] and not the other family but close family members.  But he took me down and taught me to drive, let me have the car when I would do things I was supposed to do.  He absolutely stepped in.  One of the great moments in my high school years was it had snowed cats and dogs and we were playing an away game in Houston, Missouri a place about sixty miles away.  Even the bus going down there had slid off the road, and we didn't turn around, and we were still going to play this tournament down in Houston-not tournament, it was a game in Houston. And it was a tight game and we were playing a tight game.  About the start of the second half here comes some drill sergeants into the game and they're talking and he says, 'There is my son, number thirty two."  I proceeded to play part of my best games that I've ever played because I heard him loud and clear even though he had had one or two and it was just uplifting because I had not felt that before and that was significant.  But he was always there and I had just kind of missed it and then I saw it later on.  But Isaiah Bray was tremendous.  And that kind of encouragement had been him from the very beginning.

Speaker 1: And when it came time as my senior year [at Waynesville High School, Waynesville, Missouri] went on which by the way I also start becoming a better student because a small town, no place to go your social life is your school.  And so I was in school every day, all day in the classes and listening and was motivated to be there by a lot of things.  Even though I didn't have college on my mind I'm still thinking I'm going to go in the military, I was going to do it.  There were others who started telling me you ought to consider the Academy.  Well I thought about cool uniforms that my brother [Julian Gordon] used to show--it wasn't on my psychic yet.  In the spring, [University of] Central Missouri had an art contest and it was a state wide art contest and my art instructor at school said I want you and Jan to go to this competition.  He said I'll take you guys up, we'll do this.  Mom [Martha Lee McNeil Gordon Bray] said absolutely, dad [Isiah Bray] said I'm your biggest fan and he said absolutely.  So we went there and we did this competition and I entered four areas and I won three of the four.  This was the first time that I had actually been back in art in any serious sense since I was probably single digit school.  Once I had started to take interest in what I could do besides do a little small crafts and stuff like that.  But--and so I realized that this is a possible profession but it still not in my psychic yet.  And so as spring rolled around, it's April almost May and I'm getting ready to enlist.  My step-dad turns to me and said why are you still looking to go into the military?  I said well because that way I can do such and such.  He said I owe your mom more than that.  He said just go to school for one year, go to college for one year.  He said that school system really wants you anyway.  What I didn't know was Missouri, St. Louis and also Arkansas State [University] (unclear) played basketball but I had been basically dissuaded from believing that I could play at the next level. The great irony is that I'm the only one of all of our players and we had four students that were--one was an all conference, one was all state and we had James Johnson who was the most talented player I had ever seen with a basketball in high school.  Out of the four of us those others (unclear) which was a junior, of all of us went on (unclear) and played all four years eventually playing basketball.  One became a lawyer, one became an actor, don't know what happened to James and (unclear) Cal eventually opened his own business so it's amazing.
Story_ID: 35110
Speaker 1: I go to [University of] Central Missouri and Central Missouri-as I enrolled in Central Missouri and during freshman orientation the professor of military science and I want to say Graziano (ph. splg.) was his name, I'm just going to say Graz.  The lieutenant colonel is there he is standing in a uniform and all the freshman at that time had to go through the orientation for ROTC [reserve Officer's Training Corps], he stands in front of us and he has got that great uniform on.  And he's standing there and he says you ought to join ROTC, talking to all freshmen.  He said, it would supplement your physical education and other requirements also takes you in route to a degree in minor history if you do this right and he said more importantly you are commissioned as second lieutenant.  And so I said I get to wear a uniform?  He says absolutely, so I sign up for ROTC.  I tell my dad he says well you can do that and you will be a second lieutenant.  So the pathway to officership now is exposed to me and explained that I can be an officer equal to every other officer who commissions and at Central Missouri I enroll in--I major in art.  As as I said before, over time I have to transition from a fine art to art Ed. [education] for two reasons.  First one was because it cost so much to buy supplies, I still don't have a lot of money to do that; the other one is that by my sophomore year I'm encouraged to--I'm told to go play basketball because the coach says we thought you were going to go someplace else, you're here and I said well I will try out and he says who said try out, you're on the team.  I join and I do play ball four years and I finally get a scholarship in my junior year--end of my junior year and the funny part about that was I was never less than seventh man at any time.  I was never great, I had the best vertical leap in the conference my senior year which was thirty-nine and a half but I would always say forty or forty two because I do the math but the actual measured height is thirty-nine and a half inches.  Because I could touch the square without shuffling my feet on top of the square (unclear) my feet put a hand over it and so I always say that.  But I was a coach's boy and that's when the coach tells you to do something, not to shoot, I wouldn't shoot.
Story_ID: 35111
Speaker 1: But when I graduated from college [University of Central Missouri] I would actually play with the big eight all stars and some others in league play.  In one game I actually scored forty-five or forty-plus points against the same guys I played with and only scored five or six or ten against before.  And they said where was this when you were playing for a (unclear) school?  I said it wasn't the coaches playing and so that's why I did't do.
Speaker 2: So what position did you play?
Speaker 1: I played forward center but the coach did realize in my going into my senior year that I was actually a pretty decent ball handler so he experimented with me bringing the ball up against big men if he saw pressure against our guards when we played schools that had really good guards and that was only a couple of times.  So I would bring the ball up but my natural position would have been more of a forward because I could, in fact, handle a ball.
Speaker 2: You were more like a swing man on the team?
Speaker 1: Absolutely because--and that's what I ultimately did when I played in different leagues after I graduated.  When I came back and play against the school, you know in the year of the train ups, I played with a lot more freedom and he would say where was that and he would laugh.  He said if I ever had you differenty I would have played you differently if I had really known you like I knew you.  I gave him an alibi and the alibi was this-once I understand a concept I break, and basketball was about understanding the concepts.  I was an immature basketball player when he first had me.  And so I didn't fully understand these are the rules, you can do a lot of things inside the rules.  I was almost a literalist.  So later on I was able to merge the talent with the rules and became a different ball player.  So I'd tell him it's not your fault, it's mine, I just never experienced yet to know.  I heard what you said but now it is what I'm going to do and I didn't know that yet.  And so that was the big difference.
Story_ID: 35112
Speaker 1: Okay now I read some place that you had actually had a fan club at [University of] Central Missouri, right?  And you were the only player in the college or in the conference that had a fan club, right?
Speaker 2: I can't speak for the conference but when I was in the college I was the only player on the team that had a fan club.  It was led by Judge Russell's boy because I could dunk and I could dunk about--I had about twenty some different dunks I could do.  The little kids used to love to see me play because they would come during a practice or they would come during off time and they would see what I could do.  In only a couple of games I would either get frustrated or just tired of watching our guys not play when I had exert (unclear) like that.  But these kids would sit down on the end of the practices and on the bench and they would cheer for me even when I'm not in the game.  It came to light during my senior year when Coach Judge Russell--I mean Judge Russell not coach.  The coach had benched me because he was angry at me and he benched me against a team that he actually lost to spite me.  I say lost meaning he didn't put me in the game against a team that I really always could dominate and he looked down the bench and he looked at me and just stared me down.  He did it again, and we lost again and I was so angry I said I'm done with this crap.  I told Judge Russell I'm gone tell the guys I'm done.  And my guys looked at me and in about a fifteen minute period one of the fans and boosters was a guy named Robert Russell.  He came in and he said I heard you are thinking about quitting.  I said I'm tired, you saw what happened tonight, I said we lost and we had no business losing.  You know--I mean my hands were sweating, I said you know what I can do against those guys and he said yeah.  I said I'm just tired.  He said quitting is easy, he said if you quit it's easier every time.  He said and they cheated, he said you got a lot of little kids that watch you that admire you.  He said if you quit, he said you give them an excuse to quit.  I said that is unfair, that's unfair, that is absolutely unfair.  And, of course, before I left the locker room I just was feeling bad but I was back on the team.
Story_ID: 35113
Speaker 1: Okay we were just talking off camera about coaches and their proclivities.  You were giving a healthy defense of your coach.
Speaker 2: Yeah well I tell you it was--the truth of the matter is that one of the great influences of my life is Coach [Tom] Smith [University of Central Missouri].  I mean he was a for lack of a better word he was a butt hole sometimes but he also taught me about standards and empirical standards.  I mean, when we ran sprints or anything else there was a clock so if he said we weren't performing he could show us in a measurable way we were not performing.  Before we ever came inside the gym every year we had to run a mile under five thirty [time].  Every person had to run it and the clocks were always put out visually so you couldn't cheat the clock.  Nobody could say oh yeah you made it, you were watching the clock as you went around each lap and you could see it.  And everybody else in the stands could see it.  The few people that were watching they all could see it.  When we had to run in those sprints he would pick a great day when we were all motivated and we would run wind sprints and he would use that clock it was the standard.  And so when we were not putting out he would say you guys are not moving, you're not hustling and he would put the clocks up and we would see it.  So he said you don't want to play basketball well at least get in shape and he said go downstairs and get the sweats.  And we would go out and we'd run in the snow and of course, you don't want to stay in the snow; you don't want to stop in the snow so you got to run.  He was just tough like that and he was tough minded.  I remember being sick one year I had a pretty high fever and I said coach I got this (unclear) and he says that's alright you will run it out.  You will feel like crap immediately after but you will be alright and he was right, he was absolutely correct.  But the lesson behind that was this as I became a soldier, in fact even as a ball player I learned to two things; guys on the other team don't care about what ails you.  As a matter of fact, if they know what ails you they will pick on what ails on and your enemy doesn't care if you are a hundred percent because you are never going to be a hundred percent.  In fact, most athletes are always hurt and so you got to perform, nobody cares.  And it helped transition me as a human being, so Coach Smith for all the things I disliked about him at that moment and that time I also learned to admire him as a human being.  In fact, when I thought I wanted to leave the military a couple of times my other passion which was to coach young men, I called him and I said I think I'm going to get out and he said great I'll put you on my coaching staff.  But then the [U.S.] Army had a diabolical way of offering me something more all along the way.  The opportunity to lead men and do things like that just made me transition from what I thought I was going to do because as I was starting to graduate from Central Missouri I realized--I knew I was going to have a commission if I completed the program.  Going into my junior year you have to go to a camp and so I went to an advanced camp or course which is really going to become kind of the first step in establishing where you are going to be in terms of assignments and also viewed by the military community and so I carried with me the coach's tenacity and also the willingness to compete to camp at Fort Riley, Kansas.
Story_ID: 35114
Speaker 1: Was there anything special about graduation from--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I'm not graduating yet.  This is the camp so I go to the course in 1976 I go to Fort Riley, Kansas.  When I go to the course while I'm there I realize that I got all the other universities across the country, seventeen universities across the country were represented.  Many of them have not been exposed to a lot of the woods like stuff because they don't have access.  Well my school [University of Central Missouri] had--we have a forest and a park called (unclear) Pearl Springs and so we could go out there and we were able to do a lot, our training out there as well.  So those skills were there and when I went to camp I was thinking about going into military intelligence, but me and a guy named David Farah-Inuenu (ph.; unclear) from [University of] Notre Dame were and a guy named Green [ph.] from Jackson State [University] had developed this camaraderie in competition amongst each other.  A guy named Les Abernathy from Texas A&M [University] who collectively made me want to both teach and compete in the best way, in the best way.  And when I finished camp I had a great time, I had a great time at camp.  More importantly what I felt was also expressed and I became a distinguished military student as a result of camp.  I made it to the top 10 percent (unclear) and all those things and so even though I was a Pershing Rifle which is the honorary society of military trainers--military members--college members I didn't know that I was good enough because I was also a basketball player.  The rest of these guys were really focused almost all the time full-time on ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And so when it came time for selection I was going to go MI [military intelligence] but because what had happened between me, Dave Farah-Inuenu (ph.; unclear) and Green and Les Abernathy I had a Forrest Gump moment where the guy looked at me out in the woods in the rain and he says where are you going to go?  He said (unclear) nope you are not just in the ROTC, you are an infantryman.  You are ought to be leading men in combat and so I did and that's what I did.  And so at the commissioning when I was commissioned I was prepared to go and do my two years so I had recruited for two years in the military active and then I was going to A.) go overseas and play basketball for a couple of years and then I was going to go to work at Hallmark because Hallmark expressed interest in me as an artist and an illustrator.  So that's what I thought I was going to be headed.
Story_ID: 35115
Speaker 1: But in 1978 at commissioning I went down to Fort Benning, Georgia and when I went to Fort Benning, Georgia that regimented life style and being able to have a life that allowed you to compete here [pointing towards the brain] and physically was like somebody had just pulled the light switch on, changed out the bulbs and said look this is what you are supposed to do.  So I went to airborne school while I was there and in the evenings I would play basketball with the post team and so I am playing against guys from college.  I had McDonalds all Americans and I was playing with one guy from [University of] Southern Mississippi who had played who was all combined in the service champion and also on the team with me Greg and he said why aren't you playing pro?  And I had heard some similar comments from other folks from summer league ball before I went in but now the word was starting to spread and one of the guys from the [U.S.] Army sports director's office came to see me and talked to me about playing all Army basketball.  I told them, I said I'll think about it later but not right now, I want a commission, I want to get to my first assignment.  Well they changed my first assignment from Fort Huachuca [Arizona] to Fort Jackson, South Carolina after I finished basic [training] in airborne school.  And when they did I went to Fort Jackson and before I was allowed to enroll at Fort Jackson-take my assignment at Fort Jackson and go to my unit they stopped me.  Someone from personnel branch had sent a ticket to go to Presidio [of Monterey], California and go play basketball on the Army team.  I went to try to talk to my commander and he wouldn't even see me.  He said you must be just a basketball player and I said sir I'm not and he wouldn't see me so he was passing messages down.  And the first significant officer I spoke to on the military base was the post commander, a two star general, General Blunt.  And General Blunt grabbed me and said you must be some kind of a basketball player?  And I said sir I'm okay; he said well Colonel Bozer (ph. splg.) told me he is not going to talk to you until I make a decision.  I said sir I have always made a decision, I coming to go to the unit.  He said well I played basketball, I still hold the record for most points scored in Rhode Island sixty-seven points in a game.  He said I would really like to see you play.  I said I'm not going to all Army and he said okay but I would like to see you play on the team here at Fort Jackson and I'll protect you from all the other folks while you're here but and he told me something in private.  He let me know when he was leaving and what he was going to do next.  He said well I'm telling you right now nobody else on post knows and he said but he said I can see you are an athlete and he said if you are anywhere near the officer that you are an athlete you are going to have a great career.  He said I'm going to tell you something I played Army basketball but the Army is changing, that's not going to be where we are going to go, you've got to be just a great officer.  And that was great counsel because from that point on I made sure that as much as I loved basketball, as much as it meant in my life to me it was always a sideshow and always had to be a sideshow.  And I did play for the team at Fort Jackson in my first assignment at night.  We won the TRADOC [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command] Championships, I played with them and we scrimmaged against University of South Carolina and first game they beat us by thirty-three points, second game they beat us by a last second jumper the team put together.  I got them to practice from nine to--our team practiced from nine to eleven [o'clock] at night so it would never interfere with my job.
Story_ID: 35116
Speaker 1: And while I was at Fort Jackson [South Carolina] I would get up at four thirty in the morning and I would always be the last person to leave the ranges as a chief (unclear) marksmanship.  Probably the most important thing that happened at Fort Jackson was I also begin to realize I said I can matter.  And the most significant here was the artist in me is an innovator.  I was told by one of my commanders he said if you see something that's broken, it is your responsibility to change it.  And we were going to ranges and we run ranges and we would waste a lot of time going up and down ranges.  I basically said where is the time being wasted?  Time being wasted from the time you shoot around to the time that you figure out what kind of adjustments you got to make on your weapon system.  And you are doing this in mass; you basically are shooting about 15 to 20 percent of the time that's the time you are just walking down the ranges.  So I requested to use spotter scopes and we used spotter scopes to change the ranges in time.  We cut off time down about 50 percent because just the safety aspects still consumed some time.  The other thing that happened on the ranges is the target that you currently use and we currently shoot was created on my ranges because we looked through the front site and I asked what's the difference of the width of the front site post, and a guy named Martin Norman--John Norman pulled my range and said sir it's about the same width.  I said why don't we use a (unclear) half bull to shoot--just questions.  And he said I'm not sure it's got to have (unclear) Fort Benning [Georgia].  So Fort Benning through Colonel Bozer (ph. splg.) we changed what we shoot on and so we changed from shooting at a (unclear) bull and trying and figure out what are the rounds impact to where we shoot.  The new general, General Blackie Bullbeck (ph. splg.) who came on post asked me another questions when he came on the range.  And he asked the question why do we shoot on those ranges at those distances?  And I had to go back and realize with more research and realize that we basically have been adjusting our weapon systems-adjusting our targets to the ranges and the ballistics of the rifle since 1911.  That's why we have been using twenty five meter ranges every since that time period.  So by the end of the my weapon tour which was just a little over a year at Fort Jackson, my recognition as a innovator and a person that questions things was significant enough that I left as a second lieutenant with a meritorious service medal which was unheard of for a second lieutenant to receive that medal and I didn't even know it.  But because that began the idea of thinking differently and being able to realize that you can in fact impact and matter.
Story_ID: 35117
Speaker 1: About half way through that tour [at Fort Jackson, South Carolina] one of my NCOs [noncommissioned officers] asked me another question; he said why are you at Fort Jackson?  And I said because that's where they sent me.  He says they don't send good officers to training bases.  He said you need to be with troops and I said well this is where they sent me.  He said go call your officer, your assignment officer and try and get it changed.  I didn't realize I could do that.  So I called my assignment officer and he said I can send you to Korea as soon as six or seven months and that's what we did and that got me back on other paths.  Ranger Melvin the command sergeant major of the unit told me if you perform well, he said a place you need to also go is to the 82nd Airborne Division.  He said because that's where our nation's best leaders should go and of course, he was biased because was from the 82nd as well.  But his counsel was pretty powerful because it's also what told me that's where I ultimately wanted to try and go to.  My assignment in Korea was awesome because when I first got to Korea I landed in the middle of the night and they had the chief of staff of the 2nd Infantry Division meet you and he says where you guys going to be assigned, where do you want to go?  Me and a guy named Hall showed up at the same time.  Hall had been in the seventh infantry division and he wanted just to be a XO [Executive Officer], I wanted to be platoon leader.  I had already been to mortar training school as well by this time and I said I would like to go there and I pointed to a spot on the map.  He said that's the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry and I said is that the closest we have to the North Koreans?  He started laughing, and I said that's where I want to go to.  He said I can get you to the 3rd Brigade which is the western corridor which is the traditional attack route into South Korea, I can get you there but after that the brigade commander will assign you as a second lieutenant.  He said are you really sure you want to go and I said yes sir that's where I want to be.  I got there and they shipped us out later on that evening and I got at (unclear) at some point in time we got over to the 3rd Brigade and then Colonel Nash--Colonel Lash met us and brought us in as young officers, talked to us and said where do you want to go, and I said I want to go right there.  He said that's the liberty bell, he said that's our furthest north unit and he said that's alpha company.  He said I can't guarantee that's where you are going to be but I can get you to the 9th Battalion under Colonel Seth Arell (ph. splg.)--yes Seth Arell and I said that's where I want to go sir.  We came in they pushed us there and we got to the battalion.  The XO was there, the battalion was out in the field and he looked at us and that little badge I had for meritorious service medal he said that's a meritorious service medal that you've got on.  I said yes sir; he said do you know what that means?  I said not really.  He said, he laughed and then he said well (unclear).  I said sir I just want to serve.  He said well (unclear) company is missing two officers and he said you might have to be both of them and I went up there and I became the executive officer and the second platoon leader and there I was able to join the unit right next with what I had planned to do which was called the Quick Reaction Force.  As we came in being part of that organization was awesome because every day I could look over and I could see every morning I could see the huge North Korean flag that was on the other side of Panmunjom.  And it waved every morning and I heard all the propaganda that they would say.  You, know GI go home, why are you there, why you not go home with your mother and they do this the whole year. But what it did for me was--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I didn't realize that they still did that kind of thing?
Speaker 1: Oh god yes.
Speaker 2: The last I heard that was in Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: No and the sense of purpose every morning [on tour in Korea] getting up to do that was tremendous.  And so I did both jobs for awhile,
Story_ID: 35118
Speaker 1: But I mean more importantly Captain Meredith (ph. splg.) was the company commander when I came in, and he looked at me with tremendous promise and respect.  And I remember how it felt because he said I had been there about a week--week and a half and so I'm second lieutenant and he said we've got to move down to Camp Humphreys [South Korea] and be the reaction force for the division for thunder bolt lightning.  And he said I would like for you to go down there--now there was a lot of things wrong with the preparation and I challenged most of them but I took a convoy without a map that went south of Korea, of Seoul, Korea and used Boy Scouts tricks to navigate to Camp Humphrey.  I had to kind to get past some information that was incorrect.  That was incorrect that was briefed by the member of my team to Captain Meredith to make him feel more comfortable.  But he had a relationship with them that predated me and I was smart enough to realize that.  I have two choices; I could pretend to be the bad guy that is a know it all or I can try to accept some of what they said that violated all of my sensibilities.  And specifically not having a map, not having the communications pieces that I know I needed to have and knowledge of the route to continue.  But we made it and we got there on time and the guys who had given bad information to Meredith look at me with a deep and ingrained respect for other abilities.  That carried over for the rest of my tenure so much so that when it was time to select the battalion mortar officer, Colonel Arell said hands down that it would be Bray.  And what makes that special is because only two lieutenants are really part of the battalion's special staff.  Scout platoon leader and the mortar platoon leader like three and the battalion (unclear) officer.  In the infantry unit the first two are the two top lieutenants out of the fifteen in a brigade or in a battalion.  And I was blessed to be one of those in that grouping.  It also told me that you emphasize your talents and you try to work on your slight weaknesses and I started to work very, very hard on them.
Story_ID: 35119
Speaker 1: I also started to do what I call walking the street.  You asked about a phrase or something I use - A game and walking the streets are kind of the things I used.  Walking the streets was part of the most relevant of the things I adopted.  We do a lot of simulation in training, it is awful lot of simulation in training and if you train to win a fight by using icons and fighting the simulation and doing things to beat the simulation you can't transfer that information.  But when you walk the street which is the transfer yourself to what really happens at a moment of contact you start imagine that people that you know, love, care for and the responsibilities of the aftermath of your decisions on to that simulation whatever it may be everything short of war is simulation you change.  You will make some different decisions but more importantly it becomes a rehearsal for your reactions, it becomes a rehearsal for your feelings and emotions.  And in combat later on I realized it allowed me to still my back.  Meaning it allowed me to be able to get over that next hump which is the surge when you lose somebody when somebody gets severely wounded because of something that happened in training.  It also allows you to be less reactive in terms of a response.  The time period--you say "God dang it" or whatever it may be are minimized.  And here's where some of those occurred:  before coming to Korea Sergeant Anderson was one of the guys that was a friend of ours who had been killed walking up on the DMZ, the demilitarized zone without using a compass or a map because he had done it so many times.  He had walked and veered over into North Korea, hit land mines and ultimately was killed on one of them and injured some members of his patrol as a result.  Sergeant O'Master (ph. splg.) was one of the guys who was on that patrol and became one of my guys later on when I inherited him.  We also lost one of our guys in the battalion who thought it would never happen to him.  Because the rule of north of the (unclear) is to stay on the roads because there is a lot of land mines from the Korean War that are still out there.  And they started doing things that they really shouldn't be doing and so I adopted that idea of mental realism before we trained to do something that was cost us.  So in the patrols that I ran-the live patrols that I ran in the DMZ I started to rehearse what ifs, what ifs.  If I find myself veering off I know that if we cross barbed wire you know that you are either entering North Korea or you getting ready to enter into a mine field going into North Korea.  On Christmas period of 1980 one of my patrols that I was leading we actually crossed the wire and my point man stopped and I was getting ready to really get irate because he stopped without me telling him to and then he got ready to light a flashlight and now I'm getting ready to run forward but then I remembered he's been trained to stop and assess and let me know.  When he turned the red light on he put it on a strand of barb wire.  We veered off of our track and I now had my patrol nearing a mine field so I thought.  And he waved his hand and I looked down and I looked back and we--myself, Taylor, the point man, and my RTO [radio telephone operator] we were now into the first wire almost to the second wire.  So we were now either clearing a mine field or well into it.  And so we walked ourselves back through this and I remember the feelings that I had of having to think about what would happen to me, what would happen to these guys' families if something happened.  But because we had rehearse all these things I felt pretty comfortable with everything else and also the lessons learned that I would have to carry back when we came back for debriefings.

Speaker 1: Following [tour in] Korea [U.S. Army] I was told that I would be going to the advance course early because while in Korea I was encouraged to take a company command but I didn't want to take a company command without having gone to the advance course first.  And so I went to the advance course--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm sorry now this is in--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: This is in 1981.
Speaker 2: '81 [1981] okay.
Speaker 1: In 1981 I'm now going to the advance course in Fort Benning, Georgia and one of the neat things about coming to Fort Benning Georgia in 1981 is while I'm in processing they--a lady looks and says, wow you're an airborne ranger.  You are an unmarried captain and I said yep and she said looks like you are going to the airborne school?  I said yeah, and she says and you are unmarried and I laughed.  I said, ma'am I'm immune to the ladies at Columbus, Georgia.  I said this is my third trip to Columbus now, I've been there for an advanced course, I've been there for airborne school, I've been there for mortar couse, I'm immune to Fort Benning.  She said well okay, but not you just got to get ranger school and I said I will do that when I finish up here if I don't go to aviation school.  When I go into the advanced course and I'm joined by a lot of the senior guys, in fact I'm the second or third most junior guy going through the advanced course.  They have what is called 'English for Dummies' where the guys come in that can't write, they basically are put into remedial classes for these course improvements and it has students from literally every college in the country are involved in this.  And, of course I'm not--I don't have to join the class so, of course I can write.  And so it makes me feel good for a lot of reasons but--that I'm not there because when you got kids there from [United States Military Academy] West Point, kids from other schools who are learning how to construct paragraphs and thoughts and put them on paper and I don't have to do that.
Speaker 2: From West Point?
Speaker 1: We had kids from every group--now unfortunately most of them are minorities that were in the remedial writing classes.  And I was just glad I wasn't in that.  In fact, I was--everybody said the course is actually defined in the first part with tactics, operations and through the military intelligence part of the course and after that it is all downhill.  Basically, all that stuff up to about Christmas.  Well, right before Christmas I finished up I'm number nineteen in the class and so I'm feeling pretty good about myself, I mean I am happy.
Story_ID: 35121
Speaker 1: Well a funny thing happens I meet a girl at one of the places downtown [Columbus, Georgia] and so I talk to her and she says well I've got a boyfriend and I said I really don't care about your boyfriend and she sees a fraternity emblem on me and she says you're in a fraternity and I said yes.  She says well my boyfriend and I say don't tell me but she tells me that he is in the same fraternity I'm in.  So I say oh I don't do that (unclear) I don't do that.  So I said you got any friends that look like you or act like you, I would love to meet them.  So at the end of November this--I get back to the dorm and a bunch of great looking girls come by and they stop by my house and they are all in there.  This one--this very whimsical, but has the most pleasing personality of all of them absolutely fascinates me.  And that's Alane, that's the woman that eventually would make me change everything I think.  But so she's in that grouping.
Speaker 2: Can you spell her name for us?
Speaker 1: It's A-L-A-N-E, Alane.  And so she is in that group and I really dismiss them, you know but they actually all signed my book, okay.  And that was kind of funny, in fact she laughs about that today.  They all signed books with their numbers and names.  And in February we're still doing the [advance training] course [Fort Benning, Georgia] and everything else, one night I'm actually trying to get a better typed product for one of my papers and so I call her and I talk to her and she says I really don't type and I said well then just come on by.  And so we start talking and she comes by and she spends about or maybe a half hour or hour at the house and we're talking.  But now I'm more than intrigued.  Now I have already said that I'm going to be the eternal bachelor but she intrigues me.  Well I'm going through the course and I'm still--I'm breezing through the course still, although I noticed that I had dropped to right at that midway point of the course.  I'm not about fifty some and all the hard stuff is quote unquote been done but now the other stuff I'm a little bit distracted, but it's a good distraction.  My friend--my roommate tells me he said oh you're not talking to anybody, you're not trying to entertain anybody else and I say that's not true.  Well the reality is during that course I now actually have my eye set on one girl and that's her.  I actually know before June that that's who I will marry. And that probably becomes the biggest thing out of that course besides the two things that taught me; which was company commanders aren't relieved for tactics because tactics are really informed opinions reinforced by knowledge of weapon systems, men, formations and enemies.  And so I kind of have that. But I also walked away from there with this girl in my mind.
Story_ID: 35122
Speaker 1: And by the way I've got two other decisions to add to my kit bag of being an officer; is whether I want to be an aviator or an airborne ranger.  I really can't do both but I said I'm going to be an aviator.  As I complete the forms, I complete the test, I passed the test and they are getting ready to give me orders for Fort Rucker [Alabama].  One of the gentlemen who had done the waiver for me to go to airborne school, looks and notices that waiver or the data for my hemoglobin electrophoresis [unclear] is missing or the test didn't capture and so he runs a re-test and my numbers don't meet the standard for [U.S.] Army aviation.  So he said looks like ranger school it is.  Now up to this point I was--up till ninety-two [unclear] I was actually disqualified even from ranger school because it had a requirement because you're being a paratrooper and the stress would disqualify me.  But I'm now able to go.
Story_ID: 35123
Speaker 1: So I go to ranger school and I'm--in preparation for ranger school, I compressed because I had broken my leg playing basketball getting ready for the post championship with my course and so trying to recover in a compressed time for ranger school.  And so in the process of doing that I'm now chronically dehydrated, I mean my urine is gold.  And so on the second rung in ranger school I find myself waking up in the hospital and the ranger instructor he says, Ranger Bray, he says you know you can't miss more than forty-eight hours of ranger school and complete it.  He says you're chronically dehydrated.  He says you now got to continue to feed yourself and I'm (unclear) for the summer.  He said you got to make sure that doesn't happen to you again.  So I actually over hydrate the whole time remaining in school so that I don't have to deal with that.  But toward the end of ranger school with less than seventy two hours to go I had been nursing cellulites in my left leg and I wasn't telling anybody because I did not want to miss another hour of ranger school because it--while it is very challenging, it's really more about tenacity, willingness to not quit.  And so I was bandaging myself and taping myself up because my cellulites was really bad.  My leg had--the old wound in my leg--actually I'm sorry--my old wound in my leg from high school was affecting me and my leg would swell up, it still does.  It would swell up and walking in all that nasty stuff that was in Fort Benning, Georgia and in the swamps of Florida was infecting my leg.  And I was trying to keep it quiet but one of my ranger buddies saw my leg and saw how red it was and to his credit he let the range instructors know my leg was screwed up.  And I was saying man just keep it quiet and he said Bray you could lose your leg if you aren't careful.  And so all eyes looking at my leg and first he said let me see your leg Bray.  So I pulled up so you can't see about the bottom nine inches and he said it's alright you just you got ugly feet.  He said tell him to pull his pant leg up. So I pulled my pant leg up and it exposes my leg.  My leg is basically the width of a bloused pair of pants and I had been choking it off by using a boot to keep it cinched up but it was basically shaped like my pants.
Speaker 2: Now is this basically because the artery never healed?
Speaker 1: It never really healed like it was supposed to.
Speaker 2: So it was internally bleeding?
Speaker 1: It had some--not so much internal--or closed like it was supposed to.  And so I had some seepage according to them, I has some infections that were going on inside and so all those kinds of things had affected my leg a little bit and it made that leg in some cases more susceptible.  And candidly, I didn't understand all of the explanations he gave and even to this day I still don't care.  I just move on and I didn't want to deal with.  But anyhow he said Bray you got two choices; you can either recycle right now or you can go to the hospital.  And I said we will go to the hospital and so I went to the hospital and he became part of a great story.
Story_ID: 35124
Speaker 1: So you know in ranger school you don't get a chance to eat chocolates and things like that that's not part of your packets but everybody loves to get stuff stuck into them if they can.  And so I went to the hospital, they grabbed my leg, they drained it a little bit, let some of the inflammation go down and then they--the doctor tells me he says if you can keep it dry and he said you can go and continue to train [ranger training] and everything else.  Basically what that meant was every time we stopped I was taking dressing off and wrapping it back up and I never really kept it dry but I at least nursed--but while I was in the hospital I convinced the nurse to give her five dollars and said get me everything you can out of the machine.  And so she didn't want to do it but she snuck it back in to me and I pushed down five bucks worth of vending machine candy in that time period.  Of course, when I rejoined my patrol I was stoked, I was full of a candy high that wouldn't quit.  I was energetic and the ranger instructor said man Bray you are on fire.  He was all happy about me and everything else, life was going good but as you might suspect that sugar high doesn't last long and when the lights went down I was no longer in a leadership position and all the reasons that keep you motivated and keep you going hit.  And more importantly my body was now wanting to get rid of some of that candy.  And we were in the swamps and we were walking through the swamps (laugh) and trying these little (unclear) discipline that I passed up one time I said man I got to dump, Bray's got to dump, Bray's got to dump, Bray's got to dump.  Screw Bray, screw Bray-and other words I'm not going to use--screw Bray and so I'm laughing and we keep walking for a little while and after awhile I realized it's going to happen.  So I find a piece of high ground and I go and make a dump in the swamp and it caused a break in contact or a break in the formation.  The ranger up there is angry and he is hollering in the swamps.  The ranger buddy I told to just keep walking did the right thing and didn't abandon me in the swamps and it's pitch black in the swamps.  He is trying to stay with me but he gets lost in the process and starts trying to holler for me.  So now the ranger instructor is mad at me, my ranger buddy is lost, I've got to pull (unclear) him up and the ranger instructor now is mad and he says you've got to link us back up Bray.  And so I start walking and we cross a phase line and he stops us right there and he calls the other part of the patrol because we had been walking back and forth all night long.  And that's what really caused us not to get to the point on time.  And so they ended up walking up behind us to join us and in the morning when we get our debrief the instructor looks at me and he was furious.  And so now I'm thinking I'm going to be relieved, I'm going to be taken out of camp.  I'm not going to be a qualified federal  ranger but instead he was so impressed with performances to date, what he does is he takes my honor graduate goal from me and I'm pretending to be really, really upset about losing the graduate goal but I'm just glad to be in ranger school so inside I'm celebrating.  Because I now know that I'm going to be a ranger and that's a big deal.  It was a big deal not just because you get a chance to--I got a chance to be with recognized--the few people who can call themselves ranger, less than 5 percent of those who are in our ranks get a chance to be ranger qualified and less than 50 percent of those who have started the process get to wear that tam (unclear) and that was a big deal for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35125
Speaker 1: Now is this 1980--?
Speaker 2: '82 [1982]
Speaker 1: Now this is the same year that Roscoe Robinson, Jr. becomes a four star first admiral?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Of course, you know you hear about that and you start to talk about how good that feels but Julius Becton [also a HistoryMaker], a guy that candidly I had heard more about.  Because Julius Becton was--had been the [U.S.] Army's trainer and he was both, felt and admired because one, he had embraced who he was--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: In what sense?
Speaker 2: He had embraced the fact that he recognized that one, he was an officer leading men in our nation's Army and he also recognized that there are differences in who we are and how we train and you could hear some of that in some of the things that he would talk about or people would see him.  Plus I had--in 1982 Julius Becton was at Fort Hood, Texas so I had--in 1978 I had seen him in passing because he was one of the men who were part of my cognition of African American officers.  I didn't know much more about him, I got to be very careful that I don't confuse what I know of him now with what I felt then.  But Roscoe Robinson was considered a pretty clean general, just a steady general among the folks that knew of him.  So as you might suspect, absolutely proud because now you got a legitimate four star on active duty in our military now--but he is over in Europe, you know, he gets to do Europe.  Later on that would bother me even more but at the time you got a four star, you've got another four star and that becomes pretty impressive.
Story_ID: 35126
Speaker 1: Well I'm also getting told that I'm going to go to the 101st [Airborne Division] and to kind of show you how little of my [U.S.] Army I really knew at the time I always thought that the screaming eagle was the 82nd [Airborne Division].  Because I heard about the 82nd but I always saw the screaming eagle patch and I had blended the two.  And I usually didn't recognized patches except the big red one, 1st Calv [Calvary], screaming eagle and that other double A which I wasn't sure what it meant.  Both those are the patches and so when I was told I was going to the screaming eagles I was excited.  I was excited but I thought it was the 82nd.  I wouldn't tell too many people that, as a matter of fact, but I was excited and more importantly the reason I was going there was because of a guy named David Melvesty (ph. splg.) who he had told the division commander and the brigade commander that if you can get this guy Arnold Bray he is a superb officer.  I served with him in Korea and he could command a company right now so when I actually arrived at the 101st from Fort Campbell, Kentucky I was slotted immediately for company command which doesn't happen.  The day I arrived I was supposed to start air assault school the next morning.  This is where there is a significant link between the different commissioning sources.  I didn't have a great sense of what I should do between assignments because I always treated them just like a mission.  I would go from one assignment to the next and I wasn't even taking leave between assignments.  I would actually go from assignment to assignment. And so when I go from ranger school, I went right to the 101st without any leave.  I signed in and didn't have all of my equipment for air assault school the next morning and the person who was tasked to put together my T50 [unclear] and left off what is called a neck strap which goes around the head.  And so I got thrown out the first day of air assault school because I didn't have that neck band (unclear) when you first sign up, didn't have the strap.  My commander who didn't know me yet was really angry, he was absolutely angry.  He says how does that happen (unclear) captain?  So I was embarrassed, so I was pushed back to begin the next Tuesday which gave me four days now to find a house because I did not have a house, I didn't know where I was living.  I moved into Dave Melvesty's basement and I hadn't [unclear] processed.
Story_ID: 35127
Speaker 1: But by that time the next week I now had got myself together in the four days and I started air assault school and I was a distinguished undergraduate from air assault school.  The only school I had been a distinguished undergraduate.  In major school I was in the hunt and I became the commander of troops for ranger school which was a ceremony at the very end but I was the receiver at undergraduate air assault school.  The battalion commander immediately reshifted his opinion and then put me in five days in charge of Alpha Company of the 1st Battalion, 501st.  That was an incredible--incredibly fast year in that command for a lot of reasons.  Because one, I didn't fully understand what lead was so I was learning on the fly how to be an administrative commander.  I was learning how to take care of people in administration but my--I had a great first sergeant, First Sergeant Powell, who helped get me through various things, but war fighting, I could war fight and my battalion commander recognized that very early.  And so while in company command of Alpha Company we were always first brought on as first to attack and we were always the choice for the tough missions in training.  And one of the great things we did while in training in training simulation and probably one of the few times I think I violated what I called "walking the street" was we were inserted behind the 2nd Brigade, (unclear) the 1st Brigade was of the 101st on a deep air assault.  The weather went to crap and the battalion commander and the battalion S3 had put themselves on a very, very late flight and it never got in.  So we had three companies on the ground, no battalion commander, no executive officer for the battalion and no operations officer--and the senior company commander was not necessarily well thought of by the battalion commander.  And the company commanders--and I was the most junior company commander came to me and said what are we going to do and I said we are going to get out of this.  And they said where are we going to go and I said I'll go here on the map.  I said we are going to walk right through the brigade. He said what do you mean?  I said guys we're going to go (unclear) we're going to go almost admin to get through this final [unclear] and I said just keep moving don't stop moving.  They said okay.  So we packed up and started moving through and the first stop we were challenged, halt who goes there?  With true street smarts I turned to the guy and said the man it's me and the guy said oh (laugh).  And, you'll love this, three hundred people behind me moved through this battalion formation and passed this guard and we occupied a space on the southwest edge of Fort Campbell, Kentucky while waiting for the battalion commander and the operations officer to show up because--and we had put ourselves in an area--told other folks [unclear] we had tied ourselves to trees and stayed on the dark side of the shadows of the trees.  So if there had been a recognizance they wouldn't pick us up.  The battalion commander and the operations officer did not arrive for almost twenty hours and in that time the helicopters finally found us.  So we find ourselves then into a tactical fight trying to do a break out from the encirclement.  At the end of the day we were actually killed at that location because we couldn't really go to the west which is where we would have gone.  But on simulation that was the ocean, that was the beach and so we couldn't go there.
Story_ID: 35128
Speaker 1: The command of the Alpha Company was significant in the sense that one, I managed them well and my commander at that time Colonel Severson (ph. splg.) had great tactical confidence in me.  But he also was concerned that my unit was in some cases challenging.  Because he really was a pretty domineering battalion commander but he really was hard which was very good because my unit prided itself on being hard.  I think at the very end we were--I say very end before I was transitioned to headquarters company command he--I might have encouraged a quicker move than he had originally planned.  But we ended up doing an extreme evaluation of the unit and in the process my unit had an altercation with another company commander who was considered one of the other strong commanders in the division.  In this case, one of my members butt stroked one of the other companies because a guy tried to take his weapon.  And this is where my philosophy of "walking the street" was reaching the soldiers in probably a stronger way than I want.  I emphasized that no one takes one of our--us captives unless I direct or the game directs that we are going provide prisoners of war.  Because if you succumb to giving in to quitting, I think it creates a mindset to give in and I told my guys that because the Alpha Gators--we want to be tougher.  In one of the simulations of training one of the guys who was essentially defeated told my guys I'm taking your weapon and in the process one of my sergeants actually brought weapons across while trying to keep them from grabbing it.  In the process he knocked the guy out.  Well when the story came back I was looking at the controller and the controller explained what happened and the controller said I told him not to touch the guy's weapon but he did anyway.  Well the other company commander beat me to the site, when he got to the site the other company commander said, well you need to apologize because your guy butt stroked my guy and I said what happened--the controller told me what happened.  I said man, look that shouldn't happen.  You guys had no right to touch it.  And I told the sergeant look you know, I will apologize to the guy but I will not make him apologize for him not giving his weapon up.  Well this was one of the favorite sons in the division who predated me and I was still believing I was right.  I was asked to write a letter of apology and I refused to write a letter of apology because I told my commander, I said my soldier did what I told him to do.  And so this hung over for a little while but I think the command wanted to try to find a good out.  And the good out was Dave Melvesty, the guy that brought me on was now leaving command of headquarters company and they wanted one of the stronger commanders to take over headquarters company.  And so just shy of my twelfth month of command I get an immediate transfer to headquarters and headquarters company of the brigade.  I think it quieted the noise that those who were concerned about the aggressiveness of Alpha Company down a little bit.  But at the same time, it allowed a different mindset-a war fighting mindset to go into the headquarters company which made the brigade commander happy.  And it definitely made the replacement for the brigade commander who changed out Colonel Hurling (ph. splg.) very happy.  Colonel Hurling and I became really good friends because he liked my war fighting attitude, he liked the fact I brought that the staff as well as the company commanders inside the organization.
Story_ID: 35129
Speaker 1: And after twenty-four months of company commander of headquarters company, Colonel Hurling moved me down to be the operations officer of 2nd Battalion of the 502nd [Infantry Regiment].  That's a position that's normally reserved for a major and at the time I was still a captain.  Here's where I also became friends with--a lifelong friend now and a partner Eugene Davis.  Eugene Davis was the battalion commander of the 2nd, 502nd and he had a very good battalion but battalion was not given the respect it deserved.  From the time I joined the battalion either by God's design or something an awful lot of things occurred.  The first thing we did was the battalion deployed the Camp Grayling, Michigan and began to train up some of the national guardsman and evaluations that they were given were considered part of the most fair assessments by everybody around and the approach.  We then started to redesign how we looked at recognizance and the value of recognizance in the organization.  The design we used for how to push out recognizance actually became the model that to date that we are using right now and today's modular force of pushing out eyes, ears to understand the problem before engagement.  And while it's really not new, it was less employed after we started doing work in Vietnam.  Because it was reaching back and utilizing tools that we had used before but we employed them as part of operations.  The second that occurred was the battalion had great systems and we had learned how to do multi echelon training whereby noncommissioned officers would be allocated time on a schedule to train soldiers and train leaders while other officer training was going on at the same time.  That was generally not what was happening across the [U.S.] Army and definitely not happening across 101st [Division].  And we are getting recognized for that kind of innovative training under Colonel Davis' leadership.
Story_ID: 35130
Speaker 1: The most significant event of the year--well before that one--in November, end of October, November of 1985 the battalion [2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment] was called on to do a mission.  The mission was unknown and the battalion was tapped to deploy to Somalia on a no notice.  And we deployed to the Horn of Africa with myself and Colonel [Eugene] Davis deploying in less than two hours to get a Pentagon briefing.  And we continued on to the mission with no preparation, no knowledge and occupation and setting up for a combined operation in training with the Somali forces in Berbera, Somalia which is up in the north side of the horn roughly twenty-five kilometers from where they were fighting with the Ethiopians.  The significance of this was that this was the time period when we had literally just switched from being allies to the Ethiopians and to being allies of the Somalis.  The most important part of this experience was the training of my mind.  I joined Special Forces soldiers who had been operating in the area for a little while but who had not been interfacing on any kind of a constant basis at this time with the rank and file of the Somali forces.  And the Somali forces like most third world nations were not given credit for their ability to think.  I use a phrase that's called just because I speak with an accent doesn't mean I think with an accent and I stole that from 'Scarface'.  And what the lesson learned was as we are setting up training the Somalis had explained that if we used the gun target line where our ships were firing live ammunition at a point in the ground the round could skip because it's essentially shooting straight on the ground and could hit so make sure we put no absorbers looking straight on to the round impact areas.  The (unclear) or aero-naval gun liaison team that was attached to us dismissed this discussion and put themselves almost directly on the gun target line.  By the third round that was fired a round actually skipped directly overhead and had it been lower or had the absorbers actually put themselves on the hill mast they would have been killed.  It reinforced something that had happened earlier, I've been training with the Republic of Korea mortar teams where we would fire simultaneously using the math to calculate where rounds had impact and their calculations, their process minus the language was exactly the same as mine.  But if you have never done something with somebody before you think of them thinking differently.  So this reinforced that although the Republic of Korea is significantly different than the Somalis where they didn't even have paper, more than a couple sheets of paper on their desk but their thinking was still solid, their logic was essentially still solid.  Even though the area we were working that was a General Ghandi (ph. splg.) who actually would eat or taste the blood of the people he would fight and kill.  It exposed me to some other notions that I had, it exposed me to what other nations might do and think as well as I was able to watch the Russian weapon systems that the Somalis had still sitting inside of their base or their base camps because they wanted to have them ready for their parades even though they are at war.  Or the fact that they wouldn't use our artillery because if they used our artillery the other artillery might fire back at their artillery so they were afraid of counter battery fire.  So that part of the logic, that part of the discussion to secure this argument helped train me for later discussions--later analysis that I would use in other operations and definitely I would refer to when I would have conversations before I would assume something I would ask the question but that was significant.
Story_ID: 35131
Speaker 1: The second and this was the most significant thing that occurred while I was in the second battalion it was probably the second.  One morning I was coming in from physical training and I had passed the gym and I noticed that the 3rd Battalion of the 502nd [Infantry Regiment] soldiers were still not in yet and their folks were waiting around the gym for them to arrive.  And as I was changing clothes from physical training I remembered that the report on the news said there was a crash in Gander [Newfoundland, Canada] and some Americans might have been believed to be aboard the airplane.  As I walked to my office, Sergeant Parsons the (unclear) looked at me and his eyes were wide open and he said sir do you know what's happened?  And in an instant I had a collision of what I had been witness to and I said yes I do, I said how many?  And they said they believe it was 248 soldiers of our sister battalion had been killed at Gander.  My first thoughts were that this is not going to involve us other than some support to help but Colonel Hurling and I had developed a relationship when he was--as a brigade commander at HHC [headquarters company] and he called down to Colonel [Eugene] Davis and said I want to send Arnold to Dover, Delaware to represent the battalion and I told him, I said sir they've got a company commander that's already back.  Colonel Davis said sir Bray is right, they've got somebody else that can go up there and do that when it's time and he said okay, no problem.  At 1500 [3 p.m.] in the afternoon he called down again and says we don't have a liaison at Dover to represent the brigade and he said Gene I would like Arnold to go do that.  A couple of friends were on board that was Chris Mannion--Ed Mannion and Powers were two of my buds from the battalion and my former driver who asked to the (unclear) national force mission were involved in that.  The boss said Arnold you are going to go and I asked when do I leave?  He said in forty-five minutes and so in forty-five minutes I went to the house and grabbed my uniform, grabbed my bags and we flew to--jumped on a plane and I flew to Dover, Delaware and when I landed I was met by a Colonel on the runway.  I was still a captain and he explained to me he said are you Bray I said yes sir I am.  He took me to the VIP quarters which was Colonel's quarters, 06 quarters, (unclear) and told me this is where you are staying.  I had a tactical satellite operator with me and we begin to start talking to the team that was up in Gander who was starting to collect on the number of bodies, the condition of the bodies and I was talking to Dover about transfer cases, getting the transfer cases up to Gander to put them inside.  I was being told that the bodies were basically in various states of wholeness, various states of frozen and/or burned and the numbers were starting to mount.  Where they thought they had the pieces of about a 140-some and they started trying to figure out what they had.  I was taken around the mortuary to show the process so that I could have that and I was starting to talk to their Army and right about that time I got up and talked to the division.  I got a call from the Army and the Army said I need to speak to Captain Bray.  And the United States Army said are you Captain Bray and I said yes sir, then he said well you're the Army's representative and I said no sir I represent the 101st [Division].  He said well one moment so they called General Patrick and General Patrick told me I only represent the Army.  So I was at Dover, Delaware and at that time a guy named Max Dillon--General Max Dillon got on the phone and he gave me instructions and he said I want everything you do to be done with dignity and respect and I want to make sure that every soldier--the remains of every soldier on every airplane that comes in has an officer and a NCO [noncommissioned officer] on board so that one--since we don't know if the remains are here is represented by his peer.

Speaker 1: So I called back to the boss and I told him what I needed in short order and they sent a company out eventually, he said I'll be there in a couple of days.  So for seventy-two hours I operated without sleep, my hands were jumping, the left hand was so fatigued.  Finally the Army came on and brought a complete team with four lieutenant colonels and they said who is the captain we are replacing and I said I guess that would be me.  And they came on and then my boss came onboard and we started receiving the transfer cases and we started to put people onboard the aircraft.  We ran out of officers and NCOs for the last two shipments and I told the boss that I've got two shipments left; I want to be on one of those, I would like to be on the last one.  I took the aide-de-camp from the general who was there for the second to the last.  Ironically Billy Don Ferris would later on become my executive officer and he did the second to the last one and I did the last one.  We flew up to Gander, put the remains on the ship--on the aircraft and we fly in solemnity back with those men in those transfer cases with draped coffins as you go back.  The big lesson that I pulled out of this one was actually besides the words of General Thurman was what one of my NCOs asked me and it took me twenty years--not quite twenty years yet to really understand it.  He said sir we getting a medal for this and when he said it I was actually angry.  I said why would you expect to get something for taking care of your brother and his remains?  Well what I learned over the next twenty years was something happened that I couldn't understand which was there is a tremendous amount of pride to be selected to put your brother to rest.  And that soldier just didn't know how to express it but he knows when I do something great, when I do something good, I should get something and that's what he was feeling.  And while I still don't advocate anything for it, I have matured to the point well I could understand what he was asking for.  Because he had done something so special to be able to be part of a person's home going, a soldier's home going that was doing something for his nation.  But better that coupled with a couple of other events helped (unclear) frame a lot of what-more of what I would do--I mean, it became very clear to me that things were happening to me as a human being, to me as an officer and more importantly as a soldier.
Story_ID: 35133
Speaker 1: The next event we had went with two events that went in a row one we get a extreme evaluation with the least amount of training time in the history of the division and we did remarkably well.  But behind that we had to report to the Caribbean where we are going to have to replicate another way to have conducted the operations in the Caribbean for Grenada and more importantly if something else (unclear) at the same time.  So in concert with the [U.S.] Marine operation we did amphibious (unclear) operation on the island of Vieques where we did a deep attack on Vieques while the Marine brigade landing team exited the beach.  And we trapped forces on an island and it was a great training event both for the joint cross training that goes with it and it was right about the same time that the Goldwater-Nichols [Act] was trying to take effect.  So we had demonstrated that an ability and a willingness to work together as a joint force, more importantly gave me kind of another data point to look at the readiness and the way some of our other forces trained when we fight to them where the gaps are, in the goodness of how they fight and how we fight together.  I took some tactical training points that I would use as a battalion officer especially with the manipulation of aircraft, air and ground operations without the use of some of our air force friends, just a tremendous year.  At the close of that year, I was asked what would I do next and then by this point in time I've now got more company command time than anybody in the hundred and first.  I've got more battalion operations officer training than any other officer in the division.  I'm tied with two other great Americans, Carlos and Mike Baberro (ph. splg.).  Mike Baberro who retired a three-star, Carlos would get hurt and he would retire as a colonel.  But they were just tremendous--they were the folks who people--we're now kind of in this group of three if you will of (unclear) of 101st [Division].
Story_ID: 35134
Speaker 1: And General Hurling says would I consider being an aide[-de-camp] and I told him no sir.  I has been offered--back in Fort Jackson [South Carolina] I been asked and I was not entertaining the idea.
Speaker 2: This is eighty--?
Speaker 1: This is now '86 [1986], this is now summer of '86 [1986].  And he said the corps commander, General [James J.] Lindsay (ph. splg.), is looking for an aide, he said Arnold I think you would be great for it--now he's a paratrooper.  And no one had ever left to become the corps commander's aide from another base.  They always came from Fort Bragg, North Carolina that was where the corp. (unclear) was.  And there hadn't been a selected aide there had interims but none of color at (unclear).  And so he said I want to put your name in if you let me and I said sure if you think that's good and he said I think it's good.  And so Hurling then put my name in to be the aide (unclear).  The process to get me to from the brigade to the corps was unique in itself.  It was unique because I didn't have to talk to the chief of staff, the secretary general staff or even the division commander for an interview even though they were all scheduled.  The secretary general's staff he said I don't need to talk to you he says do you remember me and I said not really sir.  He said in 1984 he said I was lost in the desert at the NTC [National Training Center] he said and you found me, took control of me, took me where I needed to go never said another word and just said sir you are good to go and just walked off.  He said I know your character, he said your character spoke volumes.  And similarly I had evaluated Colonel Moore and worked with the division commander and he said you would represent the division fine and I don't need to interview you and I'm very comfortable with your selection.
Story_ID: 35135
Speaker 1: Okay so it's 1986.
Speaker 2: It's 1986.  I go to--General [James J.] Lindsay [ph.] gets the list of names by now I've done all the schooling I can do plus the combine arms and services staff school which I had done in route to becoming the battalion three which was the school that trains you to be a staff officer.  And when I went to interview with General Lindsay the previous interviews had been oh probably five or ten minutes.  General Lindsay and I went in and I was there for almost an hour.  But I still was a little bit unsure of what that meant but he had told me to stop by and talk to the aid before I left and see what an aid really does.  I was going to fly out that evening and I flew out that night got back in about one o'clock in the morning and so I delayed going into my office and I showed up at about seven thirty that morning.  And while I was at the desk I was talking to one of the other officers and one of my assistants--my drivers was standing in the doorway and I said what do you need?  He said sir you got a call from a guy named Jim Lindsay twice this morning, he is standing on hold.  General Lindsay never says Lieutenant Jim Lindsay he simply says Jim Lindsay and so I said oh my God.  So I said let me get him on the line so I called him and he says in a way he always does he says I trust you can fix that and I said sure I can fix that.  Then he said I thought it about last night I want you to be my aid.  He said this is now the end of June when can you be here?  Sir I said, when do you want me to be there.  He said well I'd like to have you here for the fourth of July.  He said I will probably apply a little bit of training so you can jump out of air planes again.  He said and--what I need to do to make it happen.  He said use my name if you need to, he said I trust you will tell the division commander, brigade commander my selection and I said yes sir.  He said I will have my guys follow up and I said okay.  So in five days I moved my wife [Alane] who I had just found out was pregnant with my first child and we packed up bag and baggage.  I made two trips driving from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Fort Bragg, North Carolina dropping off two cars and flying back for the second one.  Picking her up, dropping her off in Georgia and into a house conducted pre airborne training and was with him on the fourth of July the first of many parades and celebrations and I jump into Sicily drop zone after not having jumped in now almost eight years.  I remember being a little bit nervous about jumping again not because of the jumping but because of the harness that I practiced on or trained on compressed my spine because it was small it was a single point release.  And so it pressed you like this and I would be in tears of pain while I was doing that and carry a load.  And he explained to me the chain and I just felt so relieved when it happened.

Speaker 1: But working with [General James J.] Lindsay was incredible because he is such a great war fighter.  He had been serving in the military since 1953 and he was the eighteenth airborne corp. commander for over three years at that point in time.  He knew everything about the corp. and the time the corp. was so large.  It was really and truly the nation's only contingency corp.  It had forces down in Columbus, Georgia, Fort Benning, Georgia which was a summer brigade, the one ninety seventh, the one ninety fourth out of Fort Knox, Kentucky.  It had the twenty fourth infantry division at the time out of Fort Steward, Georgia, it had the seventh infantry out of Fort Ord, California, it had the tenth mountain which is brand new and was starting to stand up and change its character out of Fort Drum, New York and of course, had the hundred first airborne division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky and the eighty second airborne division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  This collection of tools and talents available for contingency was unheard of.  And the ability to use this force was also being morphed by General Lindsay because he was working with General Cunningham out of twelfth air force and General Gray out of the second infantry division out of Camp Lejeune [North Carolina] and this talent pool he was starting to rewrite joint doctrine before Goldwater-Nichols [Act] was enacted yet.  It was happening starting but he had changed it, he had also had one of his mentees, General Steiner who was working with the joint special operations command.  So now I'm drinking through an incredible straw as a young captain and a major--senior major lieutenant colonel's position as the contingency corp. aide-de-camp.  But he believed I could do it, he put it all in my plate and allowed me to try and run with it.  I was tested almost immediately because we went out to the national training center where we worked with General Crist (ph. splg.) and the central command in preparation for a major exercise that replicated a real war mission which I still can't discuss.  But it encompassed an entire western part of the United States.  And one night one of the protocol officers decided to take one of the General's aircraft and use it for another mission.  And those aircraft belong to him and were a test by myself or the G3 for use.  And General [James J.] Lindsay had an incredible appetite for operational tempo for training and anything else.  And our nights usually involved about three or four hours no more than five hours of sleep when we're in the field for training.  On one of the missions we were supposed to fly to operation for the airborne drop at the eighty second, fly before five o'clock in the morning over to observe one of the units training at the national training center fly back to the operational headquarters to get an overview and briefing and then fly down to Riverside, California to conduct operations and training of the central command.  I am now less than a month into the job as an aide-de-camp and I'm orchestrating this kind of support for the commander.  (unclear) results so that I can move-I can do these things but it's a little different when you do just one person, in fact, the joke is this it is more difficult to challenge to manage General Lindsay than it was to manage an entire eight hundred men battalion task force because his reaction and then his precision.  So in this process the protocol officer had disrupted the plan because he didn't know what we were doing with the aircraft and had given the tasking.
Story_ID: 35137
Speaker 1: And we arrived in the desert with two fatigued pilots and General [James J.] Lindsay immediately said why I am seeing Mike (unclear) and I said sir we will figure that out.  And we were dropped off in the middle of the desert and he's watching the airborne drop and I'm on the horn trying to figure out where I can find the ball different aircraft not his own which I knew (unclear) could make him very happy.  But to get him to the site for all the events to occur.  And so it was--I borrowed some from the five sixty first who had some UH1H helicopters that were flying logistics missions and I was able to put the commander and some others on those planes.  But I was parked in the middle of the desert with nothing but a radio and I kept a small chopper so that I could use the radio to communicate with and they couldn't go much longer.  In the process I had the battalion-I mean the corp. three who was the operations officer telling me what I should do.  And General Lindsay's guidance to me was as I put him on the plane I expect to see you at five o'clock tomorrow morning at the national training center ready for us to move.  And he said well--when we got on the ground the corp. operations officer told me what to do immediately and then after he left he said were you going to just screw this up.  He was telling me what I was going to do and I said that's right I understand.  I was very polite but I probably came as close to saying something I shouldn't have said but I didn't.  Lots of training from some senior leadership from the hundred and first that told me he said one watch what I say and ultimately as divine powers would have it I put Mike Lokes to rest immediately when we landed.  That was the pilot--first pilot and I used the aircraft that could get me as close to the national training center as I could and in the five or six hours Mike Lokes resurrected, got the sleep he needed, got his plane, his chopper refurbished--not refurbished but refreshed and we went on and continued the mission.  Now I had to put him into the ground after we got to the next site later in the morning but all things worked out at the very end.  Now Lindsay did of course recognize and he did dig into what happened and of course, as you have to be very candid and open at the same time try not to offend anybody else who is doing the right thing as they saw it from being pressed and we did.  But he was not happy and he made some mandate later on about who runs the aircraft, who owns the aircraft and it was very clear that I was in charge of his transportation and in charge of his things.  And he played greatly later on because ultimately we had survived our first team building experience.  And General Lindsay and I stayed until he changed commands and he became the first four star of the United States Special Operations command.  And I had the great honor of handing his four stars to Admiral Grau (ph. splg.) to start off that part.
Story_ID: 35138
Speaker 1: And this is one of the other great times I had a chance to be part of somebody who is making history.  And I remember a conversation we had when he was getting ready to go he says I'm getting ready to go, I'm going to deal what do you want to do?  I said sir I've got a pregnant wife [Alane], I just moved her, it's only been four almost five months if I can stay I would like to stay.  And he said I will see if John [W.] Foss will take you and keep you on as aide-de-camp eighteenth corp. because he is going to be the new commander and that wasn't announced yet.  But I stayed on for another twelve months with General Foss as an aide-de-camp of the eighteenth airborne corp.  And we had some tremendous opportunities, challenges work with him as we start to grow the command in preparation for corp. what became called-known as corp. D.  Again being in the room with leadership that is thinking at a strategic level a global response as a young captain and then watching some of your ideas, some of your notions be both challenged and implemented was one of the greatest classrooms I've ever been in two different leaderships styles and great training.  Most importantly as I was getting ready to make major because I thought I got selected, I spent thirty-three months on the list as a major but in the process of being selected I was moved-I had to go to another job-I didn't have to I could have stayed there but no one should really and truly be an aide no more than about twelve or eighteen months.  And General Foss agreed with me and he asked where did I want to go.  He tried to encourage me to go to a mechanized unit but Ranger Melvin Woods stuck in my craw from Fort Jackson [South Carolina].  Sir you need to be in the 82nd Airborne Division and so Joe Steel asked that I come to the 82nd and become part of his brigade, the 1st Brigade and of course, like my boss reminded me when you are asked you don't get a chance to choose you go.  And so I went to the 1st Brigade, (unclear) 2nd Battalion 504th [Infantry Regiment] under Colonel Ed Kersey (ph. splg.).
