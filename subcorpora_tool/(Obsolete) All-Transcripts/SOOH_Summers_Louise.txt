 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday June 13, 2009 and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma at the Stillwater Public Library interviewing Helen Louise  Glass Hargrove Summers. This interview is being conducted as part of  Spotlighting Oklahoma: Life in the 1930s Oral History Project. Thank  you for joining us today.  Oh, you   re very welcome.  Let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you tell us where  you grew up and give us a little insight into your early life?  Well, I grew up in Stillwater. My folks moved here in 1926. I was born  in 1923 in Fairfax, Oklahoma which is Osage County. And they had  what they called the Osage Reign of Terror. At that time white people  were blowing up Indians    houses and so my dad immediately decided he  was going to move us to Stillwater. So we came to Stillwater and I  started to nursery school at the college and it was in the old Home Ec  building. I think they have just torn it down within the last few years, but  I went to what would be pre-kindergarten at that time. I guess we were  guinea pigs for the students and it was a wonderful time. I can remember  they took us over to the college auditorium and let us be in plays and I  loved being a star   always did. And then there was Eugene Field and it  was on 6th and   it wasn   t Duck. It was 6th and Washington where the  IGA store is now. That   s where I went through  elementary school    the  first year I skipped half of the second year and I skipped half of the  fourth grade. My grandmother lived with us and she had been a school  teacher, so I knew all my ABC   s and my numbers and everything by the  time I started to school. Back then you went by semesters A and B. So I  skipped the second grade and then I skipped half of the fourth grade, so I  was always like a year and a half or two years younger than the rest of  my friends, but we were all within walking distance. We all walked  5  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  about five or six blocks. I lived on Fourth Street, on the corner of Fourth  and Lincoln, which is right across  from  what is now the Kappa House.  My dad had built the Spanish house there and that   s where I grew up.  What did your parents do for a living?  My mother did absolutely nothing. She just sort of sat on a velvet  cushion. My dad owned a business on Main Street. He was the  merchant. I had an older brother 12 years older that was a track star and  he was a Sigma Nu and he had a convertible and dated a Chi Omega.  They thought they were the Gatsbys. So it was a fun time.  Well you were growing up during the Great Depression. At what point  did you realize that things were not as good as they used to be?  No. I   m not proud to say that, but none of my friends, their dads were  either attorneys, they had a lumber yard, they had, like I say, my dad  was in business, dads were in banks. And if there was a depression on  the part of our fathers, we never knew about it. We sort of lived in a  bubble in Stillwater. We thought everybody was just like us and it  wasn   t until we got up into high school did we realize that everybody  didn   t have it as good as we   d had it. A lot of the children that we grew  up with,  their  mothers were widows and they had moved to Stillwater  to live in boarding houses so their kids could go to college.  What were the types of things that you noticed in high school?  Well, we got to drive cars and they had high school fraternities and  sororities. They were like little cliques. But we just figured that anybody  that wanted to be in the clique could be in the clique until we got up later  in high school or even in college did they tell us that we were a snooty  little group and we were really oblivious to it. I mean that   s sad, but I  don   t know that my mother   we always had help. She always had  somebody to do the cooking and the cleaning and they lived easily down  in the other part of town and my mother or dad would pick them up and  bring them to the house and then they would take them home or send  them home in a cab. I can remember they would take food that was left  over from the meals; they would wrap it up and take the leftovers. And  the first time I was really aware of things was   I guess I was very  spoiled and they always took the newspapers and wrapped up the  leftovers to take home on our back porch, which was a closed in back  porch. I was looking for the funny papers one day and I couldn   t find it  and I went out and the lady that worked for us had wrapped her food up  in the newspaper. I fussed at her and my mother later went out on the  porch and saw that this lady was crying and she made me go out and  apologize and say that I was just stupid and young and didn't know any  6  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  better and to never, never talk to anybody that way again. So I learned a  lesson from that. But my brother was driving up   he qualified for the  Olympics, which he was a track star and my dad bought him an Auburn  convertible, which at that time would have been like a Lexus convertible  or something, it had spoke wire wheels and there was always pictures of  him in his knickers and his sweater that matched and he was standing,  posing in his cap. It was sort of a movie type thing, but the girls all   but  all my friends were blessed like that.  Really quite isolated, like you said, from     In a bubble, from reality. But Stillwater, I don   t think, knew about the  Depression so much. With the college, there were jobs, there were, like I  say, widows moved here and opened boarding houses and rooming  houses so that their kids could go to school. I remember going to the  grocery store and they just charged everything and at the end of the  month, when you went over to pay your little tickets, I always got to go  because they either gave you a choice of a package of chewing gum or a  candy bar and I was always torn about which one to get. But everybody  knew us. And everybody on Main Street knew each other. We always  traded with hometown merchants. And so it was really a close  community. The town people were sort of isolated from the college  people and a lot of the college people lived on what was College Circle  then, people who were professors and people like that. But the girls all  ran around together and like I say, there were two girls    sororities and  two boys    fraternities. We had our own dances and our own slumber  parties. Our folks were members at Yost, so Mom had cabins out there  and so we would go out there and spend weekends at the cabin and swim  and dance on the pavilion and it was a wonderful place to grow up.  Absolutely. Did you listen to the radio at all?  Yes, we did. We listened and I had a record player and some of the boys  that played in the band really liked records, so they would all come to  my house and we   d put the record player out on the front porch and then  they   d all come and we   d play the new records. They always said they  liked to come to our house because my mother would let them come and  sit in our living room and some of the girl   s mothers wouldn   t let them,  they made them go down in the basement and everything. But Mother  was sort of a childlike woman in that she just sort of put her head in the  sand and if it was something she didn   t like or didn   t approve of, she just  put her head in the sand and expected it to go away. And usually it did.  Would she sew at all?  Oh no. My grandmother lived with us. My grandfather had been in the  7  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Civil War and he died before I was born, so my grandmother received a  pension of  40 a month for being a widow in the Civil War. I had an  uncle that lived in Boston and I had an aunt that lived in Santa Monica,  California, so my grandmother would spend, say, four months with my  uncle and four months with us. She had been a school teacher and she  liked to cook and she was a marvelous cook. Everything Grandmother  did was good. She made afghans, she quilted quilts, she painted china. I  think Mother was intimidated by Grandmother because Grandmother,  sometimes you think,    I could do that, but as long as I don   t try it I  won   t know that I   m bad at it.    And I think Mother took that attitude.  She and Grandmother both taught classes at the Methodist church here.  Every time the doors were open we were there, whether it was Sunday  school or a prayer meeting or Daddy was on the board or a member of  Gideon   s. I sat through every sermon, and if I wiggled or anything,  Daddy always carried little pieces of paper and pencils and I   d draw  pictures and he   d draw pictures for me to keep me quiet. But I grew up  in that Methodist church that   s down there on Duck and 8th.  So church was very important?  Very important. And then my mother and grandmother were members of  the first WCTU, which was Women   s Christian Temperance Union.  They were against alcohol. When I got to be about six or seven, they  would have, you get up and give speeches and I had taken what they  called expression lessons. My mother wanted me to be able to get up and  talk and so they would have contests and you could get a gold medal or a  silver medal or a bronze medal. I never got any better than a bronze, but  I can remember many times wishing that I had that bronze medal to  show to my friends. But it was a fun time growing up in Stillwater.  What about holidays, what were those like?  Holidays were wonderful. The only thing I remember about Christmas  was we always had an abundance of everything, but my dad, having a  clothing store, would wait. Christmas Eve, when they would close up,  the things that hadn   t sold, he would have the ladies that worked the  store wrap them up and that   s what we got for Christmas. But Christmas  was just, we had everything. But we were always taught to give back.  There was a Stillwater Mission here and Mother always made me go  with her to take things to the Mission, whether it was fruit cakes,  whether it was clothing, whether it was sweaters. And they weren   t  things that were torn or anything. They were nice things. But she always  impressed on us how fortunate we were. So we always knew that we  were blessed.  I would go out on east Sixth Street, they would have things like nursing  8  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  homes, but they had a place called the    The Poor House    which I think  back today, isn   t that horrible? People lived out there. Most times you  took care of your own, you took care of your grandparents, they lived  with you or they lived with an aunt or uncle or something, but there were  people that didn   t. And I also was in the Girl Scouts and we would  always go out there and sing carols or we would wrap up things like fruit  cakes and jellies and things that would be considered, I guess, extras and  take out there and sing carols. I can remember we made chains of paper  where you   d take them and put them together and try to take little trees  and decorate and I can just remember the faces of those people to me  were just all gray. And I thought how sad it must be not to have family.  But to call something    The Poor House    is just so sad.  Well through the years you   ve been back to Stillwater quite a bit?  I have never been away from Stillwater really. My first husband was a  football player here. Played on the Sugar Bowl team and then he went  into the Service. So I was here and then when he came home, they had  the GI Bill, so he was the first in the class to go to medical school. So we  moved to Oklahoma City and bought our first house. I think we paid   8,500 for a two-bedroom house. He was going to medical school and  my dad, always there for us, knowing at that time we had one little boy  and between our freshmen and sophomore year, we had our second little  boy. My dad had a duplex and he gave us the duplex so we could have  the rent off both sides and then we got  120 from the GI Bill to put us  through four years. Every weekend, we would come home and go eat at  the Student Union, so every Sunday we came. And then after we got out  of medical school, my husband did his internship in Tulsa at Hillcrest.  We were there for a year and then we would come back to Stillwater  every Sunday.  Then when he went to practice, he practiced in Pawnee, Oklahoma. And  my idea of Pawnee was nothing but dirt blowing in Pawnee because  when you grew up in Stillwater, you had people coming from either  coast. You took them to Pawnee Bills. They had covered wagons and  they had teepees and they had Indians and that   s where, when you get  people coming from each coast, they wanted to go see the Indians, so we  would take them over there. My husband had been raised in Oklahoma  City and he wanted to raise our children in a small town, so we moved to  Pawnee, Oklahoma. And then again, we were very close to Stillwater  and so I would just take my kids over and dump them on my folks and it  was wonderful. I had live-in babysitters. So I came back and when my  husband, he died when he was 49. So I moved back, my youngest was     my daughter that   s with me today was 14 when her dad died. So we  moved back to Stillwater and she had just graduated from junior high, so  she went to high school and college here. So we were here while she did  9  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  that. And then her senior year she was a med-tech, we moved back to  Oklahoma City and I re-married 11 years after her dad had died. My  second husband passed away in April of this year, so now I   m back here  again. So I   ve never really been away from Stillwater.  Well from the time you were growing up until now, what are some things  that Stillwater does not have that we used to have? I mean back in the     20s and    30s, did we have an opera house?  Probably. I never went to the opera house. We had Rainbow Girls. And I  don   t know that they still have Rainbow Girls, but we went down on  Main and went up over some of the buildings and there were Rainbow  Girls and I forget what the name of the boys were. But anyway we went  and went through all of it because my dad was a big Mason and he had  gone to Guthrie to get his degree in Masonry. So we all had to go and  be   I was never really enthused about it because you had to sit and you  had to go through the steps and all that. Some of the girls liked it, but I  couldn   t sit still that long. But I can   t really think   Stillwater, basically,  is still a little town. And everybody knows somebody, so you have to be  careful about what you say or what you don   t say, because everybody is  related to somebody else in this town. And as my daughter will say,     Mother, shhh, you never know who is around     (Laughter) I guess  that   s what daughters do to mothers, try to shush us a bit.  Yeah. Well did your family talk about politics much? Did they have  strong feelings towards Roosevelt?  My mother was a strong republican and my dad was a strong democrat,  so all their lives they crossed out each other. I can remember Pearl  Harbor. I can remember sitting and listening to it on the radio in the  afternoon. I was in college by then and the next day Dr. Bennett, who  was president of the college, he lived up where the Bennett Chapel is,  that was his home and he had a great big gravel driveway and I ran  around with   I knew all of the Bennetts. They were very strong  Baptists, so we weren   t supposed to dance or play cards and we would  hear that car coming around in that gravel and when they got there, we  would be sitting and reading books. We would have the records turned  off and    (Laughter) But Dad, he was born in Missouri and he came  from very   as I say, they just crossed out each other   s vote. But Mother,  she was just a republican because Mama and Papa had been republicans.  But they were never really involved in politics or anything. They always  voted, but politics were never something discussed.  As I say, my mother from 1929 when they had the flu epidemic, she lost  most of her hearing and Dad, he had taken her to Mayo  Clinic  and  different places, but it had done something to the nerve. At that time,  10  you wore hearing aids and they were about the size of a deck of cards.  You had to wear them right here and you could turn them up or turn  them down with the volume and she hated wearing that, so my dad had  the chord that you wore, he had it strung with pearls so she could wear  it. But if he would get to talking about something (my dad was Irish) and  when he would get upset, the vein would stand up in his forehead and  his face would get really red and Mother would just reach up and turn  off the button and just sit there and smile and I used to think,    That   s the  meanest white woman I   ve ever seen in the world     because you can   t  argue if there   s no one to argue back with you. She would just sit there  and say,    Let me know when Peyton   s through.    (Laughter) which I  thought was really pretty classy, because you can   t argue by yourself.  She was a very childlike, na  ve woman, but the kindest and the sweetest  and the most loving mother you could ever have and she lived to be up  into her 90s.  But my grandmother lived to be 103. And I kept saying,    Grandmother,  why do you want to live so long?    and she said,    I   m just curious.    She  said,    I remember when Abraham Lincoln was killed and I remember  seeing electricity and I remember this and that and the other.    And she  said,    I   m just curious. I want to sit around and see what is going to  happen.    She would listen to baseball games on the radio. I don   t think  she ever saw a baseball game. She wasn   t really that interested in  television, but she liked listening to the radio. And she and my aunt, who  later became a widow and moved back here from California, they would  listen to soap operas and, of course, Mother was never   when we got  TV, she liked Lawrence Welk. And she always had a crush on Omar  Sharif. She just thought he was the prettiest thing she   d ever seen. But I  don   t think they went to movies. They took us to see The Ten  Commandments and some of those Cecil B. DeMille epic movies, back  in that time. And I remember they let us out of school to go see Gone  With the Wind at the Aggie Theatre. We got permission to get out of  school to go see it. It was so long that there was an intermission. But we  only had one picture show, one really top rate picture show and then  we   d have two small picture shows, one that showed cowboy things, and  then the other showed serials. The kids loved going to that. It was only a  dime and then when you got to be an adult, you had to pay a quarter. I  can remember going to the movies. That was fun to do.  But Yost Lake was the most fun. There was Crystal Plunge, which was  on Sixth Street, right when you   re going on East Sixth, you go across the  railroad track and ride and there was Crystal Plunge and it was a cement  pool. There were no   I don   t know of anybody that had a swimming  pool in Stillwater at the time. But Crystal Plunge, you could go down  there and you could take lessons, so it was fun to do. We had lots of  things to do. Plus we played. I mean we played baseball and we roller  11  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  skated. We lived on the corner, the Sig Ep house was here, the Chi  Omega house was here   it still is   and this was where I could skate on  my roller-skates and then when the street lights came on, I had to be  home. But we made our own entertainment.  What other things would you do for fun?  We played cards. We played lots of cards. We played paper dolls. I can  remember my dad sold piece goods also in his store and Butterick  patterns and he would save the old pattern books and my friends and I  would get them and cut out paper dolls and spend hours and hours and  hours. We played jacks, we skipped rope, we talked about boys. We  talked about boys a lot. And we sort of passed the boys around. I mean  there were a few couples that sort of liked each other all along, but when  you go to dances, they   d call and ask you to go to dances and different  ones would call and sometimes when I think back, I   m sure their  mothers said,    You need to ask her to go,    or    You need to ask her to  go.    And then we   d each call each other and say,    Have you been asked  yet?    You know,    No, have you?       No. Well call me if somebody calls  you.    But it was fun. I can think of very few of us that ever really   after  we got to college and the high school boys were really kind of nerdy.  (Laughter)  That happens.  Yes, it does, doesn   t it?  That happens. Do you remember when the Grapes of Wrath came out?  Not really. To me, going to California, which that was about, I had an  aunt that lived in Santa Monica and my mother would take me out on the  train and there would be a Pullman car and so we would have a double  thing and we would go out to Santa Monica. I remember one time we  went and they took the Pullman car we were in and pulled it off on a  sighting and left it there for two or three days. It was at the Grand  Canyon so we got to stay two or three days at the Grand Canyon and  then eventually one of the trains came by and picked us up and took us  on out there. And California, it was right after they had had the big earth  quake in San Francisco and I remember going and seeing Douglas  Fairbanks, Jr. and where all the movie stars lived and it was swimming  in the Pacific Ocean and going out in a glass bottom boat out to Avalon.  It was a wonderful time.  Did you travel much?  Yes, we did. Every summer we went to Manitou Springs, Colorado and  12  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  my dad would rent a cabin, house, whatever you call it, out there for a  month. He would take my mother and my grandmother and I out there.  And my brother would come sometimes and bring his friends. We went  to Pike   s Peak and we went to different places out there   the Garden of  the Gods. I can remember Mother hiked up Mt. Manitou, that was  halfway to Pike   s Peak, and she wore high heels and she kept saying,     I   m not wearing ugly shoes.    And we kept saying,    Okay     But we  would go down at night and watch the Indians dance and we knew all  the other people with children and they had homemade saltwater taffy  and so we would go out there in August every year. Then some years we  didn   t go to California, we went to visit my uncle in Boston and he was  the owner and founder of one of the first neon sign companies in Boston.  We would go and get to swim in the Atlantic Ocean which was cold, but  he would take us to see Houses of Seven Gables, where  Nathaniel   Hawthorne lived and places like that. So I got to really travel a lot as a  child because my mother always had an excuse that she had to go see  Jess or she had to go see Maude, so that   s what we did.  What was Stillwater High like? It   s not in the same building it was.  This  Stillwater Public Library  is Stillwater High. We walked from  junior high down to high school. There was a candy shop in-between  where you could stop in for a nickel and get candy and all that stuff that  was bad for you. High school was fun. I was 16 when I graduated from  high school, so I was always with people that were a little bit older. I  really didn   t realize it until I started to college. I could do the work, but I  wasn   t mentally mature enough. I did join a sorority and thought it was  the biggest bunch of stuff I   d ever seen and learned how to climb out the  window of the basement when we were supposed to be down doing  homework.  But high school was fun. We played football right down here. We  walked down to football. And we all dated the football players. Some of  us dated people in the band, but that was just because there weren   t any  football players. We went to all the basketball games and we went on all  the trips and I was a cheerleader and our mothers would take us to  Guthrie and places like that and we would go over there. It was a  wonderful time and we all knew each other and we would walk  downtown. My dad   s store was on the corner, right next to the bank on  Main Street and Eighth. So every day at noon,  we   d  walk down there  and go home for lunch and then come back. My friend   s dad had the  Hoke Lumber Company and we   d walk down there and ride with her  dad back. And finally when I got to be a junior, they didn   t have the  laws about driving I guess, but my mother would let me drive her car.  But I had to obey the rules and I did because I knew it was a privilege  and I   d get the car taken away from me. But I had one friend who was an  13  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  only child and her folks bought her a nice convertible.  When I was 18, I ran off to get married. I ran off with a boy I   d known  for six weeks and we ran off to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and went to get  a marriage license and they wouldn   t give me one because in Louisiana,  you had to be 21 or have your parents    permission. So I called my daddy  because I usually could talk my daddy into things easier than my mother.  And he said,    No, but if you   ll come home, I   ll buy you a nice  convertible.    And I pondered about five minutes and said,    No, I   m  going to get married. Put Mom on.    So Mother said,    Well, knowing  you you   re going to do it anyway so I might as well come down there.     So I got married at 18 to the love of my life and the father of my  children. We were married 25 years. So sometimes your first instincts  are good instincts.  But high school was   we   ve had high school reunions; we still have.  There   s only about six or eight of us left in the class of    40 and we still  see each other and talk to each other and get together as often as we can  and it   s just like it was. One of the boys, he   s 86, said to me not too long  ago,    I want you to know I   m really rich.    And I said,    That   s nice.     And he said,    No. I mean, really rich.    He said,    I   ve been wanting to  say this to you for years.    He said,    You were always so nice.    He lived  in a little house across over here and his dad had a profession, but I  guess he never really felt   one thing I remember, he always wore his  Boy Scout shorts to school and we always thought he was such a nerd, I  guess. That wasn   t a word then. But he went on to become quite  something. And I thought,    Isn   t that funny? That   s been in his head all  these years.    He said,    You girls all lived on the other side of town.     And I said,    We really didn   t think about that.    He played in the band.  We went to the same dances and everything, but it was in his head. And  when I went to his 86th birthday party, he told me,    I can now tell you, I  am really rich.    (Laughter)  So things are formed in your childhood that mold you and stay with you  regardless. And sometimes it   s  something  mean that someone has said  to you or sometimes you   ve been left out of something and it   s so sad  because it   s all done unintentionally. I don   t think there was a mean one  in the bunch of all the people I knew in school. And I know that one of  my best friends and the boy she married, one of their dads was principal  and the other was superintendent, but I don   t think any of us were mean  or meant to be. We were young and we were stupid, but I don   t think we  meant to be mean.  What were some of the hairstyles like in high school?  Oh, Pageboy. Pageboy. Pageboy. They rolled them on cans   orange  14  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  cans. Used cans. And you couldn   t sleep, you had to sit propped up, but  some of the girls had such good hair and then there   s us that have mouse  fur hair, trying to get it all   and the perms in those days, they had these  big machines and they had these coil things hanging down and they  literally fastened you up to them and fried your hair. You could smell it.  It was like chicken feathers. But you know, we tried and I never quite  made it and some of us had a knack and some of us didn   t and there was  always a few girls that we said,    She   s just got such good hair.    But it  was usually Pageboys or Pompadours. Pompadours were big, and then  bows behind them. And when you look back on them, you think,    Oh  dear God, what was I thinking?    But if the popular girls wore them, and  you go back and look in the high school annual and you see what we  were all striving for. Some of us didn   t ever quite make it.  What about clothing?  Well, I loved clothes from the beginning of time and my dad would take  me to market in Dallas when he would go to buy clothes and then my  mother liked clothes also, so we would always shop at places in  Oklahoma City. There was Kerr   s and Rothschild   s and different places  and so I think some of the girls    mothers were seamstresses because  there was a lot of times when you needed a party dress or something or a  prom dress or a special Easter dress that they had their dresses made and  everybody knew who they were. But I loved clothes and with my dad  being in the clothing business, we had our own alteration lady so Mother  never learned to sew and I was never taught to sew but everybody liked  clothes though. I think the girls were very aware, we couldn   t wear  skimpy clothes and we wore sweater sets, which they   re back to now.  Skirts and sweaters were our main thing to wear and then we wore  gloves and hats as we got older, to church and carried purses, always  wore stockings. You wouldn   t think of going bare legged. You wore  stockings. I don   t think they had panty hose then. I think we wore garter  belts, little garter belts that you had to fasten your hose to. As I  remember, they were a pain and my mother used to make me wear them  and I remember when I got far enough away from home, I   d take them  and roll them down to my ankles, but I had to wait to get out of Mother   s  sight to do that. (Laughter) I was sort of a rebel, to a point.  Did you ever have a need to take a taxi in town?  No, we never had very good taxis in Stillwater. We had a bus that came  down to the corner. We lived on Fourth and Lincoln   Fourth and  Monroe the bus came and for a nickel you could get on the bus and ride  downtown. But most of us had cars. Most of the girls had cars, far before  the boys had cars. The boys had to work. Most of them had outside jobs.  I really can   t remember what they did. They had paper routes. I don't  15  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  know what they did. A lot of them delivered groceries because in those  days, you could still get your groceries  delivered . Small world, my  second husband had two daughters and one of them was married to a  boy that delivered our groceries. He   s now an attorney with a great firm  in Oklahoma City. I can remember he would come in and put Mother   s  groceries in the refrigerator for her and she would always thank him and  give him what they called a track, which was a little religious paper and  it either had a Psalm on it or some kind of moral something. She would  always give him that when she thanked him. I   m sure he   d much rather  have had money, but he just got a handshake and a track. (Laughter)  As time progressed, did your parents ever talk much about the 1930s or  the 1940s?  No, not really. They were so wrapped up in the children. No, they didn   t.  My husband was overseas and I came back to Stillwater and lived but he  was stationed in Gainsborough Castle in England and so he had a good  job. And then my brother was stationed at the Pentagon. So they weren   t  really in risk of any of their family. So no, they   d say,    Oh those poor  boys,    and how sad it is and things like that, but never emotionally  connected with it. We have been very blessed. Very blessed.  How long did your father   s store remain in business?  Until the    60s.  And what was the name of it?  Peyton Glass and Son. And then my brother, later on, after my dad  retired, my brother opened a shop at the Student Union called Mr. G   s  and he stayed there until he was almost 90.  Wow.  He just died a few years ago. But he was a well known figure. He   d been  a track man. He was a well known figure on the campus and he had Mr.  G   s which was Mr. Glass   Peyton Glass was his name.  So you   ve seen a lot of changes on campus.  Yes. They have done a great job with keeping the campus looking like  the buildings. I haven   t missed anything. When I first started going to  basketball games, we went in the old gym, which I don   t think is even  there anymore. And we   d always sit right behind Mr. Iba   I don   t know  if you know who Mr. Iba was, but Mr. Iba and his wife and my sister-in-law  were best friends. So we would go about 5 o   clock and Mary  16  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Bennett, who was the youngest of Dr. Bennett   s girls, we would go and  get to sit right behind the team and that was fun. We saw people like  Bob Kurland and all these people and we were just part of it; Stillwater  and the campus and the athletics and everything all bonded together.  This is a great town. It has a lot of pluses that they don   t have down in  the Norman. I have friends that live at Norman and they always have  never felt quite the bond, but their Main Street   it   s just a different  feeling. I think because they   re so close to Moore and Oklahoma City,  and we   re isolated. We   ve always been because you had to drive so far  to the plane. And there was never very good bus service and still isn   t.  You either have your car   people now that have raised their kids that  went to school here and raised their kids and have been gone are now  wanting to come back to Stillwater because of the isolation because it   s  a great place to live. So I feel fortunate that I could come back here and  live. Hopefully this is where I   ll stay.  You   ve made mention about the Student Union a couple of times. When  it first opened in the late    50s, what were you thinking?  Well, I happened to know one of the boys   we dated  and his  dad was  one of the contractors for the Union, and we thought it was great. The  first place, there was going to be a place where they could have dances.  And then second place, there were going to be stores. And the third  place, they had this great cafeteria and everybody in Stillwater went to  the cafeteria at the Student Union to eat. I   m sure the people down on  Main Street that had cafeterias and things didn   t think it was so great. It  was just a melting pot and you would see everybody there on Sunday  and everybody would come from church and everybody went up there  and then they   d go over to the library. I think the college library   I have  a son that works for NASA and he   s also a writer and he lives in  Houston and when he comes back home, he still comes back and goes to  the library because he thinks it   s a great place, one of the outstanding  places on the campus. So, you know, that   s a lot of to be said for the  library.  Well we have many people to thank, especially President Bennett.  Right. I can remember when he had this program with Haile Selassie and  he brought Haile Selassie to the Student Union and we were invited to  the reception. My husband and my dad fussed about having to rent a tux  because they had to wear a tux and we had to wear afternoon dresses or  long dresses. We had our invitation and we all went in and Dr. Bennett, I  knew him, he   d say,    Louise, call your mama and see if you can eat with  us.    Whatever the girl   s name was that cooked for them,    She   s going to  fix beans and cornbread and you stay up here and eat with me.    He wore  high top laced shoes. He was a character, but he was a great guy. So we  17  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  Nykolaiszyn  Summers  all felt like we needed to go to this. So we went in and here was this  little black man. He wasn   t five feet tall and he had on medals. He had  these big boards that were wider than he was. He had these great big  body guards and he had all these medals and you went in and you bowed  to him as you went in and that was like,    I can   t believe I   m in here  bowing to Haile Selassie.     But Dr. Bennett is what put this school on the map. He was also smart  enough to buy the land. He bought all the land. He was far sighted in  doing that thing. He came from Durant, Oklahoma. He   d never had any  airs. He was just plain old Dr. Bennett and he just liked everybody. His  youngest son, Tom, is a friend of mine and Tom is a federal judge that  hears social security cases. Tom   s wife, Emma Adele, was a Swim and  they had the Swims there on the corner and lived in the big house there  on the corner and Emma Adele and I grew up together. She died a few  years ago, but Tom is still the same. He teaches Sunday school classes at  the Baptist church. He   s just like his dad. He   s got that southern  Oklahoma, southeastern Oklahoma, or southwestern Oklahoma Durant  draw. They were very unique, but they made Oklahoma State what it is.  Everybody ought to be really proud of them.  Well we   ve jumped across the board a lot today. Is there anything else  you   d like to share with us that we may be missing that I have not asked?  I don   t think so, honey. I just brought this along because I had written  this for my granddaughter telling her about having things like ration  stamps and gas coupons and all that during the war, but we always   my  husband went into the Service and he was with the quarter master, which  meant we always had plenty of things to buy meat. People were having  hamburger, we were having Pike   s Peak roast or something like that. For  some reason and I have no idea, we   ve been very blessed and we have to  thank the Lord everyday for our blessings.  Well I think that   s a good way to end.  Thank you, darlin   .  Thank you so much for sharing your stories with us.  Alrighty. Thank you.  -------  -------
