Speaker 1: All right now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Otis Dodson III] side of the family.  But we're going to start with your mother's side first, so we don't get them confused.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: It's Lo- my mother's name is Lois Christine Dodson.  Do you need her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in November 21st.  Oh, my god, she would have been eighty-three this year.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1927.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  And she was born in Eudora, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that E-U--
Speaker 2: E-U-R-D-O-R-A [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Now, how far back can you trace your mother's side?  How far back can you go on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Looking back at my mother--my mother, her mother was Elizabeth Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your grandmother?
Speaker 2: That's my grandmother.  My mother was only married once, and she had five sisters and one brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any--now, what about your grandfather, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Mr. Thomas, I didn't, I didn't know that much about him.  I didn't know much about him; I didn't, I never met him.  I don't think he had brothers, and I didn't know much about him.  He was a very kind man, you know.  He and my grandmother, Elizabeth Thomas, were married all their lives, you know.  I don't think either of them had been married before.  So, they were a very, very, good couple, just sharecroppers, very poor, you know.  My earliest memories of them--his name was Madison Thomas [Madison Thomas, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my earliest thoughts and memories of them is just always being very, very poor, you know, living in a home that was given to them by, you know, a white person who owned all the land, as was most, you know, elderly people back then.  Very, very, good people, very spiritual based people.  I visited them a lot, and I would go down mostly every summer to stay with them, you know, my cousin and I.
Story_ID: 621953
Speaker 1: Were there any stories passed down on your mother's [Lois Thomas Dodson] side of the family about what life was like, you know, way back, you know?  Any stories about slavery or Reconstruction, or, or any of the struggles that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She, she, didn't talk much about bad times.  She was in bad times, probably, you know.  (Laughter) I didn't quite understand at that point, you know.  I was very young, you know, three, four, or five.  She kept me a lot during the summers, you know.  And, but basically, you know, she had a few harsh stories about having to need water and having to go--walk three or four miles before she was able to get a well of her own, and to get--to physically carry a big pail of water back from Mr. Joe Blow's house, who at that time was a white man, you know.  And she did indicate, you know, when we were a little older and kind of could understand it, you know, how sometimes people had been very mean to her.  But she was a real kind person, so she didn't dwell on a lot of bad thoughts.  She was more interested in just kind of raising us and making sure we were, we had what we needed, and that we could run to the fields and didn't eat too many berries and didn't get too sick.  She played with us.  I remember, you know, she would physically get out here and kick balls with us.  And you know, when we went to the bathroom, she would walk us at night to the bathroom, until she said, "Well, it may be a little too dangerous to go to the outhouse," as we would call it.  And we would just put a little slop jar under the bed if we have to use it.  She was very, very, very kind.  Very religious, very.
Story_ID: 621954
Speaker 1: Did you have the sense that, that they'd been in that region of Mississippi, you know--I mean that generations had been there for a long time?  Or had they, did they have a tradition of having come from someplace else?
Speaker 2: I didn't know her mother, you know.  Her mother obviously had died early, and I never did, never have known much about her mother.  She [Dodson's mother, Lois Thomas Dodson] had been living in Mississippi all their lives, you know, and just had been under the thumb and the thumbprint probably of the owner, the white owners of the land, who ran everything.  They didn't have anything.  They didn't have anything, I mean.  Just everything was--they didn't have anything, you know.  I remember when they would kill the hogs, and as I got to be older and go--I kept going down there every summer.  I mean, it was just my thrill to go down there.  My cousin and I--he would come from Chicago [Illinois] and we would go down there before I was, even able to go to school.  And they would kill the hogs, and that would be a real big deal, because all of the neighbors would come around.  And no part of the hog was really thrown away.  I can look back and think on it now, you know.  I didn't understand it then, but everything was used, you know.  The hair they used to make brushes with.  And all the parts, the inside parts, the feet, the--you know, the chitterlings were from the intestines.  And the head, and the feet, and the tails, and the groin parts--all of it was--and the grease was crackling, crackling bread.  And everything was used.  Soap was made from it.  I didn't understand it all then, but as I kept going down there, I understood, you know, because they would do it every year.  And I guess the worst part about it was seeing how they had to kill the hog, you know.  But that was a process too, you know.  But it was, that was a big event.  And they, and you know I learned a lot as I'm older now looking back.  They weren't unhappy.  They weren't, you know, they weren't satisfied, but they weren't unhappy.  I guess being rooted in church--which they always did go.  And if I was there on Sunday and the weekend, I had to go too, you know.  And we would walk, you know.  And my aunt eventually stayed with them for some reason.  And she never, my aunt never, ever--wherever they moved, they stayed together all their life.  It was my dad [Otis Dodson III], my granddad [Madison Thomas, Sr.], my grandmother [Elizabeth Thomas], and her, Aunt Bertha [ph.].  So, I don't know for whatever reason, but she and Aunt Bertha just attached themselves to the house, and I guess it was okay with them.  She was my grandmother's sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only one that I knew. Well, you know what?  There was another one I, I didn't know much about.
Story_ID: 621955
Speaker 1: Well, I, I'll ask this question later.  But did your mother [Lois Thomas Dodson] talk about growing up [in Eudora, Mississippi], and what it was like when she grew up?
Speaker 2: Some.  You know, she talked about all of them. She talked about how maybe Grandmamma Thomas [Elizabeth Thomas] would--well, I guess she identified which one always was the--was sort of the mother of them all.  Because it was all girls except for my uncle, we called him Uncle Nerk.  He was Madison Thomas, Jr.  Basically, she just talked about how they got along, or didn't get along, you know.  And they were all living--you know, back then they were all bundled up in one room or two rooms.  So, you know, I guess it was kind of like kids are like now when you're poor.  You know, all the kids bundled up in a room, and they don't like it.  And later she would, as I grew older, she talked about high school days.  And, you know, they, they couldn't go to school often.  They would go to school, but they had to work.  When it came time for them to work in the fields, they had to work in the fields and go to school kind of--school was like, "I'll go to school when I can, because I got to stay and help Mom."  So, those were the things she talked about as a kid, you know.  She talked about high school and how it was, you know.  And finally, yeah, she graduated from, from Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School] I believe, yeah.
Speaker 1: In Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: In Memphis, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did she start school in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She went to school in Mississippi, which was a chore, you know, because school was just something--like I said, they went to school as much as they could, but they worked, you know; they had to work to help out.  Because part of how Grandmamma and Granddaddy [Madison Thomas, Sr.] stayed in the house that the white man had was, you got to do these fields, and that takes everybody.  Even when I went, when I got old enough to, I went to the fields, too, messing up, you know, (laughter) not really doing a good job.  But I didn't--you know, I had to go, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like your mother had a lot of perseverance to, you know, be able to finish grade school, or even, you know, stay in long enough to go to high school and graduate from high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a big deal. Yeah, absolutely, my mother was incredible.  You know, she--a very, very fond memory I have.  I never, you know, maybe once or twice in my entire life did I see my mother cry.  Never.  And that's unusual, because there were things that, you know, harmful things that have happened.  And, you know, not at funerals, or nowhere.  I only saw her shed tears later in life.  I never saw her cry.  She died of cancer.  But she was a strong lady.  And my father [Otis Dodson III] and her were married all their life, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 621956
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about that in a moment, but--so, was there a--when did your mother [Lois Thomas Dodson] move from Eudora [Mississippi] to Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm going to say in her early teens, in her teens.  She had to, you know, to actually start to go to high school, you know.
Speaker 1: So, there was no high school down there?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: So, she actually--okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  The transition from how she left Mississippi to get--I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did she have relatives in Memphis?  Or did her, did the whole family move, or just her?  I take it that she must have--because your grandparents [Elizabeth Thomas and Madison Thomas, Sr.] were still down there?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you know--
Speaker 2: Her and Dad [Otis Dodson III] met--I'm just trying to remember just that part of it.  I haven't really thought about it.  She left in--yeah, there's a gap there.  I just don't really, really know when actually she did come to Memphis.  But she graduated from Booker Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis Tennessee], you know.  And then I--
Speaker 1: Okay. Who did she stay with in Memphis when she came up as a teenager?
Speaker 2: I think my grandmother and them moved from deep Mississippi on up to the suburbs, which now is part of Memphis.  But I--she stayed with Grandma.  She stayed with her mom, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her mother and father actually moved near--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --close to Memphis?  And she was able to go to--?
Speaker 2: I want to say they did.  And I want to be kind of--because I haven't really thought about it, you know.
Speaker 1: Because when you went to visit your grandparents, did you go to Eudora or did you go to Memphis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started when they were living in Eudora.  Then they moved a little closer, but most of that was--most of the time I went to Eudora, you know, that's where they were.  And Mom, at that time, they were in Memphis on Michigan Street, which was across the street from my Dad's mother's [Annie Mae Cole] house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 621957
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your father's side now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Otis Charles Dodson the III [Otis Dodson III].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He would have been eighty-five, so he was born in 1925 [sic. 1928] maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that right, sound right?  He was born November the 23rd.
Speaker 1: Okay, November 23rd.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you something.  It was a total mystery to me.  Dad never talked about--he didn't have--his brother died very early.  So, he didn't know much about that.  Dad never talked about his side of the family, nor did his mother.  He had an uncle whose name was Tom Townsend [ph.], who lived in Eudora [Mississippi] also.  Dad was from Eudora as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was born in Eudora?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was born in Eudora as well.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Which is kind of, probably where they met up.  But I didn't know much about that.  They didn't have a lot of--he was an only child, because his brother died early.  And even as I was growing up, Dad never talked about it.  He never talked about his family much.  My grandmother didn't talk about it either.  So, and it wasn't much to talk about.  Because he was an only child, and his brother died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you knew your grandmother on your--did you know your grandfather [Otis Dodson, Jr. (ph.)] too, or just your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I knew my step-grandfather.  I didn't, I never knew my grandmother's--he died.  His name was Holloway, William Holloway [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never knew him, because he died early.  My grandmother remarried, and--
Speaker 1: So your father took your, his stepfather's name?
Speaker 2: Yes [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Annie Mae Cole.
Speaker 1: Okay, C-O-L-E?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then it became Holloway, and then--
Speaker 2: She was Holloway--I'm sorry, she married into Cole.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Holloway was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather was William--
Speaker 2: Originally it was Bill, William Holloway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, because I'm trying to get it right.  Because see, I didn't know any of those people.  And it's a very strange story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just didn't want to get it mixed up.  Because if--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If your grandfather's last name was Holloway, and your grandmother's original last name was Holloway--
Speaker 2: Holloway.  She married Albert Cole [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, wait a minute.  They couldn't have the same name.  I mean, if your father--
Speaker 2: No, she, her first husband was Bill Holloway, William Holloway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, he died, then she married Albert Cole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You understand now?
Speaker 1: Yes.  But what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  Oh, I see, okay.  I don't know.  You know, I--she's told me, but it's so strange, because she, she was stricken with dementia which later turned to Alzheimer's.  She never, ever talked about any of this. During some period when she'd gotten real ill, she began to talk about all these things, and that's how I found these things.  Up until five, maybe six or seven years, just before she died, I started asking her.  And she started talking about all these people in the past.  I said, "Grandmamma, who is this?"  She said, "That's my ex-husband."  Well, I never knew her mother.  And her mother was poisoned, and all these things.  So what I did, I took a pad and I said, I'm onto something, because Grandmother's talking about people who I never knew.  'Cause she never talked about it.  It was almost like a big secret, you know, she didn't want me to know.  Or I don't know if she just wanted, didn't want to talk about it.
Story_ID: 621958
Speaker 1: I know older people in those days didn't talk a lot to children.
Speaker 2: Oh no, they didn't. But I got it all, so I wrote it down--I had it all, and I wrote it all down.  That's why I'm not real familiar with the names, because it was the first time I'd ever heard it.  But I do remember the Holloway.  And--
Speaker 1: So she was married three times that you know of?
Speaker 2: She was married--
Speaker 1: Cole, Holloway [William Holloway (ph.)], and--
Speaker 2: Just--no, Cole.  Yes, yeah, you're right, you're right.
Speaker 1: That's three, okay. Because there was a Dodson, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right, you're exactly right.
Speaker 1: So was Dodson your father's biological father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dodson was?
Speaker 1: Dodson was, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  You're right.  You're making me, you're actually reminding me of it as well.
Speaker 1: Because with a name like Dodson, Otis Charles Dodson III [Otis Dodson III], it seems like the kind of name that a father would give his son, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: She divorced him.  Holloway died, from what I gather from her.  And Albert Cole [ph.] ended up being my dad's stepfather.  He eventually died from Alzheimer's as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: That's right.  Okay, you had to make me think about it, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said, it's very strange.  Had it not been for her sickbed, I would have never known any of that, because she never, ever talked about it.
Speaker 1: But it's hard to untangle this stuff sometimes, especially if you're not used to, you know, talking about it.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely, absolutely.  Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's true for everybody.  So, so, did you know--well, Charles Dodson, Jr. [Otis Dodson, Jr. (ph.)], I guess was your father's father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He never, like I said--yeah.  I always quizzed him about it.  I said, "Dad, where did you get the third from, you know?"  And it could have been that it was given to him.  So maybe, you know, obviously he was one of--the third.  He was the oldest Charles Dodson.  He was obviously the III, which was his dad's name, you know, and obviously was his dad's dad's last name.  So--
Speaker 1: You would assume that.
Speaker 2: We would assume that, but maybe not so.
Speaker 1: It may not--yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Things happen.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And we can assume that--if we were investigating, we would look for a junior, for Charles Dodson, Jr.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, you're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it he didn't know his father very well, or he wasn't around much?
Speaker 2: No.  I think from what Grandmamma [Annie Mae Cole] said to me, like when she got ill, that he died when--or they divorced when Dad was six.  You know, and I only got bits and pieces of that from her.  So, Dad, you know, Dad didn't talk much about--my father didn't talk much about his dad, because I guess he didn't know him.
Speaker 1: He knew Mr. Cole more?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, Dad was respectful of Albert Cole, Grandmamma's husband; he was respectful.  They weren't real close, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was respectful though, but they weren't real close.
Story_ID: 621959
Speaker 1: So, did your father [Otis Dodson III] talk about what it was like growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He didn't?
Speaker 2: He talked absolutely nothing about it.  I mean, all through the years he just never did, you know.  He never, never, did.  And I had no reason to ask, you know.  I guess I didn't ask, "Dad, what was your dad like?"  He never talked about it, you know, we just never did.  And had I--I go back to this point.  Had Grandmamma [Dodson's paternal grandmother, Annie Mae Cole] not got sick and just started running off at the mouth--just her--dementia and Alzheimer's very often takes you--well, they go back in time, and they just start rattling off all these things.  And it made me get a pad, and I wrote it down.  I never would have known; never would have known.
Speaker 1: So, did your father have any memories of growing in Eudora [Mississippi]?  Any stories of what happened in the neighborhood?  Were they sharecroppers too, in Eudora?
Speaker 2: They were poor too; they were poor too.  Dad--when Dad would talk, he would talk more about, more about his friends when he was young, you know.  And then there were some pictures he shared with us, you know.  He had a few friends that he would always talk about how good of friends they were.  And a couple of them went on, they went on to be friends, even after he graduated from school.  And you know, they would, you know, they go to see each other, and they, even when they moved away, you know.  But it, there weren't a lot of stories, you know.
Story_ID: 621960
Speaker 1: When I, when I was young, Dad [Otis Dodson III] and Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] married and they stayed in a house that was maybe one street from my [paternal] grandmother.  So, my grandmother kept me.  Dad was, he was a mechanic, you know.  My grandmother, Mrs. Cole [Annie Mae Cole], she kept me most every day.  My mother--
Speaker 2: That's in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: In Memphis, right, on Parkway.
Speaker 2: So, so, your father's family actually moved to Memphis?  You know that they moved to Memphis?
Speaker 1: Which was, which was Grandmamma Cole.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was just them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, it was really just them.  And my grandmother, Miss Cole, her mother, we used to call her Mama Betty [ph.].  She, I remember when I was very young, Mama Betty moved in with Grandmamma Cole, and Grandmamma Cole kept her until she died.  Now, interestingly, on my dad's--my grandmother's sister, one of them, was white.  I didn't know much about her.  I didn't see her until later.  She lived in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: So your grandmother's sister was white?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, wait a minute.  Now, how--I'm trying to figure out how this--
Speaker 1: Well, I only--
Speaker 2: Did she pass for white?  Or did--
Speaker 1: Well, she would--no, she was more white than black.  I mean I only, I remember seeing pictures of her in the house, but I never--I'd say, "Who is this beautiful lady?"  She said, "That's my sister."  I mean, she never popped up, and then all of a sudden one year I remember she came to see Grandmamma, and I got a chance to see her.  I don't even remember her name.  My dad later started to talk about her.  "That's my aunt," you know.  And when you see--there was a lot of mixed--my grandmother looked like she had Indian [Native American] in her, you know.  And my dad had real light hazel green eyes, very good hair, you know.  And my grandmother's sister, the one who was really more white than black seemingly, she was just gorgeous, you know, just very, very pretty.  But it was all very strange that they never talked about all of that a lot, you know.
Story_ID: 621961
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met or fell in love?
Speaker 2: Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] and Dad [Otis Dodson III] met in Eudora [Mississippi], you know.  And I would hear them talk about stories of courting, and Dad would go see Mom.  And I don't remember a lot about that, but obviously it was just one of those courting things, I guess, like, you know, guys do.  And I don't remember much of them talking about when they got married, or a lot of that, you know.  But I do remember them talking a lot about when they were courting.  And Dad loved Mom just--and he was just an incredible husband.  He cooked for her every day.  He loved to cook, but it wasn't because he had to, because, you know, they both worked hard.  But it was just his way, you know.  He always used to kid, you know, that he was the better cook.  And he would only let her fix the dessert, the banana pudding and sometimes a cake.  But for dinner, as far as I can remember back, he cooked every day, every day, you know; every day.  He would come home, and it was just tradition.  He'd come home, like when I remembered, you know, 4:30, five o'clock.  And when my Grandmamma [Dodson's paternal grandmother, Annie Mae Cole]--when mom got home, it was ready.
Story_ID: 621962
Speaker 1: I was reading that your father [Otis Dodson III] played saxophone.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He, he tried to play saxophone, you know.  And he used to, he was a musician at heart, you know.  And he used to tell us stories about, you know, him and B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King].  And, you know, he loved jazz, and that's all I listen to now is jazz.  He was just a prophetic jazz guy.  So he, there was a period where he had talked B. B. into letting him play with him, sax.  And somewhere right in there, I think he had to make a choice of whether he was going to go on the road with B. B. and do all of that nightclub stuff, or stay married (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He made inference to that.  That was when we got to really kind of be old enough to talk about stuff like that in the house, you know.  And it was very interesting. But he sort of gave it up, you know.  But he loved music.  He always encouraged me, you know.  He never thought I would be--he never thought I--I guess he never thought I would go this far, you know, from just washing dishes and singing.  I would wash dishes and sing while I was washing dishes.  And he was like, "Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Dodson], please close the door," you know.  But that was the only outlet I had, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your mother [Lois Thomas Dodson].  Did she have any musical ability?
Speaker 2: No.  Mom was just Mom, man.  You know, she was just an incredibly strong woman, you know.  I was the oldest of, you know, four kids.  And just, she was just a real dedicated mom that instilled good things in the kids, nothing extra special.  She didn't have an extra special talent or anything.  She was just a real good, down home, black, southern, good mom.

Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have three other brothers.  Jerry, who's right up under me, Jerry Leonard Dodson [Jerry Dodson].  And then the one under him is Danny Ray Dodson [Danny Dodson].  And then my youngest brother is Michael Otis Dodson [Michael Dodson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, are you, you're the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: With the exception of Michael, there's like fourteen years' difference between Mike--and he was, he was real--he was just real young.  He came real late, late, late.  But most of--Jerry and Danny are, we're all like two years apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you grew up together basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of us grew up together, all right there in one room.
Story_ID: 621964
Speaker 1: So what did your household consist of when you were growing up?  Was it just your mother [Lois Thomas Dodson], father [Otis Dodson III], and your, you and your brothers [Jerry Dodson, Danny Dodson and Michael Dodson]?  Or, was your, one of the grandparents there, too?
Speaker 2: No, grandparents lived by themselves always.  I stayed with them a lot, you know, because my mom and dad worked, and there was no babysitter, you know.  Mom worked as an elevator operator.  And when, there were times when she would take me--she was an elevator operator.  And I remember some days she would leave me in the theater, which was the Princess Theater [Memphis, Tennessee].  And as a treat for me, she would just let me stay there all day and watch the movies over and over again.  And I'd have, you know, just a buck or something, not much more than that, just--maybe not even that--just enough to buy a drink or something.  And she'd come back and get me afterwards when she got off, because it was just right around the corner.  And at that time it was, the Princess I think was the only theater we could even go to back then.  And then I think we had to walk up the side; we couldn't go in the front door.  But most days, my [paternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Cole] kept me, because we were--she lived right around the corner from us.  But back when I was growing up we lived in several different homes in South Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee], but we always lived together; small home, you know, nothing elaborate at all. Very--we were poor, you know, we didn't have any money, you know.
Speaker 1: How would you describe most of the houses?  Were most of the houses like those three room kind of houses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a living room, kitchen, and one bathroom, and two bedrooms--one for the kids, I don't care how many kids it was--and one for Mom and Dad.  And that was it, the story of our life.  No matter where we went and moved, it was always just four rooms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or an apartment.  We lived in a lot of places in, but basically in the same area.  I only, I only went to three different schools; two different grammar schools and one high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 621965
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, and their dispositions, and their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My dad [Otis Dodson III].  Yeah, I mean I take--from my dad I got my--my dad was very courteous.  He was a God fearing man, he was a very honorable man, you know, he taught me honor.  You know, the biggest thing he'd ever get mad at me about was lying.  That was a big deal.  I mean, lying and stealing, you know, just never take anything.  And never tell a lie about it, no matter what it is.  Face up, own up to it, and take it.  But I mean, I would get my butt beat about lying to him, you know.  He would even understand me making mistakes, you know, breaking a window or, you know, doing mischievous things.  None of my brothers were malicious.  We were just raised real good.  My mother [Lois Thomas Dodson], from her I got strength.  You know, she was kind of straight ahead, very intelligent.  She could kind of discern stuff.  My dad would let--my dad was hard, but he was different.  My mother was like--Dad was going to whip us.  Mom wasn't going to whip us.  "Your dad's going to whip you," you know.  When she whipped you, it's like you'd really done something really--because it was always, "Dad's going to take care of you," you know.  And we were just terribly afraid of Dad, because Dad would whip us, you know, about stuff.  But it would be stuff that was--when you weren't honorable, you know, bad grades when you know you could do better, you know.  So I mean before Mama died, I think I might have been--god, I might have been fifty before I even slipped and said a curse word around my mom.  It was like that; we just did not do it.  You didn't eat with your hat on, you know.  I mean it was just, just things like that, that you just wouldn't think parents would be concerned about.  You know, my dad--you, you always washed your hands before you ate.  It was just, you had to do it, you know.
Story_ID: 621966
Speaker 1: My dad [Otis Dodson III] wasn't over religious.  You know, Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] went to church all the time and Dad sort of, Mom got Dad back into church.  She got him back in the church, going--especially toward the end of, the last part of their marriage.  He'd just been out, you know, he'd just been out of church, you know.  It just, it wasn't because he didn't believe in God.  He just didn't go, you know, but Mom did.  And then in the later years they both would go just religiously, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, what denomination?
Speaker 1: Baptist.
Speaker 2: Baptist, okay.
Speaker 1: They both were Baptist.
Speaker 2: Now, did you and your brothers [Jerry Dodson, Danny Dodson and Michael Dodson] spend a lot of time in church when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: It was mandatory when we were growing up to go, you know.  And as we became older and had a choice, you know, (laughter) a lot of times we'd choose just not to go.  And I, myself, you know, actually for a long time I got out of church, you know.  And it was during the time that really I got into music, really.  It took me just totally out of church, just a lot of wild crazy years, you know.  And it wasn't, it wasn't that God was out of my heart, but it was definitely out of my mindset.  (Laughter) You know, I wasn't--we were gone; we were gone every week.  We were working, you know.  You were working in the clubs, you didn't feel like going to church on Sunday.  Or we were gone as we got bigger, and more concerts.  You know, we were really doing well.  We weren't home, we were just gone, you know.
Story_ID: 621967
Speaker 1: Your father [Otis Dodson III] knew [HistoryMaker] B. B. King and, and played with him at one point in time.  Now did, were--was your family familiar--or did you see a lot of the famous musicians in Memphis [Tennessee], you know?
Speaker 2: I didn't, you know, I didn't.  I was young and Dad hung out with them, you know, but I didn't, you know.  You know, of course we just weren't allowed to do that, you know.  And it wasn't like they came by the house and stuff like that.  Dad knew them, you know.  And like I say, he wasn't a jazz player that everybody knew.  But they were close.  You know, they, they knew each other well, you know.  And so, you know, Dad was sort of a hot--I saw pictures of Dad when he was young.  And he became sort of a hotshot, you know.  He was a very sporty dresser when he was like twenty, twenty-one.  And I saw pictures of him, and I said, "Now, who is this guy?"  You know, he was very sharp with the big hat and the tailored suits.  So there was a period when he was like a real sporty guy.  And I guess it was during that time, you know, that he was making, I guess, his choice about whether he was going to be a musician or not.  And he opted not to.  But I never saw those guys hanging around.  He would talk about 'em, you know, but I never saw 'em.
Story_ID: 621968
Speaker 1: What kind of little kid were you?  What, what were you interested in when you growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I, you know, as a kid I liked science.  I liked biology, you know, and I liked medicine.  Medicine fascinated me, you know.  There were times when I just thought I was going to be a doctor.  And I was always intrigued by that, you know.
Speaker 1: Was there a black doctor in town [Memphis, Tennessee]?  Or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, at that time it was like a doctor that all the black folks saw.  You know, it was one dentist, and he saw every--all the black people.  And there was sort of one M.D., and he was like the doctor that everybody--and then, but you know, most of the time, we couldn't afford to go to the doctor.  You know, there was a home remedy for everything we had.  And I don't remember us being real sick.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering what inspired you I guess, to--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's just something inside of me.  Music was something that--I didn't do a lot of singing in church, you know.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't like I was in the choir all my life.  It wasn't that, you know.  I always knew that I was going to sing in a group, maybe be like The Temptations.  That was really, excuse me, that was really my--as I got older, that's what I wanted to do.  And that's obviously what I did, because we formed a group called The Temprees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 621969
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, now, I have to ask it, like.  But, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up, backyard barbeque, you know.  We learned, as a kid, I learned to do a lot.  We had to learn to do a lot with a little, you know.  As a kid it was basically, you know, you have a pair of skates.  When they tear up, you make a skate truck.  And when that tears up, you take two and make a skateboard.  And you know, you recycle everything until you got, you know, your parents got well off enough to buy you a bike.  That was a big deal.  All of us--being one of four kids--so I'm the oldest.  So if there was something special, maybe I got it.  I got the pair of skates before anybody else did.  But it wasn't much.  Back then, growing up was just the love, the family love, you know.  My family, we played Monopoly, you know.  We, Dad [Otis Dodson III] and Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] spent time with us, you know.  We couldn't go out, you know.  We couldn't do things, you know.  But we were, we were a tightknit family.
Speaker 1: So you couldn't just be out in the street?
Speaker 2: No, no my dad didn't allow that, didn't allow that.  You know, you had to be in the house.  There were rules, always rules.  You had to be home at a certain time.  And you couldn't go in this yard.  You couldn't do that; you couldn't--you know, just things that were courteous.  You couldn't pick people's peaches off the trees.  My dad and my mom ran a real good household, so we ate together, you know.  There wasn't any--Dad and Mom ate and two of the kids ate, and then the other two ate when they got ready; it wasn't that.  It was very organized, you know, however simple it was, you know.  And then as we got older we would help out, you know.  We had chores, cleaning the house up.  That was a big deal, you know.  But we were a real tight family.  And I guess that's why I've only been married once [to Marie Dodson], because I--when I was growing up my mother and father loved each other, and I knew they would never, ever separate.  And I would hear them argue from time to time, but I knew from just the way they loved each other, that they would never part, you know.  And as they both later on in life got sick, you know, it was, I was glad I was there to help take care of them.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Early years of school, I went to Riverview [Riverview Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee].  I went to kindergarten, as matter of fact.  I went to kindergarten at Mrs. Snell's Kindergarten [ph.], which was down the street from my grandmother's house.  It was in a church, in the basement of a church.  And it was real organized, and it was real good, you know.  They made us dress up, and we did things.  I went there from kindergarten, and from there I went to Riverview Elementary.  And when we sort of moved around the neighborhood, I had to change one year and go to Florida School [Florida Kansas Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], which was near my [paternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Cole].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How old were you when you went to Florida, you think?
Speaker 2: Eight, eight.  I only went there for like a year.
Speaker 1: Like third grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I went back to Riverview because we moved back over in that district, it was closer to that.  And then in that same neighborhood, I went to George Washington Carver School, and I went there until I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that a middle school or--?
Speaker 2: It was, it was high school
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, George Washington Carver High School [Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: High school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So I started, I started there in the seventh grade, and I went on through the twelfth grade there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You're the first one we've interviewed who went to Carver.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Everybody's talking about Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Carver was that other school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There weren't many.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there weren't many during that time.  But Carver was a school that started in 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was a newer school.
Speaker 2: It was a newer school.  It was a more, it was an alternate school for people who went--you either went to Booker Washington or you went to Carver.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee] was still going on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Manassas was, I was about to say Manassas was another school that was an old school that had been out there a long time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you have any favorite teachers in school?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Brack [DeLois Brack], who was my music teacher.  Now, I understand it.  Now, about the time I got to high school, now I'm, now I'm starting vocal groups now.  I started The Temprees.  We're the vocal group, and we're the hottest, one of the hottest groups around now.  So, we're singing under the steps and--
Speaker 1: Well, tell me.  Before we get to the groups part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 621971
Speaker 1: How you and your family, and I guess the community, was oriented towards music.  Did, did you, did you have a radio that you played a lot?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I listened to the radio, yeah, I did.  And then--
Speaker 1: Was there a record shop, and--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Was there a record store that you'd go to?
Speaker 2: The first record I ever bought was Elvis Presley's record.  It was, I loved Elvis Presley.  I thought that the sun rose and shined--and not that--I listened to jazz at home, but you know, Elvis was kind of like I guess, what inside of me I wanted to be one day, the best at whatever it was.  I didn't want to be like him, but--
Speaker 1: So, did your father [Otis Dodson III] like introduce you to jazz?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would--subliminally it was there in the house.  So--
Speaker 1: And who did he listen to?
Speaker 2: Sarah Vaughan, and Ray Charles was number one. Duke Ellington--he was a big band guy, you know.  Nat King Cole, you know, [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt, you know, Dinah Washington, the greats.  And he had a very, very, big jazz collection, which he let nobody touch.  But he played it, you know, and it was there.  So I listened to it, and I--you know, and jazz is a good foundation for kids, because it's something they never forget.  You might not like it, but you'll never forget it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were these LPs or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, at that time they were called 78s [78 rpm record].
Speaker 1: Oh, so, he had 78s?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And, yeah, big thick heavy records, absolutely, a bunch of them.  And like I said, he didn't let anybody touch them.  You know, they were his collection, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, was radio on a lot at home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, radio was on.  We were allowed to listen to radio and, but not during, when we had homework.  Homework was a big deal.  Like I said, my family was regimented.  We went to school, did homework.  Got to do it, got to make good grades, you know.  You know, they attended PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meetings.  They followed us through school, you know, made sure we didn't miss.  That's why they were just real--they disciplined us a lot when we messed up in school.  But I listened, you know, I listened to stuff, you know, early memories of, you know, the '60s [1960s].  And, you know, and when I even started listening early, it was Elvis and those songs that came on, you know.  It wasn't a lot of black music, because, you know, just, it wasn't a lot of black music then.
Speaker 1: On the radio?
Speaker 2: On the radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was music, but it wasn't being played on the radio.
Speaker 1: Now, when did WDAI start?
Speaker 2: WDIA [WDIA Radio, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: WDIA, right.
Speaker 2: WDIA was back then.  And--
Speaker 1: Now that's the one that--
Speaker 2: It was a black owned radio station.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] B. B. King--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's where you would hear B. B. King and people like that, you know.  It was an outlet for black music.
Speaker 1: Was it that popular?  I mean, did you like that kind of music when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I liked--oh, no, man, blues wasn't what I liked.  I liked Solomon Burke, Ben E. King.  Jackie Wilson was one of my favorites, Sam Cooke.  That's what I liked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, those were, I emulated that.  From the white side it was Elvis, because he was just so big, you know.  On TV, when, when you were fortunate enough to have a TV, that's who you saw.
Story_ID: 621972
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you reflect back on it now--now I know it's true. Now, we're about the same age, but, but what was it about the blues that kind of lost its appeal to a generation of black youth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I just don't know, you know.  Maybe we just didn't understand what the blues meant, you know.  Our parents loved it.  They absolutely loved it, you know.  Because, you know, we would have what we call backyard parties, and that was big, you know.  All three of the neighbors, the neighbors were tight, and they'd all get together and they would play those songs.  And there was a time, there was a certain period after they all had a couple of drinks, especially, that's all they wanted to hear.  You, if you were there early in the night, you heard Solomon Burke and The Temptations or, you know, the Motown [Motown Records] stuff, and Sam Cooke.  But late in the night after the drinks came, when they got a little, you know, tucked, a little tipsy, it would be blues, B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King] and all those guys.  And at that point we'd go, we'd go, the kids would go do something else, you know. (Laughter) I don't know.  You know, blues just seemed a little sad to us I guess, you know.  We, we just didn't get it, you know.  We just didn't get it, as a lot of kids don't now.
Story_ID: 621973
Speaker 1: Do you remember the era when people started buying the 45s [45 rpm record] and the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you all participate in that, pretty much, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, when we could afford it, we would, you know.  I remember Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] bought records.  She loved to buy music, you know, and she would buy one every week, you know.  And one, you know, she could afford to get one, maybe two, whichever the most popular thing was.  I would hear her say, "I'm going to get that next week."  Or, "I'm going to get that when I, you know, do thus and so, save up the money."  And she would get it, and that would be a really big deal in the house, to have a new 45, you know, that you had to put the little red spindle in.  And to even have something to play it on was really a big deal, you know, of course.  We had then--and then, you know, then that was a real good period, when music started to be part of your life, you know.  And music, being as it is now, it was that, it was that common thread that moved through the neighborhood, you know, to keep people together, you know.  And the gospel music did the same thing for you, you know.  On Sunday, everybody's playing it.  Every window is open, and that's what you hear, you know, the inspirational music.  And back then it was, like I said, it was the glue that kept people together.  Because when they came together for parties, it made them all laugh.  And on Sundays, you'd hear that coming out of the windows.  And the old grandmammas would be sitting on the porch nodding their head before church or after church.  And it was just, it was kind of like--and on Sundays, you know, we didn't, Dad [Otis Dodson III] didn't allow us to play a lot of goofy stuff, you know.  You'd kind of like listen to what was customary to listen to.
Story_ID: 621974
Speaker 1: What about on television?  Did you, did you watch any--?
Speaker 2: When we fort- first fortunate to have a TV.  Yeah, man, we watched TV.  And we watched--we did what kids do, you know, we watched cartoons.  And then if there was somebody special, James Brown, or somebody--Ed Sullivan was real big back then--who was, you know--.  And then I look back and I remember seeing, I remember the first time seeing The Beatles, and Wayne Newton, and Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke, you know.  Because as Ed Sullivan's show ['The Ed Sullivan Show'] progressed, he started to have more African American people on there, you know.  Elvis [Elvis Presley] was, you know, I remember seeing him for the first time.  You know, TV was a big deal.  And I said, I would, still as I got older, you know, I would still go down and visit my [paternal] grandmother's [Annie Mae Cole], man, and they didn't have a TV.  So it was, it was more of just sitting around talking with them, you know, going to bed early.
Story_ID: 621975
Speaker 1: Now, what, what was the take on Elvis in the community, in, in Memphis [Tennessee] especially?  I'm really curious.  I know he, he kind of crossed over into the black community in most cities in, in a way that a lot of other white musicians didn't.  But, but, what was the take on him?
Speaker 2: He was, he was just the guy.  I mean, he was just the King, you know.  And for some reason black people loved him and liked, loved him, and it didn't make any difference if he was white or not.  For some reason, for whatever reason, he was just so dynamic and so popular.  People liked him for him, it didn't make a big difference.  They liked Jackie Wilson.  And Jackie Wilson was Jackie Wilson. And Elvis, to me, as I remember, for show business they were the, they were just the tops, because they were both very charismatic and moved a lot, and they both--the girls were crazy about both of them.  And they were very, you know, poised; very sharp, you know.  Whereas, some of the--Nat King Cole was different.  He was smooth, and he reflected something.  I do remember back when Nat King Cole was the only somebody, the only African American I saw on TV with his own show ['The Nat King Cole Show'].  He might have been the first to even have a show.
Speaker 1: I think he was the first.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And that was just strange to me, really amazing.  But to answer your question, Elvis--people loved him.  They loved him, and they kind of considered him, even though he was real flamboyant, they kind of considered him a grounded person, for some reason.  You would talk to black people about Elvis and they would say, you know, "He's kind of, he's our guy.  He's a homeboy, you know," even before I think they knew he was from Mississippi, you know.  And as he grew, as he got more popular here in Memphis, he represented our guy from Memphis.  "The King, he lives here in Memphis.  You know, his home is here in Memphis," you know.  He was a big part of it.  And then of course, he had to share that with some of the other great African American entertainers who came from this area.  But he was the tops, you know.
Speaker 1: So this is from, you know, I guess he emerges around 1955, '56 [1956], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, right, right.  So he kind of had it out there by himself for a while.  He was, you know, like I say, he was unparalleled, you know, for a while.  Because you saw him, because it wasn't often that you got to see an African American.  It wasn't that he was the only talented guy out there, but you just didn't see it.  As these guys came on TV, people started seeing that there were other great entertainers, both black and white, you know, that were just very, very good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the early rock and roll--Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you started to see those--
Speaker 1: Sam Cooke.
Speaker 2: That's right, when they were allowed to be on TV, you know.
Speaker 1: Johnny Mathis would appear--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Johnny Mathis, you know, and--
Speaker 1: It was a different kind of music, but--
Speaker 2: It was a different kind of music, but those guys came around, you know, and then you started to see them on the celebrity shows, you know, which there weren't--.  Well,  Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'] was kind of it; kind of it, you know.  And then later on came--what's--the dance parties and the--
Speaker 1: Dick Clark?
Speaker 2: Dick Clark, you know.
Speaker 1: 'American Bandstand.'
Speaker 2: And the 'American Bandstand.'  And then you would see them then, you know.  But they had to be absolutely the tops to be seen then.
Speaker 1: Now, were the--I guess almost simultaneously--like Stax Records here, and Motown [Motown Records] in Detroit [Michigan]--I guess they were about the same--
Speaker 2: At the same time, yeah.  Motown--
Speaker 1: --popular--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Motown was kind of there.  And Philadelphia International [Philadelphia International Records] sort of came later, you know, with the Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff] hits.  And then Stax was right there.  They all, Motown was a little ahead, you know.  Motown was a little ahead, and then came Stax, you know.  Philly International was there.  And Stax became, we started to, you know, take roots and, and become an entity, entity within itself.

Speaker 1: Who were your favorites then?  And were you keenly aware that there was music being developed, you know, in, you know, of the Stax [Stax Records] music and stuff here, here in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Growing up at Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee], you know, as I said, I started the group called The Temprees, which was, we sort of emulated The Temptations.  We were very good, you know.  And we got to be kind of, one of the hottest vocal groups around.  It was very competitive, because you had The Mad Lads, you know, and all these other just really great--
Speaker 1: The Mad Lads were from here?
Speaker 2: The Mad Lads were from here.  After--
Speaker 1: Volt Records, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And see, they actually were putting out records, 'Shop Around' ['Don't Have to Shop Around'] and 'My Girl'--not 'My Girl,' but--
Speaker 1: 'I Found a Girl' [sic. 'I've Never Found a Girl']?
Speaker 2: 'I Found a Girl,' and oh, they just, they had a bunch of four or five just big hits.  They were the absolute tops.  Because it's one thing to be singing around at talent shows, but to actually be putting a record out--and then to be a popular record--they were very good, dressed well.  But yeah, there was awareness around Memphis, because now Stax had, you know, Sam and Dave, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas.  And this was prior to me even, you know, getting in The Bar-Kays or anything; that came later.  But yeah, music was just, it was the thing, you know.  It was--and because Stax was so popular, even though it was a place that people could just imagine to be--to go inside--it was kind of like it existed, but it was, you know, it was kind of like it was off limits, because that's where all the stars were.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, where was it, actually?
Speaker 2: It was on--
Speaker 1: In proximity to you?
Speaker 2: The driving distance is about fifteen minutes.  You know, it was on McLemore [Avenue], you know.  And I lived in South Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee]; and that's South Memphis, really.  You know, it's not even fifteen minutes.  It was like in the hood, you know.  So, it wasn't a place that was up on some hill.  It was just a place, but they knew--everybody knew that's where all the big stars would come and record, and move in and out.  And you'd hang around and see what kind of cars you would see there, you know.  It was--
Speaker 1: Did you go over there and look?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, man, yeah.  We'd hang out and get as close as we could, you know.  And then they eventually put a fence around it, to where you just couldn't go on the property like that.  Because, you know, there were big stars going in and out of there.  But it was absolutely--people were very keenly aware that there was a lot of great music going on over there.  Because those songs were being--you really started to hear them.  As black radio evolved, you had a chance to hear those songs, you know, Otis Redding, and Sam and Dave, you know, and just, later on The Dramatics, and Johnnie Taylor, and Rufus and Carla Thomas, and B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King] and Albert King, and just on and on and on.
Speaker 1: How many of the people you mentioned were actually from Memphis?
Speaker 2: Besides The Bar-Kays, Isaac was originally from Memphis. [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes was originally from Memphis.  David Porter was originally from Memphis.  There weren't a lot of, there weren't a lot of--William Bell, and Sam and Dave and those guys were from Mississippi or Chicago [Illinois], Dallas, Texas.  It wasn't--you know, it was strange, but not a lot of them were from Memphis, born and raised in Memphis, not a lot.
Speaker 1: I think Rufus and Carla Thomas was from--
Speaker 2: Rufus and Carla were from Memphis.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rufus and Carla.  Johnnie Taylor wasn't, you know.  Sam and Dave weren't.  Booker T. and the M.G.'s, yes, they were, you know.  And then there were those entertainers who actually, who didn't go to Stax.  Like Maurice White was from Memphis, the leader of Earth, Wind and Fire.  Al Green wasn't from Memphis.  He was from Texas, but he came here and made all those wonderful big records, you know.  So, you know, some of those guys came here and made residence here, and would keep homes here.  Little Milton and those guys weren't from Memphis.
Speaker 1: There's a funny dynamic about, like Little Milton was living in Chicago.  I think a lot of the people in Chicago actually was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Or in Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Right, or in St. Louis [Missouri].  It was kind of like--everybody says if it's Mississippi, then you came to Memphis.  Then you went St. Louis.  Then you went to Chicago, and from there you might have went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] maybe, or Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Or Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Milwaukee, right, absolutely.  That was the route for some reason, you know.  So, yeah, and then backwards it came, you know.  But very few of them stayed here, you know, made residency here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would come here and get inside those four walls over at Stax and make some incredible music, because there was just something going on in those four walls.  I mean it was just some magic that everybody--
Story_ID: 621977
Speaker 1: Even Elvis, even he would want it, and at some point would come here.  And, and, and I'll never forget, when he came he had this thing he wanted to record, physically record on the floor of Stax Records [Memphis, Tennessee].  But what he did, he would bring his entourage.  So his recording trailer--he recorded on the floor, but his, the actual recorder was outside of Stax, in his own trailer.  It was a remote recording studio.  But he--
Speaker 2: So, he had some kind of a-
Speaker 1: Well, he just physically wanted to be on the floor recording, and they would put everybody out at six o'clock.  Because he came and it took him about a week or maybe even longer.  But every day at six o'clock, everybody had to go out.  And Elvis, he had his RV [recreational vehicle] and his whole little entourage.  And I slipped in, and I stayed in the bathroom one day.  And I just had to see my idol, you know, at that time who was--my other idols were Ray Charles and Sly Stone, and them other guys.  I got a chance to see Elvis Presley, so I'll never forget it.  He came out and--he came and he was in studio A, and he had his big entourage.  And I would peep out of the, peep out of the bathroom and come around the hall, and I got a chance to see him.  He had this big cigar and his big rings and his cape and all that on.  And I'll never forget when he got on the floor and I saw that all his bodyguards had gone in, I cracked the door.  And he was the first artist I ever saw who actually was singing with his hand, with the mic [microphone] in his hand.  And I couldn't stay long, because I didn't want them to catch me.  But that was the only time I got a chance.  It was only one of the few times I ever saw him, you know.  I saw him one other time riding his motorcycle one night, you know, just oddly, you know.  Because--
Speaker 2: Well, how did--tell that story about the motorcycle.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  You know, Graceland [Memphis, Tennessee] was on Everett [Avenue].  Graceland, this was later after I was like--
Speaker 2: Well, first, like how old were you when you sneaked in the bathroom?
Speaker 1: I had just joined the group, so that was, I joined the band in 1970.  That was in the first years that I was--that might have been '70 [1970].  Seventy [1970], it had to have been, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were in The Bar-Kays?
Speaker 1: I was in The Bar-Kays at that time, yes.
Speaker 2: And the second story, now tell us the second story.  This is much later?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is much later.  And this is also during the time when I'm in The Bar-Kays in the early years, the early '70s [1970s].  But he would, Elvis would spend--maybe to come to Graceland--I mean he probably sneaked in a lot, but you know, people didn't see him.  But this particular night, I saw him on the street, on Brooks Road, riding his motorcycle, which was a three wheeler.  And two other people were with him, I guess maybe his bodyguards.  But I knew it was him; I mean I was very close to him when I saw him.  But that was one of the few times that I had just actually seen him, you know.  But it was just intriguing.  And you know, it--when I--the time I was in Stax and saw him as I was peeping through the door, he was sort of a bigger than life situation.  Because to see him with his big cigar and his big rings, and then to see him come in, not like other guys would.  Most all the entertainers came to Stax were very sharp, you know, even when they'd come to record.  But he had his cape and all this outfit on.  And I didn't know what that was, what that meant.  But obviously, that was part of his, his thing.  So, and he was on the floor recording with the mic in his hand, singing just like he was.  And I just thought that was the craziest thing in the world, you know, for him to be fully garbed like that, you know, for a recording session (laughter).  But that's, that was a wild story, yeah.
Story_ID: 621978
Speaker 1: Well let's go back to high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and the group.  Now how, how old were you when you formed your group in high school?
Speaker 2: Ninth grade, eighth, ninth grade; so maybe fourteen.
Speaker 1: Now, did you form the group?
Speaker 2: I formed the group, The Temprees.  I put them all together, man.  Scotty--
Speaker 1: You recruited those guys?
Speaker 2: Yep.  We all went to school together.  I sort of talked them into doing it.  And I was the guy who always pushed for rehearsals.  Because we had some good singers, you know.  At that time it was four of us; Deljuan Calvin,  Jasper "Jabbo" Phillips, who was just a real good voice, and Scotty, Harold "Scotty" Scott [Harold H. "Scotty" Scott], who--my job was to kind of keep everybody rehearsing, and push, push, push, push.  They never liked to rehearse; they just wanted to sing.  They didn't really take it very seriously.  And as we started to get popular then they said, oh, we might be into something here.  And we never made a record during that time.  Only after I joined The Bar-Kays in 1970 did they go on, and two years later they actually came to Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee] and started to record themselves.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's the name of the group you created?
Speaker 2: The Temprees.
Speaker 1: The Temprees, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so, now what did, what part did you sing?
Speaker 2: I was one of the three lead singers.  Jabbo was the main lead singer and Deljuan was the guy with the high falsetto, with the Eddie Kendricks kind of voice.  And I was the David Ruffin kind of guy, with the raspy voice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did a lot of Temptations stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: We were actually very good.  We were kind of like of the top groups in the city.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have to worry about royalties in those days or anything?
Speaker 2: We didn't have no royalties.  Royalties?  We didn't have any songs (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, I mean paying The Temptations for their songs?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, man, please.  Everybody sang Temptations songs, you know.  If you wanted to do well, sing 'My Girl' at a talent show.  You know, that's how you get all the girls, whether you could do it good or not, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it's different.  They follow people around, ASCAP [The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers] and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, it's different now.
Speaker 1: In those days, you could just--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you just--your whole career was confined to TV, I mean to talent shows, backyard barbeques.  Somebody could pay you fifteen or twenty dollars to come do some songs there, you know.  But basically that was it.  There was no other outlet.  We tried, we auditioned for Stax twice and got turned down, you know, as did The Bar-Kays.  They auditioned twice and got turned down, before actually being accepted, you know, for a recording contract.
Speaker 1: So, were you still in high school when you auditioned for the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we actually were.  Yeah, we actually were in junior high school.  You know, because The Mad Lads were still in school when they started their career, as was The Bar-Kays.  They were still tenth and eleventh grade students, even when they recorded 'Shop Around' ['Don't Have to Shop Around'].  Most all of the groups were in school; The Astors, which was another recording group.  Stax, at that time sought after good talent in high school or wherever it came from, you know.  Deanie Parker--Carla Thomas was, might have been in high school when she did 'Gee Whiz.'  No, maybe she wasn't.  But it, when she started her career, she started singing in high school, and from there was, was sought out and Stax grabbed her, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, her father was already making records.
Speaker 2: Right, her father [Rufus Thomas] was already making records, but she was still in high school singing, you know.
Story_ID: 621979
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Booker T. [Booker T. Jones] when you were in high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I did not know Booker T.  You know, they went to Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee], and then they were a little older than I was, you know.  I did not really know The Bar-Kays, you know.  They were just, after 'Soul Finger' came out, they were just like the number one group.  And then I followed them around, because were, The Temprees, we would sing--we would often be on the same shows.  They would be kind of like the headliners, and we would be--and sometimes even they would agree to play for us.  You know, but not much of that, you know.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you about that.  Like what was your--what band did you--did have a band that you used all the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, we eventually had, you know, three or four guys that played for us regularly.  But usually what you would do then if you were going to sing two numbers, you would give your--if it was going to be 'My Girl' or something you would just let them sing.  "Well, I'm going to sing 'My Girl,'" in whatever key it is.  Or, and then they would just take the record and they would learn it, and that would be the first time.  When it came up for your time to sing, that would be the first time you'd see them.  And eventually as we got to be a little bit more known, we had some guys who played for us all the time, you know.
Speaker 1: So, rehearsal in the early days was just singing the song with the record on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, we would rehearse at each other's home and sort of, you know, never--we would rehearse to be good, but we didn't really think there was a future there, you know.  I was--we just didn't think--we just didn't think that door would ever open for us.  We just wanted to be popular and singing in the clubs.  And actually my parents [Lois Thomas Dodson and Otis Dodson III] allowed me to sing in nightclubs when we really weren't supposed to, because we were too young and it kept out us late.  I would say my parents gave us a lot of leeway.  They didn't stop us, you know.  Because we were popular, and they, they knew when the clubs started asking us to play it would be Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  And Wednesday got in the way of school, but they allowed us to do it.  And they signed this slip for us to be able to do that.
Story_ID: 621980
Speaker 1: How did you do in school?  How, how were you doing?  How were your grades?
Speaker 2: Horrible (laughter) (makes sound).  I mean I was horrible, I was really a knucklehead.  I mean, just because--you know, I remember seventh grade [at Riverview Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee].  I started--you know, I was a bright kid, but I just--school just got to be something I didn't really care for.  You know, I'd get by.  The teachers liked me, and they actually did, they helped me get through school.  Because I started skipping a lot, you know, singing and doing stuff, and my parents [Lois Thomas Dodson and Otis Dodson III] didn't really like all that, you know.  But I got off track and I had to spend a year out of school, because I was suspected of having a kid by one of the girls.  And it was later found out I wasn't.  And--
Speaker 1: And that would--they would suspend you for that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If that happened inside of school, they would put you out.  And for that reason, I did.  And my grandfather at the time said, "Well, I'll tell you what."  And I was in the tenth grade, and he said, "Why don't you think about getting a job, you know?"  So, he actually got me a job at the railroad, which was a very good job.  You know, and I worked for a while and I went back to school.  And--
Speaker 1: You were in the tenth grade in school in 1967 or so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I graduated in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Right, but that was the year I was out.  So he helped me to work, you know.  He worked at the railroad, and he got me on.  And I worked a while there and then I went back to school.  And I graduated, and I actually graduated, you know, very honorably.  You know, I was very popular in school.  And I got on the right track, you know.  Seventh, eighth, nine grade, up in there, I was good.  Because we were singing in the clubs, you know, and just very popular, and kind of smelling ourselves a little bit, you know.  But I got back on track and graduated.  I didn't go to college.  When I got out of high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee]--I graduated in '69 [1969]; we, The Temprees were pretty hot.
Story_ID: 621981
Speaker 1: I want to take you back a little bit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Back to '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because this is a pivotal moment, 1967--well, '67 [1967] and '68 [1968], in, in Memphis [Tennessee]. And then your career.  In '67 [1967], that's when Otis Redding and most of The Bar-Kays were killed in a plane crash, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: In Madison, Wisconsin I believe.
Speaker 2: Madison, Wisconsin.  And I was at a friend's house, I'll never forget it.  And we were just fumbling around, and it came on the news that they had--it happened, the crash had happened, and they suspected all of them were killed.  And it ended up Ben Cauley wasn't; he survived.  James--we went on to learn later that James Alexander, who is now still in the group and my partner, he wasn't on the plane.  But that was just a horrible time.  Because you know looking back, the day that they recorded 'Soul Finger'---they recorded 'Soul Finger,' and they wanted a live crowd.  So, they came to Carver High School [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and got a bunch of kids and they sneaked off, kind of sneaked them off.  And I only missed being in that bunch by just that much, because the car was full.  And they went over to Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee], and they were part of the ones that said, "Soul Finger."  And, it was just that bunch.  And ironically, my [paternal] grandmother [Annie Mae Cole], who I stayed with a lot, she worked for this white couple.  And she would always bring me their leftover clothes, you know.  So they'd send this home, "Can you wear this, Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Dodson]?"  And it ended up she was working for the Caldwells, who were the mother and father of Ronnie Caldwell, who was the keyboard player for The Bar-Kays.  And so it was like a--subliminally, there were all of these things that happened that were associated with--I never knew that; I had to put that together.  All these times I'd been wearing the t-shirts that the Caldwells were throwing away, my grandmother was working for them.  And you know, that was quite a--you know, that was--.  You know, that was quite--that was--it was not unusual at all to be a maid, or just go in washing clothes and cleaning clothes.  And that's what my grandmother did.  And she was bringing all these clothes.  And I saw Caldwell, but I never, ever put it together.  And later in life I said, "You know what?  My grandmother worked for Ronnie Caldwell's parents."  But I missed being on 'Soul Finger' by that. And I ended up--
Story_ID: 621982
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970], one day at--we, we were playing, The Temprees were playing at this club.  And I had been, I would ride the bus downtown.  And I would see this guy, his name was Allen Jones [Allen A. Jones, Jr.], who was like the, at that time the manager.  He was like the mentor of The Bar-Kays, you know, kind of their producer so to speak.  And I did not know that he had a vision to get a lead singer for The Bar-Kays, and he had his eye on certain guys, and I was one of the guys.  And I would see him, and he'd say, "What are you doing?"  You know, and we would always kid.  He said, "I'm going to come to you, and I got something I want to talk to you about."  And eventually James [James Alexander] came one Sunday night, and he asked me would I--they wanted to get a, they wanted to turn into--they wanted to transform the group into--get a front guy for the group.  And--
Speaker 2: So they were were basically--
Speaker 1: They were a small group.
Speaker 2: --just a little group?
Speaker 1: Right, who actually had--when Booker T. and the M.G.'s had gotten bigger, they were the group that was playing on--all of the songs that Booker T. [Booker T. Jones] and them weren't playing on, they would get them, you know.  And once Johnnie Taylor heard The Bar-Kays play, he said, "Well, I want The Bar-Kays to play on my next record."
Speaker 2: Now, let's go back and talk about the dynamic of that.  Now the--Booker T. at Stax, you're saying that Booker T. and the M.G.'s--
Speaker 1: And the M.G.'s--
Speaker 2: --backed up a lot of the musicians?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  They were what they called the house band for--when Rufus Thomas would come in and say, "Well, I'm ready to record my album," they would play.  And they were the, they were the group that played for, you know, just everybody.  Because then, the singers were singers; they didn't have bands.  Stax Records [Memphis, Tennessee] had a house band.
Story_ID: 621983
Speaker 1: Even the relationship in the plane crash--Otis Redding's band was The Bar-Kays?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: He met--if I'm not skipping around too much--Otis came to town to do a show, and Al Bell invited him to this club called the Hippodrome [Memphis, Tennessee].  The Bar-Kays was the band that was playing at the Hippodrome.  The club owner talked to Al--talked to Otis into just doing a number, you know, to treat the fans.  And Otis called out one of his songs, and The Bar-Kays knew the song.  And he was so fascinated that they didn't even miss a beat.  He told Al Bell, who was then the president of Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee], he said, "I got to have these kids."  But they were still in high school getting ready to graduate.  So the story, the short of that long story is he asked them would they be his band.  And he wanted to take them on the road, but their parents told him, "No, they got to graduate first."  So when they graduated, they left and went to New York [New York] to the Apollo Theater with Otis.  And they went on to play with him until that crash came.
Speaker 1: Now, about how many years were they with him?
Speaker 2: Just, just a brief time within that year.  Because within that year, the crash happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they were the band on 'Dock of the Bay' ['(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay'] of course, I guess?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They weren't?
Speaker 2: They didn't record 'Dock of the Bay.'  'Dock of the Bay' was recorded, was written by Otis, but it was recorded with Booker T. and the M.G.'s, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, it's a little different sound, you're right (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. Bar-Kays was the group that was playing with them on his tour.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he just fell in love with them, you know.  And it was short lived, only because of the plane crash.
Story_ID: 621984
Speaker 1: You were also were telling me before we started this interview that The Marquees were basically a combination of The Bar-Kays and--
Speaker 2: Well, they were a horn section.  The Marquees, you know, they were a studio created group, you know.  So it wasn't a band that was called The Marquees, it was just three guys.  And they went on to be The Memphis Horns.  So, but they didn't have a band, so some of the music that the--some of the songs that they made was actually The Bar-Kays being the rhythm section, and they were just the horn players, you know.  But they, but on their label, on their album covers it was just three guys.  They were the horn players, The Marquees.  And The Bar-Kays ended up playing on [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes' stuff.  And The Emotions came to Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee].  Their very first record they made, The Bar-Kays played.  And when The Dramatics came to Stax, we were there.  The first day, Shirley Brown--we were in the recording session, and Albert King brought Shirley and just sort of burst in on our session.  And he came in and he said, "Wait a minute, y'all."  They just burst into our session, we were recording.  "This is Shirley, and I want y'all, I want y'all to meet her," because he was kind of managing her.  And Jim Stewart, who was the president then, he stopped and he--and we were all being just very nice to Albert, because he was Albert King.  We'd never heard of Shirley Brown.  So he asked us to play 'Respect,' so she could audition.  And I'm like, "We're in a session, man."  But we did it, and she sung 'Respect,' and she tore it up.  And then she sang, 'Ain't No Way,' which we knew.  And she got a record deal right there, that day.  I mean, she was incredible.  We hadn't never heard anybody, other than Aretha Franklin, we had never heard anybody sing like that.  So, that was one of the many firsts we saw.  Because we were there when a lot of the entertainers--their first, you know, their first record signings and record label signings, was there while we were there.
Story_ID: 621985
Speaker 1: Just go back to the tail end of high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] again.  You were in high school when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed here in '68 [1968], right?
Speaker 2: I was--yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were like in your last year of high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was a tough time.  I remember martial law and not being able to travel on the streets.  And I remember being caught one day--because I think there came a point when we had to be in the house at five o'clock, or six o'clock, because of the racial tension that was going on, and burning stuff.  I remember being caught by some policemen, and just, you know, being, you know, just--with the sticks, and being beat.  You know, not bad, but they caught us, you know, just being--
Speaker 1: So, you actually got hit?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  They just caught us one evening past curfew.  But it was, that was a tough, tough, tough, tough time, you know.  I remember being downtown seeing that--and then violence and stuff.  Of course, I got away from all of it.  I wasn't a part of it, but I saw it, you know.  It was, it was tough, man.  It was very, very tough.
Story_ID: 621986
Speaker 1: Did you know Ben Branch of the, of Operation Breadbasket band [Operation Breadbasket Orchestra and Choir]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) He's a Memphis [Tennessee] guy, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he's a Memphis guy.  I knew Ben Branch from, he was in the house band at the Paradise Club [Memphis, Tennessee], you know, when I got old enough to go there and sneak in.  And as I said, I was going to clubs younger because I was an entertainer.  And I could sneak in and get to places that normally you wouldn't have--you shouldn't be in, you know, as a young kid.  So I got to see those guys, you know.  I didn't just know him.  Later on as we got bigger, I knew--I got a chance to meet all those guys.  And in our club ventures, we played at all the clubs.  So we would see, meet all those guys, because they sometime were the house bands, and they had to play for whatever entertainment the club had.  So I met some of them through--all of those musicians were good.  Most of those musicians from Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee], or I mean Memphis, most of them couldn't read music, but they were just very sharp guys; I mean just, their most astute player.

Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to ask you about [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes. We're rolling again, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Isaac Hayes.  Now, I know he's older than you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Isaac's a few years older than I am.  But I, you know, my earliest memories of Isaac was when he played with Isaac Hayes and the Doo Dads [Sir Isaac and The Doo Dads], which was, he was the keyboard player.  And they're a small club, the Tiki Club [Memphis, Tennessee], you know, just a club--it held about a hundred people at the most.  And James [James Alexander], my partner, would be the bass player.  And he didn't really have a real band.  It was just--you know, guys just played then.  You know, you may have two guys who were just his regular guys, and the rest would be substitutes.  But Isaac was just an incredibly nice guy, and all the way down--I didn't know him well then, but you know, we were both at Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee].  And Isaac wasn't there a lot, because he was on the road.  He was, of course, just a great big, a huge entertainer, you know, with 'Hot Buttered Soul,' and then he went on to do 'Shaft,' which we were a part of.  He was just a real kind, generous, guy.  And we did get, believe it or not, only one time to really tour with him and a couple of other acts.  But he was the headliner, of course.  And we all traveled on the same tour buses, you know, and stuff.  Of course, he would fly and stuff.  But we didn't work a lot, because we were busy; you know, The Bar-Kays were busy.  We worked a lot, and he did too, but this was just one time that this was a tour in which we were there.  And night after night, man, it was just incredible singing, you know, with him and--how he managed people, you know.  And he had this uncanny ability to talk, and his monologues, long monologues which would probably bore people to death.  But he, it was part of his thing, you know.  And I'll tell you another special talent he had.  He had a talent for picking covers to do, songs that had been record before, "I Stand Accused," "By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "Walk On By," big records for him.  But these were all songs that he--past him, I would say one of the entertainers who had that same level was Luther Vandross.  As great a voice as Luther had, most of his records were remakes, if you just think about.  Some guys have that knack, and he was, Isaac was one, one of the first.  He just had a knack for it, you know, just had a knack for it.  And the combination of The Bar-Kays and Isaac Hayes in the studio was magic.
Speaker 1: Now when you were high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee], though, Isaac Hayes was kind of--well, on a national scene he was lower profile; nobody really--
Speaker 2: Didn't nobody know him.  He just, he was a local guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think until the '70s [1970s], he emerges as a national star.  But we would see his name, and I didn't know who he was.  It would be Cropper, Hayes--
Speaker 2: Steve Cropper, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: Right, he was a songwriter.  He was one of the great songwriter duets, David Porter and Isaac Hayes.  That's really what he--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He and David wrote these incredible records, I mean just hundreds of them, you know.  All the Sam and Dave "Hold On, I'm Comin'," and "Soul Man" and all those great records were just--that's where they were.  And David tried a short solo career.  It didn't really work, but David didn't really--I don't think he really liked--that wasn't--he didn't really yearn to do that, you know.  They sort of talked him into that.  But Isaac, when he got in, he sort of--he liked it, he was good, he was different.  And from that, when he started going to the West Coast he got involved in the movies, and he ended up doing well in that, and kind of got to be accepted as one of the--you know, he was doing very well, very wealthy, and he got into the glitz and glamour part of it.  And I would say that was probably one of the reasons for the beginning of his demise, financially.  Because he was such a kind guy.  He helped everybody, but he didn't watch his finances and his business.  You can get caught up in all that, and your schedule can get so rigid and rugged, and you put a lot of trust in the people around you to handle your funds.  And that can get to be a nightmare sometimes.  And that's what happened to him.  It wasn't because of his lack of popularity; it was just because it just, it got away from him.  And that happens.
Story_ID: 621988
Speaker 1: I was trying to recoup everything back from high school [George Washington Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] before I get you in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in with the mix with The Bar-Kays.  And, but the Memphis [Tennessee]--well, well, oh, I have--I want to ask you this.  What is the relationship between Stax, Stax Records here in Memphis and the Muscle Shoals group?  What's the relationship?
Speaker 2: Stax Records was a hotbed for soul, R and B, and blues music.  There were a bunch of artists, you know, just a bunch of them; The Staple Singers, [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, The Bar-Kays, Johnnie Taylor, Rufus [Rufus Thomas] and Carla Thomas, The Soul Dramatics [sic. The Dramatics], and on and on and on.  Muscle Shoals was a hotbed for another kind of a sound.  There was a certain sound, the Stax sound, which was very identifiable with the Stax artists.  Then there was a Muscle Shoals sound, which was identifiable by the combination of guys who played guitar bass and drums.  We had, they had a sound.  And occasionally people would go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record with those guys.  They weren't, it wasn't as big of a label.  It was more of a, it was more of a studio.  You would go there--it was more known for the studio.  Stax was known for the studio sound and the artists that were there.  They had a big--it was more like Motown [Motown Records], and more like Philadelphia International [Philadelphia International Records].  They had a bunch of big stars.  Muscle Shoals was more noted for--if you wanted to go down there and get with those four guys, or five guys, who were really giving you something special on your record.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those guys, they were the guys that played in 'The Blues Brothers' movie, I think; Donald "Duck" Dunn and Cropper, and those guys.
Speaker 2: Well, actually Donald "Duck" and Cropper and them were from, from the Booker T. and the M.G.'s.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.  They were, Don, Donald "Duck" Dunn and Steve Cropper were the guitar and bass players of Booker T. and the M.G.'s.
Speaker 1: Well, you see I'm confused by it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, it was--but they were hotbeds.  Because then right around the corner from Stax was Hi Records [Memphis, Tennessee], which had the Hodges brothers, which was all the brothers that--one played--Teenie Hodges, who co-wrote 'Tired of Being Alone,' all those big records with Al Green.  And his brother played keyboard [Charles Hodges], and the other played bass [Leroy Hodges].  So they were another, they were Hi Records.  That was the--all of them would, all of the record labels had their own little rhythm section, which was hot.  And they were called the Hi tudio and [sic. Hi Rhythm Section], Hi Records with Al Green and Ann Peebles, 'I Can't Stand the Rain.'  All the--Donald Bryant, all those records were cut, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Headed by Willie Mitchell.  So it was just, so much amazing music.  And we ain't talking about studios that were just far from each other.  They were like right around the corner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Muscle Shoals is Muscle Shoals, Alabama, so that was (unclear) just two hundred miles away.
Story_ID: 621989
Speaker 1: Now when you got with the, The Bar-Kays--well, I've interviewed some pe- some people with Motown [Motown Records], and they talk about how [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy would really try to control or have a considerable amount of influence over the lives of the entertainers; what they would do, how they would--even their manners--how they comport themselves and that sort of thing.  Did, did Stax have a code of conduct, or you know, or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not like Motown.  They, Motown was much more, much more artist oriented.  They were the glitzy, glamour company, you know.  And it was, their profile was to keep you, you know, just suave and debonair, which is cool.  It was very good.  And Stax Records [Memphis, Tennessee] was more of the greens and ham hocks and cornbread kind of a situation.  There was an earthiness there at Stax.  We were more concerned about what was on that record, you know, how it made you feel; how was, how well written the song was, or wasn't.  The lives individually wasn't so much a concern in terms of, we didn't want to make you be a certain kind of a person.  Of course, you know, you want to be a great artist, a good artist, and look well, dress well, and do well.  But it wasn't mandatory, you know.  Most of those artists did what they wanted to do.
Speaker 1: You didn't have an etiquette coach or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  I'll tell you what.  There was a camaraderie there, and a family oriented spirit.  The spirit was there, instilled by Al Bell, and from the top down.  Everybody wanted to, we operated as a family.  When one somebody needed some background, they would just go around and knock on the doors and say, you know, "Johnnie Taylor's over here. Can you go do the, can you do background?"  "Cool, you know."  Or, "James [James Alexander], do you want to play bass?"  Or "Duck's [Donald "Duck" Dunn] gone and Steve Cropper is gone.  Can we get a, can your guitar player come and do a set?"  It was all that going on all the time, all the time.  So, from that perspective, that's how we were; we were more like a family.  But mandatory dressing, and everybody on salaries, and you know, you had to be a certain kind of way--it wasn't like that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So who, who actually ran Stax Records?
Speaker 2: Jim Stewart and Al Bell.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jim Stewart and Al Bell.
Speaker 2: And under that were the producers.  Our manager, Allen Jones [Allen A. Jones, Jr.], was kind of like over A and R [artists and repertoire].  But it was Al Bell and Jim Stewart.  It was Jim Stewart first, and then Al Bell came along and took it over, you know.  And he was more of a music guy, you know, a very smart guy.
Speaker 1: And also, it seems that when you compare the two of them that, you know--well, in fact it was just recently we discovered who some of The Funk Brothers were.  They were the band that played behind most of the Motown acts.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But people, although they may not know all the individuals at Stax--I mean the instrumental--the band was like a big part of Stax.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely.  Because the Stax sound came from the music, and the musicians made the music, you know.  The singers breathed life into the songs that were written by the writers.  But from the musical side, you could always tell when there was a Stax record, because it was the same musicians playing it, and there was just a certain magic.  You could always tell a Motown record.  There were certain characteristics of the music because of those incredible musicians who played and did stuff a certain way. [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and all those great writers wrote great songs.  And when we start talking about The Temptations, The Supremes, and all those others--the Four Tops, and the incredible artists--you know, there was a distinct difference.  But the, the level was high, the bar was high at both studios.  What we did here over at Stax was good.  It was the top of it what it was. Then what Motown did was at the top of what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was always a rivalry there too, you know.
Story_ID: 621990
Speaker 1: You got, joined The Bar-Kays in 1970--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right? Okay.  And, so what were they like--I know the group never ended or died out.  But at the same time, there had to be some rebuilding I guess, right?
Speaker 2: After the plane crash, James and Ben, who survived the crash--Ben survived and actually went down with the plane.  James was on a flight--because he just--the plane wouldn't hold but a few people.
Speaker 1: That's James Alexander?
Speaker 2: James Alexander.  And he was--
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: Ben Cauley went down with the flight and survived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: James, it was just his to turn the rental cars in and take a commercial flight.  And it was just God's will for that not to happen.  But they re-formed quickly.  And I was one of the first ones to--they were still an instrumental group.  In 19--April of 1970 I joined, and from that point they were really in the process of recruiting songs for the lead singer, whoever that guy was going to be.  So I jumped right into it, and we went on to do five or six more albums there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your first, you know, lead singing song?
Speaker 2: The first song--
Speaker 1: The song that you--
Speaker 2: The first song I remember being on was a song called "Sang and Dance," which ended up being sampled by Will Smith in "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It."  And that was the first breath I breathed on a Bar-Kay record, and it wasn't--we were with some background singers.  Well, it didn't call for a lead singer.  They were very cautious with me at first, you know.  And then the next record was 'Black Rock,' which I was the singer of all those songs at that point.  Those were just--we wrote the songs--well, we got the songs.  And that was a really incredible album.  It was one of the best albums we had ever done.  We're now working on our thirtieth album.  But that was the, 'Black Rock' was the first record that I sang all the leads on.  That was my starting point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 621991
Speaker 1: Now, you, you were with The Bar-Kays when that incredible movie was made, 'Wattstax,' right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: That's 1973, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], yeah, yeah.  It was, it was incredible, you know.  It was right after the Watts riots, and it was Al Bell's idea to--he just talked to all the artists at Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee] and said, "Let's go out and do something."  It was something visionary, a vision of his.  I think it only cost two dollars to get into the concert, and it was delivered so that everybody could come.  It was the biggest audience we've ever played for.  When we went on stage at whatever time that was, it was a hundred thousand people.  And let me just tell you.  This is something that people don't know.  We had originally planned--because The Bar-Keys are show business people.  We were like always known for our outlandish garbs and wardrobes and antics, and things that would--just things that would happen at our concerts, because it was very elaborate, you know.  But we had rented a white chariot, white horses.  I was to ride--because we were all in white.  If you remember, we were all dressed in white; different outfits, but it was all white.
Speaker 1: And the giant Afros, the white Afro?
Speaker 2: That was the horn player.  That was one of the horn players, Harvey [Harvey Henderson], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had went to MGM [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.; Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios Inc.], because our manager [Allen A. Jones, Jr.] was a show business guy.  He said, "We're going to take--we're going to--we're just going to totally take this movie over."  And we were to ride in on white horses, and the rest of the band would be in the chariot with the white horses.  Isaac [HistoryMaker Isaac Hayes] found out about that; some kind of way, it got to him.  We'd gotten, we'd gotten everything from MGM; rented it and everything, done everything.  And he found out about it, and he said, "No way.  You know, you're not going to upstage us like that."
Speaker 1: You're not going to upstage with the chains and all of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because see, that was, Isaac kind of got the idea of the chains and the leotards from us; that's how we used to dress.  We were always--at Stax we were always the wild outlandish group that was always doing the music that they didn't think fit, you know, the format of Stax.  'Cause we were, we were doing funky stuff and rock.  Rock mixed rock with funk, and just experimented with all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 621992
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I, I got--my impression from those days, just being a consumer listening to it, was that Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee] was, was still kind of wedded to the blues on some level. Or you know, it was not--I mean, you're right, The Bar-Kays seemed to be the funkiest--
Speaker 2: We were.  We were absolutely the funkiest, to the left kind of thing that was at Stax.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because we weren't doing just the typical R and B stuff.  We were mixing it up with rock overtones.  You know, we would listen to that stuff, and we were carefully trying to mix what was in our hearts with what we liked to do.  And our stage show was wild, and it wasn't toned down at all.  And we rarely did ballads.  You know, basically it was up stuff, you know.  So, it was quite different.  They didn't quite believe in it, and they didn't push a whole lot.  It was only until--you know, Stax closed, which was in 1975, when the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] just closed the doors and they went bankrupt, and we were still the last ones to leave.  We went to, our manager [Allen A. Jones, Jr.] told us, he said, "If you guys break up, it's going to be, it's going to be senseless.  Why don't you stay together?  Why don't you find you a place to play where you can stay together?"  And we did.  We played at a place, we found us a club called the Family Affair Club.  We played, and we played there for three or four nights a week.
Speaker 1: Is that here in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: It's here in Memphis.  And it's closed now.  And we wrote, during that time we wrote and played at night and wrote songs in the daytime.  And we wrote songs like "Shake Your Rump to the Funk."  And in '76 [1976] we got a deal with, a very good deal with Mercury Records.  And my manager was there, and he was absolutely correct.  Had we not stayed together and played night after night after night, you know, for little or no money, we, who knows what would have happened?  But we never broke up you, you know.  There have been periods when certain guys were gone, but we never stopped in the whole time that we've been together, since 1970, since I've been in the band.
Speaker 1: How many gold records have you all had since then?
Speaker 2: Six gold records, and we've had one platinum record which was associated with 'Breakin'' the movie, 'Breakin''--"Freakshow" ["Freakshow on the Dancefloor"] was on that album ['Dangerous'].  We had a platinum album with that. We've had six gold albums.
Story_ID: 621993
Speaker 1: Now, you write some of the music as well, right?
Speaker 2: I'm part of the writing team that has been there, you know, since the early '70s [1970s].  Basically when I got in the group, we were still doing some cover songs on the albums, you know, and we hadn't developed into just good writers.  Allen helped us with that along the way.  And eventually we started--you know, he put us in a room, and we'd have to go there at ten o'clock in the morning and we couldn't come out until we wrote a song, or started writing it, or finished writing it.  And that was every day.  And Allen was a very good writer.  He wrote--
Speaker 1: Is this Allen--?
Speaker 2: Allen Jones [Allen A. Jones, Jr.], our manager and producer.  And he instilled in us the qualities that make good songs, because there's a method to that madness, too, you know.  And we eventually did--and once we got into it, you know, Winston Stewart, Harvey Henderson and myself, we were the nucleus of that writing team.  We wrote--man, we did eleven albums with Mercury [Mercury Records].  And out of those, six of those were gold.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite song that you've written?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, one of my favorite songs is a record called 'I Lean on You, You Lean on Me.'  It was never a single.  It was just a great, great, song that--it said a lot; it just said a lot.  I'm a songwriter, so you know, like most songwriters, probably their biggest record is not their favorite record.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's just those records that are, have a certain place in our heart.  Or, some songs are just really pinned really well.  They say a lot, and they're not often songs that people gravitate to.  But there are songs that mean a lot to me as a writer.
Speaker 1: Can you sing a little bit of that for us?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "We've come a long way, you and I.  And there were times, oh, that we thought that we wasn't going to make it.  Oh, but we thought too long, and now we made it.  I lean on you, you lean on me.  That's the way love's supposed to be."  That's a little bit of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you can see why I--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's sort of.  I sort of--the, the song sort of touches my marriage, because I've been married for thirty-nine years [to Marie Dodson].  And like my mother [Lois Thomas Dodson] and father [Otis Dodson III], I always knew I was going to be married only one time.  And through the ups and downs of our musical career and the ups and downs of life--because all of it hasn't been just really, really good.  We had some really incredible years, you know, just where we were really gone, you know, five or six days a week.  We would come home, drop the money off, and get back on the bus and go back.  And it was really, really, really good years.  And then there were some years that things weren't well, you know, and it took some really reaching down into, into each other, you know, and really just--
Story_ID: 621994
Speaker 1: Because of the respect James [James Alexander] and I have for each other as still being the members who really are still now in the band [The Bar-Kays], we've been able to overcome a lot of things, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, James is the original bass player?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, right, right.  In 2003, he had a label called JEA Records, and I had a record label called Right Now Records, while we were still in the group together.  So we merged those two [into JEA Right Now Records], and then we've been putting out music since then.  Just like we--it's R and B music, and three years ago we started a gospel label, which is Testimony Records [Memphis, Tennessee].  And that's been a great ministry for us, you know.  We've gone, we've been in the business forty years.  You know, you get to do and see a lot of things change.  And only a few groups have been able to stay and make a living, a comfortable living at it.  We still make music.  We still put records out, you know.  Our record now is number thirty-five in the nation, you know.  So, we're one of the few that still do that, you know.  But it's, it's really, really, really a blessing.
Story_ID: 621995
Speaker 1: In terms of business, is most of your income made touring, or through record sales?
Speaker 2: Touring, touring, no doubt about it.  You know, the record business is horrible, you know, as far as selling records.   There's just too many ways to get free music now.  That's just, the template for that is just different now.  So, basically--of course, you still put music out to sell it, and you hope that you do.  But basically you try to stay popular in and out of the United States, and where you can do well.  We do--I do nothing else.  I take that back.  Since 1999, I started a booking agency, my wife and I and my son.  So we book other acts, I mean big and small acts.  We're very well known in the business, LaMarie's Entertainment [LaMarie's Entertainment Complex].
Speaker 1: What's it called again?
Speaker 2: LaMarie's Entertainment.  The L-A is for me, and my wife is Marie [Marie Dodson].  And my son is Larry too; he's Larry, Jr. [Larry Dodson, Jr.].  So, we share that.  We've done real well with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, what percentage of your income comes from touring in other countries, would you say?
Speaker 2: Very little, you know, very little.  And that's going to change in the years to come, because we're bearing down on our international approach to what we're doing.  Since we're out there still doing concerts, we have a lot of parts of Europe and the U.K. [United Kingdom] that we haven't been to, that we will be going to starting this fall.  And we're going to make it a part of our, we're going to incorporate it more.  We go to, we go to the East, but there's a lot of parts of the world we just haven't been to that we're going to be going to.  So we're basically the U.S., that's the biggest part of our income.
Speaker 1: Didn't you all have--well, weren't you touring in Japan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we go there, once maybe every three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's not, we don't go there and stay a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we do go there, you know, to Japan, Korea.  But we're going to be going to the U.K.  We're going to really have a whole another marketing plan for The Bar-Kays now that incorporates the U.K., Europe, and other parts of the world.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the U.K. seems to be really, you know, excited about--
Speaker 2: Soul music, yeah, absolutely; with the resurgence of that, right.  And see, we have two or three different things.  You know, we tour, The Bar-Kays, with our funk show which is pretty cool.  But we also have another show that we just put together.  It's called The Bar-Kays soul to soul revue, which actually is, it's geared for casinos in Europe.  Because basically the only thing we play for The Bar-Kays is 'Son of Shaft' and 'Soul Finger.'  The rest of it is 'Knock on Wood,' 'Soul Man.'  It's all that wonderful music of Stax [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee], and we do a tribute to [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, which are the songs we played with him, and the songs that we played with Otis [Otis Redding], and attribute to him.  And it has a video montage that goes with it.  And we do it with, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] garb.  And it's very well rehearsed, with a voiceover.  And as we play the songs, you see the artists and you see us intermingling with them on the live sessions.  And it takes you down that path, and it shows you the association The Bar-Kays had with all this great music, you know.  And it's just a night--it's some incredible, incredible music.  But from The Bar-Kays as we know it now, it has virtually nothing to do with that.  It's just our interaction with all of that music, and we do it really, really well.  You know, it's, it's really, really good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I have to say that it's, the audience for it is more white than it is bla- African American.
Story_ID: 621996
Speaker 1: Yeah, there seems to be a, a trend now.  'Cause I was being told by some of the office staff, two young white ladies, that that's the latest thing in 2010, as we speak; soul parties, you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's incredible, isn't it?
Speaker 1: --in, in a lot of white communities, you know, young college graduates and that sort of thing.  They go to a lot of soul parties.
Speaker 2: It's a resurgence of the good stuff, man.  We call it the good stuff, you know, the songs that when you listen to them it reminds you of when you first met your girlfriend, or you first met your wife, or your high school days.  It's like the video goes off in your mind.  Because they're great songs, you know, and its music from the soul, and it doesn't have a color on it, you know.  It's, it's just that--and things move around, you know.  There were guys who used to tell me, they said as far as clothes--pants are going to get shorter or they get longer; they get wider or they get tighter.  But they're still pants, you know.  It's only so many ways and so many things you can do with them, you know.  And if you move around, if you stay around, you'll see them get longer, shorter, tighter, wider.  But it'll come back around.  And that's what's going on now.  You know, those of us who remember those songs, we yearn for them now.  Our hearts yearn to hear them again.  And radio has sort of turned us away from it, because they don't play much of it.  So, we're searching for it now.  And the kids are searching for it, because they're hearing it by way of the rap artists, who have taken it and underlined their raps with it.  And they're saying, "Well, whose music is that?"  And I'm saying, "Well, that's not Jay Z's, you know, song.  That's his lyric, but that's not his music.  That's the, you know, thus and so, whoever it is."  And that interest is just filtered to the kids now.   So, and they're liking what they hear, and they want to know more about it.  And so, with the Internet here, they're able to find us. Say, "Oh, my god, this guy did this.  I didn't know he did this."  And they're--now they're associated, and they're looking there and, and really interested, and really loving it.

Speaker 1: Yeah, we had, during the break we had mentioned Wilson Pickett for a second.  But he was a big part of the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you know, some of those great incredible records, 'Midnight Hour' ['In the Midnight Hour'].  And he was, he was show business.  I mean he was a stern, stern, show business, bad tempered guy, you know.  He just, he was just one of those guys that just--you really had to stretch to get to know him and to get to like him.  He wasn't a bad guy, but he just was high strung.
Speaker 1: A lot of ego, huh?
Speaker 2: A lot of ego, a lot of ego, you know.  And I'm going to tell you something.  That was one thing about Stax [Stax Records], you know.  A lot of guys, when they started doing real well, there was this big competition there.  Who's got the biggest car?  Who's got the biggest house, you know?  It was friendly to a point, but then it got to be, you know, it got to be serious with some of the guys, you know.   Wilson was a great singer, but he was just hard to get along with, man.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--now, I first heard this on a Cincinnati [Ohio] radio station.  There was a piece produced at a certain point where all the Stax stars were in this one song, or a lot of them.  And they would all sang a verse or something.  And this was the first time I'd ever heard that before, that kind of thing before.  It was about 1967 or '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I can't say that I remember that.
Speaker 1: It sounded, the beat sounded something like the 'Land of 1000 Dances' or something.  But they were like, Otis Redding had something to say and Wilson Pickett had something to say, you know.  It was a lot of them in it.
Speaker 2: It's probably something that I just don't remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I have to say, Stax was a family, man, you know.  And that stuff wasn't unusual, you know, for guys to do stuff on each other's record, yeah.
Story_ID: 621998
Speaker 1: And you know, during that time, you know, I got married.  I joined The Bar-Kays in 1970 in April, and I married in August of that same year.  So-
Speaker 2: Now that's, now this is a story.  Now, you mentioned your wife several times now.  But I've heard a lot of stories about people who break up after the person starts touring, and you know, and that's like the biggest threat to their marriage.  But you managed to be married all this time.  And--
Speaker 1: And I married an incredible woman, Marie [Marie Dodson], who at one point I met, worked at Stax [Stax Records], you know, for a brief moment.  She's into law, and she knew absolutely nothing about The Bar-Kays, I mean even when we were sort of popular.  She was like--and it was very cool, because it never got in the way.  She's like, "Is that your record," you know.  "Yeah, it's number three or four in the--."  "Okay."  You know, so it's kind of cool, you know.  And, you know, we've been married, and we're business partners now.  And we're just a success story, you know.  And she's just been incredible throughout it all, very encouraging.  And she learned a lot about the business once she got to, you know, found out there wasn't no choice, you know, I guess.  She learned a lot about the business, and helps me to make, you know, good rational decisions in things that are really very important now.  Because The Bar-Kays are uniquely, are unique in the fact that we still own a lot of our publishing.  We still do quite well.  So there're a lot of legal things that we have to do, like groups who have been around as long as we have.  And there's a lot of money there on the table and different things, you know, in, in, in movies and stuff like that.  So, from time to time, there are some very big decisions we have to make.
Story_ID: 621999
Speaker 1: Have you ever been challenged, in terms of the name Bar-Kays? Who (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we never, never, never had that problem, you know.  And over the past few years, you know, movies like 'Superbad' and 'Kickin' it Old Skool' and 'Head of State,' have used a lot of our music.  TV uses a lot of it, and those things helped to, you know, kept our bottom line.  You know, when you've been around, like I say, as long we have, you know, we're still reinventing ourselves.  We're still, you know, putting music out.  Our gospel label, Testimony Records [Memphis, Tennessee], is a very, very, serious part of what we do now, and we understand that's a ministry.  And we know we're very serious about that, you know.  We're much older now, and I'd like to think we're a lot wiser now.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the artists on the gospel record?
Speaker 2: We have a group now called Perfection, a young, real anointed group, just very talented.  Two of the kids are--well, they're not kids.  Two of the guys are ministers.  But they're a young group, I mean very, very, talented.  Billy Rivers and the Angelic Voices of Faith, my youngest brother, Michael Dodson, is the director of that choir.  They are a really well known choir.  They were in 'The Great Debater' movie ['The Great Debaters'].  They did three songs in that movie.  So they're very, very, well known nationally and internationally.  And we would get other honors, you know.  We've only, they've only had the label three years.  And those were two good signings that we did, so we spent a lot of time with them.  But, and then Billy Rivers and the Angelic Voices of Faith are now going to another label.  There's nothing wrong.  It's just, you know, things like that transpire, you know.  So we're, we're diversifying, and you know, we have our sleeves rolled up in this tough business.  Like I said, our current record is number thirty-five under adult contemporary, on Billboard.  So we still, we're a group now that the older groups are looking through the crack in the door to see how much success we're going to have, to see if there's a chance for them in fact to still do that.  And, you know, I'm very encouraged by guys like Charlie Wilson, who's having just a great career, and Ron Isley [Ronald Isley], who, you know, has been in the business longer than we have.
Speaker 1: He's never really stopped making music.
Speaker 2: Never, absolutely, you know.  So, you know, it's not impossible.  Is it tough?  Yes.  You know, does it require a lot of know how?  James Alexander, my partner, is just, he's one of the great minds of this music industry.  He does independent promotion, and has for the last fifteen years.  He's maybe one of the top five guys who does that.  That's sort of his other profession.  So, it helps us, you know.  He's a guy who's been around and seen things.  And all of this history that we have and this knowledge that we have helps us to reinvent ourselves, and we like to do it, we still like to do it.  We're not like a lot of artists who got to the point where they just hate to work.  This is what we do, so we still love to tour.  We have a great band, a great organization [JEA Right Now Records], you know.  I'm able to bring my son [Larry Dodson, Jr.] into my business, who helps my day to day stuff, you know.  He works for the band, you know, handles wardrobe.  And my wife [Marie Dodson] and I, we run the booking agency [LaMarie's Entertainment Complex].  And my son does that as well.  He runs the hip hop division of that.  So it's very interesting, you know.  Just, and our, our biggest thing now is just to stay healthy and, you know, stay focused.
Story_ID: 622000
Speaker 1: You were saying when I came in, and I, I mulled it over in my mind some too.  We were talking about the, the message of music, and, and what's enduring and what isn't.  We were talking about [HistoryMaker] Kenny Gamble, the kind of music he makes.  And you were talking about the kind of, your advice to a lot of the young musicians, to try to make something that's going to stay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, yeah, just to try to stay away from shallow music, you know, because shallow music is just that.  It's not, it's not going to do anything but box you in.  It's not going to help you in your quest for generational wealth, which is basically wealth that you can pass down to your kids through, by way of song royalties.  You know, one thing about the music that not only--you take the music of The O'Jays, and the great songs of Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff], and David Porter, [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, and I mean, all the great songwriters, both black and white.  You know, that music will always make money.  And though you do it for the craft, you do want to make sure that your family's taken care of, you know, and that you're writing music that's going to be redone and re-sang again.  And I just, I'm very, you know, nervous about the mentality of some of the kids now who, they want to make what I call flavor of the day music; music that as soon as, in three months it's not popular anymore, it has no revenue stream.  It's not going to be re-recorded, it's not going to be used for anything, and it's wasted, you know.  And I just encourage, I encourage all the young kids on our label, you know, as you hang around us, pick up some of the--you know, everybody doesn't have that talent, but try.  You know, try to write songs of true love; songs of true substance that, you know, spark the mind, spark the heart.  Because those songs will last.  You'll always do well when they happen, you know.  Not all of your records are going to be hits, but just strive to do--and write those kind of songs.  Emulate [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, you know.  Smokey's written so many great songs, you know.  But those are real songs, you know, and those songs will all--his kids' kids will be making money (laughter) from those songs.  And I don't want to make it seem like you do it all for money, but you do it.  Because when you do things well, God's going to bless you with it.  You know, I guess that's, that was the root of our conversation earlier.  And I'm concerned about that, you know, with the younger kids, you know, they get it twisted.  You know, you want to make sure with your career that you do things, and that you're out there representing the right things so that, you know, when you're not able to do this, you're able to maybe do something behind the scenes that's still associated with something that's going to take care of you.
Story_ID: 622001
Speaker 1: Coming out of a generation where there were so many great musicians, and, and we talked about the, now, talked, well, there're musicians, as you said, at the Stax studio [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee] that a lot of the guys couldn't read music, but they were expert musicians.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are you concerned about the stream of people that actually play instruments nowadays?  It seems like it's--
Speaker 2: It's a big concern, it's a big concern.  And that's what disco did.  You know, disco was a craze that just drove musicians totally off the map, because it was an era where you were able to have a hit record and not have a band, you know.  And so behind that came rap music, which didn't have anything to do with music.  It was--you know, and not downgrading any of it, but those eras made the younger artists--, "Where am I going to learn to play, you know?  Why should I, you know?  Ain't nobody, the guy ain't going to hire me because the deejay's playing, you know."  When rap music came about, "Why am I, why should I learn to play guitar?  Where am I going to play?"  You know, this guy ain't going to use me.  He's a rapper, and it doesn't require music.  He's got his, he's got his deejay.  So you see where, you know, there's been a lot of deterrents for kids to not want to learn how to play music or play instruments, and not even emulate what they hear, you know, from earlier records.  So, that's a big concern.  And all the old heads are now telling--you know, when they're out, you know, doing lectures--and, and just from the kids around--they, they're encouraging them to pick up something, learn how to play something, learn the keyboards.  You know, just--I taught myself kind of enough to play.
Story_ID: 622002
Speaker 1: And I just finished a great project called 'A Message from Memphis' ['A Message from Memphis: A Healing Song for Haiti'].  I was watching TV one Sunday getting ready to go to church, and I saw Kirk Franklin talking about how he was inspired to do his music, his song for Haiti, ['Are You Listening: A Love Song for Haiti'] and God just put it in my spirit just to do something like that.  So I got, I came to my piano, and I told my wife [Marie Dodson] "I want to do something like that."  And I just starting calling all the artists in Memphis [Tennessee], and I ended up with forty-five artists all from Memphis.  Kirk Whalum, The Bar-Kays, Jay Blackford [ph.], you name it, man.  I had five ministers on the record, two mass choirs, over a hundred people.  And I wanted to donate all the music to, all the proceeds to Haiti.  So, I made a deal with the city.  I said, "I want you guys to keep the money here in the city in a fund.  And at such time as we get such and such amount, we'll take it there."  And I met since then--when I met with the mayor from Haiti they brought a delegation, and I learned a lot about the catastrophe there, more about it, and learned more about how we wanted to channel the proceeds, which all the studios were donated.  We did a documentary.  We documented everything.  It's a 'We Are the World' kind of record; a great, great, record with an hour and a half documentary with how we did it, how we made it, the making of it and all that.  But I met with the mayor of Haiti, and I understood more of how we could help.  And they had a lot of land that they wanted to donate, and you just bring the money and you could start the thing.  It's like you plant the seed and you watch it grow, rather than just throwing into the wind these other organizations and it not ever getting to where it's going.  So I knew it was blessed, because I had, nobody gave me any problems.  We got the whole thing done in six weeks.
Story_ID: 622003
Speaker 1: That leads us to a question we always ask.  And this is like final three questions, basically.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: One of my concerns is that--the absence of the trust in God.  That's a big concern, because there are a lot of things to get worried about.  But I'm a man of faith, and there is, there are a lot of deterrents to keep us, as African Americans, from believing that things can be different, be better; that they're controlled by another power that's greater than us, one which is a power of hope, and can--and, and through faith, change can come about.  There's, for me, I just think that we sometimes grab onto only things we can see, which can be bad, because sometimes you don't see anything.  You see no reason for hope, you know.  That's one of my concerns.
Story_ID: 622004
Speaker 1: Also, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could back and redo it?
Speaker 2: I wasted a lot of years in foolishness.  (Laughter) There're year- there are some years, you know, where you, you take a lot of weird turns in your life, you know, through drugs and then alcohol abuse, and those things which take you off the path.  If I could redo those years, I would.  I made a lot of good music, and I made a difference, you know.  I, we, and when I look--and I Googled myself and looked on the Internet to--something I never did, you know.  Somebody told me, they said, "Have you ever looked to see how many records you've actually done?  How many songs you've done?"  I'd never done it, never, ever.  He said, "Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Dodson], you have over a hundred and fifty songs that you penned.  A lot of them are very, very good, and have been very successful."  So, I never, you know, I never thought about it.  But I--yeah, there's, there's some years, there's some years, as all of us have.  There're a few, you know.  All musicians have, most of us have a few years we just wish we could really redo.
Story_ID: 622005
Speaker 1: I think you somewhat answered this.  But what, what today would you consider, when you look back over all that, all these years, would be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My integrity, you know.  And I'm not, you know, I don't, I'm not boastful of that.  But I've tried to conduct my musical career with--even through, even when it wasn't really good, you know, with a great amount of integrity.  And that's why I feel that's one of the reasons why we've been able to work, even when we didn't have records, you know.  People knew that we were going to give them a great show, and there wasn't going to be a lot of foolishness.  It was, you could depend on--when you spend twenty-five, or thirty, or forty or fifty dollars to go see The Bar-Kays, you're not going to waste your money, you know.  Whether they have a new record out or not, you know, you're going to see a powerful show.  It's going to be, we're gonna   have a good time, and it's gonna be, it's gonna make you laugh, and you're going to have a good memory from it.  And that's what we do as entertainers.  We want to leave a lot of good memories, you know.
Story_ID: 622006
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your parents [Lois Thomas Dodson and Otis Dodson III] have passed away.  Now, and, and you mentioned your wife [Marie Dodson] and your son [Larry Dodson, Jr.].  Now, do you have any other children?  Or--
Speaker 2: My, yeah, my daughter.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my daughter, who has Downs syndrome [Down syndrome].  And it's, she's a success story, you know.  When she was born, she--early on, she, the doctors at that point didn't think she was going to live past her teens.  She's thirty-eight, and she's been working for fifteen or sixteen years.  And she's just, she's just a success story.  And another reason why I tell you that, is when things would look bad and the doctors say, "No, and this is not going to happen.  The chances are--."  God has another plan, you know.  And we've learned, even though we didn't understand it when she was born--she was my first kid.  And, but her name is Precious [Precious Dodson], and that's exactly what she is.  She's a, she's a, she's a hoot.
Story_ID: 622007
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: We've touched on a lot of, we've touched on everything, you know, old and what I'm doing now.  So, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, well did your--I didn't ask you if your parents got a chance to see you become successful.  You said your father [Otis Dodson III] used to tell you that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they did.  Let me tell you, man.  My dad was my biggest fan.  When I got, when he got to have bragging rights about his son, that's what he did.  I mean, he had every picture, every album.  They came to all the concerts.  They were really very, very proud, Mom [Lois Thomas Dodson] and Dad.  You know, and before they both got sick, you know, we were doing really good, and I said I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that.  And they would even come to some of the parties that we'd have at the house, you know, because there wasn't anything going on that they couldn't see.  But they were very proud, man.  They were really, really, very proud.  Because Mom worked until very late in her life, you know.  She contracted cancer, ovarian cancer.  And at that time, my dad had Alzheimer's, but he never knew, because of his condition.  He never--when she got sick, stricken with cancer, he never knew it.  Because if you understand what I was telling you about my parents, they were like, just joined to the hip.  So he, God spared him of never knowing.  Because had he known that she was dying, I think it would have broken his heart.  But he never knew that.  He knew she was sick, but he never knew she was ill to that point.  And Mom sort of took care of Dad, and I took care of them both.  And then shortly after that my grandmother took ill, and I took care of her as well.  So, I've been the gatekeeper, you know.  And it's been, it's true.  I never experienced anybody dying in my family that was close to me like that.  You know, my distant--I had distant uncles and stuff, but when it comes to Mom and Dad, that's different, you know, especially when you have to kind of be there during it, you know.  And I was there when Mom went into remission, and I moved into the house and stayed there until the day she passed.  And I mean it was like just a terrible situation, because she was very sick.  And the last thirty days of her life, she didn't eat anything.  She was like sixty something pounds when she died.  And it was tough, it was tough.  But, you know, it made me a stronger person, you know, I mean because I had to take care of Dad. Because like I say, he was fortunate.  He would always say--I would come into the house and, you know, for anybody who knows an Alzheimer's patient, they make up some of the wildest stories.  So, I would come in the house and say, "How's Mom doing?"  "She's doing fine, but you know she's pregnant, though."  (Laughter) So I said, "She's what?"  He said, "Oh, yeah, she's pregnant.  She's back there."  So I said, bless his heart.  God has a way of just--because he never knew she was ill.  So, it was all very--you know it, it was a challenge, but I got through it, and I'm a better person because of it.  And I, I, I didn't think I could just, was strong enough to go through all of that, but we got through it.
Story_ID: 622008
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, h- how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a kind, God fearing gentleman.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Who wrote a lot of good songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.

Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father and one of the former mayors of Memphis.  And he autographed it to my dad, because my dad was, he was a probation officer, a volunteer probation officer.  He got no money for it.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That picture is a picture of The Bar-Kays.  From left to right Vernon Burch, Harvey Henderson, James Alexander, Winston Stewart, Charles Allen, and myself at the bottom.  That was at the premiere of 'Wattstax' in 1973 in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].

Speaker 1: That's a picture of me.  And I used snakes in my act.  And this was, I don't know what city it was, but that was one of my largest snakes.  I only used them in the last five minutes of the show, every show (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.

That was the first gold album at Madison Square Garden [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Which one is Allen?
Speaker 1: This is Allen Jones at the very right, the bottom.  He only took maybe three pictures in our whole career, and that was one we talked him into.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: And this is another picture of the group that we used as a publicity picture for--that's the original, one of the re-formed group.  That was the group--this group of guys was the group that played on most of the records in the '70s [1970s].
