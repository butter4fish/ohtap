 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, October 29,  2013. I   m interviewing Choctaw bead artist Carol Pate for the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at OSU. We   re at Tribes 131, a gallery in  Norman that handles Carol   s work. Carol, you started beading seriously  around 1996. Since then, you   ve garnered a number of awards at Gallup  Ceremonial, Red Earth Festival, Santa Fe Indian Market, a lot of times  for beaded cultural items that you had never tried before. I suspect there  are lots of awards yet to come. Thank you for taking the time to talk with  me.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Talihina, Oklahoma, and I grew up in Oklahoma City.  I think I read that when you were really young, you were raised by your  grandmother.  Yes, until I think I was like four or five. I think it was five.  What are your memories of her?  I remember her cooking a lot. Not really much of anything else.  Not necessarily any handiwork or sewing or anything.  No.  So how did you end up in Oklahoma City?  5  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  I lived in a Baptist children   s home, Goodland, in Talihina. A family, I  guess he used to work bringing   what do you call it? He drove a truck,  and it brought the food products and stuff to the home. At the time, I was  the youngest one. There was, like, three of us that were pretty young. He  would bring us up here to this church. We could go up here to church  and stay with some of the people that went to the church. We would do  that periodically, and I ended up staying with a family that decided to  adopt me. I   ve been here since then.  And you had lost your grandma, I guess.  Right. She passed   I think I was five when she passed away.  So what is your first memory of seeing Native art?  The family that adopted me had taken me to an art show that had Native  American stuff. It was probably Red Earth because I remember it was  downtown. It may have been the   .  You were how old?  About nine.  What were your thoughts or impressions?  I didn   t think any different of the people. I just really liked the artwork. I  loved artwork. I wasn   t good in art, but   . (Laughter)  We   re going to talk about that. What is your first memory of doing art?  I think I was about ten, and they had a show at school that I had made  some beadwork, the hair ties. I made hair ties and won First Place on  those. That was the first time I   d ever done anything like that.  Oh my goodness, so you actually had learned to bead by that age a little  bit. How did you learn?  It was on my own. I loved to do sewing and little crafts and stuff here  and there.  The family that adopted you, nobody did beadwork there, but you had  just requested materials, or how did that     I think I remember going to a class at Sunday school, so I think I may  have learned it in church.  6  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  And then they kept you supplied with your materials.  Yeah.  That   s really neat. What other experiences did you have in elementary  school with art or beading?  I don   t remember beading a whole lot.  I guess that was middle school.  I think I remember more of me not being good in art at school. (Laughs)  I had the hardest time in art.  What was that due to, do you think?  Probably not paying attention. I don   t know. (Laughter)  Do you remember any art experiences from, like, middle school or high  school?  No, I don   t think I did much art in that time. I would do, like,  needlepoint stuff. I did stuff like that, but that   s about all.  Did your adoptive mom do some needlepoint?  No, her mother did.  Her mother did. You got some encouragement from that.  Right.  What did you do after high school?  After high school, I got married and had kids. (Laughs)  How did you meet your husband, Rick?  Actually, I was friends with Leslie, the owner of the gallery. It   s her  brother.  How did you two meet?  We met in middle school, so we   ve known each other a long time.  That   s how I met them.  7  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  What triggered your desire to start beading more seriously?  I think being pregnant and not having much to do helped a lot.  (Laughter)  So it was your first daughter. You had some time on your hands.  Right. I didn   t do much. I tried several different things toward art. I did  some painting, a little bit, not much.  On your own.  Right, and didn   t figure I could do that. (Laughs) That   s when Hannah   Pate  worked for Doris Littrell. We would go up there to the shows, and  there were several dolls she had that I loved that were beaded. I guess  that   s what started that.  I was thinking that having that regular exposure first to Doris    gallery     Right.  When did you get with Patricia? Patricia Mousetail Russell, I guess,  first showed you peyote stitch.  Delores Pratt, she   s the one that showed me. We   d gone to Red Earth a  few times, and she worked, also, with Doris Littrell. We   d gone to Red  Earth with her a few times. We were talking about beading, and she was  the one who told me that I should start beading, that if I liked  needlepoint, it would be something like that. Not too long after that is  when Patricia had (what do you call it, at the Jacobson House) her  workshop. That   s when I went over there and learned the peyote stitch.  So this was a workshop that Patricia was giving. Did your mother-in-law  have her gallery already? Was it at the gallery?  She had her gallery already, but it was at the Jacobson House that I went  to. The way we got those together is we belonged to the AICS at that  time, and she was one of the members. We would periodically go over  there and do some of the workshops that they had.  Right. And AICS stands for     American Indian Cultural Society.  Right. So what did you guys work on during the workshop?  8  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  She taught us how to do bolo ties, the ends of the bolo ties. You do the  peyote stitch, which is anything round. That   s what I learned from her.  Opens up a lot of possibilities. Had you been doing any beaded items for  the gallery on Main Street yet?  Yes.  You had. What kinds of things had you done?  Probably small. I did a lot of little turtle fetishes like you were talking  about. I did a lot of those and some moccasins. Just small things like  that.  I remember those beaded little fetishes and how miniature they were. Do  you like miniature work, and what do you like about it?  It   s something you can start and finish within a few hours, (Laughs)  unlike a dress or something like that.  Right, right. (Laughter) So when you   re pregnant, that   s a good     Right. (Laughter)  They   re really mesmerizing, those little fetishes. What was the first sort  of big item that you made after Patricia   s workshop?  Again, Delores had taken me to Red Earth. We were going through, and  there was this couple that had these little boxes that were all beaded. I  asked to see one, and they wouldn   t let me hold it or look at it. (Laughs)  So when we were leaving, I thought,    Well, I can probably do that since  Patricia showed me how to do the peyote stitch.    I went home, and I did  two of them. Delores sent them to (where did she send them) Gallup. I  won First Place on one and Second Place on the other one.  She entered them for you? Wow.  That   s where I kind of     So glad you mentioned that because that   s sort of how it works, isn   t it?  When beaders go around and admire each other   s work, somebody has  a good idea, you can adapt it and make it your own. (Laughter) Did you  have any other beading mentors?  Let   s see. I love Teri Greeves    stuff. I met her when we did the first  Cherokee Market. That was the first time I met her.  9  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Which was how many years ago, maybe just about ten or five?  It wasn   t that long ago. Five or six years ago. I enjoyed doing some  stuff, talking to her, and listening to her stories.  You had seen her work in magazines, or     Yeah, I liked her work.  Did you check out books on beading techniques, too, in addition to your  workshop?  No, I got a few designs from a couple of books that were at (what was  the name of that catalog) Crazy Crow catalog? They had some books  you could order, but they were not really books. They were like  pamphlet type things. That   s basically what I looked through.  So were you using, primarily starting out, Plains designs?  Yes.  Did you start off beading on buckskin pretty quickly, or leather?  More buckskin than anything.  What was the first item that you sold that was a pretty good price?  Let   s see. I think it was one of my turtle fetishes, and it was a pretty big  one. That was the first one. I sold it to Ed Pate. (Laughter)  Your father-in-law, (Laughter) but that counts  How did you know how  to price your beadwork? Did you have a sense of how to price things  from the start?  Not really. Hannah helped me with a lot of it.  What was the first item you sold to another store or gallery?  I sold a lot of baby moccasins to the galleries. That   s always been a good  seller for me.  Right, and you continue to do those.  Yes, yes, today.  10  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  How important were booth shows for you when you started out?  They weren   t that important to me because I always had the gallery to  show. I really didn   t start that until later.  What was one of the first booth shows that you did?  Would have been Red Earth, probably.  What were your expectations when you did it, and what was the reality  like? (Laughter)  I have no idea. They were a lot of fun, meeting a lot of people. For some  reason, I would sit there and work through. I   d be working  while   because it wasn   t fast enough paced for me to just sit there.  (Laughs) I would get bored, so I would be working most of the time  during the shows.  And you do hear feedback from people on your work?  Yes. I hear a lot. (Laughter)  Did you have a lot of inventory at that show?  My first one? No. I didn   t have a whole lot, and you kind of learn that  you have to have a whole lot.  It   s a hard call.  Right, because you never know.  Do you try to sort of have a range? On the price scale, do you try to  have a range of things?  Yes, I do. I try and use new. I don   t like to take the same that I   ve had  before that hasn   t sold.  You won   t take it to another show.  Right. I try and do new stuff.  Now, you have two daughters. Did they powwow dance? I can   t  remember.  No, neither one would.  11  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  You didn   t have to do beadwork for them.  No, they were too shy, I guess.  Were you interested in doing pictorial work at all?  No, I   m on, like, more the design type stuff.  How about Southeastern designs? Have you explored them very much?  My friend Roberta Wallace, who did a lot of pots that way, she showed  me a lot of different things Southeastern, but I   ve never tried to really  bead anything like that. Maybe someday.  You didn   t take a pottery class with her, did you?  Just one on one because I   d go to her house and she   d show me. It  wasn   t really a class type. We   d do some things, and then she   d break  them. (Laughter) I guess that was her way of teaching.  She   d break your pieces, you   re saying?  Well, we   d either break them when they fired, or we   d just end up  breaking them because they weren   t worth using. (Laughter)  I see.  Hers were beautiful. Mine were very interesting.  That   s a good story. Thanks for that. How was your earliest beadwork  different from what you do now?  Probably more contemporary stuff now. I don   t do   I   d rather do  traditional, but I like doing contemporary because you can use all  different colors, and there   s more of a spectrum of what you can do on  it.  Artistic freedom. Sometimes the hardest part of doing art is the business  part. What was the best piece of business advice you got starting out?  No one really ever gave me any advice until I went to Indian Market.  When I went to Indian market, I shared with a jeweler. He told me at  that time,    If you really want to make money, the more inventory you  have, the better you will sell.    He was probably right. (Laughs)  So that was your first year of going to market. The whole family went?  12  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Let   s see. No. Me, Leslie, and my mother and step-father went.  How many pieces did you have?  I probably had twenty.  But still not enough.  No, still not enough.  Did you sell everything?  Not the first year. The second year, I sold everything, and I had more  inventory.  What role does your husband play in your business?  He tells a lot of people about it.  Does he do any photography of your work?  Yeah, he does all of it. He   s done, I think, every bit I   ve done.  Do you market your own work online as well as online through the  gallery?  Right now I just go through the gallery online. It   s too hard for me to get  on there and do it and her do it at the same time because I can   t have that  much inventory at one time.  Did you apply to Indian Market a couple of times before you got  accepted, or did you get accepted after your first application?  I got accepted my first application.  That   s unusual.  That   s what I was told. (Laughs)  What were your impressions of the larger Market when you went the  first time?  Oh, I liked it a lot. I liked it a lot. It   s a lot more fast-paced. It   s been my  best show ever since I started beading, has been the Santa Fe Market.  13  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  So how long do you prepare for it?  All year. All year.  Do you sort of tell yourself if it   s a really strong piece, do you sort of try  to save those best pieces for market?  Yeah, usually. Usually I know what I   m going to do by the end of this  year for next year, so I   ll go ahead and start.  The same year, I think, you entered for the first time, you won Third  Place on a buckskin dress?  A dress, yes.  What inspired you to tackle a buckskin dress? (Laughter)  Back to the dolls, I liked the dresses. I liked the beadwork on the  dresses, especially the white buckskin where you can see all the colors  and everything. There was just something I wanted to do that was a little  bit different than what I   d seen, so that   s when I did the butterfly dress.  It was a little girl   s dress, wasn   t it?  Yes.  It also had some quill work, didn   t it?  No. It didn   t have any quill work.  What were some of the challenges of doing it?  I wanted to do it so as the little girl grew up, if she wanted to make her  dress bigger, then she could take the little butterflies and everything off  and put it on a bigger one. I did it so she could take them all off and put  them on a bigger dress. I know she didn   t because the lady that bought  it   she takes pictures of little kids in the dresses and paints them. I know  who it went to, and she never did.  What a great idea. That was part of the reason that you won, probably.  I hope so.  I think that   s really a great idea. You also have done a miniature  cradleboard. What got you interested in cradleboards?  14  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  All the big ones. I wanted to do a big one. I haven   t tackled that yet, but  I will. (Laughs) I wanted to make sure I could do a small one, so I did a  small one. I did it with size fifteen beads. Those are little bitty.  Pretty time consuming?  Yeah, but it turned out good.  Have you ever tried, like   you   ve done beaded purses. When did you  start moving into those?  That was probably after the fetishes, not too long after I started doing  purses. Actually, I went fetishes, dolls, and then purses. The dolls went  back to the dolls that I saw at Doris   .  Do you still make dolls? I didn   t realize that.  Yes, I do, and they   re the ones that don   t have the face.  Have you ever tried a bandolier bag?  No, I haven   t. I haven   t tried one of those. I thought about doing the  Choctaw sash. I want to try one of those. See where that gets me.  There were a few years, I know, when the gallery downtown closed and  before Leslie opened her gallery out here. Did you kind of slow down  your production during that time?  No, towards the end of when Hannah shut her gallery down is when I  started doing work for Shorty   s up in the stockyards. She keeps me busy  with three to four hats a month.  This is the western wear store. Is that right?  She does hats only, I think.  Oh, she does hats only.  Yeah, Shorty   s Hattery.  You do the beaded headbands for that, hat bands.  The hat bands and the brands on some of them.  Oh, you bead the brands, too. Oh, yeah. So that   s kind of nice to have  standing orders, but then maybe on the other hand it   s sort of stressful,  15  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  too.  Sometimes. They   re about three months behind on hats right now, so  when I get them, they   re wanting to rush. They   ll give me a deadline,  but I can usually get it done.  How much of your work is commissions?  Lately, most of it. Before, maybe two years ago, I was doing a lot of  shows, but within this last couple years, I   ve kind of slowed down on the  shows and have just done commission work because I   ve also got  another job.  Right. So how do you carve out time for your beadwork?  On my days off.  That   s when you know you   re beading.  That   s when I   yeah.  You gave a workshop to members of the Choctaw Cultural Club, right,  at one point? When did you get involved with the Choctaw Club?  Again, through the AICS I met a lady that had been a member, and then  once it broke up she, I guess, went to Choctaw Alliance and started  doing stuff with them. She called me and asked me to come do it, so I  went up there.  What was that like, doing your first workshop?  It was fun. It was fun. It was a lot of fun getting to know other people  and showing them how to do beadwork.  Sometimes your students can indirectly give you ideas, too. I don   t know  if that happened or not.  Oh, not really. (Laughter) I still have students that come by and say,    I  still haven   t finished.    That   s been, you know, years ago. (Laughter)  Well, you don   t have to worry about any competition, do you?  (Laughter) I understand you were going to have a show at the  Department of Interior at the American Indian Arts and Crafts store  there. You   re ready to go, and the government shutdown happened. Can  you tell us that story?  16  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  They picked a really good time to shut down for us because  I think it may have been maybe a week before, they shut down when I  bought my tickets to fly out there. Nobody knew if they were going to  open or not or anything. Then they opened the day before I was  supposed to go. They still had a small thing, I think, because it was their  seventy-fifth anniversary thing. I think they   re supposed to do one in  November, but I think they   ve already got artists scheduled for that.  So you had sent your work or not?  I didn   t. I was going to take it with me because you can pack mine easy.  We didn   t know anything. Then we finally decided,    We   ll just not,     because we weren   t sure, even if they did open. We decided not to, so I  just sent my stuff to her.  So they will be showing your stuff, whether or not you decide to go in  November.  Right, right. She   ll have it there at least.  What   s an upcoming project that you   re really excited about?  Upcoming project. I guess probably my holiday show will be coming up  soon. I should be already working on that. (Laughter)  Getting some work out for that. That   ll be here at the gallery in  November?  Yes.  What would you like to try in terms of beadwork that you haven   t had a  chance to try so far?  Like I said, I want to do a cradleboard, a full-size. I have an idea of  another dress. This time, I actually found me a form to use, so I   ll have  something to put it on. All my other dresses, my husband has had to  make a form for.  Oh, yeah, that   s crucial.  To be able to hang it up and see what you   re doing. Then I have an idea  of mixing media on my work. I   ve kind of started on it. It   s going to be a  bronze piece with beading, together. I hope it turns out the way I   m  thinking it   s going to.  That sounds really fascinating because you would be sort of doing the  17  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  model and having it cast.  Right, and I would have to do the beading. Every piece would be bronze.  It   s going to be a turtle. What it will be is, I   ll bead the turtle part, the  back, and maybe some on the bottom, and it   s going to fit into a bronze,  kind of like   the outside will be bronze. It   s going to have a lip around  it with the feet and the head are going to be bronze. We   ll see how it  works out.  That sounds really neat. Are you collaborating with anybody?  No. I know David Kaskaske wanted me to do some work with him, but  we haven   t connected yet.  You   ll be designing the whole turtle.  Yeah, I   ll be doing that myself.  Now, do any of your daughters do beadwork, either of your daughters?  They both did a piece, and they won at the kids Red Earth show. They  both won. One won First Place; the other won Second Place. That   s all  they   ve ever beaded.  Had to prove they could do it, I guess.  Right. (Laughter)  Let   s talk about your process and techniques a bit more. I read that you  don   t sketch your designs. You start with colors. Can you explain for us?  I have a Pyrex dish that I put the colors that I want to use in that. If it   s  something somebody has commissioned, then I   ll certainly do what they  want and in the colors that they want, but most of the time, I do colors I  want to do. I mix them, and that   s how I use them. I start out, and it just  goes where it goes.  So you can sort of move the colors around. That   s part of the reasoning.  Right, right. That way if I don   t like the yellow here, then I can just put  green there. Just depends on what I   m doing most of the time.  How do you think your use of color, your palette, has changed over the  years?  I don   t know if it   s really changed. There are certainly more colors now  18  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  than you could get before. I think it   s more contemporary colors than the  older traditional colors that I like.  And you   re not really drawn to antique beads too much?  I usually, I use thirteens. That   s all I   ve ever used because I like the way  they shine. When you   re finished with the product, to me, I like that, so  that   s what I   ve used. I   ll use a size, maybe, ten to do the outline, but  other than that, I   ve used that or smaller. The smaller, you get a better  design.  Do you have a pretty good supplier for your buckskin right now?  Yeah, I order it from a catalog. You can get it that   s brain-tanned or  whatever.  Where do you buy your beads? Do you like to buy online, or do you like  to go to shows, or     I used to go to powwows and buy them there. Then I had a lady that  used to sell them. She would sell them at powwows, and I could go to  her. Then she quit selling them, so I had to find other outlets to get them.  I order a lot of them from Crazy Crow.  Have you done any loom work at all? Do you have any interest in that?  That   s what I do the hatbands. I do hatbands on the loom. I do bracelets  on the loom. You can do belts on a loom.  What makes your bead art   what separates it or distinguishes it from  that of other bead workers?  I   ve had people tell me it   s more the traditional way of beading, but I  don   t know. I don   t see how different a lazy stitch can be from another  lazy stitch, or a peyote stitch can be from, you know. I don   t do a lot of,  like, the other brick stitch or church stitch. I don   t do a lot of that.  Mine   s usually lazy or embroidery.  Is functionality important to you, that people use some of the items that  you make in some way?  Yeah. Yeah, it is. I do a lot of things that can be   . Like, I   ve done a lot  of moccasins that I think a lot of people will take pictures of their babies  in them and then frame them in the shadowboxes and stuff. I thought  that was kind of neat. I like them being able to use the purses and things.  That   s why I tell them,    If you use a purse, and something comes apart  19  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  or something, just always send it back. I can always fix it.    I think so. I  like being able to use them.  What   s your creative process from the time that you get an idea?  A lot of it depends on what I have to use with. If I have everything there,  then I can get it done pretty fast. If I   m excited about something, I   ll  work on it, really with it.  And you won   t do any sketching of what the     Now, I say I don   t, but I do doctor   s bags. My first one I did had  everything to do with medicine and Native American, so I would sketch  out what I wanted on each side. That   s how I   d go about doing those.  Right. We know that you work at your beading when you   re not at work.  Do you work during the night better or the day better?  My best time is early morning. I like working early morning.  Do you like working to music or TV, or does it matter?  Either.  Looking back on your career so far, what   s been one of the high points?  Getting any awards for the work you   ve done. It seems all of it   s been a  lot of fun.  What   s been one of the low points?  Probably right now would be not knowing how long I   m going to be  able to do it because of my eyes.  Right, you   re having your eyes checked, getting that situation looked  into. That would really sort of   it could do a number on you, couldn   t  it?  Yeah, yeah.  You   ll be in our thoughts and prayers about that.  I appreciate it.  Is there anything else you   d like to add or talk about, something we  might have forgotten to include?  20  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Pate  Little Thunder  Not that I can think of.  And you don   t want to tell us what you   re working on for Indian Market.  (Laughter) This probably won   t go up online before that.  Well, I had two kind of things. I was wanting to do these, you know,  cards, a deck of cards? I really wanted to do a deck of cards, but trying  to figure out how to show them all is a big deal. Then another dress, I   d  like to do a dress. I   ll have to figure out which one I want to do, which  one I   m up to doing.  Right, right. Well, great. We   re going to take a look at your work now.  Okay, this is an example of one of your beaded bags. Do you want to  talk to us about this?  This is a Choctaw stickball bag. All my purses, I do something kind of  different. This one, with the little things     I see that, yeah.     only on this side, though. (Laughter) You can tell it   s Choctaw  stickball by the way the string is.  Right. Beautiful, beautiful beads. That white just sets it off.  I like the brown colors.  Yes, I do, too.
