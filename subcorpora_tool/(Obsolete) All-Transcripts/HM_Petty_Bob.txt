Speaker 2: And this is Washington High School?
Speaker 1: Washington High School, Caruthersville, Missouri.  It's down in Southeast Missouri on the Mississippi River.  They call us "river rats", child of the river.  Small town.  Population about nine thousand or so people.  The Washington High School Tigers.  If memory serves me correctly, we were 17-5 that year.  Got knocked out of the regional state tournament in the first round by the Clarkton [Missouri] Reindeer.

Speaker 2: Is it a public high school?
Speaker 1: Yes, public school.  I think up here you call them "township high schools" or something, where they attract kids from all over the area, since ours was the largest black school in the area.  So, we attracted kids from the smaller towns, kids from the country or the rural.

Speaker 1: This is a PR picture, Channel 7, Eyewitness News, WLS Television.  This picture was probably taken during the mid-1970's just from looking at the Circle 7 on my jacket there, during the days when we wore the Circle 7 at Channel 7, Eyewitness News, the mid-1970's, yeah, early to mid-1970's.  It's a company picture.  Public relations.
Speaker 2: (inaudible)
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.  They got the whole thing.  The whole life history.  It says something about Sigma Delta Chi, 7 On Your Side, Action 7.  Okay.  That would have been the mid-70's.
Speaker 2: When did you first start here?
Speaker 1: Oh, I came to Chicago in, working in 1971, summer of '71, to work.  I came here as a student prior to that.
Speaker 2: Did you go straight to 7?
Speaker 1: Well, I was in the business already, living and working in Phoenix, Arizona.  Shortly before coming to Chicago as a student, I worked for CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] in Phoenix and took a leave of absence.  Came here, did some studying, research, what have you, went back home, worked awhile, then came back here in the summer of '71.

I also worked filling as substitute anchor.

Speaker 1: Oh, we got away from Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois] Eyewitness News and the Circle 7's during the mid-'80s, '86, '87, something like that.  We were the last.  Oh, the O&O stations, owner and operator stations, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles [California], whatever, we all wore the Circle 7's, we all wore navy blue jackets purchased by the company.  Hey and excellent, excellent jackets.  So, they took our 7's and made us buy our own jackets.

Paying the bills.  Man, they had pumpkins everywhere.  One of the million classrooms I've been in in my day doing one thing or another in addition to being a student.
Speaker 2: Do you prefer being a field reporter over an anchorman?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Yes.  Anchor people spend their time sitting inside.  I spend my time in the streets so the they don't know where I am or what I'm doing.  I prefer the streets.  I'm just kind of a street person.  I like the outside, meeting people, listening to people, watching, I prefer that.  The anchor people, it's like having a job, they're inside eight hours a day.

Speaker 1: State your name, and spell it for us.  I want your date of birth, today's date and our location.
Speaker 2: I'm Robert Anthony Petty, but, please, call me Bob.  Most people who don't know me, do.  Another joke.  People only call me Bob here.  My father was Bob, so I was always Bobby.  Growing up, I was always Bobby or Robert or Petty and then when I got to Chicago, my news director told me "You can't be Bobby.  That just sounds too informal."  And he said "Robert sounds just a little formal."  So, I became Bob.  People have called me Bob in other places and other phases of my life, but I've never really been Bob until I got to Chicago.  I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, November 26, 1940, on a rainy night, born prematurely, not that much, my mom tells us, and we are at 1900 South Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], The HistoryMakers studio.

Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I like the spring of the year.  I'm a rainy weather person and I enjoy the rainy weather and then the spring is the transition, you know, life is starting to bloom again and, the flowers and the grass and the birds and the worms, and I like the spring of the year.  Winters are good, but spring would be my favorite.
Speaker 1: And favorite place to vacation.
Speaker 2: My favorite place to vacation depends on the type of vacation that we're taking.  If it's a family vacation, wife [Cora Jones Petty], daughter [Cory], son [Robert], probably some place where there's lots of, or three of us, at any rate, sand, water, sun, lots of sunshine, the Caribbean.  If I'm riding with friends, probably Cuba.
Speaker 1: Alright, Cuba.  My last question of this series is I'd like to know what your favorite phrase or saying is.
Speaker 2: "Dinner's ready."
Speaker 1: That's cute.  Now who's saying that to whom?  Is that the wife saying it to you?
Speaker 2: Usually, yes.  I don't know.  That's kind of a tough one, my favorite saying, "dinner's ready," "payday," "goodnight," you know, but "dinner's ready."

Speaker 1: I know you were born in Memphis [Tennessee], but I want to ask you, first your mother, her name was Hazel Bell?
Speaker 2: [Nod].
Speaker 1: But let's talk about your mother.  She, what do you know about her?  What can you tell us about her background and her family?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1908.  My mother's folks [Ida Miles Bell, Oscar Bell] were from Texas, West Texas, East Texas, West Louisiana part of the country.  My mother was one of three children.  My grandparents had three daughters, my mother being the oldest.  My mother completed high school.  They considered high school then eighth grade.  My mother was a reader.  She always had magazines, books and newspapers, so perhaps I got my interest in the printed word from my mom.  My mother did not have a vocation, because she never really worked until after our father [Robert Petty] died.  So she got a start working kind of late in life.  She was a fiery lady, a little, short, thin, fiery lady.  We were church boys.  We grew up in the church.  My mother was a very religious woman.  We grew up in the sanctified church, the Church of God in Christ, as it is more properly referred to.  She pushed her boys to get an education and to be good solid citizens and good solid men.  We missed out on most of those, but one or two we did alright with.
Speaker 1: Now did she share with you any stories of her growing up?  She was from Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Born in Baton Rouge, but my grandparents, my grandmother and my grandfather moved quite a bit, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Missouri, even Chicago [Illinois] for a brief period, but mainly the South.  The stories that our mother, yes, she did share stories with us, about she and her sisters growing up.  They, as I said, lived in a number of places.  They moved fairly--I shouldn't say frequently perhaps, but she and her sisters grew up pampered girls.  I guess unlike a lot of young, black women in the South, they, well, they too did field work living on a farm.  It was not absolutely essential, apparently, that they did it.  She said they grew up kind of pampered like.  Her parents were more concerned with the girls going to school.  And my mom, I guess, like a lot of black kids in the South, never went to school year-round because, where and when she grew up, school was let out so that the crops could be worked.  She never complained a lot about her life, but later in life, after our father died, she did have to go to work.  But she was the kind who said, this is what has to be done.  We'll do it and complain about it after it's done.  There's no point in complaining about it now.  That kind of a person.
Story_ID: 11833
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father, Robert Petty, who is your namesake.  It seems like Robert, I mean, aren't you the third Robert?
Speaker 2: No, I'm probably the three hundredth Robert in my family.  Kind of a family name.  My grandfather was Robert.  My father was Robert.  My father's two brothers were Robert.  I am Robert.  My brother after me is Robert.  My son is Robert, and my son says that when he has a son, his son shall also be Robert.  But sometimes it's a first name, sometimes it's a middle name.  I'm Robert Anthony.  My brother after me, he's Billy Robert.  Then an uncle, John Robert.  So, it's always, it's kind of a family name, and they stick it in wherever they can.
Speaker 1: Do you know the origin of Petty, how that, what that name originated from?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, I've thought about it.  And Petty is, means small, French, petite, small, and since they were from Louisiana, West, East Texas, maybe there's some French in there somewhere.  Perhaps the name came out of there someplace.  My father's folks came out of the Mississippi Bayou.  So, you know, and there's some French in there.  I can only guess at it.  I can only guess at it.  I have no way of really knowing.  But it is a question that I've asked myself.  An interesting thing that happened is that as my father's folks came out of the Mississippi Bayou. Here in Chicago [Illinois] on the South Side, in Glenwood Cemetery [sic, Oak Woods Cemetery], there's a huge--I like cemeteries, my daughter, Cory, and I, take cemetery tours. We visit cemeteries.  There is something quite still, thank goodness, but quite beautiful about cemeteries, the architecture.  You stand and you look at a tombstone and whatever and you say, "What does this person look like?"  You know, that kind of a thing.  Well, in Glenwood Cemetery, on the city's South Side, about 67th and Cottage [Grove Avenue], whatever is down in that area, there's a memorial to Civil War veterans who were prisoners of war, at about, what, well, not too far from where we are now, we're 1900 South Michigan [Avenue], 31st [Street], 35th [Street] and Michigan, there was a huge Confederate prisoner of war camp there during the Civil War, and many of the men who died there are buried down in Glenwood Cemetery and there's this big giant memorial to them, and they have the names of many of those men and on there is a James Petty, from Mississippi.  Now, are James and I related?  Was James a Confederate soldier, or was he the slave of a Confederate soldier who maybe went along to prison with the owner?  I don't know, but that name has intrigued me.  Actually my daughter found it.  She said "Oh Dad, look, here's our name.  Look, James Petty. Who is this man?"  I don't know where the name came from, but it has crossed my mind.
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Robert Petty], describe the kind of person he was.  He was born in 1900?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  My father, I don't remember too well.  We were just little boys when my father died.  And I only have two or three distinct memories of my father.  One, him trying to teach me to tie my shoe when I was about four years old, a couple of other memories of my father, so I don't remember.  Memories that I have of my father come from my older brother [Stanley Jones], who was a product of our mother's [Hazel Bell's]  first marriage, but he is, Stanley is six years older than I am, so obviously he'd know my father better than I know him. But stories that people have told about my father--he worked on the Mississippi River.  He was a cook on what we called a river boat.  It was a boat that hauled men up and down the river, men who worked at flood control, to prevent the Mississippi River from flooding, especially in the spring, and my father was a cook on that boat, or one of those boats.  He was also a money lender, money lender, you might call him, not a loan shark, but he loaned money to men who gambled up and down the Mississippi River. And that is how we ended up, my brothers and I, growing up in Missouri, because he was collecting money when he got sick, and went back home to Memphis and died--but not a lot of memories of my father, except for the fact that the guy always had a big pocketful of change when he would come home, and he would give my brother Stanley, the oldest of us, nickels, dimes and quarters, and he would give the little ones big stacks of pennies. What did we know? We thought we were rich.  Just a few memories of my old man.
Story_ID: 11834
Speaker 1: Your siblings, they are, would you go in order?
Speaker 2: Stanley [Jones].  Stanley is the oldest, and Stanley lives in St. Louis [Missouri].  He worked for Amoco Oil, as, I don't know, turning the dials, helping to make motor oil.  My brother Billy [Petty] lived in New York [New York] for a long time, and my brother Jerry [Petty] lives in Kansas City [Missouri].  Billy left New York and came to Chicago [Ilinois].  He passed away a few years ago, and my brother Jerry lives in Kansas City.  Jerry's the youngest of us.  Jerry works in, oh, Jerry works with troubled teenagers.
Story_ID: 11835
Speaker 1: Tell me what some of your earliest memories growing up are?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember when we left Memphis [Tennessee] and moved to Missouri.  I remember that, because--I don't remember the circumstances, but we ended up living on the river.  The house that we lived in then is still there, only now it is a boathouse--again, small town, Caruthersville, Missouri, down in Southeast Missouri.  Trace the Mississippi River from Minnesota down through--your finger will slide right past the town that I grew up in, which is really what I consider my hometown.  But I remember we lived right on the river, and I was a 'water baby'--I believe conceived, I know, born on a rainy night, and then living on the river, I just was always, seemed really hypnotized by that. I distinctly remember living on the river.  And then the second place we lived after our father [Robert Petty] died, we lived in some wooden apartments, a couple or three blocks over, because the spring after our father died, there was a flood. And the apartment that we lived in sat on stilts, probably eight to ten feet off of the ground.  There were maybe a dozen or so of these apartments there, some facing north, some facing south.  And we woke up one morning and the river was our front yard.  Yes, and you talk about some excited little boys.  We had a balcony, and we're standing on the balcony, and this chicken coup comes floating by ever so slowly, and my brother, Stanley [Jones], says, "Watch this, Bobby." And he jumped. And he missed the floating chicken coup and hit the river.  Fortunately, the water wasn't that deep, and there were some neighbor men out there and they pulled him out.  But, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  Good memory.  There was a--I told you my father worked with men who were responsible for flood control.  Well, in Caruthersville, Missouri like in a lot of towns that border one river or another, there's a levy, and in the town portion itself, there is what we call a seawall, this huge concrete wall, eight feet high, maybe four feet thick.  And my mother [Hazel Bell Petty] told me, constantly told us, "Don't play on the seawall, because it's too high, too tall. You'll fall off."  Well, on my fifth birthday, I got up early that morning.  I made up my mind, I'm going to walk the seawall, the way the older boys did.  I managed to climb up, got there, took two steps, and whoop, fell right off.  Got up, brushed myself off, ran home to my mom and said "Guess what?"  She said "What?"  I said, "I just fell off the seawall."  Little boy memories.  A lot of ball playing, a lot of running, a lot of marble shooting.  I always liked to play with the girls, too.  I would play with the boys for awhile then I would go play with the girls.  The girls taught me to sew.  I can still put a good button on, sew a good button.  I could darn a cuff, darn a shirt, rather, sew a cuff.  Things the girls taught me.  I still jump rope, twirl a baton.  But I can't sink a twenty-foot jump shot anymore.  The things I learned from the girls, I can still do.  The things I learned from the boys, they've all passed me by.
Story_ID: 11836
Speaker 1: I Said you weren't really aware of the implications of your father's [Robert Petty], you know, I mean passing.
Speaker 2: No. I'm not certain that any of us understood the implications of it.  Obviously, the younger ones, they were too young.  My older brother, Stanley [Jones], he may have, he may have.  But no, not  really, not really.  It's just things got very quiet.  Our mother [Hazel Bell Petty] was pregnant at the time.  Things got very quiet around the house.  There were a lot of strangers coming and going.  We were relatively new in town.  Suddenly, there's a widow alone with a houseful of boys.  In small towns, like I see in big cities, on one street or another, when things like that happen, you know, word gets out.  And as I say, we were still relatively new in town and didn't know a lot of people. And we were only in town because our father had business there, and certainly no intention of staying there because his family was migrating from Memphis, Tennessee out to Los Angeles [California].  Because there were a lot of jobs--the second Great Black Migration out of Memphis, the first took place during the 1800s.  The second took place during the 1940s, early '50s [1950s] or what have you. And so it was our parent's intention--our father was going to do this business, get his money, then join the rest of the family in California.  We never made it out of Caruthersville [Missouri].

Speaker 1: One other thing I wanted to ask you about, and that was you said that you, you didn't speak of it as a love affair with water, but, you know, you said that water, growing up around water--and I'm just wondering how it made you feel, what does water, what did it do to you then that it still does to you today?
Speaker 2: I find it's like a rainy day or a rainy night, for whatever reasons.  I'm kind of drawn to it.  I get melancholy.  I feel romantic.  I feel sad.  It just depends on what emotions are already there, I would assume, but water gives me a great deal of solitude.  I can very easily, I've always had the ability to drift off in my mind, to focus, so that the rest of the world isn't here with me.  It comes in handy in my line of work, but I can stand or sit on the water and just going someplace else.  I'm absolutely away.  I find it great for thinking about problems and troubles, or just lying there, standing there, sitting there, being mellow and happy, and enjoying it.  So, you know, mixed feelings, not one particular feeling that the water gives me.  But I do love the water.  I learned to swim in the  river at a very early age, like most of the boys in the neighborhood, but that river was always calling me. I was never afraid of it, respected it, but never really afraid of it.

Speaker 1: And you lived in Caruthersville [Missouri], how long did you say?
Speaker 2: I lived in Caruthersville from the time I was four or five years old till I graduated high school [Washington High School, Caruthersville, Missouri], till I was seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: So, actually your mother [Hazel Bell Petty] stayed in that house?
Speaker 2: Yes, we stayed.  We had no place else to go.
Speaker 1: She never got remarried?
Speaker 2: No, she said that she got lucky the first time around with, what, stepfather, with my oldest brother, my brother Stanley [Jones], and our father [Robert Petty], she said that was luck, but she said she didn't want to take a chance.  And a widow along with four growing boy, eating up the house and half the grocery store, you know, so, but she always said that she didn't want to marry anymore, because she didn't want us to have a stepfather.  Although she had a stepfather, who was my granddad [Oscar Bell], he was a terrific guy. And my oldest brother, the stories he tells about our father, so, but she said she didn't want to any more.
Story_ID: 11839
Speaker 1: How are you as a young person?  What is this young Bob Petty?  What is he like?  You were the oldest of that group and really you had your older brother, Stanley [Jones], so I'm just wondering?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a very curious child, very active.  I wouldn't say that I was a bad little boy, but I was just very curious about things.  I've always been something of a loner, and I would disappear.  But then my mom [Hazel Bell Petty] I don't think really worried about me too much, when I would disappear I'd disappear and head to the river, disappear and head to the park, disappear and just walk the streets in Caruthersville [Missouri] there, Caruthersville.  But I said I don't think my mom really worried about me the way she worried about my two younger brothers [Billy Robert Petty, Jerry Petty] or my older brother because I was always the one that she could say to do this or see to it that this is done, and it would get done.  I was always one who would assume responsibility, take the bull by the horns.  Let's just get it done before she gets home.  And then we're all dead if we don't get it done.  So now, "You do this.  I do that. Let's get it done."  So, that kind of a kid.  I ran errands, hustling movie fare and pop money for older people in the neighborhood, always out hustling and working, that kind of a guy.
Speaker 1: When you were taking these walks, what was going through your mind?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I was not dreaming.
Speaker 1: Are you sure you weren't a thinker?
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know.  I may have asked myself that question. Sometimes I think and wonder I don't remember having daydreams about cars, or clothes, or jewelry, or any types of those sort of things, but I did have daydreams about getting things done and being successful and knowing that I was not going to, that I was going to get out of Caruthersville as quickly as I could not because there was anything bad or wrong with it, despite the fact that it was a small Southern town, most peculiar little town in some ways, but I had places to go and things to do.  There was an air force base near Caruthersville, an air force base down in Blytheville, Arkansas, which is only ninety miles or so south of Caruthersville, if that much, or thirty plus miles, but there was an air force base.  And I could stand for hours and watch those airplanes fly overhead, and wonder where are they going?  Who is that?  Can I do that?  I was that kind of a little dreamy boy.  Always concerned about sports--wrapped myself up in that.  Entertainment--wrapped myself up in that.  I never dreamed about television or radio, never crossed my mind.  Lived in the movies.  When I could hustle a dime, fifteen cents--and most days I could.

Speaker 1: Caruthersville [Missouri]. A very nice town.  Caruthersville is definitely in the South.  We got there in the mid to late 1940s.  In many ways, a typical Southern town.  When we arrived in Caruthersville, there were a number of factories there.  I remember there was a tomato canning factory, a factory that canned corn, there was a Chris Craft motor boat company there.  There was a huge lumber company-slash-sawmill there.  Then there was the agricultural side, picking cotton, chopping cotton, soybean, potatoes, corn. So it was a jumping little town.  Caruthersville was and continues to be the county seat of Pemiscot County.  Pemiscot County was a wide open county.  You name it, and you can find it in Pemiscot County when we were growing up.  Many of these things, activities, were illegal.  There was open gambling, open pool halls, open prostitution, open bootlegging.  And since Caruthersville was so centrally located between Memphis [Tennessee] and St. Louis [Missouri], we attracted any number of people from Memphis and St. Louis, hustlers, musicians, regular folks, and others.  I can remember lying in my bed at night, listening--we lived half a block or less from a place called the Sportsman Hall.  It never closed.  From the time we arrived there, until I graduated high school, thirteen, fourteen, years later, it never closed.  That was its reputation, all day and all night.  Not a buzz of activity all day and all night, but it was a strange little joint.  Up front was a restaurant and a dance hall.  In the back, gambling.  Over on the side there, you get your liquor or whatever next door. Wide open town, I remember a time I was lying in my bed listening to this wonderful guitar music on a Friday night, Saturday night that floated down from this joint, you know.  It's 11:00.  I should be asleep, but I'm lying there, wondering what those grown people are doing, and B.B. King was making this wonderful guitar music.  Because you recall that B.B. King came out of Memphis.  When I was a little boy, he even had a weekend or Saturday radio show on a Memphis radio station, and I was just fascinated by the fact that I could hear him on the radio on the Saturday afternoon, and at night he would be in this joint in Caruthersville playing the guitar.  Yes.  That was Caruthersville.  Caruthersville was, you know, nobody, I never had problems in Caruthersville.  People say "Well, how are race relations in Caruthersville?"  Unless I romanticize it, and I doubt that I would do that, I never had problems in Caruthersville.  I've never been called a name by white people, never called a 'nigger.'  Nobody got off the sidewalks.  It was not that kind of a town.  Some of us say, well maybe because it was so centrally located, you know, close to big cities, and on and on, I don't know, but I cannot recall any bad incidents happening between the races.  I do know that in the late '40s [1940s], early 1950s, before Brown v. the Board of Education, for whatever reason the subject of town swimming pool came up.  And they said, "All taxpayers' money," and I don't know who's saying this, "pays for that swimming pool, because it's a public pool in a public park."  The city fathers closed the pool, this was like I said late '40s, early '50s [1950s].  The pool is still closed, still there, still closed.  So that's when kids started going to the river to swim.  The white kids swim on one end of the river.  The black kids swim on another end of the river.  We had the best deal because we had sand and trees.  Yes.  We were a little town.  I told you before that I was my mama's [Hazel Bell Petty's] boy.  When she had to go to work, I had to see to it that things were done.  And when it was time to pay the bills at the end of the month or the beginning of the month, my mom would give me the money, and I'm ten years old, eleven years old, I'm downtown dealing with these businessmen paying the bills, you know.  "Well, Mr. Gates, my mom said to give you fifteen dollars."  "Well, she owed us twenty dollars."  "She said to give you fifteen."  Good experience for me, looking back at it.  It taught me to handle the money, and how to deal with people, and talk with the people and that if she didn't have the entire twenty to give the man, after he finished talking to me, he would take the fifteen.  So, Caruthersville was that kind of a town.  And here, fifty years later or whatever, there are still a couple of the old merchants who were there, and when we have occasion to visit Caruthersville--no family there, but every now and then I'll run into one of those old men that I did business with forty fifty years ago.
Speaker 2: Now, was it black, white, or was it, how many blacks versus white?  You only have nine thousand people?
Speaker 1: Nine thousand people.  Half and half.  Half and half, maybe.  Caruthersville High School [Caruthersville, Missouri] was the white school.  Washington High School [Caruthersville, Missouri] was the black high school.  There were three motion picture theaters, The Roger, the gym and the stadium.  In every case, the black kids sat in the balcony, white kids sat down front.  What else was there?  Kids play together.  Black kids and white kids play together.  And when you reach a certain age, puberty white kids go one way, black kids go another way.  And then growing up in a small town, again, so many people knew so many people, working, living, whatever, what have you.  Even white people would say to you if they saw you doing wrong "Hey, aren't you Hazel Petty's boy?"  "Yes, sir."  "I'm going to tell your mama on you, boy." That kind of a thing, so, for me, it was a nice place in which to grow up.
Story_ID: 11841
Speaker 1: Tell me the schools you went to [in Caruthersville, Missouri], what elementary school?
Speaker 2: There were only two, Washington Elementary, Washington Junior High, Washington High School.
Speaker 1: All Washington?
Speaker 2: All Washington.
Speaker 1: Named after who?
Speaker 2: Who would you guess?  Booker T. Washington.  No, actually George Washington.  Yes, gets them every time.  "Black school--it's got to be Booker T. Washington."  No, George Washington.  Many of us thought it was Booker T. Washington--but, just teasing you, it was Booker T. Washington.  Just wanted to see if you'd go along with me on that one.
Story_ID: 11842
Speaker 1: Now that we're all adults or what have you, I talk with the guys and women that I grew up with, and we talk about these things and say we could not have grown up in a better place [Caruthersville, Missouri] for seeing, for learning, you couldn't help but learn something about the streets if you lived in the neighborhood that I partially grew up in.  On the other end of town, there were no juke joints like that.  They didn't hear B.B. King late at night.  But, then, you know, maybe back then, I was thinking "Gee, I can't sleep.  I sure wished I lived downtown where people were sleeping."  But I look at it now, how many of us were lying in bed and hear this wonderful music coming.  It didn't make me fall in love with the blues necessarily, but it certainly gave me an appreciation, a better appreciation of music, I would like to think.  It taught me to watch people and to figure out I'll try this as opposed to that, I'll try going that way as opposed to some other way.  So, for me, it was a very good learning experience, and my brothers [Stanley Jones, Billy Robert Petty, Jerry Petty] tend to feel the same way.
Story_ID: 11843
Speaker 1: So what was forming you as a person?  What are the things influencing you?  You grew up, you said, well Pentecostal, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, I mean, so you have this Pentecostal, this very churchy thing happening and at the other, you know, you're exposed to the other side, the very secular part of life.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, who is forming you, you know, who is your, are there men, people who mentor you or who look out for you, or show--was it the minister, was it the--who were these people that were forming you as a young man?
Speaker 2: I'm not really certain.  I liked Mr. Bate and Mr. Bossy.  They ran the gambling house and they always wore white shirts, ties and had high shines on their shoes and hats.  Men dressed as gentlemen in those days.  I always thought Mr. Bate and Mr. Bossy were two of the cleanest men in Caruthersville [Missouri].  I'm not really certain.  There were a lot.  Having no father to set those kind of examples, I'm not really certain.  I'm serious about Mr. Bate and Mr. Bossy, they taught me, watching them, to appreciate clothing, and told me "Dress nice, son.  Shine your shoes, always shine your shoes."  Those kind of things.  A couple of teachers, a couple of the teachers that I had, one of them, Ms. Bates, when I had Ms. Bates in fourth grade, she gave me a double promotion, I was never in fifth grade, I went from fourth to sixth.  So it wouldn't necessarily have to be men who influenced me.  I was very shy growing up and Ms. Bates worked with me on that.  I would never raise my hand when she'd ask a question.  I knew the answer as well as most, if not better, but I would never raise my hand to answer a question.  I was always afraid of what happens if I'm wrong.  Well it wasn't as though she was going to set my tennis shoes on fire, but I didn't want to be wrong.  But Ms. Bates--Mrs. Bates helped to get me to overcome that.  So, I always include her in there.  A couple of teachers in high school, men in general, a man I once ran a pool hall for when I was fifteen, sixteen years old, Mr. Charlie Howard. Somehow we--well, the first time I went to his pool hall, he kicked me out and told me I was too young.  A year later, I was running his pool hall and he would give me a sack of money every morning and he'd take off and go wherever he was going and I would run his business for him.  Until somebody turned us into the cops and the cops showed up one night and said "Son, you're too young to be in the pool hall."  But I was ran his business for about a year and a half, and I was maybe fifteen, sixteen years old.  So, Mr. Charlie was a very good businessman.  So, any number of people, but I couldn't just point to one specific person and say, "This person influenced me more than any others."
Speaker 1: Did you, so what are you--well, you're in high school.  I mean you're as formed by the streets as you are anything.  Is church forming you much, except, is that a willing thing, or did you just have to go, that's where your mother went?
Speaker 2: Oh, I enjoy church, being a sanctified church, Pentecostal Church, Church of God in Christ, lot of music, love that music, people dancing and shouting.  Watching people who normally, would not, were not very self, would not express themselves in public, but in church suddenly there's this man, and he is dancing and sweat is pouring off him and he's praising God and he is so into it until I know in my heart even today that he is somewhere else, he is not of this earth at that moment. The spirit has taken over his body.  So, I enjoyed church in that sense.  They told good stories in church.  Stories of murder, rape, wars, monsters, good stories, and I've always enjoyed a good story.  The Bible is a wonderful book to read and study from.  Much more to it than thou shalt not, or thou shall.  There are some terrific stories in the Bible.  I enjoy that aspect of it.  I enjoyed the community aspect of it, because at our church, the sanctified church, when we went to church, we went to church.  We'd be in church all day.  I mean, all day long.  You know, these ladies would bring chicken, greens and salads and all the food and make it a community type thing, practically every Sunday, so I enjoyed those aspects of it.  I never lost my religious training, but my other training, the things that I learned in the street, seemed to help me more in a practical sense.  You know, it's one thing to say "God, get me out of the way of this car."  Common sense tells me, "Run."  So, some of those, some of those.  I enjoy church immensely.  I don't attend church on a regular basis now, not for a particular reason, but no strong influence from there either.
Story_ID: 11844
Speaker 1: In your teens, are you--what are you wanting to be or do, I mean, or around the time of graduation, what are you wanting to, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I never really thought about those kind of things when I was growing up.  Limited options.  Poor boy.  Certainly no money to go to college.  There was the military.  I told you we grew up near an airbase down in Blytheville, Arkansas.  So, poor boy.  No money for college.  I grew up near a military base, an air base.  That crossed my mind.  The main thing for me, my primary concern was to get out of high school and get out of Caruthersville, Missouri.  Again, not that there was anything wrong with Caruthersville, Missouri, but I had other things to do and I had places to go.  What I had to do, where I had to go, I had no idea.  In my senior year of college [sic, high school, Booker T. Washington High School, Caruthersville, Missouri], one of my classroom advisors, Mr. Wallace, my history social science teacher, told me that it was possible that I could go to college.  And, son of a gun, I did.  I got a scholarship to college.  And going through some of my mother's papers, not too very long ago, I found a copy of my college scholarship.  It was worth sixty eight bucks.  Sixty eight dollars to cover the first semester's tuition and fees. But that sixty eight dollars made all the difference in the world, I truly believe, in my life.  Because had it not been for that sixty eight dollars, maybe I'd be working on a gambling boat now, a crooked river boat.
Speaker 1: You were at Lincoln University?
Speaker 2: Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri.
Story_ID: 11845
Speaker 1: How did you end up choosing Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri],  Was there any choice about that?
Speaker 2: No.  No choice.  Lincoln offered me a partial scholarship, an academic scholarship, and always do that homework, do those grades, you know, get those grades, so the academic scholarship, that's how I got to college.  And I worked and I saved my money and on and on and on, and my mom [Hazel Bell Petty], you know, she gave me twenty bucks, no, I'm just teasing you there.  But, yeah, so off I went to college.
Speaker 1: Now Jefferson City is how far from--?
Speaker 2: Caruthersville [Missouri]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh Jefferson City's a couple hundred miles from Caruthersville.
Speaker 1: So, this is a change for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, a terrific change, a complete change.
Speaker 1: I mean you have been in this one little spot.  So, how was that experience?
Speaker 2: It was only the second time I'd been out of Caruthersville, actually, but I was eager.  When we were little boys growing up--I told you about my father's work.  My father's work required that he change towns from time to time.  So we lived in a number of little towns up and down the Mississippi River.  And when we were little boys, our grandmother used to call us the 'little black gypsies' because we were always moving.  Well, when I got ready to go to college, the gypsy in me came out, because I was supposed to have left home for school in early September.  I left home in August.  I was ready to go.  I figured I'd get up there early, on and on and on, plus a friend, a guy a couple years ahead of me in school was a student at Lincoln University in Jefferson City and he told me there were jobs up there cleaning dormitories and on and on and on.  Well, I was working in a sawmill at home helping to make those little wooden crates and boxes that you see lettuce and tomatoes shipped in, you see them in little slices, pieces of wood.  I don't remember what I was being paid, but in Lincoln, they were paying like three, four bucks an hour, something unheard of.  So I went up and got a job cleaning dormitories for most of the summer, and then the ball came around, I was off to school.  First time away from home, scared, missing my mother, missing my brothers [Stanley Jones, Billy Robert Petty, Jerry Petty], tremendously homesick, homesick for the next ten years, till I got married, and finally killed most of the homesickness.  I was a mama's boy also, so that was especially difficult for me, it was especially hard, and on more than one occasion I was, "Tomorrow, I'm going home." Or, "If I have any money, I would go home."
Speaker 1: Was there a sense of not belonging when you got there?  Did you feel bad at all or did you feel that you were welcomed into this institution?
Speaker 2: No, I was at home.  Despite my homesickness and all of that.  I've always enjoyed school a great deal, because I saw it as a challenge.  I'm as smart as you are.  And I like it.  I like the books and the reading and the challenge as I say.  So, I kind of fell right in with the college life.  I didn't do much on campus, the hanging out and the dances and all of that, I didn't do a lot of that because I was afraid that if I didn't get those grades that I would have to go home.  And those grades were my priority, so I spent most of my time either in my room working or in the library working. So that went on for awhile until I got kind of comfortable and figured, "Okay.  I think I can do this."  Then I discovered that every Wednesday night they had dances at the recreational center, so that kind of eliminated a little of the studying.  But college was fun.  You know, I had that "rah, rah" about me.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Then why did you drop out?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd been in school all of my life, for one thing.  At the end of my freshman year at Lincoln University, I was walking through a gymnasium after basketball games, some inner-league games, and I saw a notice on the bulletin board in the gym that said "Wanted.  Green Giant Canning Company of Belvidere, Illinois", something, some, summer jobs, and the Green Giant Canning Company in Belvidere hired college students from all around the country to work for the Green Giant Canning Company doing various things.  So, a friend of mine also from Caruthersville, and I, and a number of schoolmates from Lincoln said we wanted to go and they took about forty of us, loaded us on buses, took us from Jefferson City up to Belvidere and we spent the summer working for the Green Giant Canning Company, and I'm saving my money to go back to school, but we had friends from Caruthersville who lived in Chicago [Illinois].  We were only 90 miles, or whatever that is from Chicago, so we came over to Chicago one weekend.  Earlier, I told you that my grandmother lived in Chicago for awhile, a couple of my mother's sisters lived in Chicago for awhile, my oldest brother, Stanley [Jones], lived in Chicago for awhile.  I heard all these stories about Chicago for awhile.  But, I said, "I am in Chicago"--we decided to come over one weekend--said "I am in Chicago."  So, we looked up some homies from Caruthersville.  And I just decided, this is Chicago, and I'm staying here.  So, I didn't go back to school.  I stayed in Chicago.  I had a couple of hundred bucks in my pocket.  I didn't tell my mother until after school had started.  Then I called and told her I decided not to go back to school.  So, I stayed in Chicago for about a year.  I hooked up with a group of guys.  We were actors, singers, dancers, musicians, etc.  We decided, "Hey, let's go out to LA [Los Angeles, California] and knock them dead."  By then, every now and then, you started to see black faces in television programs, doing something other parking cars or waiting tables, and then I got this idea, because I had family out there also, my father's family, who I had not seen since I was four or five years old, and I wanted to see my father's people.  I'm not certain how badly they wanted to see my sweet butt, but I wanted to see them.  So there were all of things going on.  In high school, I was a drummer in the concert band.  I was in the marching band.  I sang in the choir a little bit.  I sang in doo-wop groups.  We had a rock and roll band.  We had a jazz band.  We played school dances at our school and other schools.  I was in plays and musicals and so I had this thing--going to Hollywood [California].  Going to Hollywood.  And, while in Chicago during that period, the movie 'A Raisin In The Sun' was being filmed here at a place called the Kit Kat Club.  It seems to me it was down on 63rd Street, 63rd and Cottage [Grove Avenue], 63rd and something, down in that area.  And a friend and I went down there one day to take a look because I wanted to see this.  I loved the movies.  And nobody--they weren't doing anything.  They were all standing outside with props, with the cameras, and on and on and on.  Never saw Sidney Poitier.  Never saw Ruby Dee.  Never saw anybody.  I was fascinated with it.  So, I hooked up with this group of guys, after almost a year or so in Chicago, we headed west to California, and then from there, I drifted into Arizona.
Speaker 1: Now, you were at Lincoln, how many years?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: Now your mother, is she upset about this whole turn of events?
Speaker 2: She knew I was a gypsy.  Yeah.  She was upset that I dropped out of school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First one in my family to go to college.  That kind of thing.  So yes, she was.  She was not too pleased, but it was a little late then.  Because, as I said, school had started.  And my mother always knew that she could count on me, that I was not going to go crazy, so I'm not certain that she was too worried.  I don't recall her ever expressing any grave concerns other than, constantly asking me "Are you certain?"  "Do you know what you're doing here?"  That kind of thing.  So, she really was not really too worried about me.  She figured I'd be okay.
Story_ID: 11846
Speaker 1: So, you're out in L.A [Los Angeles, California]?  Right, L.A.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this whole, are you enjoying it?  Are you performing?  Are you having, you know, odd jobs?
Speaker 2: The guys and I, they were three in the back, five guys, we arrived in Los Angeles like on a Friday.  Had a great time.  We hooked up with people from Caruthersville [Missouri].  We are all over the world. We hooked up with people from Caruthersville that Friday--partied.  That Saturday, we partied.  That Sunday, we partied.  That Monday, four of the guys said "Hey, we're ready to head back home now."  "We've only been here for four days."  "Nothing is happening in L.A. for us."  "Are you crazy, we just got here.  We haven't done a thing."  So, four of the guys loaded the gear in the car and headed back to the Midwest.  Two of us stayed.  That scared me.  That was a little frightening.  And I did odd jobs, washing dishes in restaurants and busboying in restaurants, those kinds of things.  I did one semester, took a couple of classes at Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California].  Wherever I was, when I was going through my knocking around phase, I always made it a point to pick up a few hours if I could.  And so, I did that, auditioned, did some auditions out there.  Never got any work.  Didn't get any closer to show business than the shine man in Union Station [Chicago, Illinois].  But, it was a very good experience for me.  It was a very good--being on my own that far from home and at least feeding myself.  Not eating as well as I would have at home.  My birthday dinner, for my twenty first birthday, instead of my mom asking me "What do you want to eat for your birthday?", I was living in a hotel for retired railroad workers that always reeked of pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and cigars in the lobby.  I had a little black and white television set with a wire hanger that was an antenna that had a vertical roll every thirteen or fourteen seconds.  And I said "Ok, here I am now.  This is my birthday, and I wish I was home," but I had a dinner of sardines, Pepsi, and a cupcake. That was my twenty first birthday dinner.  And I was real scared that night.  But the following morning I was okay.  Got out and started looking for a job.  Eventually, like I said, I found a couple of jobs, washing dishes, busing tables, whatever would come along.  I did that for awhile, and had friends living over in Phoenix, Arizona, and I started to going to Phoenix on the weekend and just kind of fell in love with it, because Phoenix, while a large city and a major city, back then had a nice small town atmosphere to it.  And I met some nice people, and Arizona State University [Tempe, Arizona] is next door and one thing led to another and on and on and on.
Speaker 1: So, this is what year?
Speaker 2: 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1962.  So, you're in Phoenix, and you decided you're gonna, how long are you there before you go back to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did a lot of hanging out in Phoenix.  By then, '62, '62 [1962], I found a job, worked for awhile at a cotton compress in Glendale, Arizona, which is a suburb of Phoenix.  I don't know whether you've ever seen a cotton compress, but a cotton compresses does exactly what it says, compresses cotton.  Picks a bale of cotton which measures four feet across, compresses it down, so it measures two feet across, then they can load more cotton into the, whatever way they're shipping it.  So, I did that for awhile.  Then I got a job in a department store in downtown Phoenix.  Did that for awhile, knocking around back and forth, back and forth--a couple of years maybe.  Maybe more.  Three years.  I wasn't really to go back to school really.  I took a couple of classes at Phoenix City College.  Always taking classes.  Something to do at night.  I took a couple of night classes at Arizona State University.  Something to do, but I wasn't ready to go to school full time.  I was busy doing other things, mainly working, mainly working, and going through experiences that I had not gone through before.
Speaker 1: Were you getting married at that time?
Speaker 2: Not then.  That came a year or so later.

Speaker 1: How did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: How did I meet my wife?  We met at a dance.  I'd gone to a dance with a friend of mine.  I didn't want to go to a dance.  I wanted to go to the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars] Club with the grown people, but he said the college kids were going to be at this dance in the park that night.  So I said, "Fine.  We'll go over to this college dance for a bit.  Then we'll go over to the VFW.  Do a little hanging and listening to the music there."  So, at this dance, I see this guy that I'd ran into before.  I didn't care for him.  I didn't really like him.  I didn't like him at all.  One of the three people on this earth that I've ever encountered whom I did not like.  I don't remember why I didn't like him, but that's usually the way it is when you get older.  But he's dancing with this girl and she's kind of holding back off from him a little bit.  I said "There's that guy."  So I go over, "Pardon me, there, buddy."  And at first he said, "No."  I said, "C'mon man." Tapped him on the shoulder a second time, cut in on him.  And we got married.  Not he and I, she and I.  And that's how I met her, at a dance.  And a couple of years or so later, we were married.
Story_ID: 11848
Speaker 1: When did you go to Arizona State [University, Tempe, Arizona], you said in what year?
Speaker 2: I have to think about this one now.  '66 [1966], '67 [1967].  Because just before going to Arizona State, I was managing a store for, there was a small chain of discount stores in Phoenix [Arizona], for those stores like Circuit City, those kind of stores, where they sold refrigerators, major appliances,  small appliances, radios, televisions, etc. lawnmowers, those kinds of things, at a discounted price.  And I went to work for them as a salesman in 1960, I don't know, '65 [1965], let's say '64 [1964], '65 [1965], and then a couple of years later, I worked my way up to store manager and then I decided that I wanted to go back to school and study communications.  And I quit that job and went back to school on a full-time basis.  By then I was married and had a son, little Robert.
Speaker 1: But how did this studying communications come about?
Speaker 2: I knew you were going to ask me that.  Well, while working as a salesman for Milt's stores in Phoenix, again a small chain of discount stores--we advertised very heavily, but we would nail many of these advertised items down to the floor.  We advertised a clock radio in this case for $9.99.  The idea being, you don't sell a person a $9.99 clock radio unless they specifically want it, move them up to a $29.99 clock radio.  Well, I moved this man up to a $49 clock radio, and when I finished he said, "You know, you're a very good salesman."  And I said, "Thanks a lot."  And he introduced himself, gave me his card, and he was the Vice President, General Manager of a small black radio station in Phoenix, the only black radio station in Phoenix, but he said "I'm looking for somebody to sell advertising on a part-time basis and I think you're the guy."  And so I went to work, part time, selling radio time, selling radio air time, and that kind of, I'd always been interested in radio, television, that kind of stuff, the movies, I told you that, that kind of perked my interest.  And so, going through the an Arizona State University catalog of classes, I came across one or two radio-related classes.  I know I didn't want to be a radio time salesman, but I thought, "Hey.  There could be something in this." So I started looking into it.  I took a couple of more classes at Arizona State University, and then decided to become a full-time student at Arizona State.
Speaker 1: And what is your wife [Cora Jones Petty] thinking about this whole movement to communications?  Does she understand it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you thinking at the time, you like, you like the sales part, you weren't thinking of sales?
Speaker 2: No.  Not sales.  No.  At the time, I decided that I wanted to work on the, once I made the decision, I was interested in the technical side of the business.  I wanted to work in television as a director and a producer.  My mom [Hazel Bell Petty] and I used to watch the 'Johnny Carson Show' together five nights a week.  I would be out with my friends, and I would suddenly say, "Oh, I have to go home.  Johnny Carson is coming on."  They said, "Where's he going?"  They said, "He's going to go home and watch television with his mom."  And for whatever reasons, I discovered that Johnny Carson's brother, Dick Carson, was the director of the 'Johnny Carson Show' then, and I just can't tell you why, but I wanted to be a television director at that point.  By the time, I had started taking some classes on a part-time basis at Arizona State.  And they did not have a journalism television, radio journalism department.  We had radio television production departments, so I started studying radio and television production, the technical end of the business.  I really had no interest in being in front of the camera.  I was much more interested in being behind the camera.  So, I majored in radio television productions.  My wife was with me all the way because she saw that it was something that I wanted to do.  She knew that I was not a frivolous person.  That if I quit this job where I making boo-hoo money, about eleven grand a year, which was my life's ambition to earn eleven thousand dollars a year, but to give that up, then I'm married, got a house, and on and on--my wife worked also, my wife was a teacher, is a teacher.  She teaches the little kids, preschool, kindergarten.  But she said ,Well go ahead.  Give it a shot.  Because I don't want you lying around here moaning about what you should've done, could've done, would've done."  So, it worked out just fine.
Story_ID: 11849
Speaker 1: Are you working at the station all the time that you were in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You go to school full time?
Speaker 2: I go to school full time, not working at all.  But there was a live program on KTVK, the PBS [Public Broadcasting System] station in Phoenix [Arizona], the education channel, and they had political and other guests on.  The show came on Sunday nights.  And one minute I would sit down and I'm watching the show.  It was a very interesting program, but I would see that maybe a hand come in, someone had come in and give him a glass of water or something, something, something, and they would say "If you have questions, call this number and our volunteers will be happy to take that, take the message or you can whatever the question there.  And so, I went over and volunteered.  I'd quit my job, gone back to school full time, went over to the PBS station.  The station is on campus, on Arizona State University's campus, KAET, educational PBS station.  I went over to volunteer.  They said "No, we don't need any volunteers."  I'm offering my services for free.  They can hire me because I'm cheap.  They said "No.  We don't have an opening."  Back and forth and back and forth.  Then finally they called a few weeks later.  And then I worked over there as a volunteer.  I did that for a couple of months, and then they put me on staff.  $16.50 a week.  One thing kept leading to another, and another, and another.  And I'm behind the camera, cameraman, sound man, lighting, a little directing.  Enough directing after awhile for me to know that it wasn't what I was going to do in life, because I was horrible, just an awful director.  They'd say "camera one," I'd punch up camera five, "camera five," I'd punch up camera three.
Speaker 1: So, you're really unusual with people in the business in the way you came out.  I mean in some respects.  Not many people go from technical.
Speaker 2: To the other side.
Speaker 1: Right, and to that side.  That's not, that transition doesn't happen all that much.  I mean, not intentionally.
Speaker 2: Well, I understand.  I understand.  But also, when I consider my background, song and dance man. I wrote for the high school newspaper, plays and stuff like that so, while the camera and the light and the mikes did cause me to inhale, I was not overwhelmed, because I had, growing up, I learned to focus myself and to sing the song, recite the poem, do whatever it is because you are in charge.  It's really your show.  The camera is not in charge, you are.  So, to make that transition, you know, make it overnight, it wasn't necessarily an easy transition to make, I wasn't that frightened by it, and I thought "Maybe this is the way I can go, because I've always done these kinds of things."  And just fooling around, playing, having fun, whatever.  So, it's just a matter of sucking my gut up and saying that camera lens is not going to bite me, and I can talk to it. I discovered that I could talk to it.
Story_ID: 11850
Speaker 1: You graduate and then is that when--yes--no. Is that when you got hired by KOOL?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I was out of school when I was hired by KOOL, KOOL TV in Phoenix [Arizona], the CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] station.  While working at the PBS [Public Broadcasting System] station doing the technical stuff, my junior year of college [Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona], we had a talk show, a campus talk show, a kind of variety show, and the guy was the, there was a host and a co-host, co-hostess, a guy and a lady doing it, and they got ready to do the show, and they couldn't find the guy.  They couldn't find the host.  It turned out he volunteered for the [U.S.] Army to go to Vietnam and he didn't tell any of us, didn't tell anybody.  But we need a host right now.  We need somebody to host this show tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.  We're taping.  One of the classes I took involved going on camera, reading, ad-libbing, writing commercials, those kind of things, a typical college class in that regard, but I aced them with that on-camera stuff.  And I wrote my own commercial, and I did my commercial without too many flubs, you know, and that kind of thing, and I wasn't frightened to death, and I was one of just half a dozen students who did as well.  But while they're looking for a host that day, somebody to come in and host, somebody said, "Call Robert Petty.  He did alright on that commercial.  Call him."  "Can you come in and host this show?"  "Yeah.  Fine."  I'm a little nervous about it, but, come on, it's just college stuff, you know.  So I did it and they said, you'll only do it one week, because I think the rule was you had to be a senior in order to be talent at that station, because again we are a college station, despite the fact that we are PBS, and that was my junior year.  They said "Next week, we'll find somebody else to do it."  So, I did it the following week, and the following week, and the following week, until school was out.  So I had experience by then going in front of the camera, and I'm hammin' up, you now, I'm thinking I could sing doo-wop, I'm hammin' up.  I was thinking I could pull this off.  So, I did that for awhile, and that summer would have been the summer, the summer of 1967, I reckon.  A friend and I, he was studying radio television also, decided to sell ourselves.  We borrowed a camera from campus, wrote some stuff out, wrote some script.  He's the cameraman.  I'm the talent, and we went to every television station and sounds.  I'm the talent.  He's the cameraman, and we done that back and forth.  Well, the people at the independent station at the time, I think it's the equivalent of WGN Television here in Chicago [Illinois], KPHO [Phoenix, Arizona], the independent, offered me a part-time job doing technical stuff, and I went to work for them on a part-time basis.  I was still in school, and I worked for them on a part-time basis until I graduated.  Somewhere along there, I went from the studios and the technical stuff over to the newsroom, the news department, and then the following year or so I went to work for KOOL TV, the CBS station in Phoenix, and I worked there until I came here to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now, so you, at KOOL TV, you became on air, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  On a full-time basis.
Story_ID: 11851
Speaker 1: Were you ever active in any of the Civil Rights Movement and things like that?  Or was, you know,  Phoenix [Arizona] a place, you know, I was from a little town, I'm not saying things didn't happen. You know--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stuff happens.
Speaker 1: --people, but--. What--and how was this also, you know you're a black man anchor?
Speaker 2: In the 1960s.  We had not seen much of that before.  Who is he?
Speaker 1: I mean you make it seem so easy, as if it were effortless but I'm just saying, you know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was very frightened, very frightened at one point.  When I was working for KPHO [Phoenix, Arizona] doing the technical stuff was when I really came to realize that I was not going to be a television director, and I said to myself that I'd made a very serious mistake.  What am I going to do all this stuff, if I can't put it to use?  But again, I'm working for KPHO, the independent station.  They had a very small news department.  There were only four people in the news department, plus the weather lady.  I say it in that manner because someone else prepared the weather and the weather lady simply came in and read it on camera and that stuff.  But, while working in the productions for KPHO, I watched the four people over in the newsroom in the studio, I'm standing there with my hands in my pocket.  I've done the lights.  The lights are set.  I've clipped the microphones on.  What do I do now?  Stand there and watch the people talk or stand there and watch the show being done.  And I'm the type of person who gets bored rather easily, and I discovered that I didn't like standing in the studio watching two people talk.  But these people over in the newsroom, they're always running around the corners, bumping into each other, "Fire!  Governor's coming!  Mayor's holding a news conference!"  I've always had an interest in news.  I started reading newspapers when we were little boys.  Our mom [Hazel Bell Petty] started us off reading the comics and then slowly we worked our way to the sports page, and we always listened to the news on the radio, and watched the news on TV.  Mom didn't say "Alright kids.  Let's get together and watch the news now."  But I've always been a news junkie for whatever reason.  I remember the old newsmen, you know, back in the day, but watching these guys at KPHO news department, I got interested in these guys, because they weren't standing around.  They're running and doing things.  Not so much interested in being on, being talent, being on camera, but suddenly I started thinking about the news.  I wrote for the 'State Press', Arizona State University [Tempe, Arizona] Press.  I wrote for the newspaper in high school [Washington High School, Caruthersville, Missouri].  The one year we had while I was there.  I wrote for the newspaper in college.  So, I always had this thing with it.  And I'm thinking, I'm gonna try this.  Well, since we had such a small news department, there was no one in the newsroom in the mornings, and we had teletype machines, Associated Press, United Press International and all these machines are clickity clacketing and clickity clacketing all day and all night and if there's no one in the newsroom to clean off the wire machines to gather up this paper, there's a mountain of paper on the floor in the newsroom every morning.  We had photo fax machines where pictures were sent over the wires, pictures all over.  And so, the news director said, "Listen.  Can you come in and just clean off these wire machines, rip the copy, cut the copy up so that there are local news stories in one pile, national news stories in the second pile, world news stories and international news stories in the third pile.  And if there are pictures that relate to the stories, arrange those."  That was my entry into the news department, so I started doing that, and one little job led to another and another and another.  And eventually he said, "You want to learn this business?"  And I said, "Tom Sherlock," the news director, "I want to learn this business, because I'm very bored over in that studio,"  and I don't know where I was going in that studio, and I had no great interest by now to go any place.  But news, that was something different.  So I went to work for the news department.  Everybody would assign themselves their own stories.  We were all assignment editors. We were all cameramen.  After I would assign myself a story, I would load my camera gear up, hop in the company car, go out and do my interviews, back and forth, turn the camera away over here, hitch my tie up, get it lined up right, put a mike on, turn the camera on, run around to the front of the camera and do my on-camera stuff. Take it back to the station, process the film--we were shooting film then--process my own film, write my story, edit my film. Doing it all. And loving it.
Story_ID: 11852
Speaker 1: I don't remember who--what black person was on the air at Channel 5 [WMAQ, Chicago, Illinois], perhaps Russ Ewing, maybe Harry Porterfield at Channel 2 [WBBM, Chicago].  I don't know over at Channel 9 [WGN, Chicago].  I can't think.  Lloyd Brown, I remember seeing Lloyd Brown, a black cat, mainly radio, but he did some on-air work over at WGN, so maybe every station had one black guy, maybe two.  1971, '72 [1972], '73 [1973], something like that.
Speaker 2: Now the decision to come to WLS [Chicago], was that something that you got recruited for or that you sought out?
Speaker 1: Oh, I hustled that one.  I was always hustling.  I hustled that one also.  But I came to Chicago to study at the University of Chicago.  I came to Chicago from the CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] station [KOOL] in Phoenix [Arizona].  I took leave of absence as an urban journalism fellow at the University of Chicago in the University's Urban Journalism Fellowship Program.  The program brought journalists, primarily print journalists from around the world, around the country, from around the world, to the University of Chicago to study, get away from work, study some aspect of urban affairs.  Urban affairs--because urban affairs, something was being looked at in a very different way.  Back in 1970, 1971.  The Great Society, [U.S.] President Lyndon [B.] Johnson. There was a very, very strong effort going on for social changes in the country, obviously, and many newspapers, especially, began placing a great deal of emphasis on urban events, urban affairs.  Working for the CBS station in Phoenix, my news director and his boss told me, "All right, we want you to be our urban affairs guy."  And this is perfect.  For the first time, Phoenix was going to get public transportation, real public transportation.  Phoenix was going to get public housing, real public housing.  And the CBS station in Phoenix management saw the program here at the University of Chicago to have a chance to have a reporter specialize in something and we would be way ahead of the game.  Well, I came here and did my work at the University of Chicago but decided that I would apply for a job here in the city as well.  I wanted to go back to Phoenix.  I loved Phoenix, but also ambition and those kind of things came into play as well.  And so I asked myself, do I want to stay in Phoenix or do I want to make a move to a larger market?  So, I applied at all of the television stations here in Phoenix [sic, Chicago], Channel 9 [WGN], Channel 5 [WMAQ], Channel 2 [WBBM] and Channel 7 [WLS].  I was offered a job over at WBBM, Channel 2.  I was offered a job at WLS television, Channel 7 Eyewitness News.  They were not hiring at Channel 5, WMAQ.  The news director said he liked me and took me to a great lunch.  He said, "I like you and if anything comes up, we'll get you.  We want you."  They were not hiring at WGN, but I took the offer at Channel 7.  It was solid, and I liked the people over there and just went to work there and things worked out pretty good.  I anticipated staying three years.  Twenty-seven years later, I'm still here.  But I wanted to work here three years, get that experience and then teach, then teach at the college level, teach.
Speaker 2: What did you want to teach?
Speaker 1: I was going to teach communications at the college level.
Speaker 2: Now why did you want to teach as opposed to just being on air?  I mean, this is, you know, in our society, the journalist, the news journalist is something that the person had a special role in, and I mean if you were black, that was even more unusual.  It hasn't really much changed, really--(laughs).
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true. Well, I've always been interested in teaching.  I liked teaching.  I always thought that if I could find me a nice, small college in a nice, small town, being a small-town boy, that I would be very happy.  And it would be something meaningful and touching people's lives and what little teaching I'd done up to that point, not a lot.  I've done some substitute teaching.  But I enjoyed it.  I like being around young people.  I like being around the smart ones, the bright ones.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to people talk.  I'd always rather talk then to listen, although you haven't said a word since I've been here.  Really I'd rather listen than to talk, you caught me.  But that was my plan.  When I was at Arizona State University [Tempe, Arizona] studying communications, radio television productions, I had one instructor who had practical experience.  All of my instructors were people who got their knowledge from the books.  With the exception of one of my instructors had some radio experience.  And I thought, well, I could do three years in Chicago and I would have worked for a PBS [Public Broadcasting System] station, or educational station, as they were referred to then, I believe, an independent station, a network affiliate station, KOOL Television in Phoenix, a CBS station, and [Channel 7] Eyewitness News, here in Chicago.  I would've worked for all of them.  Then I could go into a classroom with all this experience that none of my instructors had and that was my plan.  But one thing led to another here in Chicago and I'm still here reporting the news.
Story_ID: 11853
Speaker 1: Oh, stories.  Oh, I don't really know that, as a general assignment street reporter, we cover, those of us, pardon me, who do that, again.  General assignment, street reporters, we cover everything.  I have no specialty.  There have been periods in my career when I was the station's education editor and I covered the [Chicago, Illinois] Board of Education.  When I was a political editor, nothing but city hall, so there've been occasions when I had those assignments, but I prefer being loose and not being locked into every city council meeting, not being locked into every board of education meeting.  I like the streets.  I like being out roaming around.  I prefer stories, my favorite stories are stories that have some significance, but it impacts all of us at one way or another.  It could be a tax bill in Washington [D.C.].  It could be, I don't know, whatever, Lake Michigan's water level is receding.  How does that affect me?  It affects all of us one way or another.  So, I like the challenge, the idea of taking a story and then making it interesting to you, trying to explain to you how it might affect you or your life.  Granted, you know, an accident on the Eden's Expressway doesn't really affect your life directly in that sense, so not every story falls into that category.  But there are people who rely on us.  People who are interested in the day's events and they rely on us to inform them as to what went on regardless as to why they were interested, but they want to know what happened.  They want to watch the news, and we should be very serious about our responsibilities in trying to help keep them informed.
Speaker 2: But what event then is very memorable for you?
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, you say I cover events as they happen, but are there are any that were extremely memorable to you?
Speaker 1: I remember all 4,641 at last count, no.  None really jump--the ones that jump out in my mind, you don't want to really hear about, usually those are the horror stuff, the bad, bad stuff, you know.  But some of the stories that I've done are memorable in their own way.  For example, I don't like especially close quarters. I'm a bit claustrophobic.  Last year, I had to go down in the deep tunnel.  Well, the deep tunnel is how many miles--how many hundred or thousand feet below the earth.  I mean, they go down and then they bored out this tunnel to help relieve flooding in the city and some of the suburban areas, but I'm going down this tunnel, and suddenly we're like in an elevator and it's open and there are about a half a dozen of us, reporters, camera crews, officials, and we got on the hardhats and the rain suits and big boots for the mud and goop that's on there and as we see last of the daylight going down, I thought, uh-oh, it's starting a little close in this elevator.  I remember that very well because I thought I was really going to be frightened being under the earth like that, but it wasn't so bad.  It wasn't so bad.  Those kind of events perhaps stick out in my mind as much or as well as any, just many of the opportunities that I've had, you know, I've sailed on boats.  I've flown in World War II fighter planes.  I've flown with the [U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron] Blue Angels.  That was a little close.  That was a little tight in there.  I didn't do too well on that one.  But I've had the opportunity to go places and do things that I never would have doing anything else.  Memorable story,  I covered the topping out when the last nail was driven or the last bolt turned, topping out the ceremony for the John Hancock building, the day they officially said "That's it.  We're done."  Mayor Daley, not young Mayor Richie [Richard M.] Daley, but his father, Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, was up there and all the politicians, so at the time I believe it was the second tallest building in the world, so I looked around and said, "Look at me.  Bobby Petty in this building, the John Hancock, one of the tallest building's in the world."  I've covered the topping out ceremony of the Sears Tower, so I've been on top of both of those for completion ceremonies.  Those kind of opportunities, you know.  I enjoy those kind of things.  The people that I've met, I can't tell you about that, in that there's so many.  But I remember the events and the things more so than the people, for whatever reasons, my nature I guess.
Speaker 2: Now was Paul Hall, was that any memorable or not or was--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Whew, Paul Hall was very much so, very much so, a criminal trial.  A man whom many of us supported one way or another and his efforts to help adolescents, young children, Paul Hall's Boys' Club, Paul Hall's Marching Band and Bugle Corps and on and on and on.  Many years ago during the [Jimmy] Carter Administration, they were, Paul Hall's Boys' Club Drum and Bugle Corps, invited to Washington, D.C. to do something with [U.S.] President Jimmy Carter, I don't know what it was, march in a parade.  I went along.  That was my job covering, that was my assignment, so I had my eye on and familiar with the workings of that for many, many years.  To say that I was disappointed that Reverend Hall was accused of sexually abusing some of the children that was put in his charge by the state of Illinois, of course, I was very disappointed.  And then I was assigned to cover that story and do I say to myself I know him too well.  I won't be able to cover this story.  I'm the one you want on it because I know the cat.  But, very difficult for us to cover.  Very difficult for us to cover.  And those of us who were, the journalists who were assigned to cover that story, many of us had a very difficult time with it, because you sit in a courtroom and you hear what is said by the victims and on and on and on.  You say okay.  But then outside the courtroom, many of his reporters, members of his church say "Well, those four boys are lying."  Well.  So, yes, sometimes those stories hit very close to home and the Paul Hall trial, the Paul Hall story, is one of those that hit very, very close to home for me because as I said, I'd known the man for years and supported him for years.  If something that was going on involving the Paul Hall Boy's Club and Drum and Bugle Corps, and I was not going to cover the story, then I would say to the assignment editor but that's a story that we need to cover because this man is doing something that is terrific.  He is touching the lives of hundreds of children, so I took it kind of personal.
Speaker 2: [off-camera discussion]
Speaker 1: That brings me to the whole subject, because the press says, you know, you have tremendous power, you as the press representative, of, you know an institution, broadcast outlet.  And so, here you had, you know, I'm sure in your, you had the ability to give within the  of an instruction to say you know, this should be covered or you know, I think this is good or whatever.  And so, that is, you know, sort of many a key example of here you have supported him and then this person has let you down and you must have felt wrong in many ways, you felt betrayed.
Speaker 2: Yes, in a sense.  However, simply because I felt that way personally, I can't let that interfere with my work, and my work is to go into the courtroom and to tell you what happened in that courtroom.  To tell you what was said or done in that courtroom, and I'm serious enough about my work, so that whatever I tell you, to the best of my ability, to the best of my knowledge, that is what was done.  That is what was said.  I won't play around, fool around, because I don't like the cut of your coat.  I'll just give you a straight shot.  So, while on one hand, my emotions there are very, very mixed, on the other hand, I can't let that get in the way of what work I have to do and hopefully I did not.

Speaker 1: You've been in this business such a long time, and the news agency, the news business has changed dramatically during that time and I'm wondering how you're dealing with the industry as it is right now versus how it was, sort of, gone are the Walter Cronkite days, and I just want to know how are you dealing with that?  You know, how are you dealing with it?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of changes have taken place in the business.  There was a period, a time in the business, when I first got in this business where if you wanted to play the race card I'm certain you could have, because being a black man in television news was certainly, certainly most unusual.  Today?  Ah, who cares, literally.  I've had people who called me [Chicago, Illinois television reporter] Chuck Goudie.  I've had people who called me [Chicago, television reporter] Walter Jacobson.  "Hey Walter."  So, you know, that novelty has worn.  We all look alike, all the news guys look alike, I reckon, to some, but that novelty has long, long worn off, but the changes that are taking place to someone who is serious about what we do, I don't especially like them.  You know I like, one of the things that has happened in our business, is that, when I first got into this business, I was told it's a young man's business.  It's a young man's game.  Well, you can't say that anymore.  It's a young person's game now.  But young people do drive the business, and we hire the people.  I have no problem with a young person tell me what to do, give me my assignment, give me my orders.  This is the way we want the story whatever.  But I do have a problem having to take orders from a young person who has not done very much.  You know, to tell me to go out and find construction workers at 4:00 in the afternoon, 5:00 in the evening, they don't work that late.  You should know that.  To tell me that I can get to O'Hare [International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] in an hour from downtown at 5:00 in the evening, it doesn't work that way.  And I've been told that because the person who is my editor or whomever, they're new to Chicago.  That's one of the problems with the business.  We seem to be hiring them too young and bringing them up too quickly.  I've been on assignment, out in the streets, out in the field with reporters who are more concerned with their hair than they were with, let's get this interview here before we do anything.  I'm very suspect of a reporter who asks, "How did I look?" as opposed to asking, "how did that sound?"  My first question is, "How did it sound?  Does that make sense to you?"  More and more, we're seeing that kind of thing.  I'm not certain that--I'm not certain how good your journalistic credentials have to be to get a job in Chicago today. I do know if you could do a live shot, if you could go on the air live and handle yourself, your chances of getting a job are very, very good.  Now whether or not you can construct a proper sentence, I don't think that's critical anymore.  I would rather hire someone who can construct a proper sentence.  I would, because I don't want the audience, I'm not talking to people in the audience who are concerned about someone looks or how I look, I'm talking to people in the audience who want to know what the hell happened out there.  That's who I'm talking to.  That's who my work is directed towards.
Speaker 1: So does that bother--the changes--so what do you think the future of the news industry is, in its current form?  I mean it has changed dramatically.
Speaker 2: It has changed dramatically.  Keep in mind, also, when I came to Chicago in August 1971 there were four television stations, you have four options for your television news.  How many do you have now?  Twenty-four?  Thirty-four?  How many now?  Local television stations, cable, whatever, whatever, whatever, so there are a lot more options now, so to say that, you know, we're going to hell in a hand basket.  You can't say that.  I can't say that.  Because if you're serious about television news, then you will find the place where, you know, that you can get your news from.  Even if you have to channel surf, which is what I do.  If there's something going on, and I want to know about it, I'll just jump from channel to channel to channel.  I won't rely on one.  There was a time where people would say, "Well, you can always rely on Eyewitness News [WLS, Chicago].  That's where I get all my news, from Eyewitness News."  Well, nowadays you have to look around and shop around.  Look around, shop around, and find the outlet that's best for you.  Other changes, I talked a little bit a while ago about being my own assignment editor, cameraperson, lighting person, sound person, on and on and on.  We're going to work our way back to that.  The American Federation of Radio and Broadcast Artists, Television Radio Broadcast Artists in Chicago, AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists], the union that we belong to, those of us who work in front of the camera, and in front of the microphones, are busy now going through the negotiations with the various stations in Chicago, and one of the things that Channel 7 [WLS, Chicago] is asking for and other stations also, I'm certain, management, they're saying that we want the reporters to operate the equipment.  Very slowly, the other unions have been fighting and holding back on that but the day will come, if not this contract, the next contract.  If something happens, the reporter should have the authority to pick up the camera and continue to take pictures.  You can't do that now, but eventually that is going to happen and we'll be back to having one person do it all, and since I came through that door, I would prefer not going out of that door.  I like to get out before we work our way back to that.  But the business has changed.  The people who run the business, you know, there was a time when my side of the business, the news side of the business was ran by journalists.  That's not necessarily true.  I think more and more now they're business people.  Nothing wrong with that, somebody got to take care of the books.  But it's a little bit difficult for me to take order from people who don't really, don't really know.

Speaker 1: You've made it seem all easy, I was going to say glib about your progress through.  It was like oh I did this, I did that, and I sort of ended up, (laughing) you know, on network news.
Speaker 2: You know, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did, at one point, you know, you didn't say you hustled, but, you know, I always had a plan.  I can't remember but when you say you came to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So my question is, you know,  for an industry that's still, and I, you know, know you're still a member of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], but for an industry that still has not seen a lot of progress, I mean, it's one thing to say it's not a big deal that I'm a black person on the news.  But still there is not the numbers, you know--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the number is getting smaller in some regards.  There is some information, I can't remember, some news gathering organization, Scripps Howard [News Service], something like, that last month, the most recent, a survey of the most recent numbers of minorities who are working in this business and the numbers last year down from the previous year from the previous year from the year before that.  And the numbers were not a lot but fewer.  And some experts say, "Well, there are fewer opportunities now.  You know, people can get in the dot com game and get rich," and whatever, whatever.  So a lot of bright, clever, aggressive people and I really put emphasis on aggressive people who might have tried journalism in one form or another perhaps have gone in other directions, but what was the question?
Speaker 1: Do you think this is an industry that black people should still pursue?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.  This is an industry that black people should pursue very much so.  Very much so.  Because there are young people out who are as I was when I was a young cat, you know, interested in the newspapers and the news, not ever dreaming "I'm going to try journalism someday," but they write poems and they write songs and have this aggressiveness that is necessary, I think.  They're out there.  And the hands of time are not going back.  News directors and others now know that black men and women can do this job as well as white men and woman.  They certainly didn't know that in my day when I first started off.  "Well, he could never do that."  So, that kind of thinking hopefully has dissipated.  So, yeah, plenty of room.  Plenty of room.  If it's something you want to try and it's a terrific way to earn a living, that being doing what you want to do.  So plenty of room.  And I encourage on one hand, give it a shot.  On the other hand, I say it is as crowded as the dickens because people see it as glamorous work and it is not glamorous by any structure of the imagination except for those rare moments.  Nothing glamorous about watching the fire department cut people out of a crashed vehicle, nothing pretty about that.  You earn it then.  And you have to be ready for that kind of stuff also.  That kind of stuff also.  So, yes, young black people should get themselves together and take over Bob Petty's job as soon as he hangs it up (laughs). It's there,
Story_ID: 11856
Speaker 1: You're still very youthful.  What are the things that you still do want to do in your life.  I mean you've been pretty targeted for a period of time.  So, what other roads haven't you traveled is what I'm trying to ask?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really have a lot of things that I would like to do.  At some point I would like to go back to school again. I would like to know about Greek mythology. I've long had an interest, interest in that.  I would like to take some classes in general.  I'd like to go to culinary school.  Not that I have any intention of getting a job in a restaurant or doing any more cooking around the house perhaps, but I do like to cook and I have cooked since I was a little boy, and I've have had culinary classes and classes at cooking school and I enjoyed that immensely and those kinds of things.  I like walking over to the Lake [Michigan].  I love Chicago [Illinois], downtown Chicago.  I could spend a lifetime just walking around downtown.  I'm very interested in Chicago museums, I would like to study.  There are some museums, The Art Institute of Chicago, I have never in my life gone to the Art Institute as a regular person.  I've always gone there working.  It could well be I want to learn every square foot of that place, I doubt it, but there's still there's things to do, places to go that will keep me occupied for a long time.  I must have two hundred books that I have not read just stacked away at my house, tucked away one place or another, one thousand movies on tape that I intend to watch every one of them.  I like sitting in my backyard.  I would like to get in my car between the spring and the fall and drive to a baseball game, every major league park in the country, national league park in the country, I would like to do that.  Go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for a long weekend and do nothing but eat Philadelphia cheese steak sandwiches.  Nothing specific.  Just whatever comes along that I want to do.  I don't write well enough to do any books and novels.  I have no intention of doing 'Me and Eyewitness News'.  I'm going to let somebody else write that book.  I just like special things I want to do.  Sit in my backyard.  Nothing special.
Speaker 1: [Off-camera discussion]
Speaker 2: Well, let me just finish the thought on the future.  On a serious basis, I would hope that, I told you earlier that at one point in my career I was interested teaching and I have done some teaching at the college level, since, while here in Chicago.  But I would hope to be able to share some of what I've been able to pick up with kids perhaps at the high school level, Hyde Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], for example.  At one point, a very nice television radio production department, I could share some things with young people in that manner.  CABJ [Canadian Association for Black Journalists], for example, the black journalists, the work that they do with the high school students, become more involved, more active in doing.  Those kind of things, just to kind of share a little bit, and besides, I like young people and I like talking with them but primarily listening to them.  So I would like to do more of that kind of thing, working with young people.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be or what do you want to be remembered for?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: He couldn't sing, he couldn't dance, but he paid his bills on time.  I have no idea. (Laughs)  It was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell. I don't know.
Speaker 1: Have you ever performed in musical theater or can you do a song, a little line of one of your favorite songs?  No, I'm serious.
Speaker 2: No way, my union forbids it.
Speaker 1: Oh, no they don't forbid it for a  project like this.
Speaker 2: I don't move well anymore. Bad hip, bad knees. I don't move well anymore.
Speaker 1: How about singing?
Speaker 2: And I've never had a singing voice.  I was always writing the songs, and the guy in the background just kind of mumbling along.  Those were my jobs, you know, but never a lead singer or anything like that, no.  No. No.  But I do appreciate the opportunity (laughs), but you'll never see that.  Thank you very much.
