Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Vernellia Ruth Randall [HistoryMaker Vernellia Randall], V-E-R-N-E-L-L-I-A, Randall, R-A-N-D-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind your first name?
Speaker 2: You know, (laughter) no and yes.  I always wondered what my first name was about, and I've never been able to find anybody; up until the starting of the Internet, I've never met anybody with my name.  Now supposedly, my, my dad [Ernest Randall], it's the name of my, my dad's, one of my dad's girlfriend, but I don't believe that, 'cause I can't imagine any woman who would name their girl child after her husband's ex-girlfriend.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mary Hall Randall] have anything to say about that, or--
Speaker 2: My mother died in--when I was seven years old, and so I never got to talk with her about the name.  And nobody else seems to know where the name came from.  It may be a derivative of Vernell, which is a popular southern name for boys around the time that I was born.  There is one--since I--since the, since the advent of the Internet, I have occasionally gone on to see if I could find other people with my name, and recently I found another Vernellia.  But so, right now there appears to be two of us in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It, it seems to indicate some kind of a lush growth or vernee- you know, like a verdant or you know, or verde and green, you know, and that sort of thing.  So--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I haven't, I haven't been able to--I looked it up in, you know, the names books that tell you the meanings of names.  It's not listed, you know (laughter).  So I, I just put it in to so see if it comes up in a language.  It doesn't come up, so I, I don't know where or how my mother and father got the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My--March the 6th, 1948; and I was born in Gladewater, Texas.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: G-L-A-D-E-W-A-T-E-R, it's one word, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a law professor.
Story_ID: 351975
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions we always ask; management compels me to ask them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere that's not hot, has water and mountains.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No struggle, no progress.
Story_ID: 351976
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then your father's [Ernest Randall] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mary Pauline Hall [Mary Hall Randall].
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-A-U-L-I-N-E, Hall, H-A-L-L.  I'm sorry.  I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know what, I should have brought papers with me if you were gonna ask me to remember things like that.
Speaker 1: If you can get us roughly there.
Speaker 2: My mother was born in 1921, and she was born somewhere in Texas.  I'm not quite sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe White Oak [Texas], Tyler [Texas], that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother [James Randall] does have--I knew I should have had him email me the family history.  He, he's the family historian, and he's got a document where he keeps all this stuff.
Speaker 1: Well, we're just trying to get some of the stories in the family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so much.  And you know, I think if anybody was, was researching you or trying to research that part of Texas, they probably could dig and--
Speaker 2: Find and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --find the information.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that's, you know.  So, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  I mean, how far back can you--do you trace them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We can--
Speaker 1: --and what do you know about them?
Speaker 2: We can go back to my great-grandparents and probably further this--there's someone on my family who's doing a family history that goes back further.  My, my grandmother was--her, her--okay.  My grandfather was Jesse Hall, and my grandmother was Maude Hall, Maude McGill Hall.  And, and my--her, Maude's, grandfa- parents were James McGill and--oh, what was her mother's name?  Magoo [ph.].  I'm, I'm--my great-grandmother [Francis Craddock McGill], I'm forgetting the name.  My grandparents--my mother's side of the family, is, is--has a significant Indian [Native American] mix.  They lived in White Oaks [sic. White Oak, Texas], and White Oaks is a little town, a little backwoods community outside of Tyler, Texas.  And it was like five families, the McGills, the, the Halls, the Magoos, and they all lived back up in there. And the story has it that my grand--my great-grandfather, was more Native American than he was black but was part black and Native American; did not like the family to deal with white people.  So they have moved out into this--I mean it was real, it's really, if you, if--when I can--when I say out in the country, I mean you drive out fifty miles, you turn off a road, you go another ten miles, you turn off more road, and then there's this narrow little road.  And so you're really back out in the country where there's--where, you know, nobody would know how to get to you unless they knew you were there.  My grandfather--my great-grandfather had a lot of land.  And he divided his land up among all his children.  He had thirteen.  And so they all ended up living together in that White Oak area together around each other.  Whatever level of Indian my family was, they never registered because my grandfather would not, not have it and--my great-grandfather would not have it.  And in fact, there's a story about my grandmother running off the BIA [Bureau of Indian Affairs] agent with a, with a shotgun.  And the BIA agent came to the door when she was a young adult and, and kept (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the Bureau of Indian Affairs?
Speaker 2: Bureau of Indian Affairs--trying to get her to register.  Then her--and my grand--great-grandfather had instilled in her the idea that registering was nothing but the government's way to keep track of them and that they weren't to do that.  And she ran the BIA agent off with a shotgun.  My fam- they were farmers.  They farmed their own land.  I mean they weren't--they were land owners, but they weren't rich.  They--I mean, I mean they were richer than people that didn't have any land, but you know, they had a lot of children, and they raised their children on their farm.  And they grew everything they needed.  And, and they sold stuff in town in, in, in Tyler and in Mount Pleasant [Texas], and then they raised their children back out in that area.
Story_ID: 351977
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother went to nursing school, was an LPN [licensed practical nurse].  Maude Hall [Maude McGill Hall] went to nursing school, was an LPN.  I don't know about my grandfather's [Jesse Hall] educational background.  But she didn't actually practice nursing very long.  She ultimately ended up just being--I hate to say housewife because I feel like that, that implies something different.  A housewife in the middle class is like someone who sort of keeps the house and you know, just kind of take care of the children.  But my grandmother was a farmer's wife, which meant she helped farm, so she was a farmer and a housewife and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's a different meaning today--
Speaker 1: It has a different meaning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) --for a lot of people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for a lot of people.  But she didn't work outside her farm and her house.  And my grandfather worked small jobs to earn money to--you know, he would--mill jobs and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Is there a story about where she went to nursing school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I, I don't--
Speaker 2: Or, or how she--
Speaker 1: --know
Speaker 2: I, I imagine there's probably some drama there 'cause there were probably very few black nurses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I, I'm sure there's some drama 'cause you're talking about 1900, before my mother [Mary Hall Randall] was born.  My mother was born in 1925, so--no, 1921, so my grandmother had to go to nursing school somewhere between 1900 and 1921.  You know, so I'm sure there is some drama, although I do health nursing, and I know that there was--one of the things that we have lost as a community is, due to integration, is all of the schools that were available to train blacks, not just, you know, colleges, but--not just high schools and, and, and, and elementary schools, but there were nursing schools.
Speaker 2: I just wondered if she, she went to Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal & Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] or Bishop [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas] or, or Texas Southern [Houston Colored Junior College; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: One of those.
Speaker 1: I'm sure there had to be a school of col- colored, a school for colored, a nursing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some in--
Speaker 1: --school for colored because--
Speaker 2: --Oklahoma too.  You know, I just wondered which one of those (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know; and that's an interesting question.  I, I don't know. So that, I mean, that basically--my, so with my mother's side of the family, that's my--that's what I know about my, my mother's--the--how far back I can go with my mother's family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 351978
Speaker 1: Now did you know your [maternal] grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew my grandparents well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Jesse [Jesse Hall] and, and Maude Hall [Maude McGill Hall].
Speaker 1: Did they have any good stories to tell you coming up?
Speaker 2: You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or even bad stories, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I have to admit that because of where I was in my own life too and because of the time, I didn't really--my mother [Mary Hall Randall] had died, and I was living with foster parents who--and I didn't actually--I wasn't emotionally into asking about stories and stuff.  I think the stories that my--that I can remember, the ones, the one about my grandmother and, and the Native American.  I remember my grandmother, pictures of my--my grandmother had her--in her house, pictures of her, of her grandfather and who actually looked white to me.  And I've always wanted to get a copy of that picture and in, in the--but the house burned down.  I think they led a very--they led segregated, separate life.  They really--White Oak [Texas], which was a black, it was a black Native American community of families, was designed to keep them away from white people.  And, and, and so they, they were kind of like a commune.  You know, they--everybody was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, is there a story in the family that trickles down about, about what specifically--we can imagine from the reading of history why he [Randall's maternal great-grandfather, James McGill] might not want to be around white people in those days, was all the violence and, and other strains.  But is there any specific story that comes down through your family about why he, he wanted to remove his family so far from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there isn't--
Speaker 1: --white people?
Speaker 2: --a specific story that I have ever heard as to why.  And there--and I'm--you know, that raises an interesting question that I really would like to look into.  But--or--I've never really done a whole lot of research into my mother's side of the family.  And I just know that my grand--great-grandfather did not want his family--he didn't even really want my grandmother to go to school that year she went, you know, the--to become an LPN [licensed practical nurse].  He, he wanted everybody to stay right protected in that, in that arena, but I don't know why.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have to imagine there was some trauma that he was deal with, some fear that he was--
Speaker 2: Sure.  I mean--
Speaker 1: --a real one, very real.
Speaker 2: --I mean, it's a very--I mean, if you talk about 18--you're talking about 1800 to 9- to, 1921, which is when my grandmoth- my mother was born, I mean, you're talking about lynchings; you're talking about, you know, the genocide of the Native American had just--you know, wholesale genocide of Native Americans had just taken place over the last hundred years, and, and so there would be a very real fear.  And, and the better caution is to say look, let's just move out here and, and get some land.  I really like to know how he got that land, you know, if (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is a question.
Speaker 2: It's--the question is how.  I mean, because we're talking about he had thirteen kids, and he, he gave a good piece of land to all of them.  So he had got--he had a lot of land back out there in that compound, in that back area.
Story_ID: 351979
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mary Hall Randall] talk about--I know she died when you were seven, but are there any stories about her or, or any stories that you remember that she told you about growing up?  Or, what do you know about her, her childhood and growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know really anything about my mother's childhood growing up.  And my, my own life was traumatized by her death.  And for whatever reason, her sisters and brothers never really talked about her and her life.  I've asked several times since I've gotten older if they had stories about her, but they always sort of say, you know, she was much older than us, and we were much younger, and we didn't really know her that well, and she was gone off to school by the time we got to the age where, where we would have taken any interest.
Speaker 1: Now, well, that's something that you just said she went off to school.  That's something that's not that--
Speaker 2: She went--she graduated from college.
Speaker 1: Well, that, that's very unusual.  So she's somebody that could graduate from--could go, go off to school and graduate from college; I mean, that's something to know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what--where--what did she--what's the story?
Speaker 2: She went to Jarvis Christian College in Hawkins, Texas, Hawkins, Texas; majored in sociology.  That's where she met my dad [Ernest Randall].
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, you told me two things that are very important (laughter), yeah, from, yeah, Jarvis Christian--
Speaker 2: College.
Story_ID: 351980
Speaker 1: What do you know about Jarvis Christian [Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Actually quite a bit, because it started off as a school--as, as a elementary school for coloreds.  And it was the only school in the area--one of the few schools in the area.  And it was, it was obviously based with the Christian church [Disciples of Christ].  And as, as it developed, it grew from a elementary school to a high school to a institute [Jarvis Christian Institute; Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas] to a college.  And my dad's [Ernest Randall] side of his family is strongly connected with it and, and, and with its development.  But my mother [Mary Hall Randall] went to school there and graduated, taught a few years as a teacher, and then married my dad, and became a housewife.  And she--they thought--they moved.  She had, she had a pregnancy.  One, one story that I know which is not about her childhood, it's--I'm the oldest, but she had a pregnancy with my--before me, and she had--was--and this was in Hawkins, Texas.  They were living in Hawkins, Texas.  And my dad tells the story where they were playing softball or something out on the farm, and she start miscarrying.  And the black--there were no white doctors who would come out and serve the black community.  And the only black doctor wouldn't come out; had just gotten this new car I guess.  And my dad--they lived--my dad's family lived off the road and--
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of dust.  Is that--
Speaker 2: (Nods head) And he wouldn't come down the road.  He wouldn't come down the road to help.  My, my mother had to walk down.  And my dad would swear up and down that that was what caused the ultimate miscarriage.  She had to walk down the road and then catch the bus to his office because this black doctor--because there was no white doctors that would come, and the only black doctor would not go out into farming communities because that he didn't--he had changed his--this was in 1947.  And he had, he had gotten one, one, gotten one of the first--a car or something and didn't want to get dust on his car and sort of like that.  And so she, she had a miscarriage because of that.
Story_ID: 351981
Speaker 1: Another story, that in terms of my mother [Mary Hall Randall], is that she was really, really protective of her children.  And one of my first exposures to kind of racism was when we lived in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and we lived in a project.  My dad [Ernest Randall], even though he was college-education, couldn't get a job working--doing anything but working in the  mills and, and you know, that sort of thing.  But we, bunch of us, they--we were living in the projects.  And there was only one bicycle among the kids, and we all used to share.  And in, in Pennsylvania the projects were integrated, and so there were white and blacks, and the project was integrated.  And so, we would share this one bike.  Well, this woman from the South moved in, and her daughter had her own bike, and she also did not want us coming in her yard.  And so we were riding bikes around.  And one time one of the kids--the bikes went into the yard of this woman who was from the South, and the little girl made a big fuss.  So when it was my turn to get on the bike, I didn't actually get on the bike; I just pushed it into the yard 'cause I was mad that they had made all this fuss.  Well, the woman came out and cursed me, called me a nigger and slapped me.  And I, I must--I was under six.  I was like--I wasn't even in school yet; I was like five.
Speaker 2: This is in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: This is in--
Speaker 2: --in, in--
Speaker 1: --Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: --what, what city, what, what--
Speaker 1: Pottstown.
Speaker 2: Pottstown.
Speaker 1: And I can remember my mother coming out and not only kind of cursing this woman out but physically attacking her and, and about, you know, keeping her hands off of her child.  And I can remember my mother going to the office.  And other parents were upset as well, and they ultimately--that woman was made to move.  And, and that's--I, I, so I, I, I think one of the things I learned from my mother is, you know, you don't let people do things to you.  You, you--you know, she was a small woman.  I didn't real--it was only, you know, as a child you, you think your parents are so big (laughter).  But I've recently been looking at pictures of her and realized she must have been like 5'1" or 5'2".  'Cause she wasn't really a big woman, but she nevertheless, you know, was not going to let anybody call her child a nigger and, and slap her and push her around like that.  And she came out.  The other, only other story that I--I don't have--re- remember a lot about my mother, and it's part of I think the trauma of my own lifehood is, is that my sister [Brenda Randall] got lost one time.  And, and my sa- my mother--lost in the neighborhood.  And my mother was frantic, and we were all looking for her.  Then, then the final story had to do with me stealing.  I, I stole something from a grocery store.  I must have been, you know, a kid, piece of candy or something.  And I came home with the candy, and my mom was like, "Where'd you get that candy from?"  And at first I didn't want to say, and she forced it out of me.  And she said, "You didn't have no money; how did you pay for that?"  And I, you know, being a kid, I just kind of looked dumb.  And she made me march back to the store, apologize to the man, and then she made me--he made me--I had to go to the store and sweep the floor for a few afternoons to pay for the piece of candy that I had eaten.  So, I, I kind of learned that lesson about, you know, be truthful; don't steal, from her.  But she got sick when I was--she got sick with cancer when I was really quite young.  And I remember during her illness not being--her in the hospital and her being on the colored ward in the hospitals, you know.  Where in Pennsylvania, you know--and people keep thinking the North, you know, 1956, the North is, you know, better than the South.  But the North, it segregated black people just like the South did.  They just didn't call it Jim Crow.  And I--my mother was on this colored ward, and they wouldn't let us come into the hospital through the front doors.  We had to, we had to go in through the back doors.
Speaker 2: So you were about seven then?
Speaker 1: That was--I would have been eight that--
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: --that March, so I was seven, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 351982
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ernest Randall, E-R-N-E-S-T, Randall, R-A-N-D-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: He was born in 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Texas.
Speaker 1: I need to probably go back.  And now, I mean, how, I mean, how did you feel, you know, being that young and your mother [Mary Hall Randall] passing away when you were just a--
Speaker 2: It's all, I mean, it was a very emotional--I mean it's very--it's been a very--it was an emotional think at the time, and it's been something that I've blocked out a lot of memories.  I generally don't have a whole lot of memories pre--almost pre-twelve years old and because of all the different life changes I went through.  And I used to think that that was everybody.  But then I've come to realize that lots of people have memories and lots of memories of, of their childhood at that stage.  I, I, I, I, I don't know.  It was, it was one of those things that has--I mean, it, the, the emotional impact of not being able to--my mother, they took my mother off to the hospital, and she died away from home.  And so, you know, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It kind of removes you from the--
Speaker 2: It removed me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, so I never--she was at home for a while.  And I remember her calling me down at times.  And she'd call, and nobody would hear her, and I'd come down.  Her sisters came up to kind of help take care of her.  And my dad tried to find--I can remember them having discussions of, of, you know, treatments, you know.  What if we did this?  What if we did this?  But they didn't--you know, they, they were working poor, you know.  They--and one of the things I keep people, people say--I, I hate it when I hear people say black people don't appreciate education.  I'm like, black people was getting education when they couldn't do nothing with it, that--you know, you don't know anything about black people if you think black people don't appreciate education.  'Cause when they knew they couldn't get a job, they would get--people were getting educated.  And my dad was one of those people who had an education but couldn't get a job, and so he worked various odd jobs.  And it's been--emotionally, it was an emotional thing at the time, but it's also been something throughout my life that's kind of impacted me because of, you know, there's all these stages where you want to have a mother.  You want to ask your mother about this or ask your mother about that, and you don't have that.
Speaker 1: And most of her family was I guess in--even though you said her sisters came up, I, I imagine most of them were in Texas or some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Most of them was in Texas, and her sisters came up.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Maude McGill Hall] and, and I--my grandmother had just--you know, the, the interesting thing, if my grandmother is that my grandma--which the violence thing I've always--my grandmother had just lost two of her sons just a few years earlier to, due to the violence in the same week, you know, in black on black violence, you know, and, which I, I--people say, you know, black--why are these--why is there so much black on black violence?  I said there's always been black on black violence, because when you live in a white supremacist--when you, when you have stress that has to be expressed, you can expect that some people are gonna express it in an, in, in, in violent ways.  And we see it, we see it through suicide, which is just an expression that's self-violence, and we see it outward violence, you know.  And so, my grandmother had one son shot, and then in another week she had another son shot, and then six years later her daughter dies, so, you know, so.
Story_ID: 351983
Speaker 1: I wanna pick up this story probably later, but I wanted to ask you about your father's ancestors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, his name is Ernest Randall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Born in 1916.
Speaker 2: Correct, in Texas.
Speaker 1: And in somewhere in Texas too or, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, about around--where was daddy born?  I, I have that written down, but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But near (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was in Texas.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it near the same area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right in--yes, right.
Speaker 1: In the panhandle area?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, not--oh, that's where you went to school.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: White--that's where I went to school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: White Oak [Texas] is down around Tyler [Texas] and Mount Pleasant [Texas], which is sort of East Texas.
Speaker 1: East Texas, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was born in East Texas.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: To my great-grandfather, Narcissus--I mean Manlis Randall [Manlis Randles].
Speaker 1: Manlis?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, M-A-N-L-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my brother [James Randall] has actually found his name in, in the census, and Narcissus [Narcissa Dean Randles].
Speaker 1: That's no--are there any stories behind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's--
Speaker 1: These names?
Speaker 2: We don't know.  We know Manlis was born in 1845, which would have made him twenty years old at the time of the Civil War.  And Narcissus was born in 1854, which would have made her thirteen or twelve years at the time of the Civil War.  So, since they were in Texas, while there might have been some free, free blacks and--a few free blacks in Texas, we think--the family history is that they were slaves; that's, that's, that they both came out of the, the area slaves.  Actually, they weren't in Texas.  They were out in Mississippi, and we don't know how they got to Texas.  And they got somehow (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they were in Mississippi at first, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And somehow they made their way to Texas, and that's all we know about him.  We have a picture of him and of her, and she's with--there's another woman in the picture, which is--the story is it's his--it's her sister.  So the three of them--and they look like they might be in their early twenties, so the--and we think this is before any children were born because we think that if they had had children, the children would have been in the picture.  So we think this, the pictures might have been around 1865 or so before they had children, right after the Civil War.  He had--my grandfather, Tom Randall, was the third child, and Tom was born in 1875.
Speaker 1: Now was Manlis a farmer, like, like most people in those days, that did, did--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --agricultural stuff?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was your grandfather--
Speaker 2: A farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather--then and this is a--my grandfather owned a farm in West Texas in 1900--in 1902.
Speaker 1: So Tom Randall owned a farm in 1902.
Speaker 2: And, and that--we don't know the story behind that, because grandpa couldn't read, write, or add.  But grandpa had a farm, and the history is that he was well-to-do.  And so somehow between--he was able to buy la- he--from--he was born in 1875, and by the time he was thirty, he owned land in West Texas.  And the family--his--this is before my dad was born.  And my grandmother's name is Cora Phillips [Cora Phillips Randall], and Cora's born, I believe in 1887.  Cora is his second wife, and I don't know the name of his first wife.  And his first wife died in a horse and buggy accident.
Story_ID: 351984
Speaker 1: So he's [Randall's paternal grandfather, Tom Randall] living up in West Texas farming and doing well-to-do.  And a bunch of church ladies--there, there was this period of time when the, the, the education rate for blacks was like, 1 percent or something like that, and--reading grade--and there was these church ladies from Jarvis [Jarvis Christian Institute; Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas] who would go town to town and--black church ladies who would town to town and go into black churches and basically say you need to get your child educated.  And the family's story is, is the next day after, after the, after the church ladies had been to my grandfather's church, the next day my dad--my grandfather took a train to East Texas to check out--he bought land across the--in walking distance--it's across the road now, but in walking distance from Jarvis.  And he sold his farm in West Texas and moved his family to East Texas.
Speaker 2: To be close to the school, huh?
Speaker 1: So that his kids could go to school.
Speaker 2: To be right across the street from the school.
Speaker 1: To be across the street from the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And all his kids--and, and this is the other thing, is that he, he educated his kids in order of birth, and gender had nothing to do with it. And so, my, my Aunt Ora [Ora Randall Carey]--the, the picture, that's right on the--I have a picture of all my dad's [Ernest Randall] siblings.  And my Aunt Ora was the first to go to col- the first to--they all went to elementary school.  And then my Aunt Ora was--and my Aunt Ora grew with Jarvis.  Jarvis grew into a high school.  Aunt Ora went to high school.  Jarvis grew into a college.  Aunt Ora went to, went to college.  Jarvis added a master's degree in English.  Aunt Ora got a master's degree in English.  Aunt Ora then taught at Jarvis for several years, taught high schools for a couple of years, and then came back and taught at Jarvis until she gradu- until, until she retired and actually taught all her brothers and sisters, who all went to Jarvis and who all graduated from Jarvis.  And it was 'cause my grandfather, and my grandfather made that decision.  And, and, and, and apparently, the farm he bought and farmed was less profitable than the farm he left, according to the family history--I mean, he, he did fine I mean, but it was he had all--but, but he was doing very well up in West Texas, and, and then he moved.  And the only reason to move was so that his kids could go to school, and he moved.  I mean, he was a smart man--they not gonna go to school if we live far away, so he bought land across the street.  And my dad didn't want to go to school.  My dad didn't want to go to college.
Speaker 2: There's always one.
Speaker 1: And so my, my, my grandpa said fine; you don't have to go.  Arthur [Arthur Randall] can go.  Arthur was the one under him.  So you can come back and help me on the farm.  Arthur can go.  Okay, and so that, that happened, and then dad decided that, yeah, maybe (laughter), maybe college--going back to college--going to college was better than doing farm work.  So then he went back to school, but then he got interrupted by the war and went to the war.  And so, he actually didn't graduate from college until he was thirty, thirty-one.
Speaker 2: So this is World War II [WWII] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) World War II.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I think my--we don't--my--we have my grandfather-- When my grandfather died, there are stories of how he was--had paid two or three times over for the land because he couldn't add, and he didn't--really hadn't gotten his kids involved in it.  And so they found receipts and stuff and, and added up.
Story_ID: 351985
Speaker 1: We also--our family name, Randall, was changed by my [paternal] grandfather [Tom Randall] because some white man told him he was spelling the name wrong.  So, the name that he was--that, that every--all his brothers and sisters go by is R-A-N-D-L-E-S.
Speaker 2: Randles, like, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then some white person well, whatever way--that's not the way you spell Randall, and so my grandfather changed the spelling.  So, if someone was doing a family history, his siblings go by the name--my--the Randall is on the Tom Randall component.  Man--Manlis Randles is R, is R-A-N-D-L-E-S, and all his children is R-A-N-D-L-E-S.  And we're the only one that's R-A-N-D-A-L-L.  I, I find it, you know, you know, it's the same--first of all, it was a slave name, and so it shouldn't have mattered.  And, and secondly, the idea that someone, you know, would tell you that you're spelling your name wrong.
Speaker 2: Well, that happened in my family too.
Speaker 1: Did it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they told us we were mispronouncing the family--the original family name is C-R-O-W, Crow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather added an E.  My brother, when he comes along, who is really my half-brother, when he goes to school, he, when he first acquired this name when my father marries my mother, you know, they tell him, the white people in school tell him your name, name is pronounced Crowe not Crow.  So but they don't know the rest of the story, so yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he said he came home and told, told, you know, my mother and father, it's Crowe not Crow.
Speaker 1: And so there it goes.
Speaker 2: But it's been Crowe.  They (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: They didn't go with it, so, I mean, but I could see how they might have said oh, well, maybe it should be Crowe.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So the, that Grandpa changed his name to, you know, changed his name to Randall.
Story_ID: 351986
Speaker 1: As I said, they [Randall's father, Ernest Randall and his siblings] all went to college there [Jarvis Christian Institute; Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas].  We don't really have any stories--again, I don't have really stories about Manlis [Manlis Randles] and Narcissus [Narcissa Dean Randles].  I wish I did.  I wish I knew how they got from Mississippi to Texas.  I wish I knew how, you know, they were kind of--I'm sure they went through all kinds of things, you know, because of the time.  Mississippi was not one--is one of the worst places to be as a black person.  Texas wasn't too far behind.
Speaker 2: Right.  The people were trying to go out to those wide open spaces where they wouldn't be bothered as much--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --or, or could maybe establish a homestead out there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in some way or another.  Yeah, it's interesting.  We can just imagine though that they were coming across at a very dangerous time and were able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were able to negotiate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It and, and to protect their family, raise their family.  And my grandfather [Tom Randall] was able to get his, his kids all college-educated, which is I think quite a feat for that period of time.
Speaker 2: It gives something to think about when, when you see these movies about the West.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We know who else was out there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, who, who else is out there and what they were doing.
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  So that, I mean, I don't--other--my, my grand- I don't have stories about my grandfather.  I--my dad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what you tell is a pretty good story.  A man who had moved his family from across--
Speaker 1: It, it's, I think it's--
Speaker 2: --from a college.
Speaker 1: --an incredible story.
Speaker 2: That's a, an incredible story for a family to pass on.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I always keep thinking like, you know, they always talk--the, these Lifetime for TVs, and they're always talking about making these movies about challenges.  And I think, how come they never have movies, you know, these simple movies about inspirational things that black people do?  And there's always--(unclear) facts, stories and that different people have and--
Speaker 2: And these heroic ladies going around from church to church--
Speaker 1: I mean, that's--
Speaker 2: --recruiting and proselytizing--
Speaker 1: Re--
Speaker 2: --for the school.
Speaker 1: For education.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, just black women going church to church saying, you know, you need to get your child educated, you know, and, and Grandpa, you know--people listening, you know, and saying okay, if it means I have to sell my farm.  Because he couldn't--education, you know, there was no school where they were, you know, so he had to go to where the school was; that was that.
Story_ID: 351987
Speaker 1: So, now did your, your father [Ernest Randall] talk about going to school and what it was like for him growing up?
Speaker 2: No, my father didn't--hasn't--I--my father didn't talk a lot about going to school.  He, he wasn't a good student.  And we know that 'cause we, we've been doing family research, and we got his transcripts (laughter).  He wasn't a good student.  My father got sent away for a period because he had done something or said something inappropriate to a white person.  And they were scared that they might do something to him.  And that's one of the stories I heard about my father, that they sent him to live with a relative in an--for a year or so, so that things could cool down.  I'm not sure what it is he did or said or whatever it was.
Speaker 1: Now, is he still alive or is he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  My father died--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you never had a, had a chance to ask him what he did?
Speaker 2: No, I never did.  My father was always--you know, I was telling someone I--my, my kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall] say, ask me, "Why are you angry all the time?"  And I used to say that to my dad: "Why are you angry all the time?"  And my dad had a lot of frustrations and was ang- he talked a lot about the problems he had as a, an adult white--adult person in a white world.  You know, he struggled through college [Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas], and then he worked mills, and he drove cabs, and he dug ditches, and, and then finally he got a teaching job in the '60s [1960s].  And then with the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] he, he, he went--he taught awhile at a Native American reservation, and, and then he ultimately ended up with Job Corps.  But that, the Job Corps job, I mean, I can--he was angry a lot, you know, things that would happen in the work, racial things that would happen in the work, being passed over, being talked down to.  He, he, he--when I can remember, then I was an adult, young adult then, and I can remember him being in his late fifties, early sixties when he would come, come back and you know, he would be ranting, quote, about something that had happened in work recently.  And, and so I, I, I saw that.  I heard those kinds of stories.
Story_ID: 351988
Speaker 1: Well, when you look at, back, back at your parents' [Mary Hall Randall and Ernest Randall] personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I don't know my mother well enough to know whether I take after her enough, but I am like my dad.  I think I, I do have a lot of my dad's personality.  My dad was very outspoken, and it caused him a lot of problems on his jobs, because he wouldn't--he would--he (laughter) says I'm not gonna let these white people say anything to me, you know.  And so he, he would say stuff, and he'd have these problems.  So I'm, I'm, I'm very outspoken about race things, and, and I, I, and I, I think that personality-wise and that sort of thing I take from my dad.  My--I have--one of my memories with my dad is when it was some--after my mother died, my dad used to--but we moved back from Pennsylvania [Pottstown, Pennsylvania] immediately after--buried my mother, and we stayed in Texas.  And my mother had made my dad promise to keep us together, and I was angry with my dad for a long tan--time because we ended up with this play foster mother.  And I'll talk about that in a minute.  But one of the things he did is he never, not one day, were we ever separated, not even for a minute.  And so I realized that, that he worked very hard to try to keep that promise to my mom.  And so he made choices centered around keeping the three of us together and you know, people, three kids, a, a seven-year-old, a six-year-old [James Randall], and a four--a two-year-old [Brenda Randall], you know, an instant family, you know.  And so, we leave--we lived six months with, with one aunt, and then we lived another, a year, with another aunt.  And then we moved to Beaumont [Texas], and my dad had a, a wife, we think, although we can't find the marriage certificate, for a few months, and then we, we lived with him for a while.  But one of the things that--and I forgot where I was going with this story.
Speaker 1: You were just trying to show how he tried to keep you all together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and so, in keeping us together, you know, it was he--one of the times, he would take us to--he, every summer he would pick us up from wherever we were and drive us down to see our mother's family.  And so that was one of the other promises he had made, that he would make sure that we knew our family, so he would come to us wherever we were; he would pick us up, and he was driving to see mother's family.  So right after my mothers [sic. mother] died, we were driving back from my mother's family, and my dad--we, the three of us, were in the back seat.  And my dad and my uncle had been--my dad had been drinking.  And we were at this filling station.  And my dad went in, and suddenly there's this commotion.  And it's night.  And, and this white guy has this shotgun, and he's pointing it at my dad, and my dad is backing up.  And my uncle is saying to the guy, "Please don't shoot him; you know, he just, he just--they just--he's got three kids, and they just lost their mother," and you know.  And, and there was all this pleading and stuff.  And eventually my dad and my uncle got in the car, and they left.  Turns out that my dad had said to the man--to woman--there was a woman behind the counter, and my dad had said "Honey, give me a pack of Palmolives."  And the guy, the white guy, said, "You, you don't be calling my--"  "Nigger, you don't be calling my woman, my wife, honey," and, and then was prepared to kill him, was prepared to kill him over it.  You know, it was, it was something that always stuck with me.  And I remember the history of it, but the emotional impact of it never really hit me until I was older and was, and was touring one of the civil rights museums, and they were having pictures of this kind of thing.  And I'm like, oh, God, that just, that almost happened to daddy, where he was almost killed over nothing, you know, over nothing.
Story_ID: 351989
Speaker 1: Part of what I remember going down during that period was--I was telling (laughter)--my kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall] hate it when I tell this story because they said it's gross.  And I was saying when we traveled, everybody piled--we traveled in, in, in, in, in, in, in--what do you call it when one, one, more than one car?
Speaker 2: Caravan sort of.
Speaker 1: Caravan.  And I'm thinking it was done out of safety.  So like, we would travel in caravans if we were going--like, if my dad [Ernest Randall]--if we were going to visit family there would be two or three cars of people packed.  And aunts and uncles and stuff would cook lots and lots of food.  And to a kid, I'm thinking oh, this is--I didn't really understand well, we had to have food 'cause we couldn't have--there was no place to stop to eat, you know, in, at that time.  So you would just--so they--you packed lots and lots of food, fried chicken, you know, and, and you--and what my son found gross is that there would be a way to use the bathroom on the side of the road.  And, and, and if you needed to use the bathroom, all the cars would pull over.  And you would open the front door, and you would open the back door, which would give you privacy, and then everybody else would go somewhere else.  And you'd get in between those two doors, and you'd use the bathroom on the side of the road.  And you know, and I did--you know, that's, that's the way we, when we traveled in Texas, that's what you did because you didn't stop at a, at a, you didn't stop at a restaurant to go to the bathroom.  You didn't stop at a filling station to go to the bathroom.  The only thing you did at the filling station is get some gas, you know.  And you didn't know when you were gonna find food, so you always had to pack all your food with you, you know, and go with you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's true.  I've heard lots of stories about that.  You know, peep, pee, people wonder where that comes from, loading the car up with food, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now people still, still want to do it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But not for the same reason.
Speaker 2: But it doesn't have the, it does not, it doesn't have real--it's really not necessary to do it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --now.  You know, I guess when people--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you save some money, save--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But back then it was done completely out of necessity, you know. Plus especially since when we ended up living in West Texas, we're talking lived seven, eight hundred, nine hundred miles from East Texas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you're not talking about a two-hour trip.
Speaker 2: Talking about vast--
Speaker 1: You're talking about that eight--
Speaker 2: --distances.
Speaker 1: --seven to eight, nine-hour trip--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, that you, that you were going to go without having--you slept in the car, you know.  And my dad used to drive all night when we--when he lived out--he eventually moved to Oregon.  And whenever we would drive from Oregon to Texas we would just drive.  I mean, we would, we would drive all night.  And I think he was born--even thought this was in the '70s [1970s] and some things had changed, he had had a lifetime of you didn't stop.  You know, you, you know, you rotated drivers.  If you needed to pull--sleep, you pulled over to the side of the road and you slept, you know, and then you started back up and drive some more, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But that was done because of the segregation.  That wasn't done to save money or to, to save time.  It was done because there was no place to, to go, no place to pull over.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 351990
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  This seem like--you've told us so much already about childhood, but do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think the earliest childhood memory that I can claim is the one of my mother [Mary Hall Randall] and maybe when I was five or six with, with the white woman.  That's the earliest childhood memory that I can claim.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 351991
Speaker 1: And what were some of the--how many places did you live when you were--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've lived (laughter) all over Texas, all over Texas.  We lived in Hawkins [Texas], and we went to Hawkins Colored School [Hawkins, Texas].  My sister--my brother, James Ernest Randall [James Randall], was born in 1949, and my sister, Brenda Joyce Randall [Brenda Randall] was born in 1953.  We went to Hawkins Colored School.  Then we went to Munday's [Munday, Texas] colored school.  Now re- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how do you spell Munday's?
Speaker 2: M-U-N-D-A-Y.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought, yeah.
Speaker 2: Then we went back down to Beaumont, Texas, where we went to a colored school, and whose name I don't know--elementary school.  Then we moved to Muleshoe, Texas.
Speaker 1: Muleshoe?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, M-U-L (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) M-U-L-E, okay.
Speaker 2: S-H-O-E.  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Muleshoe, Texas.
Speaker 2: That's the beginning of my most vivid memories.  That's, that's, that's where my most vivid memories began.  I think I was about eleven or twelve, 1960, so I was twelve there.  So it was a two-room colored school.  And my dad's [Ernest Randall] brother had got the, the, the, the--the school normally hired two people of the same sex, because the community, Muleshoe, was incredibly poor, and there was no housing for teachers.  And so they had a house built next to the two-room school, and they usually hired a married couple or two people the same sex.
Story_ID: 351992
Speaker 1: Muleshoe [Texas], right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we moved to--my, my Uncle Bud [ph.] heard about this--my dad [Ernest Randall], although graduating from college [Jarvis Christian College, Hawkins, Texas] in 1949, had never been able to get a teaching position and had basically worked steel mill in Pennsylvania and cleaning facilities and various odd jobs up until 1960.  And my Uncle Bud heard about this position that had become unexpectedly available.  And he knew the woman who was the principal and, and got my dad the job.  And my dad packed up us, and we moved to Muleshoe, Texas.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the school there?
Speaker 2: Muleshoe Colored School [ph.].  It was a two-room school, a two-room school in which we did everything.  I mean, my sister [Brenda Randall] and I--I just visited my sister who lives in Alaska right now, and we were talking about that.  My dad taught in one room, and Christine, Christine Perkins [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)], who, Perkins Rogers, who's also my foster mother, who ended up raising me for the rest of--from the time I was twelve until I left home at nineteen, Christine Perkins Rogers was the principal.  She taught grades one through four.  My dad taught grades five through eight.  We cleaned the building.  The white school used to--the, the white--the school district used to send over in a van, lunch food.  And we'd have to--and there was two rooms and a big, one big, long sort of a conference room-type lunchroom, and we would load--that you could use as a big meeting room.  We would load up the--so they would send over a lunch van, and we'd have lo- we'd have to, you know, bring in the lunches, which were in metal trays.  I don't know if you remember those metal trays.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: They're metal--
Speaker 1: --no.
Speaker 2: --food trays--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --square, they would be square trays.  And, and the food had already been put on the tray.  And so the older kids--the younger kids would sit down, and the older kids would pass out the lunch.  Then we had to clean them.  So there was, so there was place there to, to wash dishes and stuff and clean up everything, and, and so the older kids would be responsible for cleaning the trays.  And so, it was, I mean, you know, it was a two-room school, and, and it had a lot of benefits.  I mean, I think one of the benefits--well, for--first, one of the benefits of going there was--is going to all of the colored schools--which is a lost benefit--is that every single person who taught me was a person of color, was a black person, not a person of color, but a black person.  So, all of my role I saw on a daily basis nothing but black people doing black--doing professional things.
Speaker 1: Now that's, that's an experience that very few still have.
Speaker 2: No, yeah.
Story_ID: 351993
Speaker 1: With integration they diluted--they took all the--one of the things that happened in integration in Texas, which didn't happen until 1960s, but they closed down all the black schools and then dispersed all the black teachers among the white schools.  And so what be--what happened was white kids continued to get an education in which their role models were predominantly white, and so they, they continued to see them, themselves succeeding.
Speaker 2: From what I understand, a lot of black educators lost their jobs too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of them lost their jobs.
Speaker 2: Not everybody was absorbed by the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No. You're absolutely right.  A lot of them lost their jobs.  But the ones who didn't lose their jobs got dispersed.  They took the talented tenth, and, but then they didn't always put them in the classroom.  My uncle, my Uncle Bud [ph.], who was a principal, kept his job but got taken out of the classroom and out of any kind of, of real administrative responsibility.
Story_ID: 351994
Speaker 1: In Muleshoe [Texas], we used to tutor the white kids.  It was really funny, 'cause on Saturday and Sunday--and I had kind of forgotten about that, but my sister [Brenda Randall] reminded me that, that kids were who having difficulty and the parents didn't want them to know--want their other white friends to know that they need tutoring was bringing them over on Saturdays and Sundays for us to tutor.  And, and my dad [Ernest Randall] would tutor them, and I would tutor them.  And one thing that happened that was a major thing is they used to do this, this city-wide testing.  Muleshoe wasn't a city but town-wide testing.  And me and Joanne [ph.]--I was in this, eighth grade that year--Joanne and I made the highest grades in the city, in the city.
Speaker 2: And Joanne, that's your, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was a friend--
Speaker 2: Friend, okay.
Speaker 1: Black, went, went to the two-room school [Muleshoe Colored School (ph.)] with us, and we made the highest grade.  They refused to accept it.  They said we cheated, that my dad had given us the answer and coached us and made us retake the test.  And, and we still passed it, and we--there was supposed to be a, a, a event, but they wouldn't let us go to it for--you know, they said that it's not possible that we could have made the best grades, the best score, math scores.  And it was math.  It wasn't possible we could have made the best math scores without having cheated.  And-- .
Speaker 2: So they refused to accept the, accept the evidence.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, so yeah, they refused to accept the evidence.  And they just decided that it--that since it wasn't possible that two black kids being educated in a two-room school within--with insuff- books that were ten years old and not enough supplies to go around, it's not possible that we could have made the highs, highest scores, so something else, like cheating, had to be the reason.  And even when they did the test over again, to supervise the test, they still would not accept the scores as valid.  And they would not allow us to go to, they would not allow us to go to the, the dinner that was being had to be--to receive the award.
Speaker 2: How do you spell--is, is Muleshoe one word or two?
Speaker 1: One word.
Speaker 2: One word, okay.
Speaker 1: M-U-L-E-S-H-O-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll put it all together, okay, 'cause I had it as two.
Story_ID: 351995
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The other thing I remember about Muleshoe [Texas] is, is Muleshoe, the community, the black community, was sharecroppers and, and/or are, are working the fields.  And so the schools had to turn out whenever the people had to go work in the fields, you know, pick cotton, pull cotton, chop weeds, stuff like that.  And my--whenever the schools turn out for that sort of thing, we would go too.  And my sister [Brenda Randall] thought that we were going because my dad [Ernest Randall] and foster mother [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] wanted us to teach us the value of hard work.  And I, I said I thought we were going 'cause they weren't getting any money, and they needed to earn some extra money, and yeah, we could--we might as well go along and work as well.  So we actually--I actually pulled cotton and along with everyone else.  You know, we would go to the fields with everyone else.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a, yeah, that's a, that's a story I hear a lot, you know, but usually not from people as young as you are.  There's usually peop- much older people talk about that kind of situation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I guess that's, that's still going on now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean, it, it was still--I remember families who were sharecroppers, we would go visit--they were our friends, and we would go visit them.  And you know, the sharecropping situation was they, you know, they had these little houses, and you know, they never seemed to be able to work their way out of it, you know.  They were always owing something, you know, sharecropping.  And supposedly they owned the land and--I mean they would, you know, a certain amount of the land, and they would farm the land and supposed to get certain amount of money from it.  But by the time they paid for everything that they got from the, from the white farmer, they were, they were in debt for the next season, and so they never really could get ahead a lot.
Story_ID: 351996
Speaker 1: Well, I was gonna ask you like, now how did, how did it come that you all stayed with Ms. Perkins Rogers [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, first of all, my dad [Ernest Randall] and hers had an affair.  And I think they eventually lost their job because of the affair they were having.  And, and that's why she--we moved to Amarillo [Texas] with her.  She convinced my dad that moving--I was a teenaged girl, and moving us with him around to these various place was not good for us.  And--
Speaker 1: So after they, well--after they got together, they, they didn't, they decided not to stay together.
Speaker 2: Well, they--she was married (laughter).  Her husband, Uncle Majors, what I call him, Major Rogers [ph.]. I had actually--that's their picture over there.  Uncle Major lived in Amarillo.  Christine lived in Muleshoe [Texas].
Speaker 1: Now that's a strange kind of a relationship for a marriage anyway, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's very strange (laughter).  And the interesting--I mean, I, as a kid growing up in that family situation--we all shared the house--all I really knew, I didn't--I knew--I didn't know a whole lot.  I think I put stuff together as I got older.  But you know, they had a affair.  And I think at one point the, the, the whites in town start getting upset that this unmarried man was living in this household--house with this married woman, even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so he actually lived in the house?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's a teacher's house.  The teacher's house had four bedrooms.  She had a bedroom, he had a bedroom, my brother [James Randall] had a bedroom, and me and my sister [Brenda Randall] shared a bedroom.  And ordinarily, it would be people--women of this just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two women.
Speaker 2: Two women or two men (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or two--
Speaker 2: Or a married couple.  But because they had this emergency in the middle of the school year, and my Uncle Bud [ph.] knew her, he got her to hire my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the only place to live was in the teacher house, so we lived in the teacher house.
Speaker 1: That's a tough situation when you think about it.  Let's see, now if you go on a date, if you're gonna find somebody that's like you and the same interests, where are you gonna find them, right (laughter)?  In the house.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In the house.  I, I, I mean, Christine was an odd person, and she was, I mean, she was not quite sane, and it's hard to put together exactly why everything fell apart.  But she would do things like leave the school and leave us in charge, that is the oldest girls, she would say.  And she would go over to the house to take a nap, or she'd go to go shopping, you know.  And so, so that could have been a problem.  I know it was problematic that, that, that a married man was living in the house with, with--I mean a single man was living in a house with a married woman that wasn't his wife.  Remember, this is 1960, so this is, this really would have been scandalous for--and I remember at one point they hatched a scheme for him to get married.
Speaker 1: Him to marry some, someone else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, to, okay.
Speaker 2: To kind of deflect--
Speaker 1: Take the heat off of the--
Speaker 2: Take the heat off, like, he's married.  And so, I remember them--I--you know, you know, how kids listen to everything, and I remember them hatching the scheme, and I remember them not turning in the, the la- the, the license, the wedding license.  But apparently it didn't work very long because apparently the school, they asked both of them to leave.  My dad went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they had a little school board or something that--
Speaker 2: Well, not the colored school [Muleshoe Colored School (ph.)].  We're talking about the white, the--
Speaker 1: Oh, that, the--
Speaker 2: All of this came from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, the--
Speaker 2: White people in town.
Speaker 1: Superintendent of the white school asked him--
Speaker 2: The superintendent of the school district.  And you know, I don't know whether the complaints from--I'm not sure the complaints--I, I--the complaints could have been coming from the black community, but I doubt it.  But I, I mean, I think the complaints probably were coming from the white community, you know, as they, you know--I don't know where the complaints were coming from.  But at any rate, the superintendent asked them both to leave--
Story_ID: 351997
Speaker 1: And at that point, my dad [Ernest Randall] took a job in an, with a, on a Native American reservation out in Mexico.
Speaker 2: In, in New Mexico?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, New Mexico.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was 1962.  And my foster mother, Christine [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)], convinced him that we should go with her because I was a teenage girl, and he wouldn't be able to supervise us appropriately.  And so we went to, we went to Amarillo [Texas].
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962] I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And for a while we led sort of normal lives, maybe--I don't know what the time period was.
Speaker 2: So it didn't--none of this bothered her husband in Amarillo?
Speaker 1: Uncle Major [Major Rogers (ph.)] was a strange man.  No, it didn't bother him.  It didn't appear to bother him.  And their relationship kept going.  I mean, they, I mean--
Speaker 2: You mean your father and the--
Speaker 1: (Nods head) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And this is where my history--I don't know.  You've done a lot of these, so you, you may have heard these kind of--I think my history takes a little twist from the normal at this point, 'cause Christine, at this point, decides to quit teaching and to run a lot of borderline illegal businesses in Amarillo.  She runs, we call it the hotel, but it actually wasn't a hotel; it was more like a boarding house that she rented out rooms to men on a weekly basis and a, a, a house where she rented out rooms to women on a per hour basis.
Speaker 2: Had a--okay.
Speaker 1: She wasn't, she wasn't a madam or anything.  She just rented rooms to women who were prostitutes and was bringing men back.  We also bootlegged.  We, we had a bar down--and the bar never did much business, and it wasn't until I got older that I realized that the bar was just a place for her to get alcohol to bootleg.  It wasn't that bootlegging--not in that we made the alcohol--bootlegging that we sold alcohol after hours and on Sundays.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, 'cause they had Sunday laws and all that.
Speaker 1: They had Sunday laws, right, and they had after hour laws.  So, so what we would do is we would stock the ho--we would stock the hotel with alcohol that came from the bar.  And then people would come to the hotel to buy beer after hours and, and on Sundays.
Story_ID: 351998
Speaker 1: We lived in a fairly--the house that we lived in was a fairly middle-class neighborhood, black.  It was segregated, was still segregated.  There was the black sort of town--there was the black side of town and the white side of town.  And we lived in--there was the sort of upper-class black neighborhood, which we did not live in.  They lived kind of two or three streets down from us, bigger houses, that sort of thing.  Then there was our neighborhood, which was maybe more middle class, working class, nice houses.  And then you moved further down, and, and you get, you would be the poor blacks, you know, with, with the smaller houses, shotgun houses.  I, I actually lived in a shotgun house in, in Beaumont, Texas.  And there would be shotgun houses in, in, in--should I explain what a shotgun house is?
Speaker 2: Yes, you could explain, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, a shotgun house is a one-room house, I mean a one-room wide house, but the rooms are all lined up behind each other.  And the doors are, are lined up in such a way that if you open the door to each of the rooms, and it's usually like three rooms--if you open the doors to each of the rooms, you could shoot a shotgun, and the bullet would go straight through it.  So that's why they call them shotgun houses.
Speaker 2: I think that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We lived in a shotgun house in Beaumont for a while.
Speaker 2: There's that famous paint, painting of Texas artist, John Biggers [John T. Biggers], of a shotgun house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: It comes to mind.  I started smiling when you said it 'cause I, I know what one is, but it's good to, to have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To have somebody--
Speaker 2: Have you explain it.
Speaker 1: To explain it, yeah.
Speaker 2: But you know, but I, I think of that picture of--that's a typical house in black communities--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --in the South especially--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and from all the way from Atlanta [Georgia], all the way through--
Speaker 1: And, and so what you have--and then when you went further into the Amarillo [Texas] black community you would have, you had the shotgun houses.  And then, right--then there was this district where they had their bars and liquors and stuff, so that was that.
Story_ID: 351999
Speaker 1: But our hotel was right in the middle [of the black community in Amarillo, Texas], so you, you--we were--we weren't down where all of the--we were where everybody lived, so it was more of a boarding house that happened to be right in the middle of everything.  When she [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] started doing that, she sort of said at that point that we didn't have time to play.  And that, you know, that's when the life of--and, and it was very early after we moved there.  And we, we started working in those places and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So she--well, you know, as a foster mother, she, she got free labor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we--she got free labor, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, it doesn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and, and--
Speaker 2: She, she had to feed you and all that, but she got, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, and, and we, when we get up we would walk to the hotel in the morning.  I was telling--someone said to me, you know, I, I come--I'm like a 24/7 worker.  I, I--when I get up, I usually get up and start working, and, and I work 'til I go to bed.  And, and someone said, "Well, you know, why you work like that?"  I said, "Well, you know, that's how I was raised," so 'cause when we got up, we would walk up to the hotel.  And we would stop in the ho- before we went to school, and we'd stop in the hotel, and we would clean the rooms, and then we'd go to school.  And then we'd come back to the hotel, and we'd clean the rooms.  And then we would go down to the bar.  Me and my brother [James Randall] would go down to the bar, and I would be the barmaid.  And I'd be there until like ten o' clock at night, and then, and then I would do my homework.
Speaker 2: So you were a teenager, fourteen, fifteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You were the barmaid.  And you were allowed to be the barmaid as, as a teenaged girl?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.  I mean, the thing is, is part of the issue right is, is that--well, there was two issues: one is, is I'm--first of all, when I say she was my foster mother, I'm--it was an informal arrangement.  It wasn't through the state.  So there wasn't no state agency coming around and saying what are you doing with these kids, you know.  And, and, and that was not abnormal.  I think that sometimes people the--I mean the, the environment of state in foster care and all of that kind of stuff is something of recent history.  And you know, it, it's not something of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: And something that's relatively urban in its origin too.  You know, you wouldn't--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --you wouldn't necessarily see it out in rural--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --communities.  You had more informal relationships.
Speaker 1: Informal arrangements.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And so, so, so there wasn't state agencies.  And to, to the extent that the leaders of the community ignored it, they ignored it.
Story_ID: 352000
Speaker 1: Now, the police, I realized that she [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] must have been paying the police off, but she wasn't paying them off about us.  She was paying them off about the bootlegging.  They would come (laughter)--we would--on Sundays the hotel [in Amarillo, Texas] would, the hotel would fill up with men.  Some of them, we--our hotel was next door to a church.  And the church would turn--(laughter) the--
Speaker 2: Saturday night and Sunday morning (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Exactly.  Church would turn out, and most of the men would go home with their wives, but many of them did not.  Many of them would put their wives in the car and then come into the hotel, sit around drink beer, grab at me.  My, my--the hotel was set up where there was a stairway, and there was a window; there was a lobby, and there was a sort of a dining room area.  And we had a jukebox, and we had a kitchen where we kept all the beer and stuff.  And the hard liquor was kept in Christine's room.  So Christine would stay in her room and, in the bed, and give out the hard liquor to my brother [James Randall].  So my brother was responsible for keeping the, the icebox stocked with beer and selling any hard liquor that had to be sold, okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your brother was how old then?
Speaker 1: I mean he's a year younger than me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he would have been a lot smaller as a, as a young man than you.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then my sister, who was five years younger than me, was responsible for watching for the cops. That was her job.
Speaker 2: So she sat out on the porch and jumped rope and whatever, looking up the street?
Speaker 1: She'd jump rope; she'd sit--yeah, whatever, you know, sit in the--(unclear)--stairwell, window.  And I think, and I never put this together until I was older, that Christine must have been paying the cops to come always from a certain direction, because she always had my sister looking in a certain direction.  And when Brenda [Brenda Randall] would say, "Mama, the cops are coming," Christine would say to all her guys: "Okay, take--put your stuff under your chair, under the couch."  And so the cops would come in: "Hi, Vernellia [HistoryMaker Vernellia Randall], hi, Christine; what's going on in here?"  You know, we're listening to the radio; we're listening to the music.  They'd walk through the building; they'd walk back through; they'd walk out.  They never looked down (laughter).  If they had looked just--if they had just reverted their eyes (laughter) down.  And I always wondered how come the cops never can see the beer (laughter).  But they would never look down.
Speaker 2: The people in every community in the United States wonder the same thing about the drug dealers.  Why do the cops never see them, and we see them--
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: --all the time?
Speaker 1: We see them all the time.
Speaker 2: But they, somehow they--
Speaker 1: They never, they never--
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: --can see it.
Speaker 2: Some scientist needs to investigate this.
Speaker 1: They never you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What are they?  They have a vision, you know, it's kind of like--so yeah, they, they walk in, and I mean, in the seven years that I lived there and worked with her, not once was she ever stopped, raided, and found to be doing anything illegal.
Story_ID: 352001
Speaker 1: So she [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] basically retired from teaching and she didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, she quit teaching.
Speaker 1: That wasn't even part of it.
Speaker 2: No, that wasn't even a part of what she did after that.
Speaker 1: Do you--
Speaker 2: And she wasn't--part, part of the history with her is, is that she went to--I don't know how--I don't know a lot about her history.  I don't know her mother's name, and I don't know how--a lot about her history.  But she went to--what's the Texas, the--it's a black school--not Texas.
Speaker 1: Texas Southern [Houston College for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: She went to Texas Southern.
Speaker 1: In Houston [Texas], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and what I heard is she wasn't really a very good student and, and that she never was really interested in teaching.  And so she kind of, kind of drifted from job to job, and that when it, this thing happened she was in her fifties, and so she just quit teaching altogether when--and, and did this mu- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now and what did her husband do, Major [Major Rogers (ph.)]--?
Speaker 2: He was a millworker.
Speaker 1: He worked in the mill?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he worked in the mill, and, and, and he was a real quiet man.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of mill was it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  He--and did whatever she told him.  I mean, Christine was one of those people who no one really ever talked back to.  It was amazing.  She was very abusive physically, emotionally, sexually abusive to all of us.  And, and she was a personality who seemed to occupy the space that she's in and that anybody else who was in that space, succumbed to her.
Story_ID: 360918
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to you ask you now, so here you are, you're in a pretty difficult situation, in some ways.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was--
Speaker 1: --you seem like you're flowing with it, but this--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't at the time.
Speaker 1: And still it wasn't--
Speaker 2: It was, at the time, it was, it was a very difficult situation that really impacted my life for a very long time.  I mean, I, I said I'm a recovered, I, I recovered from abuse, but it wasn't easy.  It wasn't like I left her [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] house and now I'm fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was years and years and years before I, before I became sane.  I managed to get an education, and I think that's what kind of helped me.  I, I always liked school.  But, I mean, she was crazy, and she did crazy things.  I mean, she, she did--I mean, it is a--one of the ways we used to survive, we used to tell--we used to get together and tell Christine stories, you know, just things that she did to us.  And as an, an example, and this actually happened to my sister [Brenda Randall], but this is an example of how crazy she--other people perceived her be.  My sister went to a private Catholic, school, and my--and this was after I'd left, and she was a teenager.  And one of her friends had--was leaving town [Amarillo, Texas], and my mother--the nuns had allowed her to go and see her friend off and, her and a couple of others, young girls.  And my, my--the sister didn't come back on time, and the nuns got scared and called the parents.  My foster mother came to the school cussing and carrying on like nobody's business, beating her in the school.  And the nuns were so taken aback by the behavior that they told her to, they, they told her that your mother's crazy (laughter), and we're never gonna call her again.  Long as you don't do anything too bad, we're never gonna call her again.  And so they protected my sister like that, but no one did that for me.  And Christine came up to the school, and the--I was--the school and she--you know, I was a bed wetter, and she would bring sheets up there, and she would beat me in the school.  And she always was trying to push me off on men.  A, a major part of my life as a teenager was try--staying away from the men she was trying to push me off on without giving away to her that I was doing that so that I would have to--she, she used to, she would say, "Go over there and ask mister so and so for some money.  You're a poor, motherless child trying to get an education; go ask him."  Now, this is a drunk in a bar.  And so I would always say, "Okay, now how can I go and say, talk to him?"  And then I would go and say something to him, and then I'd go back and say, "Oh, he say he ain't got no money," (laughter), not, never really having asked him at all, you know.  And so I spent a good deal of my life under her--I--all of my life under her, afraid all of the time.  I was--I gave a talk the other day.  Someone asked me, and I said I did not know what it meant to live without fear until I was in my thirties, that, that I got a fear in my chest from living with her.  And that fear stayed with me well into my thirties.  And I mean she--I--my--I would never date.  I never dated, primarily because you never knew how she would behave, and I never really wanted to have to deal with that.  And you, we, you never in anything--did anything because you'd ask her--if you asked her to do something, like, can I go to so and so, her initial reaction would be say oh, yeah, yeah, you can go.  Then she would start into ragging on you about all of the things your daddy [Ernest Randall] isn't doing, all of the things that--et cetera.  And you're, you--by the time it came time to go, you've realized that if you went, you would never hear the last of it.  And so you would just decide not to go.
Story_ID: 360919
Speaker 1: We once tried--I once tried, tried to tell my dad [Ernest Randall] about it, and my dad went up to the hotel [in Amarillo, Texas].  She had--I--she had beat me so bad.  She used to beat us with an ironing cord.  She would make the three of us lay naked over a couch, and she would beat us with an ironing cord.  And my dad--so she bruised, one time it bruised me and I thought, oh yeah, this, now this is gonna get my dad to do something.  And so I told my dad, and my dad said oh, this har- nobody beats my child like this.  Pack up your stuff.  I'm gonna take you.  So he went up to the hotel.  He said we're going--I'm going up to the hotel to tell her that I'm taking you all, 'cause we stayed down at the house; we didn't stay at the hotel.  He stayed gone. Next night, that was gone.  You know, she did whatever she did and he, he, he, he didn't take us.  You know, he came back and had reasons, oh, you know, it's not that bad and blah, blah, blah.  And so, so, yeah, we ended up--I ended up staying with her until I went to junior college [Amarillo Junior College; Amarillo College, Amarillo, Texas] there.  And I actually--and, and then and once I left I never went back.  I think I coped.  We all three coped in different ways.  I coped by give--going into my studies.  And, and I was a good student, and I would just read.  I would just really work hard.  I would just pour myself into the studies.  My brother [James Randall] actually became an alcoholic.  And since we were around alcohol all the time, he, he just, he does like many kids, you know.  Like a lot of middle-class kids that have alcohol--except we had a lot more--he'd just steal alcohol and drink it.  You know, nobody was ever gonna miss it.  And I actually was so in my own world I never realized that he was drunk most of the time.  And my sister [Brenda Randall], actually Chris [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)]--once both me and my brother left right out of col- right when we left, she, at, at that point, she was much older.  She had stopped a lot of the things that she was doing, and she got afraid of losing my sister.  And so my sister said while her behavior still stayed, stayed strange, she loosened up, and, and, and my sister actually also being a, a younger child--I think younger children are a lot less, you know, they're a lot--they're more independent and whatever, and so she, she actually had a different life after we left.  But it was, it was a bad situation; it was a really bad situation.
Story_ID: 360920
Speaker 1: What was high school life like?  I mean did, did you really have a life in high school like, like most students?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have a life like--I, I was, I was so afraid of people finding out about what was going on with--at Christine's [Randall's foster mother Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] and her embarrassing me, that I was--I, I didn't trust people to protect me, because every single time that I had made an effort to try to get someone to protect me it had always backfired because they would go to Christine; Christine would have an explanation, and then they would leave us there.  So I didn't trust nobody.  The principals at--you know, it's something that people like to talk about how the black community protects itself, and I mean, there is validity in there, but there's also all the things the black community let happen, you know (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and that's right.
Speaker 2: You know, and ignore it, and turn its eye on.  And I think that's part of my thing right now, is I realize, you know, we, sometimes we, we take the easier path, you know.  And so, there was this crazy woman, and the easier path is not to get in her way.  And hey, the kids are coming to school every day; they're eating; they're dressed okay; and they're doing well in school.

Speaker 1: Was church a, a significant part of growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Church was a significant part of growing up, but not necessarily on the positive side.  Okay, because Christine [Randall's foster mother Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] was making us going to church because Christine would say go to church because the church--God is helping me to do this.  And so I grew up thinking, hell, if God is helping you to do it, who needs God (laughter)?  But part of it, you know, I'd go to church and I, you know and you know, in church, you go to church and church is church, but the church didn't intervene.  The church didn't, I mean the church didn't intervene.  The ministers didn't come to Christine and say you know, you got that sixteen-year-old girl working down at that bar [in Amarillo, Texas]; you, you--that this is not right.  You're sending her to our church on Sunday, and we're concerned about her.  Nobody ever did that.  Or, if they did it, it didn't do no good because they never did it in front of us, so we never knew it happened.  And, and then, when my sister [Brenda Randall] finally left, a bunch of people said we don't know why you kids just didn't run away.  Like, why would--run away?  Run away to where?  You all are the adults.  Why should you expect kids to take control by running away?  So, church was a, church was a part of my life but not a part of my life that I respected very much, because I, I--chur- Christine used God as a, you know--and, and I cringe now.  I cringe when I hear people get on TV and thank God for stuff.  I, and, and, and I have found my way back to God, into spirituality, okay, not to organized religion.  And I cringe when, when people say I thank God for helping me to do this.  God is not helping you to twist your booty on TV.  Please, don't thank him; don't thank her.
Speaker 1: Or, or even score touchdowns or--
Speaker 2: Or score touchdowns.  Don't thank God for you--God is not helping you do that, you know.  You know, 'cause when you--we all have flaws.  And when some person sitting out here who doesn't know any better see you thanking God, and they see you do the things that you doing, then they connect that to God, and, and that's not right.  So, you know, thank God for giving you life, and make it your own personal spiritual thing.  And then lead a correct life, and thank God that way.  But don't, don't get on TV and, and thank God for the mundane things that you're doing in your life as if God is make, you know, making you capable of doing that, you know. So anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, okay, now--
Speaker 2: I got to preach on that (laughter).
Story_ID: 360922
Speaker 1: In school, did, did you have any, any mentors, any, any positive role model, figures that, around you that--?
Speaker 2: I think that, and I'm trying to remember back in, in high school [Carver High School, Amarillo, Texas], I, I think the positive figures that I have--and I don't remember the names of my teachers, this is a period where I re- I wasn't concentrating--I was just concentrating on surviving and so.  But I think what I did have is yeah, I think that the black teachers--I think, I think--I'm not sure that I would have done as well this day and age, because I think that I saw all these role models.  All my teachers had--was, were black, and they all encouraged me.  They all encouraged me 'cause I was a good student; I was very smart and very quick; and I was very quiet (laughter).  And so I wasn't a troublemaker, and, and I, you know, I did my schoolwork and stuff.  And, and the teachers, male and female--we had male and female black teachers, and they all encouraged me to go to college.  My parents and my gra- my dad [Ernest Randall] encouraged me to go to college.  Fact, my dad--and I was telling someone the expectation was that we would all go to college, you know.  My brother [James Randall] and sister [Brenda Randall] started and then stopped.  But there was this expectation from the very beginning that we would all go to college.  And my dad actually one time said to me, "Girl, you need to get yourself an education because you don't ever know.  You know, you're gonna have children, and you know, you never know what's gonna happen to the man.  And you need to be able to take care of your children and yourself."  And that's, and, and, and that was the attitude.
Speaker 1: Now you said, you mentioned that you were kind of a troublemaker in school.
Speaker 2: No, I was not.
Speaker 1: You were not a troublemaker.
Speaker 2: I was not a trouble (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what I would have thought.  That's why I thought I heard that, and I said well, I don't understand that.
Speaker 2: I kept myself well under the radar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I go talk to people now, and they think that it was because I was stuck up.  They said we all thought you were stuck up and thought you were better than us.  I'm like, I thought I, I needed to keep myself under the radar so that, 'cause I was afraid of stuff I might do or say getting back to Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)].  And so I figured the best way nothing could get back to Christine, if I do nothing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing from nothing leaves nothing.
Speaker 2: Nothing, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, when you were--so there are no significant mentors or teachers that really helped or--
Speaker 2: No. I mean, I--no, no, no, no, no.
Story_ID: 360923
Speaker 1: That's, that's pretty rough to have to walk that lonesome valley as a teenager.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: It was very rough.  I mean, I mean, it, it--I have this poem that is--that I--Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] used to like for us to read poetry, and I got this poem, 'Invictus' [William Ernest Henley]. Have you ever heard it?
Speaker 1: 'Invictus' is, seems to be something that a lot of high school students are exposed to and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I heard it from my brother when he was in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And people--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: It, it's an in--it's, it, interesting that, you know, a lot of black high school students at a certain point were exposed to it.  Perhaps the white ones were too, but I (unclear) wasn't like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I mean it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a, it's a real short poem.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: "Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole.  I thank whatever god--[gods]--may be, for my unconquerable soul.  In the still night of circumstance I have not winced or cried aloud.  Under the bulging [sic. bludgeonings] of chance my head is bloody, but unbowed.  Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horrors of the shade, and yet the masters of the years find and shall find me, unafraid.  It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll.  I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul."  That's my poem.  I learned that.  I would recite that over and over to myself, you know, growing up.
Speaker 1: It has a kind of a power to it that I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It does have a power to it.
Speaker 1: I don't--I, I looked it up once on the Internet just to, you know, get a copy of it and yeah.  It's--some, someone else that we interviewed, in fact a couple of people, you know, have referred to that poem.  And strangely enough, it's in--Robert Cummings recites it in a movie called 'Kings Row'.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: With Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].  His only movie--the only good movie Ronald Reagan ever made.  And Ronald Reagan is laying in the bed with both of his legs amputated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Needlessly, 'cause he really didn't need 'em.  His, his ex-girlfriend's father was a doctor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --who didn't want him to marry his daughter and, and actually did this.  He had an accident, but he didn't need his legs amputated.  He did it to--and then before he tells him what really happened to him, he tells him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He gives him--
Speaker 1: He, he, he--
Speaker 2: --gives him this poem.
Speaker 1: He recite, recites a poem, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that poem I said I tell that, that poem became this cornerstone of kind of like, when, whenever I got, felt like my fear was overtaking me or the--in terms of my life, and I would recite that poem to myself.  And I made myself move forward through fear, you know, even though I had this huge fear.  It wasn't easy.  I actually, I was totally dysfunctional going into college.  I--
Speaker 1: Who, who introduced you to the poem?  I'm just curious.
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: She did?
Speaker 2: Actually, she gave us a little brown book.  She always want--I mean, there was a couple of things she always, she used to do.  One thing she used--she always wanted us, she wanted us--I--she had a value in education, and she always wanted us to be educated, and she always wanted--she always liked to show us.  And so, she would make us learn poetry and then, you know, some, some white person would come around, and she'd make us recite a poem or play the piano.  I mean, she--we'd learn these things.  She also (laughter) used to com- always compare us to white kids.  And so, whenever we'd do anything bad, she would say white kids don't do that; she'd say white kids clean their rooms; white kids don't do this; white kids do this; white kids do that.  And you know, and so I don't know if a part of me is kind of like (laughter), like, white kids must be perfect (laughter), you know.  I mean, she really did.  It's kind of like, white kids were perfect, and you were imperfect, and if you want to, if you want to get per- if you want to be like white kids who are perfect, you need to, you know, whatever it is we were doing she would say you need to do this; you need to do that.  But it also probably fueled my sort of critique of white people.  I mean, you know, it's sort of like, once I got sent, you know, it's kind of like, okay, let me wa- let me see if they're perfect as Christine used to say they are.
Speaker 1: Kind of like the church too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You look and say let me see if this is really what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So I, I think that's what me got me into my counter-racism work, is, is that, you know, it's kind of like, okay, I need to critique white people 'cause, you know, are they that perfect?
Story_ID: 360924
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about--now school.  You're in Amarillo [Texas].
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: At, at Carver Junior, Carver [Carver High School, Amarillo, Texas].
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Carver?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, in 1966.
Speaker 1: Carver High School?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In Amarillo?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And even though Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] came down in 1954, Amarillo was still segregated in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Amarillo didn't integrate until '68 [1968], so it integrated after I, after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all deliberate speed.
Speaker 2: All (laughter) deliberate speed.  I always--I think, you know, I always laugh when people say all deliberate speed.  I was like, well, in Texas that meant twelve years later (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, I, I suppose the junior college was the quickest and best option I guess.
Speaker 2: I actually had scored high enough on the--there was this test that they--SATs you took, but there was also this scholarship test, and I'm trying to think--  And they had a one for minorities, and I had scored high enough that I had offers from Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] to go.  I had offers from a num- number of big colleges to go.  But Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] said I wasn't ready to go, and she wouldn't let me go.  And I didn't have enough personal power to think that I could leave, even though I was eighteen.  So I went to Amarillo Junior College [Amarillo College, Amarillo, Texas].  Now, I was advised, you know--you know, that time, a lot of the career ma- model--mold for blacks were still nursing and med- and, and teaching, and I chose to do nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: I started in '66 [1966] and went to Amarillo Junior College for two years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay, Amarillo Junior College, okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated from Amarillo Junior College.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so in '67 [1967] you started at--
Speaker 2: No-- I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], '67 [1967].  I started at University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when-I suppose-when you were going--you started going to Amarillo Junior College were you--you probably were thinking, how can I get out of this house?
Speaker 2: That's, that was the on--my, my--you know, people said what did you do during the civil, the civ- all of the Civil Rights Movement?  Think about how I could get away from Christine (laughter).  That--I didn't really have any attention on anything else except, you know, how can I lessen my pain, avoid being injured, and get away from here.  And I knew that soon as I finished Amarillo Junior College that there would be--I'd have to leave to go to finish school.
Speaker 1: So you stayed with Christine during junior college (simultaneous)-- ?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Um-hm, and worked at the hotel and worked at the bar and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Didn't date, yeah, you know.
Story_ID: 360925
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] how did, how did she [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] take you going off to school?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, she, I mean, she--it was not something she wanted to happen, but it had to happen.  She (laughter), she tried to--she made her one last push to get me hooked up with some man, someone who that had come actually from Dayton [Ohio] who came through.  Our lives are all intertwined--who came--he was a nice guy, and, and I appreciate him because she really--he could have really been a different--if he'd have been different sort of man, things would--she decided--he came through, and she kept trying to push me on him.  And so she decided that I needed to come to Dayton so that I could see another part of the world.  And this is where this gentleman named--gentleman--I can't remember his last name, but it was James [ph.].  So she decided to me send me up here so that I could see the world, which was really about sending me to see if, you know, she's gonna send her nineteen-year-old daughter up to a strange place with a--
Speaker 1: To, to, to meet a strange man, to, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A man--
Speaker 1: --visit a strange--
Speaker 2: --that she barely knew, she had met.  He had driven, driven through Amarillo [Texas], and she met him, and she liked his car; she liked how he talked; and he appeared to have a little bit of money.  And she always has the, she had this fantasy that if she could hook us up with someone with money, she would control us, and then she would control the men--the money, you know, that sort of thing.  And I came up here and I stayed at the Y [Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)].  And I remember telling James, I said, you know, this is my mother's idea, me coming up here.  And I said ain't nothing gonna happen.  So, if you're expecting anything, you--I can just stay at the Y until time to go home.  And he was nice--"No, no, no, I understand that.  Let me show you around."  And he was very nice, a very nice man, and made no attempts to do anything.  But I went back home and the first things she said to me was, "Have you fucked that man?"  "Did you fuck him?"  And I said, "No, mama."  'Cause she was vulgar, and she talked like that all the time.  And so, I said, "No, mama."  And you could see in her face the disappointment.  And so I told this story to someone.  They said, "Well, why was she disappointed?"  I said, "She had hoped that she could make a fuss about having sent her virginal daughter and had this man taking advantage of her."  And when I came back and, and nothing had happened, she was disappointed.  And, and so--but I left, and when I left, I--the only time I went back is when I left Texas.  But I never went back while I was in school.
Speaker 1: This is interesting because that whole story, I mean, there are so many families that have, have similar stories, because I think that it's, it's--we should take note, I mean, that, that the black community's been on the edge of an underground economy for a long time.  And a lot of things--
Speaker 2: Go on.
Speaker 1: I mean, that generation that she came out of, I mean, it's very typical behavior, speak easies and doing--and having a lot of conflicting ideas circling around their heads at the same time.
Speaker 2: At the same time.
Speaker 1: And how to, and how to manipulate all that stuff is really unbelievable.
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean, I mean, it really is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you think about it, she was an educated woman who appreciated education.  But at the same time she was involved in all these little illegal things and, and, and abusive and using children in inappropriate ways.
Speaker 1: I guess what happens when a lot of things are squeezed into a corner and you know, are not allowed to--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Almost like a Langston Hughes poem.
Speaker 2: You know, and I mean, you know, the part of the thing is, is there was also not--I mean, I've long since, I think--you know, I always say, well, you know, people do the best they can.  And part of her problem is she was crazy, and she's a product of her time, you know.  She did what she could do, you know, that sort of thing.  So yes, I, then I went away to University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas].
Story_ID: 352010
Speaker 1: Oh I want to ask you this before we get you there: now, how did you feel when you knew you were gonna leave, you're gonna be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was ecstatic.  I was not fearful of leaving.  I was like, thank God I'm getting ready to leave, that I'm getting out of here.  And you know, people, people say weren't you afraid to go off by yourself?  And I'm like, no.  I was just--I had finally got a way out of there.  And, and, and, and, and it was such a relief for me to get out of there, that I was so afraid of getting caught back up in it, that I never went back.
Speaker 1: Never, ever?
Speaker 2: I--one time, when, when I graduated from college [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], on the way to Portland, Oregon, 'cause I decided I was gonna get out of the state.  I decided that I, once I, when I--that I wanted to get as far away from everything as possible.  And so I graduated.  I was single.  I had my son [Tshaka Randall].  And I was like, I'm not gonna stay here in this state with all of this pain and stuff.  I'm gonna go to Portland, Oregon.  I stopped to see her [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] and to say goodbye then, but I never went back during my college years.  Once I left to go to--once I left the state going to Portland, I never went back until she died, and I buried her.  I never went back there, went to Amarillo [Texas] back.  I've never been back to Amarillo since, since 1970.
Story_ID: 352011
Speaker 1: So, well, how was the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], you know, to--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the thing is, is I was--we first of all, at, at Amarillo Junior College [Amarillo College, Amarillo, Texas], I was one of the ones to help grate--integrate Amarillo Junior College.  I don't know if I was the first black, but I'm sure I was one of the first.  And then you go to, to University of Texas, and this was in 1968, and I may have been this--I don't know which group of blacks I was in, in terms of--but I was one in the--in one of the earlier groups, you know, who used to say there was a hundred blacks on the whole campus.  And they had several thousand, you know, tens, tens of thousand--ten thousand, fifteen hundred, whatever, fifteen thousand students there, and they had maybe a hundred blacks.  We were in dorms.  I had a private room, and that was largely 'cause my foster mother [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] made a big fuss about, you know, wanting me to be in a private room.  I don't know why.  I--that was her idea.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a scholarship?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have a scholarship.  My dad [Ernest Randall] gave me some tuition money.  It wasn't ex- that expensive at that point to go to University of Texas.  You're talking about several hundred dollars for tuition and then books and then room and board.  My dad helped me pay that.  And then I got a job, and I worked and pay--and help pay that.  I think the main--I was not a good student at the University of Texas for four--for the first four years--for the first two years.
Speaker 1: Okay now, you, you, you went to junior college for two years, so you would come in as a sophomore?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And took me six years to graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Took me six years to graduate because I did--one of the things--I did what every caged bird does when it gets free (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you went absolutely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Crazy (laughter).  I partied; I pro- I participated in protest march; I did everything but go to class; I became sexually active; I did drugs; I smoked marijuana; I did everything.
Speaker 1: So you just got loose and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did everything (laughter).  I did everything.  I would sign up for classes, and I dropped them before I'd fail (laughter), was my pattern of behavior.  I was on probation.  I'd get on probation one semester, and I'd work just enough to get off the next semester.  I did that for two years.  And I was virtually always at--almost always at the point of being dismissed.  I was a campus activist.  I, I was outspoken on the war [Vietnam War].  I was outspoken on racial things.  I was a campus leader.  I was involved in--I, I helped to get the black history.  There was a, a room, and I helped to get in and decorate it.  And I--my--the nursing school kept trying to convince me to do something else but nursing.  I kept flunking med surgi- I flunked med surgical nursing twice.  And in nursing you can't move on to the next one until you, until you pass the one you're in.  Pri- primarily, I flunked, kept flunking med surgical nursing because I didn't know how to take multiple choice exams.  And this professor's, whose name I can't remember right at the moment, not Terri [ph.].  I can't think of her last name.  She said, "You're, you're too smart.  I don't know why you're failing these exams, because when you go on the floor, you know, when you go into the hospital and I question you, it's clear that you know the materials.  And I'm gonna figure out why."  And I thank her to this day, because if she had not sat me down and taught me how to take multiple choice exams, I probably would have eventually flunked out--
Story_ID: 352012
Speaker 1: What was the key to that?  I mean, it seems like it's not--I mean on the surface it doesn't seem to be difficult.  But what was the--
Speaker 2: I actually, I--the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the--?
Speaker 2: I, do, the work I do now is centered around the idea that there is a secret to how to take multiple choice exams.  And you've to learn how to do it, and most people don't know how to do it.  One thing to do it is not reading too much into things, trust--if you study, trusting your instinct, knowing how to rule out bad choices, knowing how to pick among the choices, knowing how to, to skip--to be--not get--letting yourself get bogged down on questions you don't know, moving on.  Most times, people who are not good on multiple choice exams are linear.  And so what they'll do is they'll, they, they won't move on to the next question until they got the answer to the question in front of them, which of course means that they get bogged down and so they don't finish the exam, when you should give an ex- you should give a multiple choice question forty-five seconds.  And if you haven't got the answer, you should move on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: To the next question.  And you will in the long run answer more questions than if you just stick with that question.
Speaker 1: Get more points, yeah.
Speaker 2: And get more points.
Speaker 1: You've got to turn it in at the end of the period, right?  And if you --get stuck on a question, you can't finish the rest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly. Exactly.
Speaker 1: That, that's, okay, that's a key that I, that, that--
Speaker 2: That's a part of the key.  I mean, there are some keys in terms of--but those are things that if you haven't been used to taking multiple choice, and if no one's ever taught you how to take multiple choice, you don't do naturally.  That's not--instinctively you, you say okay, let me get this question and then let me get the next question.  And you, and you may move on, but you've all--not until you've wasted five minutes, you know, so you'll try and try and try, and then at some point you give up.  And the answer is, is that you should quit after forty-five seconds.  If you can't answer it in forty-five seconds, move on.
Story_ID: 352013
Speaker 1: Now did you choose nursing because your mother [sic. maternal grandmother, Maude McGill Hall] had gone to nursing school?
Speaker 2: No.  I choose nursing because, in fact, someone told me I ought to be a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I said okay.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any idea what you wanted to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --yourself at that point--
Speaker 2: No, I had no, no vis--
Speaker 1: --except escape from (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Except escape from Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)].  That's exactly--go to school and escape from Christine, you know.  And so, you know, talking about the, the PATRIOT Act [Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001] and, and, and surveillance, someone was calling Christine and telling you about my an- anti-war activities and my, my--I don't know what kind of--I wasn't in the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] or anything, but I was heavy into the black--
Speaker 1: Was there--?
Speaker 2: --activism movement.
Speaker 1: Was there a black organization on campus [of University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a black student organization and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, we were doing a lot of re- we were doing what a lot of what a lot of young blacks were doing on all of the campus, you know, agitating for black history courses, agitating for a place where black students could go and feel safe, agitating for represent--more black faculty, more black students, anti-war.  So I was doing all of those things instead of studying.  At one point the dean asked--dean of school of nursing asked me if maybe I'll not change my major to political science because I was doing so poorly in nursing, and I was, you know, quite obviously, very interested in all of these things.  So that went on for two years.
Story_ID: 352014
Speaker 1: So did you, did you then change your, your major?
Speaker 2: No, but I got pregnant [with Tshaka Randall].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Was, was the, the, a fellow you met some, some someone you really--
Speaker 2: No, I, I was sexually promiscuous, and it was a part of my rebellion against Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)].  I did, I mean, I--you name everything a--you would not want your daughter to do during school, I did it during that two-year period, because I was let loose from my cage, and I didn't know how--I, I just, I didn't know how to do anything.  And I was scared, and I was experiencing life unsupervised, which I had never felt, experienced before and--(unclear) on me.  And when I got pregnant, I remember thinking that I didn't have a whole lot of choices.  I remember thinking--because at that time when young girls got pregnant, their, their choices were--abortion had just been legalized, so that wasn't really--it wasn't as mainstream thing to do.  It'd been legalized, but it wasn't as mainstream thing to do--get married, quit school, and go home.  People did not stay in school.  And I remember the friends of mine who got pregnant.  They did--one--those--one of those three things: they got married or they quit school and went home, until after they had the baby.  May, maybe they left it with their mother and came back, and maybe they didn't come back.  And I realized I didn't have those choices.  Abortion wasn't a choice that I wanted to exercise.  Getting married wasn't an option.  And I sure as hell wasn't going back to Christine.  So I might as well stay in school, and so I chose to stay in school.  And then I also realized that if I didn't, that if I didn't get a degree, I would eventually be out of school with no real skill.  And so I buckled down and got the best grades ever.  I finished--I, I went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, with a baby you did much better than--
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I actually tell people you should not tell girls that having a baby is the wrong thing.  It may be, and for many of them it is, but for some, it's going to be something that will cause them to focus.  Because part of me, I hated myself so much, and disliked myself so much, and had such low self-esteem that I didn't have the power to do anything good for myself.  But I wanted to be a better mother than I had had.  And so I could focus; I could do for my baby what I couldn't do for myself, you know, and I did.  I mean, my life, I mean, it changed a 100 percent overnight, overnight, just and just by being pregnant.  So I went my junior year pregnant.  And Almetris Duran, Ms., Ms. Duran was sort of this house mother, black woman that the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] had hired.  Ms. Duran had been hired when they first started letting black girls come to University of Texas.  And they segregated the young ladies into their own separate--before they integrated the--by the time I came, they integrated the dorms, but they, they weren't always integrated.  And they had a house that was especially for black girls to live in, and Ms. Duran was the house mother.  And at the time I went to college, this, the--you lived in the dorm.  The dorms were not co-ed.  And there were, was a house mother that supervised the goings and coming, and they locked the door at a certain time at night, and so it wasn't this free flow of things.  Partly, that--I think largely that is because, because--I don't why.  And at any rate, Ms. Duran, Ms. Duran encouraged me.  I wanted to stay, and I didn't know how that was gonna happen.  And she said well, you know, you just take your baby to class with you; you just do what you--if you want to stay, stay.  And oh, I should have found that picture--when you all do the picture, I mean, I think I have a picture of Ms. Duran with the baby.  And I use--I tell--I think I felt like--I don't know if it was true--I, I felt like the only pregnant single woman on the University of Texas campus.  I know among the blacks I was.  And so, you know, it was like, okay, I can do this.  So I, I stopped the partying; I start going to class; I start making good grades; I stopped the smoking; I stopped the drinking; and I start looking at being--getting out of school so that I could take care of my baby.
Story_ID: 352015
Speaker 1: Did you change your major, or did you stay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I stayed in nursing [at the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: --in the nursing?  Okay.
Speaker 2: When my baby [Tshaka Randall] is born I went to get welfare.  And welfare said to me, you--I said I'm in college, and I'm one year from graduation, which I was.  They said we won't give you welfare if you're in college.  I said but I'm only one year from graduation.  Sorry, rule says you can't have welfare if you're in college, trade school, yes; you can get welfare if you're in trade school.  We'll pay two years of a trade school.  I said but I'm only one year from graduation.  Can't have welfare.  So I did what any good-blooded American would do; I lied.  I went back and told them I had quit college, and I couldn't find a job.  Can I have welfare?  And they said yeah, so I went on welfare.
Speaker 1: So they were satisfied that you were sitting at home doing nothing and--
Speaker 2: They would, they would, they would pay to sit at me--to--and you know, I, I get upset, you know, and I'm like, the people blame people on welfare, and I'm saying people on welfare are the way they are because the system made rules to make it that way.  The system made rules that say if you work--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: If we--if you work, you got to report that little bit of income.  And Texas had this whole thing about: we don't want to encourage you to stay on welfare.  And if we give you all the money you need, then you'll never get off of welfare.  So what we're gonna do is only give you part of what you need.  So what that mean is, instead of the four hundred a month that they thought I need, they'd only give me two hundred a month.  And if I reported any income whatsoever, they took part of that two hundred.  If had a man who live with me, I didn't get the two hundred.  If I had a man who brought me any kind of gift, they valued the gift and subtracted it from the two hundred.  And so, what they encouraged was: a) don't work; b) don't get involved with a man; c) it--don't get, don't have the man do anything for you, and don't go to college.
Speaker 1: Or don't have a meaningful relationship (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Don't have a meaningful relationship.
Speaker 1: Because if I'm--they know that young women are gonna have a man some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at some point.
Speaker 2: So don't have a mean--
Speaker 1: But you can't have a meaningful one.
Speaker 2: You can't have a meaningful relation.  And they enforced it by sending around social workers to come into your home and look to see if you have anything that you can't afford (laughter), you know.  And so, you know, I did, you know, I, I, you know, I was, I, I, I wrote a letter once.  I'm like, you know--someone said why don't you run for office?  And this was a long time ago.  I said yeah, I got too much dirt in my background.  And one of them is, is that I lied to the federal government, and I got welfare for two, for, for two years when I wasn't--when I was working, and when I, I had a job part time, and I was in school finishing up nursing school.  But my--I've always believed that, that if you've got a--if, if you see a problem that is consistent, that is consistent, there's systemic reasons for that problem; there's something that, that the system is doing that promotes that.  And so instead of focusing on the individual people, focus on changing the system because the system promotes it.  So, so yeah, I graduated.
Story_ID: 352016
Speaker 1: I had to live with my sister-in-law [LeEartha Randall] because I couldn't afford a house on my own.
Speaker 2: Now your sister-in-law, this would be--
Speaker 1: My brother's wife.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: James [James Randall].  And--
Speaker 2: Did they live in--?
Speaker 1: They lived in Austin [Texas].
Speaker 2: In Austin.
Speaker 1: And, and my brother was gone off to Korea, and, and she was in school at the university [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Okay, so your brother joined the [U.S.] Army when he got old enough.
Speaker 1: My brother and sister [Brenda Randall] got caught stealing.  And they gave him the option: go to jail, or go to the Army, so he chose the Army.  And, and then they sent him to Korea.
Speaker 2: What about your sister, what (unclear)?
Speaker 1: My sister ended up going to college for--going to drama school for a while, not doing much with it.  Ultimately, she followed me up to Alaska and got into office work and, and became a self-taught computer programmer and really did a lot of--did a good, lot of good work in that area, worked for the oil and gas administration as a, as a computer programmer.
Speaker 2: Is she still there?
Speaker 1: She's still in Alaska retired.
Story_ID: 352017
Speaker 1: So I had my baby.  I rode--I had a bicycle that I used to ride around University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] with my baby on the back 'cause I didn't have a car.  I went to class.  I graduated.  And you know, it was hard, but it wasn't as hard as, as, as living with Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] was.  When I got pregnant, Christine came, drove down and to meet with my doctor.  And she apparently, she just went off on him, on him about me and what kind of whore I was, this, that, and another (laughter).  And he apparently told her--my sister [Brenda Randall] was there--and he apparently told her that he couldn't see anything wrong with me but her and that perhaps if she stayed out of my life I would be okay.  And so my--she became convinced that he must be the father of my baby, because why else would he defend me that way?  But that was the kind of person she was, you know, she--you know, if anybody stepped in like that.  But I cleaned houses.  I, I actually had to finance most of my own education.  I lived in a boarding house.  I did various different jobs.  I lived in a boarding house while I was pregnant once, and they gave me free room and board and I--if I would clean the boarding house.  And so, I used to clean the boarding house.
Speaker 2: So the--your son, you, you had, you have a little boy, right?  Yeah, well, this is--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tshaka [Tshaka Randall].
Speaker 2: This was, this is Tshaka, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And did the father do any--
Speaker 1: No, and--
Speaker 2: --when he was--
Speaker 1: --and that largely, I mean, that largely is much my issue as anything else.  I did not ask for keep him in contact or try to keep him in contact with him.  I sort of just took my baby and went off with my baby.  It's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was--and so I, I don't know if he would or could have done something.  I know I didn't allow him the opportunity to do anything.  So, I take responsibility for that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 352018
Speaker 1: Well, what happened after you graduated [from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]?  What, what--
Speaker 2: I, when I graduated I decided that I wanted to get out of Texas.  And my father [Ernest Randall] was up in Portland, Oregon, and so I packed up everything the day after graduation.  I flew through Amarillo [Texas] and said we're going to Portland.  And I had my--one of, one of my last, not my last, my, one of my last confrontations with Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)].  She was going to take a broom to me, and I told her I was--I don't know--I was twenty-three--excuse me-twenty-four at the time.  And I said look, you know, I'm too big for this.  And if you hit me with that broom I'm not gonna hit you back, but I'll never come around you again, period, and she put the broom down.  And, and then I flew to Am- to Portland.
Story_ID: 352019
Speaker 1: I got a--I lived with my dad [Ernest Randall] for a year.  I got a job as an emergency room nurse, where I experienced--it was Bess Kaiser Hospital [Portland, Oregon], and where in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what, what hospital was it?
Speaker 1: Bess Kaiser.  Now, I had a mast--I had a B.A. degree in nursing.  And also on the ward was a hospital-trained nurse, white nurse, who was the same age as I am.  And we had been work--we had got hired at the same time.  A B.A. is supposed to be a higher-level degree than a hospital-trained nurse.  I--and when they, when they needed a charge nurse, temporary charge nurse, I should have been the one that they identified, but they never would.  They decided that she had more experience because even though she graduated at the same, same time that I graduated, she went to--they changed the rule.  One of the things that I've experienced throughout my life working in predominantly white institutions is, is that whatever the rule is when you come in, if you, black person, can take advantage of the rule, they change it (laughter).  And it's just as simple as that.  I, I mean, I can tell--every job I've ever had there's been, okay, there's this rule; I'm gonna take advantage of it.  Oops, we didn't mean for you to take advantage of or for you to use it the way it's gonna be used, and so we will just change the rule even though we may have had the rule for years and years and years.  And so, up until the point that they hired me, and I was the first black person they'd ever hired in--their rule had been the charge nurse is the person with the most education and experience, that is, having been there.  So that was me.  So now it was come, well, by experience we mean a hospital-trained nurse has more experience because they have been trained in a hospital, so your bachelor's degree doesn't really help you anymore.  And so you don't get to be charge nurse at all, ever.  This white girl who is same age, same, and same level of experience, the rule has been changed to redefine what experience means so she can get to be charge nurse over you.  Then I had this doctor who would throw things, and you know, and he never really did it with other people.  And one time he came in, he would--he was mad at me, at something, and he just threw all of the files on the floor, just separated them.  And I refused to pick them up.  I just went back to the charge nurse and said, "I'm not picking them up.  You know, he's got to stop throwing things.  You know, he doesn't do it with anyone else, and I'm not going to take it.  I'm gonna pick up--he can't throw things on the floor and think I'm gonna scurry around and pick them up."  So I stayed there a year, and I decided to go back to school, and I decided I wanted to become a family nurse practitioner.  So I moved up to Seattle, Washington.
Speaker 2: Now, what, what year was it that you went to Portland [Oregon]?
Speaker 1: I went--let's see, Tshaka [Tshaka Randall] was born in '71 [1971]; graduated [from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in '72 [1972].  I worked a year.  I must have went to Portland in '72 [1972], '72 [1972], yes.  I think I went to Portland in '72 [1972], and I went to Seattle in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you graduated from college in '71 [1971] and then went to Portland in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.  I graduated from college in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972], okay.
Speaker 1: Tshaka was born in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And then, if I graduated college in '72 [1972], so I went to Portland in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Okay, I got it straight now.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: I was--when I applied for the University of Texas, I didn't initially get admitted because I (laughter) had bad, I had bad grades, really bad grades.  My--to, to tell you how bad my grades are, my overall GPA was a 2.3.  That's with making 3.8 the last couple of years.
Story_ID: 360926
Speaker 1: You moved to Seattle, Washington, in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I applied for the university, school, to go to University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], and they didn't admit me.  I actually got a denial letter.  And I was in Portland [Oregon].  And I--so I drove up to Seattle to meet with the dean, and I ask her, you know, you haven't--you know, I got denied.  What can I do to get admitted?  And she says well, your GPA is low and your, your GREs are low.  And I--'cause the--I didn't do all that well.  I, even though I've never--I've always under-scored on standardized tests, okay.  So I said to her, "Well, look, how many black people you got in your class?"  And she looked at me like, really, like no one had ever really said it that bluntly.  She says, "Well, none."  I says, "Well, what difference does it make to you?  If, if you think I'm gonna fail, it's my money, my dime, you know.  Why not give me a chance, you know, to fail, you know?"  And whatever, it caught her attention or whatever, I--they ultimately admitted me.  And I promptly got put on probation the first semester.  I was not an entirely good student.  Even though I had done--turned things around in undergraduate school [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I still was suffering from depression, from--and, and I was a single parent with, with a child going, trying to go to school with no scholarships and no source of money.  And so money was always an issue, and, and of course, that--whenever money gets tight you get depressed even more (laughter).  So, my first semester I was placed on probation.
Speaker 1: Did you know anybody in Seattle or--
Speaker 2: I had a--my, my oldest brother who has a different mother than me, Jerry [Jerry Randall].  He was in--but we weren't close.  We didn't grow up together.  And so, no, I really didn't know anyone in Seattle.  I did--I've large--I moved a lot, and I've always moved sort of like, to places where I could be by myself, sort of away from family, away from people, largely because I, I've always--my fam- you know, I've always had a bit of anger at my family, not my brother [James Randall] and sister [Brenda Randall], but at my aunts and uncles.  It's sort of like, they knew Christine [Randall's foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] was crazy.  And, and, and they, you know, they, they turned--they, they let it go on.  They said well, Ernest [Ernest Randall] must know what he's doing or something like that.  And so, I didn't really have much to want to do with family.  And so I, so I went up there, and I, you know, I, I try to figure out--I don't have a memory of how I paid for things.  I know I didn't get no scholarship, and I worked, I worked part-time as a nurse at night and stuff.  And then I had my son, Tshaka [Tshaka Randall], who was like two years old.  And I finished--I pulled myself off of probation.
Story_ID: 360927
Speaker 1: I had a teacher who helped me [at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], white teacher.  She really helped me.  She helped me because at the height of my de- I got, I got clinically depressed, clin-, and, and, and clin-, the, the second time in my life I had been clinically depressed.  I'd been clinically depressed in, at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and been hospitalized.  And I got clinically depressed again, and I was not taking care of myself or my son.  I actually say to people that had social service been differently organized, I might have lost my son [Tshaka Randall] because I wasn't taking care of him, and I wasn't taking care of myself.  And somebody would have reported me, and they'd have come out and they'd have taken one look at the house, and they would have (laughter) taken my son.  But this teacher came over, and she recognized that I was clinically depressed.  She came over with her two children, and I didn't want to let her in the house 'cause the house was filthy, filthy.  And, and she kind of pushed her way in.  She cleaned the house.  She took my son and said you need a weekend, and she took my son back to the house with her and gave me space, you know, gave me help, gave me the help I needed.  She didn't talk, which is that she--and that modeled for me how I try to help students.  You don't tell people what they need to do.  You help them do it.  You don't say well, you need to get your house cleaned, and you need to do this and then walk out the door.  If they're depressed they know they need to get the house cleaned, but apparently they can't do it, you know, so clean it, you know, and give them, give them--you know, take their child; give them some space, and that's what she did for me.  And that helped me enough to turn myself around, and I quit school.
Story_ID: 360928
Speaker 1: I quit my master's degree program [at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] to get a full-time job as a nurse practitioner.  I had done all the coursework.  And this was early.  I was a pioneer in the nurse practitioner field, so it wasn't regulated like it is now, so I didn't have to have a degree.  And there was this community, High Point Center [Seattle, Washington], it was a low-income community that was situated in a middle-class neighborhood.  And the doctors would not accept them, mostly black, Hispanic, Samoans.  And even though they had welfare and Medicaid, the doctors wouldn't accept the welfare and Medicaid.  And, and the near--and they would have to get on buses and go on long rides to try to get health care.  And there was no hospital anywhere close that they could go to.  So they decided to start their own health center, one of the first community health centers.  And I interviewed, and they hired me.  And I was the first person they hired.  And we put the center together.  I was seeing six hundred patients a month, easily, working there.  I, I was the primary healthcare provider and--for that low income minority community.  And--
Speaker 2: So did, did you enjoy that?  Did that--?
Speaker 1: I loved that.  I loved it.  I mean, I loved, I loved the work.  I loved helping people.  I loved the fact that I was working with poor people and, and, and minorities who needed the help.  And I, I had people who were coming to me who wouldn't go to doctors.  I had a Samoan lady who had gangrene and who really needed to be in a hospital.  And her daughter couldn't get her into, get her into the hospital because she wouldn't, but she got her into my clinic.  And I had a doctor that I worked with, and we decided that we had to treat because otherwise she was gonna lose her leg, or die, or worse, die.  And if she would come to me even though she was beyond what I should be taking care of, she was coming to me, so I, I needed to take care of her.  So we made a deal: if you--we told her if you will come to me on a regular basis at the intervals I say and do what I tell you, I'll take care of you.  And, and, and it turned out okay.  We started physicals in the schools.  They, you know, they--we--you know, I, one of the things I--bothers me is how all the systems develop around middle-class needs and then get mad at poor people because poor people won't access them.  And so like, take your doc- take your child for a physical.  Okay, what does that mean?  Taking off of work, getting on a bus, going to a doctor, taking a half a day or so, losing money that you need for basics for a child who's basically well.  No, it doesn't make--it, it doesn't make any rational sense to do that.  So we said we think physicals are important.  Why don't we do something different, which is we don't have to have the parents sitting there.  That's the middle class way of doing it.  So why don't we just do the physicals in the school without the parent and then go to the parents' home and give them a report?  They sign a consent, we do the physical.  We can do a bunch of kids at one time.  We--if they're all--if they're well, we can just send them a report home saying they're well.  And if they need something, we can go to their parents' home and do it.  And it was a great success, you know.  So I loved that. We did a health fair.  People say blacks and poor people don't come to health fair.  I said that's because you call it a health fair (laughter).  So we got a band and music and food, and we put in a--we, we, we, we said we having a, we're having a festival, and come out for the festival, and we had all kinds of things.  And oh, by the way, when you get inside there's all this health stuff, not mixed up.  We even did, and this--and I tell nurses and stuff--we did pap smears in the gym.  They--how did you do pap smears in the gym?  I said we put up, we put up things, closed off the place, where there was privacy.  And if a woman came over we said, "Have you had a pap smear?"  She said, "No," said, "Come on back; we can do one right now.  You don't need to get undressed; we can, we got everything in here; it's private."  And so we--so yeah, I loved that; I loved doing that.  It was, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 1: --great fun.
Story_ID: 360929
Speaker 1: How did you find the City of Seattle [Washington]?  I know it rains a lot.  You know, and if you, a person has, has already got a lot of issues, I mean, that seems like that'd be the worst place to go for--
Speaker 2: Actually, I was telling someone I like bad weather rather than I--more than I like sunny weather.  I actually feel better in rainy weather.  And part of it--and it just may be weird me--part of it is, is that I can always feel better than the weather.  Sunny weather, and you're not feeling--sunny weather depresses me.  And so--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess Amarillo [Texas] was kind of, was sunny all the time, but a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --really sad situation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so may, maybe that was it.
Speaker 2: So maybe that's part of your--I associate.  I never thought about that.  Maybe I associate the sun with Amarillo.  But I don't like sunny weather.  So I, I mean, I loved Seattle.  I, I found Seattle to be fine.  I mean, you know, I didn't--the rain and weather didn't bother me any, too much.  I worked there I think about two years, three years maybe, almost '77 [1977], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of the place was?
Speaker 2: High Point Health Center [High Point Center, Seattle, Washington] where I worked.
Speaker 1: High Point, H-I-G-H?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: P-O-I-N-T Health Center.  It started that I was the first person--it was still going fifteen years after I left.  I don't know what's happened to it since then.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you--
Speaker 2: Got pregnant my second time.
Speaker 1: How what do they call, call your--what was your title?
Speaker 2: I was a family nurse practitioner.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I delivered a baby.  But mostly I saw people in the clinic.  I mean, it was, the clinic was like a doctor's office.  People made appointments.  They came in.  I saw them.  I treated them.  We had a lab tech who ran labs on them.  We did our own labs.  You know, we draw--we had, we had a social worker that we sent around to people houses.  It was quite a nice clinic.
Story_ID: 360930
Speaker 1: So what happened in '77 [1977]?  What did you decide to do?
Speaker 2: I went through a phase of--I'm going--I was--it was actually '76 [1976] when it started.  The phase was I am never going to be married, you know, that I think women go through that.  If you get twenty-eight or so and you aren't married, you know, we think I'm never gonna get married.
Speaker 1: So you were then, what, twenty-seven?
Speaker 2: I was twenty--in '76 [1976], I was twenty-eight.
Speaker 1: Twenty-eight, okay.
Speaker 2: So I, I started going through that phase, and I started dating this ja- man, Vivian Charles Phillips [ph.], who's the father of my youngest son.  And I got pregnant.  And I thought that, that I didn't want to go through a second pregnancy alone, that Charles asked me to marry him so that I should marry him.  I don't know that it was the right thing to do, but I did marry him.  And so I quit the clinic after Issa [Issa Randall] was born in '77 [1977].  But Charles was working up in Alaska on the pipeline and, and had--I wanted to stay in Seattle [Washington].  He wanted to go to, he wanted to be in Alaska, and he actually moved back to Alaska.  Issa's born in Jan- in July 1977.  I married Charles in January 1977, and Issa was born in July 1977.  And Charles moved back to Alaska right after Issa was born.  And it was clear to me that if I was going to, if I was going to make this marriage work, I was gonna have to leave Seattle.  And so I moved to Alaska in November of 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what part of Alaska?
Speaker 2: Fairbanks [Alaska].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No money, no job, two babies (laughter), to Alaska.
Speaker 1: But you had a track record of, of service and you know, as a nurse.  And that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And I didn't have a prob- I, I, I mean I'd--I was confident that I was gonna get a job, which I did within a week, not my ideal job; I got a jobs as a detox nurse supervisor in an alcohol detox center in Fairbanks, Alaska.  The interesting thing is that my foster mother [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] had moved to Fairbanks.  So we actually ended up in the same city.
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Don't ask me.  It's one of those--I've had these things in my life that kind of come, you know, come together.
Speaker 1: Now that is, that is strange.
Speaker 2: That is strange.  She had moved--
Speaker 1: Of all the places--
Speaker 2: Of all the places in the world, for two people who aren't necessarily looking to get in contact with each other, and she was up in Alaska.
Speaker 1: She was already there?
Speaker 2: She was already there.
Speaker 1: And how did you, how did you discover she was there?
Speaker 2: I knew she was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Well, that must have made that decision a lot tougher.
Speaker 2: It was a very hard decision, although by that time we were telephone talking.  And you know, I, I didn't feel like she had the same level of control that I--had when I was eighteen, although--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she still frightened me.
Speaker 1: Well, why was she there?  Why was she in Alaska?
Speaker 2: She--the tax people had taken down everything she had tried to do, and I think she just needed to get away from Amarillo [Texas].  She lost the hotels.  She lost the bar.  And I--and she at--she had a friend that had been up in Alaska at one point, and she decided to move to Fairbanks, which I tell you, I think--let's see, let's see, that must have been in 1970 or '4 [1974] or so, or '5 [1975] or so that she moved to Fairbanks.  And she was born in 1914, so how old was she?  She was sixty years old.  She pulled up everything and moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, where she knew nobody, her and her husband [Major Rogers (ph.)], to start over.  So it's something.
Speaker 1: So did she present a problem being there at all?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, I, I didn't actually go around her.  And when she would come around, she would never get in--come--she would never come into my house.  So, she--you know, it wasn't much of a problem, yeah, no, so.  I was still working on getting over it.  But I was far, so far enough past it that the only time she caused me anxiety is when I was actually in her presence, so I just made a point of not being in her presence very often.  I was in Fairbanks two and half years, and I don't think I saw her more than a half a dozen times over that two and a half years while we, while we were there in Fairbanks.  So it, it wasn't a big problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 360931
Speaker 1: So you were there [Fairbanks, Alaska] two, two and a half years.  Did, did you work as a, as the nurse in the, in the drug place (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just for about--I didn't really like that job.  And I wanted to be a public health nurse.  And they said that the on--that public health nurses were hard jobs to come by.  There was this long list of people who wanted to be public health nurses and so that I'd have to get on the list.  But I decided, which I kind of instinctively knew these things, that I can jump over all the people on the list if the person doing the hiring wanted to hire me.  So I went and did an informational interview with the supervisor of the Fairbanks Health Center [Fairbanks Public Health Center, Fairbanks, Alaska] and early on and kind of kept in touch with her.  And a, a public health nurse position came open about six months after I moved to Fairbanks, and I got the public health nurse.  And I--my--public health nurses in Alaska--I was an itinerant public health nurse, which meant that I served a group, a population group, that was not in Fairbanks.  And there's two kind, there's two kind of itinerant public health nurse.  One travels by car, and one travels by plane; mine was by car.  And my district started with North Pole, Alaska, which is a name of a town and not the North Pole, and extended for about a hundred and fifty miles out from that.  And I would have to drive around in a jeep, in a car, in a van, and I had clinics at these different communities.  I went to people's home, those who would let me in.  Some people wouldn't let me in.  You know, they, they, they see a black woman drive up to their door, and they just wouldn't let me in.  They'd say, you know, get away, they, they're not letting me in.  There was this, this man who had children that was having awful problems and just refused to let me help him.  And so, I did that; I did--I, I was a party to one of the first lawsuits on, on comparable pay lawsuits.  A compar- we, the public health nurses, were making five--approximately five hundred dollars a month less than the physician assistants in the, in--for the state.  Now, we were all state employees; public health nurses were paid by the state.  And physician assistants weren't required to have any kind of particular educational background, where public health nurses had to have a bachelor's degree and a certain level of experience.  And we were making five--on average, five hundred dollars a month less than the physician assistants.  So a group of us grouped together and filed a lawsuit and--against the state.  We lost the lawsuit, but the state changed its pay policies, and so I got a pay raise.  I also got offered a position as the maternal child nurse coordinator for the State of Alaska, and I moved to Juneau [Alaska].
Speaker 1: Maternal child nurse coordin--
Speaker 2: Coordinator.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Juneau--
Speaker 1: What, what year is that?
Speaker 2: That's in--let's see, '77 [1977]--two and half--'79 [1979], '80 [1980] maybe, somewhere like that.
Story_ID: 360932
Speaker 1: I was getting to the end.  That was also the period where I finished my master's degree [from the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] in public--in, as a nurse practitioner.  My professor, two professors, that just really pushed me to write my dissertation, which is all that I had left to do, and frankly I--they gave, they--I feel like that--I've never reread my dissertation because I'm not sure--I mean my thesis--
Speaker 2: Thesis.
Speaker 1: --'cause I'm, I'm not sure that the (laughter) quality of it was all that great.  But they, they really pushed me to get it done, was very anxious for me to get the degree, and, and really helped me get through the--get the data through and pushed it, and they helped me with that.  So then I went to Fairbanks [sic. Juneau, Alaska] where my job was to evaluate the maternal child health programs in the state and to do training for nurses.  And I flew all over the state doing that and, and worked--had my two children [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall].  We started a black organization in Juneau, all hundred of us.  I don't remember the name of it.  I have some pictures.  I don't know if I pulled them out, but I can pull them out if, if you'd like to.  We--there was--we said there, there were a hundred blacks in Juneau, if you counted the babies in utero.  I love Juneau.  It was beautiful.  The scenery was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Where is it in respect to--?
Speaker 1: It's in the panhandle of Alaska, the part down on the end, you know--
Speaker 2: It's going towards Japan and--
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: --and Asia or--
Speaker 1: --the part going towards Seattle [Washington] and stuff.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: It's only two hours from Seattle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's that little tail--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --on Alaska.  So you've got the big body of Alaska and the little tail, and it's in that little tail.  And you can only get there by plane because there's no roads that go to Juneau.  So you have to fly in or take a boat in.  And then when the weather's bad, you can't get in at all.
Story_ID: 360933
Speaker 1: Alaska taught me a lot about the nature of racism and how it con- that it's about numbers and threat; and that, that in terms of behavior.  I try to separate out prejudices and biases from racism, which I think is about behavior and discrimination.  And there weren't many black people in Alaska, and all of them had gotten them some way that made them skilled.  So, you--and people just didn't come up to Alaska.  They came up to work on the pipeline or something like that or [U.S.] military.  A lot of them were military people.  There was not a lot of direct racism that I perceived in Juneau [Alaska] against blacks, but Natives Americans, it was vicious.  And people would try to co-op me into it.  So, it was, it was almost as if: if we can get you to participate in the discussion, then it can't be racist because you're black, and you wouldn't, you wouldn't be doing this if it was racist.  And, and I constantly had to say to people: look, I think what you're doing is racist; I think the conversation you're having is racist; don't pull me into it; don't try to pull me into it.  And one time we--I had this, I had this office next door to these two women.  One was a nutritionist.  They both were nutritionists, and I--they were having this conversation, this racist conversation about this Native American mother with a lot, all these children.  And it just upset me so much that I finally went in and said, "Look, I know this isn't my conversation, but I find it to be very racist, and I wish you would stop it."  And the young woman, who appeared white, said to me, well, she was part Native American, and she didn't find it racist.  And I so I said to her, "Well, shame on you; shame on you that you would sit and participate in what is clearly a racist conversation."  And I think that, that, that really shook her up a little bit, you know, that she hadn't really thought about it in that way, you know, and excusing the racist behavior of whites.  The other thing that happened to me in that job [maternal child nurse coordinator], which has happened to me in a number of different occasion is, is that I've learned over the years that it doesn't matter how long I go doing a good job within the context of a white institution.  As soon as a disagreement between me and a white person arises, my--I, I become suspect, okay.  And so I had been in that job five years with no complaints.  And then this administra- I was--this administrative assistant come in and we start having problems.  And now instead of them saying to her, you know, Vernellia's [HistoryMaker Vernellia Randall] been here five years.  Nobody else is having problems with her.  You straighten it out.  She start coming into my office and taking work.  She, she started thinking she had to protect her boss from my writing because I was not writing well, and I had mistakes in my writing.  And so she was gonna take my materials off and put it on the desk.  And so then they--it was like, well, we want to mediate this discussion.  We want to mediate this discussion between you and her.  And you have to then sit and listen to her tell you why she's doing all of this.  And I always felt like, well, no, I shouldn't have to do that.  You should--you know, she's the new entity in here.  And if you haven't been having this problem with me, I should be the one getting the benefit of the doubt.  But I found over and over again that that doesn't happen.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is--what is today?  February the 26th, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Presently we're in my house at Dayton, Ohio, USA.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we're continuing an interview that we started in, I think in March of 2006.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: So it's been a couple of years.
Story_ID: 360935
Speaker 1: So we're gonna pick up where we left off.  We had you in--
Speaker 2: Alaska.
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of in Alaska, yeah, you were employed as a--
Speaker 2: Family nurse practitio- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nurse, right.
Speaker 2: --I was a--actually, no.  I was a--in the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s]--I was the maternal child nurse coordinator for the State of Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had been a family nurse practitioner.  And my job in Alaska was one of, of going around the state, making sure that nurses were well trained when it came to maternal child health.  I worked for the state department and, and I did a lot of traveling with that job.  And I had, I had two children at the time and was a single parent.  My oldest son, my Tshaka [Tshaka Randall], must have been nine years old, and my youngest son, Issa [Issa Randall], was about three years old when we was in Juneau, Alaska.  It's an interesting period.  It was interesting because there weren't very many blacks in Juneau.  And we started a organization, a black organization, whose name I can't even remember now.  There was about a hundred blacks I think.  We used to joke that there would be a hundred blacks if you counted the babies in utero.  And, but it was a great time in terms of it's one of the places where I say that one of the things I learned about, I learned about how implicit racial discrimination work.  And it was easy because a lot of the, a lot of the discrimination there was not targeted towards African Americans.  And it seemed to me that it was targeted more towards Native Americans.  And so, there was often attempts to try to bring black people into the racist behavior, you know, to say--and, and so I learned about that kind of behavior.  It was also a really stressful period.  It was stressful because I also experienced a lot of, of, of--I don't know what kind of racism to call it, but it was, I was--would get young white men in my, put in my division and, and trained them.  I had a master's degree in nursing [from the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington].  I was working on a master's degree in public health, and I had--I don't know--maybe ten years' experience, something like that.  And I wanted, I had a desire to be promoted into the commissioner's office.  I wanted to be an associate, assistant commissioner, maybe even commissioner for the State of Alaska.  And--but these young white men would get put into my division and work six months to a year and then get promoted into the, into the commissioner's office, and I wouldn't get promoted in the commissioner's office.  So there was this whole sort of discontent that I was having at that time because I knew that I was kind of dead-end in terms of what I was gonna be able to do there.  There was--I, I have a learning disability.  I didn't know it at the time.  And so, and it manifests itself by me having really serious problem with proofreading.  I tend to be a really great ideas person and very analytical and can see connections between things without having a whole lot of data.  But if I write it up, I'm going to (laughter) misspell something, and I'm not gonna catch it, you know.  And so I, I would need, I needed assistance of a good secretary.  And--but I think people, one of the problems is, is, I feel like, that comes from being black in an all-white institution is, is that people expect you to not be competent.  And in that expectation they look for your problems.  Everyone has problems.  You know, it's not that anybody's perfect.  It's just that I feel like as a black person who almost all my life has been the only per- black person in my--in wherever I work, what would happen is, is that no matter how well I performed in all these other areas, areas that was much more significant, you know, ultimately people would eventually--start focusing on this little, this problem, or you misspelled this, or you misspelled that; and you know, and, and, and basically took it as laziness, like, well, you know, if you would just proofread more, that sort of thing.  And I was frustrated because I didn't know--you know, proofread a lot and it still happened.  So on the one hand, I had this kind of not being able to move into the commissioner's office, being frustrated by that sort of continuous kind of being under the microscope, so to speak, for my work.
Story_ID: 360936
Speaker 1: So that, that happened--so that was going on. At the same time, one of the thing-, I had a, a flying incident that scared me (laughter).  I, I used to fly into these small villages, like, so I'd go to Barrow, Alaska, where there's, you know, the only way you can get in and out of it is by airplane, or I go to the islands, and the only way you get in and out are airplanes.  And so, one time I--we flew into this little island in southeast Alaska, and we plane land, and I went to the nurses--to the nursing center to talk to the nurses.  I was gonna stay three or four days.  My sister [Brenda Randall] was living in Alaska with me at that time, and she was keeping my kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall].  So, I had just gotten off the plane, and we--I went to the nursing center.  And maybe two hours in, I--there's a call that a storm is coming in, that they didn't know how long the storm would last, and that, that they were leaving, the plane, and that if I didn't leave I would be on the island until the storm was gone, which could be couple of weeks, several weeks before they could get back.  So, of course, I wanted to leave.  But we was riding the tail of the storm.  And if--you, you're in a two propeller plane that seats five people, so you're (laughter) not talking about a jet.  There was maybe three people in the plane, the pilot, myself, and another passenger, who was a man.  That plane got swooped by the storm all over the place.  It was like, people were vomiting.  The plane, it looked like the, the winds would take the plane into the mountain, look like we were gonna hit the mountain, and then the pilot would correct it.  I'd never been so scared in all my life.  And I actually got afraid of flying and found that I couldn't do my--that I began to make excuses for (laughter) not taking plane trips, you know, which was a fundamental part of my job [maternal child nurse coordinator].  So I decided that I needed to leave that job and, and that I wanted to do something where people thought you were smart because I felt like that; I was a woman; people don't think women are smart.  I'm black; people don't think black people are smart.  And I'm a nurse; people don't think nurses are smart.  They like nurses, but they don't think of us as smart.  And I decided that I wanted to do something that people would think, oh, you must be smart.
Story_ID: 360937
Speaker 1: Now, before we leave this, now, that, you were telling a story in the last reel about a conflict at the job [maternal child nurse coordinator for the State of Alaska] where there was, there was some dispute, and one of the clientele, I mean, one, one of the clients was in conflict with you about something and, and--
Speaker 2: I think that might have been the administrative assistant for the, for the, for, for the section that I was in.
Speaker 1: Was that what it--okay.
Speaker 2: There, there was administrate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, it wasn't a client--
Speaker 2: It wasn't a client.  It was an administrative assistant.  I think that's what the--if we're talking about the mid-'80s [1980s], right before I went to law school.  Now there's also a client--I, I don't know if I told the story about me learning about cultural sensitivity and Native Americans.
Speaker 1: Yes, you did, you told that.
Speaker 2: I told that.  Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, but, the--
Speaker 2: The, the administrative assistant story is, I'd been working at the, the health department for several years and was getting decent evaluations, good evaluations, and liking my job.  And we hired this new woman to many--administrative assistant, not to me, but to the person, the, the, the director of my de- of the unit that I was in; a white woman, little bit older than me.  I was gonna call her middle-aged, but now that I'm looking back, she wasn't that old (laughter).  I was in my early thirties, and she might have been in her late thirties, mid-forties.  She took to going into my office and taking work off of my desk and in an effort to--because she felt like she needed to protect her boss from the work that I produced, and she took to doing that, okay.  And at first--and she did it without asking me; she did it without consulting with me; and she did it without consulting my boss.  She just was doing it.  And when I discovered what she was doing I filed a complaint, okay.  Now, instead of them sitting her down and saying you shouldn't be doing this, it was, oh, well, she has a good reason for what she's doing, so we're gonna sit you down and both of you, and we're gonna talk about this as, as if you caused her to do this.  So it was like, okay, whatever reason she gave them for doing it, they decided, even though they had never had that problem before, had never articulated that problem before, they decided that I was part of the problem, and so they sat me down and, and, and they nev- and they never really did reprimand her.  They just sort of kind of did this negotiation things.  And I, and I think that largely may also called--caused me to realize--and, and it's an experience that I felt--it's not the first time that has happened to me, where if confronted with a problem, as a, me as a black person, against a white person, that I very rarely get supported unconditionally, that it's almost as if, okay, what are you doing to cause them to have this problem.  Okay, the--they wouldn't act this way; they wouldn't be doing this if you weren't doing something that was causing them to have to behave this way.  We don't agree with their behavior.  In fact, if I've heard that once, I've heard it several times.  And people say I'm intimidating.  One of the problems is, is, is that when I work with people in, in, in a, in a supervisory role or in a role in which I have more authority, people will often complain of me being intimidating in, in how I respond to them.  And so, so then, I then become part of the problem.  And, and it all--and, and it comes up not like on a regular basis, but it is almost as if, as if someone has to be introduced.  I can go along okay, and it can be years with no problem, and then someone new gets introduced into the environment, and they have a problem with me.  At that point, it's never gonna be--I'm never going to be treated as they're the problem.  It's okay, what are you doing as well, because they wouldn't have a problem.  And it's always white.  I've never had a problem with someone black being introduced, even though I've fired--in my positions I've had to fire both black and white people.  It's always that kind of thing.  So yes, I had that prob- I had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that, that kind of weigh in in the decision of--
Speaker 2: That weighed in the decision.  That weighed in the decision.  It, it, it, it made me, it made me feel like that I was no longer in a place where I was respected, no longer in a place where I would be treated as an intelligent person, and that, that I probably should find me another job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I decided that I really needed to sort of change how people perceived me intellectually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 360938
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I suppose just the, Alaska, the physical environment, was intimidating after that plane ride, you know, just--
Speaker 2: Well, not--flying was intimidating; Alaska wasn't.  I loved Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  In fact, I think I stayed there so long because it was so beautiful, and, and I really enjoyed it.  My kids enjoyed it.  In fact, they thought they were--my oldest son [Tshaka Randall] was adamant that when he got grown he was gonna move back to Alaska, you know.  So, they had a good time there.  We, you know, they were the--I think one of the things that integration did, and, and it's still something that we still haven't addressed, is, is that our kids became isolated, you know, at least from my experience.  So my kids were raised in a totally different way than from what I was raised, in terms of, I was raised where I went to school with black kids; my teachers were black; all of the professionals that I knew were black.  The issue of whether or not I was going to college was not an issue of can black people do it; it was just an issue of, can I pay for it?  Can I find a school that I'll go to there because we had a long history of black--my family had gone to college, and everybody else, all of the black people that I knew--all the professionals that I knew were black.  My kids were raised where they saw very few black professionals.  All of the professionals they saw were white.  And then they were raised in these environments where they would be the only white--I mean the only black kid.  And it caused them some amount of stress.  And so I remember my youngest son, Issa [Issa Randall], we had an--when we was in Juneau [Alaska], we had an Ethiopian friend that--did I tell it, Ethiopian friend?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: We had an Ethiopian friend who was coming over to have dinner with us, and I told him--he, you know, we--he's living in this all-white environment and stuff, and so he's four years old, and I said, "We're gonna have, we have this friend coming over, and she's from Ethiopia."  And so, of course, he's a four-year-old, and so he says, "Where is Ethiopia?"  And I'm saying Africa, and everybody in Africa's black.  And that got his attention, and he start that four-year-old thing, you know.  "The bus driver black?"  "Yeah."  "The teacher's black?"  "Yeah."  "The doctor's black?"  "Yeah."  You know, and on and on it went.  Finally, and I'll never forget this because it just brought home to me this--we, we send--we tend to think that if there's no overt racism going on, that children are not noticing that--what's happening to them.  He got this thing in his eye, and he looked and he said, "I wish I could live there."  And at four years old, I mean, no one had, you know, called him nigger or chased him with rocks or done anything bad to him.  And he had a good, middle-class life.  I mean, his mother was, you know.  But he knew that, that somehow being the only black person day in and day out was causing him some amount of stress that he had not been able to articulate until he found out that there was a place where that wouldn't be so.  And, and that's all he could articulate it as, so, you know, but--I got off anyway.
Story_ID: 360939
Speaker 1: When did you decide to actually leave Alaska, and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess in eighty--
Speaker 1: --and where were you going?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983] I just de- I decided that, I decided that I wasn't gonna go back to nursing school and get a Ph.D. because I'd just be a smart nurse, and I could be over nurses (laughter), and I wanted a degree--  And, and this is the, this is the unofficial--this is what the real decision-making--I have an official story that I tell when people ask me why you go to law school.  This is not the story I tell.  You know, but this is the reason that I basically went to law, is, is that a number of factors came together.  I wanted to do something where I would get recognition for my intellect.  And I--because I had kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall], I needed to do something that didn't take up a whole lot of time.  So I didn't want to go to medical school, and law seems like one of those things where people say oh, you must be smart.  You know, they think you're--if you say you're a lawyer, people say oh, you must be smart.  Fact, it's really funny.  I was recently telling someone, people now say--they always say it when I tell them.  I think that's part of the amazement, a black person who's a law professor.  And, and they'll, they invariably will comment on it in some way.  And, and lots of time it's oh, you must be smart.  But recently people have started saying bless you.  (Laughter) I don't even understand that.  I mean, lawyers are evil, and you're not.  (Laughter) So, thank you for being in this profession that--I, I, I don't understand it.  I've had it--in the last year, I've had that response when people say what do you do, and I say I'm a law professor.  They say oh, bless you.  And I get it from both black and white, so I don't really know where that's coming from.  But at--anyway, so I decided to go to law school.  And I applied, you know, did what I needed to do and decided to go to Portland [Oregon], Lewis and Clark [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College] 'cause my dad [Ernest Randall] was in Oregon.  And I knew that as a single parent, that I was gonna need a support system.  So, I packed up my two kids, who were twelve and six at the time, and we moved down to Portland.
Speaker 1: Now at this time, now--
Speaker 2: This is '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 360940
Speaker 1: And I think that your, your stepmother [sic. foster mother, Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] was gone by this--we wasn't--she, she wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My stepmother had passed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know if we talked about that.
Speaker 1: I think we did.
Speaker 2: She--
Speaker 1: I think we did.
Speaker 2: She had lived, she was living up in Alaska, not my stepmother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's living in--
Speaker 2: My foster mother.
Speaker 1: Your foster mother, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She actually hadn't passed yet; no, my foster mother hadn't passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she still--so she was still in Alaska?
Speaker 2: She was still in Alaska.  In fact, we had an incident with her where I tried to get a--my, my foster mother was a strange bird.  And she would never see the kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall].  She was always disappointed that I had children and married.  And she would never really come around them or do anything around them.  And so, I went to see her before I left Alaska, and I said you know, you have never really seen the kids.  Maybe I should bring them up here for you to see because, you know, who knows might happen.  I actually said to her you might die before we can get back, and, and in fact, she did.  And she, she wouldn't have none of it.  And so, yeah, she was still in, she was in Alaska when I left.  My sister [Brenda Randall] was in Alaska when I left.  My sister had always followed me 'cause I had been her surrogate mother.  And so my sister had always followed me.
Speaker 1: So just, did your sister move back to--
Speaker 2: No.  She said she was too old at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to Portland [Oregon]?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) She said I'm not having none of that.  I'm too old to follow you at this point, and so she stayed in Alaska, her and her daughter.  She had a child at nineteen and was single parent as well, and, but now she's married now and lives in Soldotna, Alaska, out in the boonies.
Story_ID: 360941
Speaker 1: So, we packed up my kids.  We moved to Portland [Oregon].  And it was not an easy time for my, for my oldest son [Tshaka Randall].  It was a, it was a hard adjustment for him.  He was too white for blacks, too black for whites.
Speaker 2: In Portland?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, Portland, Oregon.  People don't think of Portland like that, but Portland used to have laws that wouldn't let black people walk at outdoors at a certain amount of time (laughter), you know.  They, you know--and, and, and in fact, I put him in a private school on the idea that, that it would be good for him.  I actually got a scholarship for him.  He's very smart, and I got a scholarship for him.  He got horribly harassed.  He, he got, his lockers were booby-trapped.  And it was an experience.  He never had had the experience of being harassed because he was black, and, and in Portland he did in, in the, in this big private school that had--who prided itself on the international diversity they had.  Part of it I think was junior high.  I think junior high kids are mean, and they're doing--and, and they don't like to bring new people in, and they kind of exclude people.  And so I, when I moved to Dayton [Ohio] I didn't make that mistake, but I think it was a mistake with my son.  I finally had to go to the place and say to the headmaster that he needed to put a stop to it.  I remember the headmaster wanted--once again, it was--they tried to do to my son exactly the same thing that had been done to me all my life, which is blame me for their behavior.  And so, the headmaster was like, "Oh, well, you know, they, they shouldn't be doing this, but they have a problem with his attitude.  So maybe what we ought to do is have a meeting, and people can air both sides of the issue, and we can resolve it."  I said no way.  I said, I don't care worst--don't care if he's the worst asshole in the world.  Booby-trapping people's locker, calling them racial names, is not an ex- not an--their attitude is not an excuse for that.  I said, whether he changes his attitude or not, and I'm not saying he's perfect--the harassment will stop.  And he--I will not subject him to having people tell him that his behavior is the cause of--his attitude is the cause of their behavior, you know.  And so, he says, "Well, I'm not sure what I can do."  I said--I was (laughter) coming out of first-year law [at Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon].  And so, like every first-year law student, you think you can sue more than you can (laughter).  So I threatened to sue.  I said, "You know what, it's okay.  I'll sue the school, and I'll sue the parents of every child.  And what will they think?"  And so it stopped.  I don't know what--they, they stopped it, you know.  And my son didn't have to sit through any meeting, having people tell him them--tell him that his attitude was the reason why they was misbehaving, you know.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: So, it was, that was, that was, that was my first year of law school, and so it was a hard adjustment.  The first--my son re- read a lot, and he would go--and so that's the things that he was getting with the white kids.  But then with the black kids, what he was getting is--he was this big old giant of a, of a twelve-year-old.  He's 6'6" now and four hundred pounds and football player.  And he was, at twelve, big, you know.  And, and he would go to the park with a book to read.  And they would like, you know, "Man, what are you doing?" You know, teasing him about reading all the time.  And then he would talk, and they would say you trying to sound white, and they would tease about how he talked.  And so he was like, in this place where he was not accepted by anybody.  I--my dad [Ernest Randall] had a house that we, that, that we were renting inexpensively, but I decided I needed to move my son to an environment (laughter) that he was used to and where he might be able to make some friends and stuff like that.  So we moved out to Lake Oswego [Oregon], which is a suburb of Portland.  And I put my son in public school, where he was one of few black kids, but he did well there.  He, he got--he played football.  He got--he was on--he was in the choir.  He did dancing.  He's, he's an eclectic person in terms of, he directed plays, and he's a real eclectic kind of intellectual person.  And so, and I think he was--and he pride himself, he--on being a part of every group (laughter).  You know, so he was part of the jocks and part of the arts and part of the--and you know, taking physics and stuff like that.  My youngest son [Issa Randall] was doing fine.  I mean, people in the first grade accept--you know, they're, they're, they're not cliques or anything, and so he was able to fit in.  And so I was able to continue with law school, but law school was stressful for me.
Story_ID: 360942
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so I went off to law school, which I was a, it was a real interesting experience.  And I went to Lewis and Clark [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon] I was the on--this was 1984, yeah, 1984.  I was the only black person on campus.
Speaker 2: Now what size of--was your class (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) School? My class was about two hundred.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the school had about six hundred.  And there was a black person who was in the third year, but I never saw her because she was in the night program, and then there was me, and I was the on, on--in the day program.  And I was the only black person there.
Speaker 2: No black professors I would guess.
Speaker 1: There was no black professors.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there, there was no black staff.
Speaker 2: Now did you have any expectation of law school?  Had you discussed it with anybody that you trusted?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, I didn't any--I didn't know any lawyers.  There were no lawyers in my family.  I didn't have any lawyers as friends.  I just kind of made the decision to go to law school based on just what I saw on TV, what people talked about lawyers do, and basically because people think lawyers are smart.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a movie called 'The Paper Chase', with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 2: John--
Speaker 1: I think I might have seen--
Speaker 2: Houseman [John Houseman]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, tells--he, he opens law class having people look to the left and right and say, you know, some of you are not gonna be here--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, and that sort of thing.  Did you--did they have that kind--was that, was it that kind of atmosphere that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It wasn't exactly that way, because Lewis and Clark has a large night program, and because of that they have a lot of returning--they had a lot of older students that were going to law school.  But law school is, is not what people think it is.  And it's--you know, everybody said law school is really hard.  It's hard because of the way it's structured, not because of the content.  It's hard because they teach you one thing, which is sort of, read these cases and be able to talk about these cases, but they test you on giving you a hypothetical and having you write an answer.  They never teach you how to write an answer.  They never tell you how to write an answer.  They never even tell you that's what they're gonna do.  And they only give you one exam a semester.  And so you are go- you are in this environment where you're learning these new skills.  No one is really telling you what you need to do.  No one--a lot of what you need to learn into, 90 percent of it, you got to learn on your own.  And you have--we call 'em study groups, but you got to get in a little clique where you work together.  That's true, coming from the movie.  And so, if you're isolated in any way, you end up studying on your own, and it becomes difficult to learn the skill that you need to learn when people aren't teaching it to you and when you don't have access to information.  I mean, historically, black students haven't done well in law school, but it's more because by the time they figure out what they need to do, it's late in the semester.  Now, I think one of the reasons I did well in law school is because, first of all, I was thirty-five, thirty-six years old.  And I had performed poorly as a student before coming to law school.  So I didn't really expect to mop up the streets with--I--and so I did a lot of trying to figure out how to succeed in law school before I went to law school.  I read a lot of books, and so I had, I had a kind of a good understanding of being--what I needed to do.  And knowing that what I needed to learn and do was different from what was going on in the classroom.
Story_ID: 360943
Speaker 1: The other thing that makes law school really hard is we don't grade on, on actual performance.  I'm always amazed when people say to me, oh, he graduated in the top of his law school class.  And I say, well, that could mean he's an A student or a D student.  To graduate in the top of your class means that you were better than the other people in your class; does not mean that you have any kind of absolute skills.  So, example, what I tell--the way law school grading works, if there are ten people in the class, and zero to a hundred[percent] is an absolute scale, okay, hundred being the best, zero being the worst, and of the all ten people have ninety or above, what does the person who makes ninety get?  Maybe an F because we grade on a curve.  If there's ten people in class, and all of the grades are sixty and below, what does the person who makes sixty get?  Maybe an A because we grade on a curve.  And so someone who graduated at their top of their class, doesn't mean anything about the skill they have.  It just means they're the best of the people who were in that class.  And that makes, so that makes law school very competitive, because people then are trying to make sure that you're not gonna compete with them.  How can I be the best?  To make sure that you don't perform as well as I perform, okay.  And so you get crazy things going on; people hiding books; people tearing pages out of books; people refusing to share information.  I remember my philosophy in life has always been, give because it'll come back.  And so when I was in law school [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon], if I found a resource that was really helpful, I would tell people about it.  I would say oh, you know, I found this resource; you should look it up.  People--one friend said to me oh, you shouldn't tell people.  We should just keep this among ourself.  I said no, that's not the--you know, just, you, you can't be that way.  If people are gonna do better than you, you shouldn't work to try to make yourself better by making other people perform poorly.  And, but that, that, there is a huge incentive in law school because we--because people have, have one exam.  And so, so it's stressful, because you don't know until you take that first exam how you're gonna do, you know, and, and, and the first exam's not until the end of semester.  And then, because jobs are based on how you do, and so employers won't re- lot of the best jobs, best in term of money, won't even interview you if you don't graduate in the top twenty percent of the class, you know.  And so, you're worried if you got a scholarship.  You're worried about if am I gonna lose my scholarship if I don't perform in the top twenty.  Can I get job interviews?  And so it's, it's very, very stressful.  In fact, there's been studies that says that law students have more diagnosable mental illness than any other group of graduate students, and it's all related to law school.
Story_ID: 360944
Speaker 1: On top of that, I had the problem of being the only black in the school [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon], and, and which meant that--at least my first year. I think the second, third year there were blacks came--coming behind me, but that added stress because they looked to me to help them kind of figure out the system.  I remember being overwhelmed one time by just being so alone in the situation.  And you go to class and you read these cases where the only time they mentioned the race of the person, the only time they mentioned the race of the person, is in a criminal law case, and the black person is a black defendant.  They don't mention the race any other time, but they happen--the race is important, you know, there.  And it's almost always some big egregious thing that is going on and you know, or, or you, you, you got to contract class and the, the--you, you, you have this case where they mention the race of the woman who didn't--who bought all of this stuff she shouldn't have bought on a contract she shouldn't have signed, and she didn't read the contract.  And lo and behold, they mention the race, and the person is black.  And you're sitting there, the only black person, and you're thinking I don't think I can take another minute of this.  I remember just starting to cry one day, just, just starting to cry, 'cause I was tired of being the only black person in the environment and realizing that I didn't have any place to cry privately, no one to go to, no one to talk to, no one to say--not that people wouldn't be empathetic, but they would be empathetic in a way which they would try to tell you, oh, you shouldn't feel that way, you know, and which is, I mean, it's, it's, it's a demeaning sort of empathy.  It's sort of like, I'm black in an all-white environment, and you're telling me that I don't know how I ought to feel, that you know better.  I ended up in the bathroom crying.  I ended up in the bathroom in a stall, 'cause I knew that was the only place I knew I wouldn't have anyone ask me what's wrong.  And what was I gonna say to them?  I'm tired of looking at white faces?  (Laughter) You know, it's not something you can say.  So, that was--the first year was really stressful.
Story_ID: 360945
Speaker 1: Stressful for my kids.  I thought I was gonna be able to study at home.  I wasn't, 'cause I was tired all time.  So I had to leave my kids alone.  I keep thinking, God, if I--if my--if I was a parent now, someone would've called social welfare on me, 'cause I left my kids alone by themself every night, six nights a week.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Six, six night?
Speaker 1: Six nights a week.
Speaker 2: Now did you get a study group?
Speaker 1: I did not get in a study group.  I ended up, I ended--I, I--by the time I figured out that I really need a study group, it was kind of too late, plus in addition, I just didn't feel like negotiating that.  I just felt like I did, I had enough of being the only black person.  And I didn't want to get in a study group where I was the only black person and trying to articulate an alternative view that I was--that I didn't think anybody was gonna understand, you know.  So, I didn't get in a study group.
Speaker 2: Now did your father [Ernest Randall] help you with the, your, your sons?
Speaker 1: Yeah, to a large extent but not to babysit them or anything like that.  So, he lived--I lived outside in the suburbs [in Lake Oswego, Oregon], and he lived in town [Portland, Oregon].  And on, on occasions when I had to make a trip or something he would babysit me.  But my--basically, my older son [Tshaka Randall], who is thir-, babysitted my youngest son [Issa Randall], which is, you know, I, I, I kind of--I--one of the thing that troubles me about today is, is that we, we take--we think--you hear these things about parents losing their children because they leave their children alone.  And I'm like, excuse me, what are you supposed to do?  You know, you, you, you're trying to work, trying to get an education.  You--there's not a lot of choices for a single parent, you know and if you're trying to do something like that.  And so, your kids get to a certain age, you decide they're old enough to stay by themself.  The twelve-year-old, the thirteen-year-old can take care of the six or seven.  Call me if you need me.  Occasionally, if my oldest son had something that he wanted to do, I would take my youngest son to school with me.  And so, and then when I, I took them when they were out--by necessity, I took them every place with me.  And actually it turned out to be a good thing for them (laughter).  But if there was something I needed to go to, it was understood my kids was coming with me.  If there was something at the school [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon], if there was something--my kids were coming with me.  My kids--I taught my kids to sit quietly and wait for me, and because I didn't have a babysitter.  And so my kids, when, when I didn't--when they were sick, I took them to school with me.  When their school was out, I took them to school with me.  If there was meetings I needed to go to, if I need--the dean say if he wanted to see me for something and I would--and the schools, kids were out, I took them with me.
Story_ID: 360946
Speaker 1: I did really well [at Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon].
Speaker 2: So, so that first year, you--
Speaker 1: It was hard.  It--
Speaker 2: Were you surprised with the result of that, that first test?
Speaker 1: I was, I was amazed.  I did not expect to do--I graduated eleventh in my class.  I didn't expect to do that well.  I actually expected to be put on probation.  That was my true expectation, because previous history had said okay, you'll get put on probation; you'll learn how to do it right; and you'll get to graduate.  And I thought okay, I can do this.  I don't--I can--I don't care about being put on probation.  I'll get put on probation; it'll take me a little while to learn how to do it right; and I'll graduate.  But apparently, there, there, there's a certain way--I think my disability actually came to my benefit, the years of my, of my disability, because I learned to--because, first of all, I'm, I'm very good at analysis, and I'm very good at critiquing things.  That's, that's a high, high-level skill that I have.  Because of the problems I had with writing, I learned to write succinctly, fewer words, the better (laughter).
Speaker 2: Fewer words, fewer opportunities for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Error.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Get to the point; get it over with.  Don't be trying to put all this, you know.  So essentially, law school--that's what law school writing is about, law school exam writing, which has little relationship to writing out--so that's the other thing that, that amazes me when people say oh, they graduated in the top of the class.  I'm like, that doesn't mean they're gonna be a good lawyer.  It means that they are able to do law school exams.  And law school exams are not related to law school--to lawyering, okay.  Fact is, there's a, a saying they have in law school: A students make lawyers; they become teachers.  B students make law; they become judges.  C students make money, that they become lawyers, and they become good lawyers because the--because law school exams and doing well on law school exams is not an indication of overall good lawyering skills.  But I did well on the exams for some good reasons.  I'm, I was a good student.  I had learned how to be a good student at thirty-six--I was a dedicated.  I had uprooted my kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall], had gave up a well-paying job to go to law school, so I wasn't about--I didn't have time to play, you know.  People talk about--law school does take a lot of time, but not any more time than a fifty, sixty-hour a week job.  And so if you've ever had a job that required more than forty hours a week, you, you know, you, you have the discipline to go to law school, you know.  But a lot of the kids had been--come from undergraduate school where they barely studied ten or fifteen hours a week.  So when they get in law school, and they got a fifty or sixty hour a week job for the first time; it's, of course it seems hard to them.  Didn't seem that hard to me.
Story_ID: 360947
Speaker 1: Tell me now, were there any special teachers [at Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon] that, you know, took a special interest in your or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tried to mentor you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were, absolutely.  I benefited from a lot of people who mentored--who worked for--who mentored me and took a special in me, Susan Mandiberg, in criminal law, and the dean.  I'm not good on remembering names, but there were teachers who really did mentor me and help me out.  And there was a young black teacher who visited one year.  I can't even think of his name now.  It'll come to me.  They, they brought a visitor in either--I think it must have been my second year, yeah, African American; brought him in for one year.  I'll never forget what he did.  There was a convention that I wanted to go to that was rated--relate--nat- NBLSA, National Black Law Student Association [National Black Law Students Association].  He bought my ticket, I mean, just, just out of the blue, just said, "I know you want to go to that.  I know you have children [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall].  Here's the money for a ticket to go," you know.  The, the school, there was--I don't know that I--you know, there was--I would not have made it without people supporting me.  I mean, it--there were a number of teachers, all white, who gave me a lot of support.
Story_ID: 360948
Speaker 1: So you graduated [from Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon] in 1987, was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1987, had a difficult time finding a job, notwithstanding the fact that I had two master's degrees and graduated eleventh in the class.  And I don't want to hear nobody tell me--I get hit--whenever I hear people say, oh, you know, we would hire if--we just can't find any qualified black person.  I'm like, yeah, you be in my shoes a little bit.  I was overqualified and couldn't find a job.  I interviewed well.  I'm a great interviewer.
Speaker 1: Now you did you try to find jobs in law firms or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was that, that basically?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I was doing, because I, I mean, I was--I didn't know anything else to do because I was coming out of law school.  I interviewed, but I kept not getting jobs.  Finally, my dean--I think I--it became an embarrassment, because the common mode was we--Oregon had no black people in any law firm, okay; 1987.  And the common discussion was, well, you know, black people don't do well in law school.  The reason we haven't hired a black person is because, you know, we want someone who's in the top 20 percent of the class.  We want someone who is on law review.  We want, want someone on moot court.  We want someone who's well-qualified.  They're not well qualified 'cause they're in the bottom half of the class.  So, here I come along, in the top half of the class, top, in, in--eleventh in my--graduated eleventh in the class, yet no job, you know.  So my dean came to me one day and said, "Bullivant, Houser, Bailey, Pendergrass and Hoffman [sic. Bullivant Wright Leedy Johnson Pendergrass and Hoffman; Bullivant Houser Bailey PC]--," name of the law firm--I had interviewed with them--, "if they would offer you a job, would you take it?"  (Laughter) I'm like, "Are you crazy?  I got two kids [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall] to feed, and I'm graduating in a week, two weeks or something.  I don't care what the job is; who it's with.  Yes, of course, I'll take it."  So I was on--so they offered me a job, and I took it.  And I was the first black person in their firm and the only black person in a law firm in Portland, Oregon, in 1987.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of that firm again?
Speaker 2: Bullivant, Houser, Bailey, Pendergrass and Hoffman.  One of the first jobs you had as an associate was to learn how to say the whole name correctly (laughter).
Story_ID: 360949
Speaker 1: So I moved from one experience to another experience, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, how was the law firm [Bullivant Wright Leedy Johnson Pendergrass and Hoffman; Bullivant Houser Bailey PC]?  How did they treat you at the firm?
Speaker 1: The law firm was fine 'til I--'til I started being politically active.
Speaker 2: Now when did you get active?  Did you get act, active in someone's campaign or something?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What I got active was in organizing Oregon Women Lawyers.  I'm one of the founders.  It still goes, Oregon Women Lawyers, a major--the only women law organization in Oregon.  And it's very large now, and five of us founded it at the time.  And the woman, Katherine O'Neill, had been the first woman at Bullivant and had left there.  I don't think she left in good terms, but she never talked to me about it.  And so, so I got in--she asked me--I'd, I'd been involved in--I was (unclear) in the black lawyers association.  I was (unclear) in the Portland, Oregon, community.  I did a lot of lecturing around the community on race-based issues, stuff like that.  And so I was, I was--and also everybody knew who I was.  I mean, if you're the only black person in a law firm in Portland, everybody knows who you are, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, now, were you a member of the National Bar Association?
Speaker 1: I was a new member of the National Bar Association.
Speaker 2: The National Council of Black Lawyer [sic. National Conference of Black Lawyers]?
Speaker 1: I was a member of the National Council of Black Lawyers, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was--I've always been very pro- no matter what job I have, when I, when even when I was the organizer back in Juneau [Alaska] of the black community association.  So I've always been a kind of a community organizer and involved in black organizing thing.

Speaker 1: So my law firm calls me in.  I think this was--and says that they think I'm overextended and that, that they want me to not be involved in this partic- starting this particular organization [Oregon Women Lawyers].  And I thought at first they were joking, I actually did.  And I said, I said I, I said--I, I laughed.  It was a partner and associate meeting with me, both white.  And I said well, I didn't think I was overextended, if they had problems.  And they--I said you know, my time is my time.  If you don't want me--'cause we, we supposed to do pro bono work and volunteer.  They, you know, usually they want you to belong to different organizations, how they get and make money and stuff.  So I said, "If you are saying that you don't want me to use Bullivant [Bullivant Wright Leedy Johnson Pendergrass and Hoffman; Bullivant Houser Bailey PC] resources, copy machines, stuff like that, secretarial help, stuff like that, I understand that.  And I'll be happy to tell you things that I'm working on, and you can tell me what you don't want me to use your resources on.  Okay, I'll be happy to do that.  But as far as my personal time, my time was my time."  And they said, "All of your time is Bullivant time."  That's large firm mentality, still is for that matter.  People make these high wages; they get high wages, but the expectation is, is that you are owned by them.  (Laughter) I laughed.  I said, "You have to be joking."  I said--and I think this was the kiss of death--, "My folks stopped being slaves (laughter) in 1867.  You don't own me."  I said, "I--if, if, if I'm not working up to your expectations, you tell me.  I'll try and fix it.  If I can't fix it, then you do what you have to do; you fire me."  I said, "But there's no way I'm getting permission from you about what to do on my off time."  So that was the kiss of death.  They didn't fire me.  They started--they could--and, and I think they felt like they couldn't fire me because of my position of being the only black person, okay, and my--so what they did is the process that is common in a law firm.  They started not giving me work.  So that--'cause you're supposed to bill two thousand hours a month, which is about forty hours a week or something like maybe a little over forty hours a week.  And it's very difficult to get because you can't bill--that's billable hours.  And in order to get forty billable hours you gotta work fifty, sixty hours to be able to get forty billable hours.  And so if people are not giving you work, you're not gonna get--you're not gonna meet that goal.  So I could see the handwriting on the wall, so I thought oh, I gotta get out of here before I--before they fire me.
Story_ID: 360951
Speaker 1: One thing that did happen is they [Bullivant Wright Leedy Johnson Pendergrass and Hoffman; Bullivant Houser Bailey PC] helped me to discover that I was--that I had a learning disability because I--they would--and this was, this was when we were--before we got into bad times.  They would say, "You have this wonderful work.  You have really creative ideas, and your analysis of case and everything is great.  But whenever you turn in a work product, there's mistakes made in it.  And you're too smart to do this, and we want you to figure out why."  And so they paid for me to figure out why I, I was having these problems.  I first went to a, a, a English teacher who tested me and said, "Oh, you know all the rules; you know them perfectly.  And when you critique someone else's work, you can pick up errors, so I don't--there's nothing for me to teach, so."  What happened then, I was frustrated because I was like, I don't know what to do, if it's not a lack of knowledge or lack of ability.  My son though, my youngest son [Issa Randall], is, has a serious disability, a learning disability.  He--I had to keep him behind a year or two, and then I, and I was getting him help for his learning disability.  And one day when I was taking him into this reading specialist and sitting in the waiting room reading something, I read this article about how children with learning disability, that there was a genetic component, and that parents often had learning disabilities.  And my light bulb went on, and I went and got tested.  And (laughter) it's really crazy because my overall intellect and my analytical bur- ability is on the superior level.  My ability to decode, both orally and in writing, is on the third grade level.  And, and so that's what the problem is.  And, and, and so now, I mean, it's still a major frustration still in my life.
Story_ID: 361131
Speaker 1: So you're leaving the law firm [Bullivant Wright Leedy Johnson Pendergrass and Hoffman; Bullivant Houser Bailey PC], or--
Speaker 2: Right, the law (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, how did you decide--I mean--
Speaker 2: What did I do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: I decided that--I had been teaching as an adjunct at Lewis and Clark [Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon], and I really loved teaching.  And I decided to see if I could get a teaching job.  And I actually--they have a meat market kind teaching thing, a central jobs market for law teaching.  And I actually had a lot of--I went to it.  I had about twenty interviews, which is, is a lot, and I started getting callbacks.  And I realized that if I took time off to go on job interviews, that I wouldn't be working and that I could end up without a job.  (Laughter) And so I went to them and made them a deal that they could confu- couldn't refuse.  I basically said--gave them a way out.  I said I don't--I'm not happy here, and I'm not happy doing this, and I want to leave.  I, I'm looking at teaching positions.  And if you pay me my salary from now--this was like, November--through May and keep me on health insurance, keep me on the books as employed, and allow me access to use of materials, and give me a good reference, but not require me to do any work on over the next six months so I can do job hunting. I'm gonna do a serious job hunting, and at the end of this time, either I have another job or not, but I'll resign, you know, from it.  And I, I, I'm, I said to that to them like, Friday at one o'clock, figuring that they would have to talk about it, and they'd let me know on Monday.  By four o'clock, when I was on my way out, 4:30, they met me at the elevator and said we accept (laughter).  I thought, damn, I didn't ask for enough (laughter), if they that eager.  Of course, they made me sign a, a, a, an agreement not to sue them as, as sort of a settlement.  We all was kind of playing this game.  The game was I--there--I'm not saying that you're leaving--that you're pushing me out, but you're gonna give me all of these benefits, and I will sign an agreement that I won't at any other date sue you, that this--for any kind of discrimination or anything.
Speaker 1: So they must have assessed that you had a pretty good case.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  They wouldn't have given me anything if they didn't think that I had some case, and I did, because I feel that the fact of the matter is, is they tried to control my behavior in an impermissible way.  And then they tried to push me out by not giving me work.  So, yes, they assessed that.
Story_ID: 361132
Speaker 1: So I got, I, I got the job at--I did--I interviewed here in Dayton [Ohio]; I interviewed in Toledo [Ohio]; I interviewed in Cleveland [Ohio].  What's interesting, I really wanted to stay on the Pacific Northwest.  I had no interviews on the Pacific Northwest.  They were all out here in the South.  And I got a job offer from Dayton [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio] and from Mercer [Walter F. George School of Law, Mercer University, Macon, Georgia] in Georgia, and I chose not to go. Actually, I, I asked on every--I had about seven callbacks to different schools and where they call you back, fly you in, look around.  And every school I said, which was unusual, that I'm a single parent, that I, I need to bring my son, and I need you to pay me for bringing my son, and they all did.  And one of the things that impressed me with Dayton, is Dayton was the first school--and when I said it the guy didn't even miss a beat.  He didn't even, like, oh, what, what, we've never done anything like that.  He said but of course.  So Issa [Issa Randall], who was a teenager, who was sixth grade, my--by this time my young--my older son [Tshaka Randall] had graduated from high school and was in college at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And so I was really only concerned with Issa, whether--I, I wasn't going to move any place that he was gonna be unhappy, 'cause I'm a single parent, and I was gonna have to leave him by himself as--you know, and, and lot of times, so.  He went on my callbacks with me, and the schools arranged for him to go to different schools and to meet people and stuff like that.  And we got--on the callbacks, I got a job offer from Mercer and a job offer from Dayton.  And I chose Dayton primarily because I was unsure about--after my experience with Tshaka--that's my oldest son--I was unsure whether Issa might not end up--I just wasn't sure about the South, whether Issa would end up being too white for the black kids down there and too black for the white kids down there.  And so I just decided to go with Dayton.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you find out it's just like the South once you get here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 361133
Speaker 1: So what year is, did, did you--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990], okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, we moved here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: I moved--Issa [Issa Randall]; I gave Issa--the other thing I did, which is, it was a lesson I learned, is I gave him the choice of where we lived.  I--he--we looked at a lot of schools.  I let him look--I chose schools inside of Dayton [Ohio] and outside of Dayton for him to visit, and I told him he could pick the school he wanted to go to and that we would live in that community.  So I didn't say we were gonna live here.  I said here's five schools; visit them.  Tell me which one you want to go to, and we will find out; we will live there, and he chose Oakwood [Oakwood High School, Oakwood, Ohio], so we lived in Oakwood [Ohio] 'til he graduated from high school.  I rented because I didn't--knew I didn't want to live permanently in Oakwood.
Speaker 1: Now, Oakwood has a reputation for being a preeminent white community in this area.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is the old, old money, white community.
Speaker 2: And a lot--Oakwood has, Oakwood has kept blacks, Catholics, Jews, and poor people out.  I don't even know if people even realize the history of how come all those housing--that, that Oakwood is so small because they refused to allow the people who built the Hubert--
Speaker 1: Huber Heights?
Speaker 2: Yeah, housings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Huber Heights, yeah.
Speaker 2: Those housing that's in Centerville [Ohio], on the edge of Oakwood, they first approached Oakwood about building those housing there.  And Oakwood didn't want whites coming back from the war, middle--low middle-class whites to come into that, and they refused.  And so he went over into Centerville and took that--put the land next to the land to Centerville, and so then Oakwood got boxed in.  And it was all because they, they were so elitist in, in who they thought could live there that, that happened.
Story_ID: 361134
Speaker 1: My son [Issa Randall] had a, had a fairly good experience at Oakwood [Oakwood High School, Oakwood, Ohio].  He enjoyed it.  He--I, I asked him--he's, my youngest son is 6'11'', and he played basketball only because people insisted.  He was never a good basketball player.  He was much too artistic, and his mind would never stay on basketball long enough when, you know.  But I asked him if he ever--he never really had any significant trouble there.  I asked him.  We've talked about race issues, and he said eh, there were some.  But he was always so much bigger than everybody that they pretty much steered clear of him (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now Oakwood, now, was he--and, and I'm asking this question, I, I haven't lived in Dayton [Ohio] in thirty years--was he the first black student at Oakwood High School?
Speaker 1: I don't know if he was the first.  He was the only, at the time he went there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a possibility he might have been the first.  I, I don't know.  I mean, it, it's--
Speaker 1: I, I don't know.  He--
Speaker 2: I never knew of another.  And it was even--you know, I mean, when I grew up you could be arrested for walking through Oakwood [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh, you still--my, my sons, we lived in Oakwood, and they got arrested for walking in Oakwood (laughter).  In fact, I (laughter)--you know, it's kind of like, you know, there's this whole life that's different, you know.  So, here I am, I'm a law professor at the University of Dayton [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], right?  I have a son.  My oldest son [Tshaka Randall] decides to go to--to transfer from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] to University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio], and he's living at home.  He's nineteen, and I wouldn't let him drive my car because I'm like, I'm, I know--you know what, I know what people do when they party, they drink, you know.  So I'm not letting--you going out to party, you walk.  He got, he got stopped three times walking while black in Oakwood, in the '90s [1990s].  So then I started--so I said okay, okay, you're 6'6"; you're four hundred pounds.  One of these times some--a policeman's gonna stop you for walking in a Oakwood home, and you're gonna be just high enough to start arguing.  And he's gonna get scared, 'cause you're gonna be bigger than him, and I'm gonna end up with a dead child.  So I start letting driving his car--I let him drive my car.  One night, he, he comes in.  He says, "Mom, this policeman pulled in behind me, cut off his lights, and followed me all the way to the house, and he's parked across the street right now watching the house."  So I looked, and sure enough, there was a cop outside.  So I thought, this has gotta stop.  So I pulled out my lawyer suit, the one that I used to get, get the teaching job.  And I made him dress up, and we went and talked to the chief of police.  And I said, "Your police are racially profiling my son."  I said, "He can't walk; he can't drive without being followed."  I said, "Sooner or later something's gonna happen, and I'm putting you on notice that this is all inappropriate."  And of course he denied it.  He said, "Oh, no, no, no, that's not going on."  But they did stop (laughter).
Speaker 2: Funny how these things don't exist, but they can actually stop.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That, that was like, I know it would stop, and, and it did.  I mean, it stopped in that overt sort of way.  A few years later, when my youngest son was in college, him and his brother and friends all got stopped.
Story_ID: 361135
Speaker 1: So the problems in Oakwood [Ohio] and on UD [University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio] campus, on UD campus--and UD still has problems.  UD has--UD police officers stop black guys who are on campus, period.  I mean, we had--we hired, maybe four or five years ago, the UD hired twin, identical twin black brothers to teach at UD.  They tet- taught in the art department, and they were identical, identical.  And they went to--one of them went to go into the lounge for teachers at, at the--and a police officer stops him and would not accept the explanation that they were teaching there.  My sons [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall] have been stopped by police officers at UD.  The, the fact of the matter is, if you're a black male in ni- in 2008, your chances of being stopped on UD's campus by UD police is greater than if you're anything else.  And I have proof of this because I'm notorious for driving my car without the license plates being up to date, 'cause you're supposed to do it March, and I never do.  And so it's usually about August before I get around doing it (laughter), I mean, every year.  It's almost this passive aggressive thing I do, okay.  So the last time my son came home I'd been driving around since August on UD campus with my license plates expired.  Police pull in behind me, they ignore it.  They don't stop me.  They don't pull me over.  They don't tell me your license plates expired.  They just ignore me.  I ignore them.  My son is not home one day.  He drives over to UD to pick me up.  Guess what, he gets stopped.  Now my car has been expired for four months, and I'd been driving daily.  And I even seen the police behind me.  But you know, I'm a--stopping me, what do they get out of it?  Nothing.  They don't even get a ticket out of it.  They give me a warning and tell me to get my license plates up.  Stopping a black male, hm, maybe they get somebody doing drugs; maybe they get someone and they can search the car; maybe they'll have an attitude, make him, make him get out the car, and they can search it, and then maybe they can find drugs.  And so this whole driving, the, the, the profiling, more blacks are in the system because people profile them.
Story_ID: 361136
Speaker 1: Starting at UD [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: So, I was starting at UD--
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990]
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990].  We moved here.  We lived in Oakwood [Ohio].  My son [Issa Randall] was doing well.  I--
Speaker 1: And so you didn't know anybody in Dayton [Ohio], and you didn't get any advice apparently, if you ended up in Oakwood.
Speaker 2: I knew that Oakwood was not--I knew, yeah, yeah, I did, but my son wanted to live there.  And I knew this, that as a single parent who was gonna have my son left alone by himself a lot, if he was not someplace he was happy--
Speaker 1: Did he have any reasons for wanting to live in Oakwood?  I'm just curious as to what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was--
Speaker 1: Of all the places--
Speaker 2: --because it reminded him of the school in--the schools he came from in Alaska, small--
Speaker 1: So did he get a tour of the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) by the university?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, when I came here--
Speaker 1: University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio] people took--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to interview--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he came with me.  And he, he went to a school here in Dayton.  He went to a school out in Kettering [Ohio].  He went to a school in Centerville [Ohio].  He went to a school out in Trotwood [Ohio], and he went to Oakwood.  And so while I was interviewing, he was visiting these schools.  And I basically said you pick the school you want to go to.
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting that he picked a school where he'd be the only black student.
Speaker 2: I don't think he--for him, I don't know that he looked at that as much as he looked at size of school.  I think the sizes of the other schools scared him, and Oakwood had--the Oakwood Elementary School [Oakwood, Ohio] and high school [Oakwood High School, Oakwood, Ohio] were small; I really do.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I wondered, because he had been in situations before where he was the only one and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he--
Speaker 2: And it--
Speaker 1: --at one time had a desire not to be, but this time he had a chance to choose and chose to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. So, anyway, that's what he chose.  And he graduated, and--
Story_ID: 361137
Speaker 1: I started at UD [University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio], and it--I--teaching there.  I was the on--at the time, UD had had no black faculty, law school [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], and they hired me.  And I had had enough of being the only person, only black person.  So when they hired me first, and I told them that I wouldn't come if I was gonna be the only black faculty, because I know what that meant when you're the only, the stress of being the first, and, and if you're the only.  Because whenever you're the first, and, and I've been the first so often in my life, there's an adjustment that everybody has to make, you know.  And the adjustment is there is a difference between black people and white people, and there's a difference, you know, not in major--we all speak English, and we all work fine, but there are cultural differences and, and, and cultural references even that I bring into the workplace that, that whites don't bring into the workplace or even my hair.  The hair thing throws people off, you know, 'cause, you know, what black women do with their hair.  And so, that if you're the first, people have to deal with their cognitive dissonance, their, this is uncomfortable, and I don't know why.  Am I a racist?  And they don't want to be a racist.  Why am I feeling uncomfortable around her, you know?  And, and they have to address that.  And they--and, and in the process of addressing it, there's always going to be some kind of lashing out at the first black person, you know.  You're making me feel uncomfortable, you know, whatever.  It's almost--it's always easier to follow somebody than it is to be the first.  And, and so, I knew I would be the first at UD.  And I didn't want to be by myself, and I told the dean that I wouldn't come if I was gonna be by themsel- my--by myself.  And he said that they were hiring; they were gonna hire another--they were gonna hire a black male, Will Stallworth [William L. Stallworth], and they did.  So the two of us integrated UD law school in 1990.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So how--so you've, you've been there since--
Speaker 1: Nineteen--I've been there since (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so that's like eight--eighteen years--
Speaker 1: Eighteen years, yeah.
Speaker 2: Eighteen years.  It's a long time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 361138
Speaker 1: How has it been [at the University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Not easy (laughter).  It's been a rough road.  I love the job.  I love teaching, but it's been a really rough road.  I think that my faculty--Will [William L. Stallworth] left.  Will said that it, that it was too racist for him and that he--and he left two years after being there and moved to California.
Speaker 1: Now what, what's his last name again?
Speaker 2: Will Stallworth.
Speaker 1: Stallworth, okay, Stallworth, okay.
Speaker 2: And he actually moved--it was three years after--the fourth--let me get this right.  'Cause we had a--we fought a major battle in our third year.  They--this is a--they thought Will and I didn't talk to each other.  I'm Afrocentric.  I talk Afrocentric.  I look Afrocentric.  And I approach everything in a very Afrocentric way.  Will is Eurocentric.  Will is--came from corporate law, tailored suits, you know, four degrees from four different high-level schools, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], et cetera, et cetera, you know.  I think they thought that--and I think this would be true maybe in the white culture.  I'm not sure.  But you know, people who are so different wouldn't have much in common.  But they don't understand that the black cultural experience gives you something in common, so that I think they didn't think Will and I talked to each other.  So when we went up for our third year promotion, they denied both of us promotion, okay, for a different reason.  Will had been voted best teacher of the year every year since he'd been there.  Will is very Eurocentric in his teaching, pedagogy.  He's very much like them in how he teach and, and exceptional person.  He'd written one article, and the--so, that's where he was.  And they said his article was unacceptable, okay.  I had not been voted best teacher.  Fact, I had, I had students who were angry at me all the time.  But I had written five articles, okay.  So they couldn't say my articles were bad.  In fact, I had a national--even though I, I had a national reputation on the work that I was doing.  So they said my teaching was bad, and the denied both of us.  So Will and I decided to appeal the decision and put our package together as one package, to not explicitly say that we think it was race.  But putting our package together, and we put the--I got--I went--I got--we both put--did a complete outside review of our materials, him and his teach--and his scholarship, me on my teaching.  And we put our package together and sent it up to the provost.  And the provost overturned the law school's decision and promoted both of us, okay.  Will thought that they were going to only tenure one of us, and he thought it wasn't gonna be him.  I think it was--wasn't gonna be me, but he decided to leave.  So I was left alone and was there by myself until about four years ago, when they got--hired another black male.  I mean, it--noth- it was if nothing I did that was exceptional could be acknowledged.
Story_ID: 361139
Speaker 1: I remember going to the associate provost one time and--not provost, associate dean, when I wrote my arti- when Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] did her healthcare plan [Health Security Act of 1993].  My, my research area is in race and healthcare and in structures.  I, I look at institutional and systemic racism.  I used the healthcare system, and I look at how institutions and systems can change, okay.  When Clinton did her healthcare plan, they invited--when if--before it was released to the public, they invited number of people to in-review it and give feedback, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is, this is 1992, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was one of those people who was invited, okay.  So I asked the dean for money to go to the White House [Washington, D.C.] to review Clinton's healthcare plan.  I was told no.  I said this is important.  This is important for me, but it's also important for the school.  The dean said, looked me straight in the eye and said they didn't see any value to the school for me.  And I think that's what it means to be black and is, is that, here I am, one of very few people invited to see the Clinton healthcare plan, but because whatever going on in the dean, associate dean's mind, he couldn't acknowledge how important this was for the school, never would, and they, they still don't.  I have an international reputation, and the--it's this, the mode of operation, we, we change deans, but no matter what happens with the changed deans, the mode is cannot acknowledge what you're doing becau- with--unless we do it in the context of what everybody else is doing.  I think there's a fair amount of jealousy, a fair amount--because I do have--I, I, I, I've done a lot of things over the last eighteen years on an international basis.  I, I just came back from speaking in England at the London, I was at London Metropolitan University [London, England].  And I was co-chair at the World Conference Against Racism.  I was invited by the United Nations [UN] to come and speak about the healthcare for African Americans.  And I, and I do a lot of stuff nationally.  And so I have on this--I live this existence where the, the place that I work treats me as if I am no different than any of the rest of them, which would be fine except that I am, am different.  I have a reputation they don't have.  I have expertise they don't have.  I--if I was white with this reputation and stuff, I would be being--I would be--I'd have a chair, you know.  I'm--in fact, there's only two of us that have an international reputation at the UD law school [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], and she's a white woman, and she has a chair.  And so it, it, it's, that it's been--
Story_ID: 361140
Speaker 1: I've had the dean, the associate dean [of the University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], step in my face and shake his finger in my face, say I'm, I'm tired of dealing with you, wagging his finger like that, right at the point of his nose, in his nose.  It was over my race and racism course.  I was teaching, Race and Racism in American Law, and it's limited to twenty students.  And this particular year it, it, it, it was full, and there was a waiting list.  And none of the minority students have gotten--was in the course.  And I've always taught the course in a way that relies on the people in the course talking about what it means to be white, what it means to be black, what it means to be Hispanic, Asian, whatever, on the idea that I can't really talk about it from every point of view, okay.  So I was trying to explain to the dean I needed the diversity in the class to really teach the class, and I wanted to get more people in.  And I was trying, find a way to get more people in.  And every alternative that I would give him he would shoot down, you know, every single alternative.  And so I was approaching him yet again with another way to try to get people into the class.  And it's a private school [University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio].  There's nothing, no reason why he couldn't have put them in the class.  And I--he was--he stepped up--we were in the lobby in front of the secretary's desk.  He literally stepped right into my physical space, sort of trying to overpower me, and began to wag his finger in my face and saying he was sick of dealing with me.  You know, and people say life flashed before your eyes.  All I could--I kept thinking don't hit him (laughter).  I kept thinking don't hit him.  You'll lose your job.  Don't hit him.  I wasn't fearful; I was mad.  And what I wanted to do was knock his finger out of my face and, and hit him.  And I would have, except I didn't want to lose my job (laughter) and because they would have, they would have said no, nothing he'd done would justify physical contact.  And that's my brain.  That's all--I, I couldn't think of anything else.  And finally, I kept saying, out loud I kept saying get out of my face; get out of my face; get out of my face.  Finally, he dropped his finger.  And when he did, I turned and spun and walked out, and I went down to one of my colleagues.  Will [William L. Stallworth] had left by this point.  Will wasn't there, and I went down to another colleague, a, a young white woman.  And I went into her office, cried until I got all the stress out.  And then I went up and wrote an email and made a complaint.  In my email I said, I don't know what your cultural reference is. I said, but in my culture that's a physical threat.  You made a physical threat to me when you stepped into space like that.  And I want you and everyone else to know that in the future I will take it as that.  And if you do it again, I will hit you, you know.  Nothing ever came of it, nothing.  They didn't investigate.  They didn't, they didn't, they didn't discipline.  They didn't say nothing to him, and they put my letter of complaint about him in my file.  So he's got a clean slate.
Speaker 2: So is that dean still--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He's a dean now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He just--not the dean, dean; he's associate dean.  They just rehired him as associate dean.
Story_ID: 352056
Speaker 1: Now you have been actively writing a website that is very popular.  But you've been--you've got a book out.  I know at least one--
Speaker 2: I have a book, 'Dying While Black' [Vernellia Randall].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I have--I manage three or four websites.  I've got one, Race and Racism in American Law, that I've had almost fifteen years, have had over a million hits.  I have one on gender and the law.  And then I just started one a month ago that's on the election, the 2008 presidential election, Race and Racism, is a website that I collect articles related to the current election and race and racism, particular racial inequality issues.  And then I've written, I've written maybe fifteen law review articles, all some way connected to race and racism, either healthcare or educate--legal education.  I think one of the big issues facing the black community is the lack of black lawyers, and we don't have enough black lawyers.  And, and, and schools are admitting few black students than they were ten years ago, in actual numbers and in percentage.
Story_ID: 352057
Speaker 1: What about your students [at the University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio]?  Have you had--well, okay, let me go back over that too, just the course you teach, Race and Racism in American Law.
Speaker 2: I used to teach that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So you don't teach it anymore?
Speaker 2: They redesigned the curriculum about three years ago, and they took out all of the perspective courses, which meant they took out, Race and Racism in American Law, which was my course, and Gender and Law, which was my course.  I really loved both of those courses.  I taught Race and Racism in the Law from 1992 through 2002, so almost ten years, twenty students every year.  It was a wonderful--I taught it around--what I would do is I took each major ethnic group and took an issue that was specific to their group and studied history more than current law, because what I wanted people to see is how laws affect different groups differently and how throughout our history the laws have been used to do things with different people.  So obviously, I look at slavery and Jim Crow for African Americans.  I looked at the Latinos.  I looked at the Treaty of Guadalupe [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo], and I look at English-only laws that our people are trying to get.  For Native Hawaiians, I looked at how, how we participated in illegal seizing of Hawaii from a constitutional monarch.  For Asian Americans, I look at the immigration laws that wouldn't allow--and most people don't even realize this--wouldn't allow im- Asians immigrants to be citizens.  They could come here.  They could work here.  They could do--but they couldn't be citizens up until--and then, of course, looked at the ter- internment of Japanese Americans.  For whites, I looked at--I--this whole issue.  I looked at how Irish became white.  I look at how when they were here they were a marginalized ethnic group who was put just one step above blacks only because of the color of their skin, not because of any feeling of, of, of privilege that they were--had, but saying that there's tapes, you know, that whites were considered, in some ways, expendable--I mean not whites--Irish were considered expendable to slaves, because--
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so, and--
Speaker 1: And cannon fodder during the war.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And, and so the question that people have to ask is how did Irish become white.  And this, it's, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's a book by that--yeah.
Speaker 2: That's by that name, and you, and you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Noel Ignatiev.
Speaker 2: Look at what--the issue of assimilation, you know, that, that to be accepted in American society you have to be assimilated.  And though as a group, if you cannot be assimilated or won't be assimilated, then you're always marginalized.  That Irish, Italian, Germans, all of these ethnic minority whites were not accepted until they gave up what made them distinctive, so their language, their religion, the outward dress, anything that exposed to them.  I loved the course.  Students liked it.  Students are always amazed by what they didn't know about the history of America and the law and how the law was used to do all this.  So we're not just talking about here's a history; we're talking about here's the law.  People pass laws.  And then I have them look at how we're using the law today to do similar sort of things.
Story_ID: 352058
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, Gender and Law is the second course.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Since you took--you, you, you only taught the two courses [at the University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I taught, I also taught torts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until I had such complaints from students about my, my teaching of torts.  I always integrate into all my courses the issues of how law affects groups differently, and particularly I look at race and gender but not exclusively, sexual orientation, et cetera.  Well, tort is a basic course.  And people in the first year who took--are required to take me, okay.  And half the students hated being taught that.  Any time I teach a required course, I get a lot of complaints.  My healthcare law course--I also teach healthcare law.  So my elective courses, there's this, there's this division.  Courses that I teach that are elective, my evaluations are good; the students are good.  Courses that I teach where students are required to take me, there's a group that don't like my teaching pedagogy and don't like the integration of race and gender.  But I taught torts.  Over the eighteen years, I've taught a lot of torts, five years.  I taught remedies two years.  I taught Race and Racism in American Law and Gender and the Law for about ten years.  I've been teaching criminal law two years.  I've been kicked out of criminal law just this month, but that's another story I'll tell in a minute.
Story_ID: 352059
Speaker 1: I started and directed the academic support program for first year law students [at the University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], and I did that up until two years ago.  I did it--law schools are always complaining about how black students are performing in law school.  And it is true that black students perform disproportionately poorer than white students, even with the same statistics.  I started an academic support program because I believe that that was because that performance wasn't because of the intellect; it was because of isolation, and lack of access to information that they needed to know, and teaching.  So, I did the program, and it did, it--I mean, in fact, the program was so good, year after year students would be on law review; students would be moot court; students would win these prizes.  It wasn't just black students, but black students would be among them, and they would be all from my program.  And black students didn't flunk out, and black students weren't disproportionately in the bottom of the class.  So I, I mean, I did, I, I, I demonstrated that with an, with--if, if you--with an appropriately structured educational experience, that, that minority students, black students in particular, won't perform poorly, disproportionately poorly.
Story_ID: 352060
Speaker 1: I'm no longer doing that [directing a first year law student academic support program].  Right now, I'm no longer teaching criminal law.  I'm in a grievance over that because I got called in three weeks ago or middle of January and was told that because of student evaluations and concerned about whether students were learning from me, that I was gonna no longer be allowed to teach first-year courses.  They're not even--they don't even know what I'm gonna be teaching.  So, I, I'm on a summer-fall contract, which mean I teach during the summer and the fall, and I'm off in the spring.  So right now this is an off period.  But I--it's--I, I, I think teaching--I do my teaching pedagogy as a real robus- robu- (laughter), robust teaching pedagogy.  I teach it; they have to write; and I have--we're a problem-based course instead of a case-based course.  They have to--sure, they have to read cases but not just to tell me what the cases said, which is what most teachers do.  They have to take the cases and solve a problem.  I give them a problem, and then they have to solve the problem.  They have to write an answer and bring a written answer to, to class.  Well, part of the theme of law school is, is that they're in these huge classes, class of ninety.  You can get along without actually preparing for class very hard, because you're not gonna get called on but maybe three or four, five times out of a semester, okay.  And most professors, once they call on you, is gonna try to go through the rest of the students before they gonna get back to you.  So, my class though, there's--I set my class up where they have to do the work before they come to class because they have a problem, and they have to write an answer to the problem, and they have to bring that answer the class.  And so there's a lot of anger over that.  I make them look at race.  I make them look at the death penalty.  I make them look at gender.  I ask them questions why, 'cause there's a concept in criminal law, for instance, where a reas- where if you kill someone and you committed murder, and you were reasonably provoked, it can be reduced to manslaughter, okay.  So I asked a question: why is it reasonable for a person to kill someone who is sleeping with their wife or their husband, but it's not reasonable to kill someone who's been beating you for seven years?  That's a gender issue, okay.  And I, so I ask those questions.  I don't answer it because I don't have an answer.  But I, I try to force them to think about race issues, you know, and think about sexual orientation issues in, in the context of how the law and the criminal law--some students react to it by thinking, oh, great, I am understanding this better, and this, I didn't understand this, and I'm glad to learn this, and this is gonna help me in my thinking.  But more students react to it like: no one else is doing this.  If this was a relevant thing to do, wouldn't my other white male teachers be doing this?  And since they're not doing it, this must be her political agenda and not relevant.
Speaker 2: Question, is there any other professor in the law school [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio] that teaches about race or gender?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, wait a minute; wait a minute.  That's not right. No.
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: No, in the context of their regular course.  We just--we have a black professor, Dennis Greene, who teaches about race and gender but not in the context of his tort class, okay.  We have--there's a white woman teacher who does a little bit in her course.  But in the first year, I'm the only who's, who has integrated it as a regular part of the course as at throughout the whole course and not just one case or one something like that, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so that's--and they, so, so they, you know, that, that kind of sets them off a little bit, you know, and saying this must not be legitimate, because if it was legitimate, other people would be doing it.
Speaker 2: Seems to say something about the world they think they're living in too.  I mean this, it's different from the world that, that you know we're living in.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 352061
Speaker 1: You know, we're--one other thing that disturbs me is this era of time, the disconnect between what we say we want to do for our students and what we're actually doing for our students.  And it's not just law school.  We say we want to get--that we're living in a diverse, multicultural, global world.  But we're not actually restructuring our courses, our curriculum, or how we teach to reflect that.  And so we have all these students who are actually of the 1960s mindset I'd say, in terms of how they see culture and race and gender.  They, they, they, they're not being taught to--in a--to reflect the what's really going on in the world.  And, and so, and that's gonna put us behind as Americans I think.  My youngest son [Issa Randall] travels a lot.  And one of the problems we have that we talk about a lot is, in many other cultures, especially England, there--and because they live in this--in Europe they have this so close proximity.  There's this experience of traveling and experiencing other cultures that we don't get.  And so they get a--they have a whole different kind of mindset than we have.  And, but no, that's, that's kind of where I--so, you know, being at UD law school [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio]--it's where I am now--it's, it's been an experience.  It's been an experience of the law--the both--we work on diversity.  We're embracing--right now we're in the campaign of embracing diversity, the university and the law school.  Everybody embraces diversity.  And I have come to hate the diversity.  And in fact, I think diversity comes--has--it's articulated as everybody's got diversity. We can celebrate diversity.  And it's a easy way of, of saying we will deal with difference but not so much.  We don't actually--we're, we're not increasing the number of blacks.  We're not increasing the number of Hispanics and Asians and Native Americans on campus.  We're not changing how we teach.  We're not doing any of the hard work.  We're just having a diversity festival or you know, bringing in speakers.  That, to, to me--when they are recruiting at HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], you know, we go, we will recruit at HBCUs even though we know we're not going to admit those students.  I mean, it's, it's infuriating to me.  I refused three years ago to speak to a group of students from Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  I refused to speak because the school had put up all these banners, "Celebrate Diversity," and they're bringing in these students for Central State, which is an HBCU.  All of them were black.  And they're talking about how the law school embraces diversities and you know, we're happy to have you on campus, when they know when they get into the admissions committee--and I sat on the admissions committee--and they have a student from Central State who has a 4.0 [grade point average], the very first thing that comes out their mouth is oh, but it's Central State.  It's an easy school.  We can't give it the same credit as we give Wright State [Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] or Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  And so then they say, And look at their LSAT.  Their LSAT is only a 145.  So she's got a 4.0 and a 145.  We can't admit her because we don't--the school, HBCU, is not a school we respect, and she doesn't have an high LSAT.  On the other hand, we, we may--we, we love to bring them on campus.
Speaker 2: Celebrate them.
Speaker 1: Celebrate them, that's right.  That's the word.  We love to celebrate diversity.  And I'm like, I'm not into celebrating diversity anymore.  I want diversity, you know (laughter).  I want us to have more than 5 percent black students at our law school.  And we're, we're sitting here in Dayton [Ohio] that's almost half black.  We've got two HBCUs.  We got Wright State.  We got Ohio State.  There's no reason that the University of Dod- Dayton law school shouldn't be 10 percent, 12 percent black, no reason.
Story_ID: 352062
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what do you see as, as your future now.  I mean, you know.  And I wanna talk about your book ['Dying While Black,' Vernellia Randall] and stuff too at some point, but, but, but what do you--what would you like to do now?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm in the midst--I'm turning sixty in a week, and I'm actually going to Honduras with my sister [Brenda Randall].  I see myself, I mean, you know, I'm going to continue to work on the issues of race and getting--I, I think that a critical issue in, in my professional life is getting more blacks into law.  The system of our soci- to our society is controlled by money and law.  And if you don't have lawyers--not, it's not just people going to lawyers.  I'm talking about people--lawyers in the community that can help, who can be on boards, who can go to--be on church, your church boards, who can be on your organizational boards, who can go to your meetings and educate you about--if you don't--educate you about what's going on.  You have to have lawyers in your community willing to do you that, and I'm talking about the small community, not the big community.  Right now we're still a segregated society.  For the most part, black lawyers live in black communities.  You don't find white lawyers living over in this part of town, for the most part.  And the same--for the most part, in, in the--in, in, in the white neighborhoods.  And so, if we want legal knowledge to come into the black community, we gotta have black lawyers and, and in representation.  And so I, my son [Tshaka Randall] and I, have started a nonprofit called The JD Project.  He's a law professor now.  And the goal of our project is to help people who have been admitted to law school--well, how--the whole range.  We want to get lawyers into the community.  We want to help people do, do better on the LSATs so they can get admitted. We want to help people to do, to perform better in law school so that they'll have more options when they graduate.  We want to help people pass the bar the first time, because there's a, there is a movement on to close down schools that are having low bar passage rates, and that--and right now two out of the five black law schools are at risk.  And so, if--so, that's what professionally I see myself; continuing to teach here at UD [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio] but working in my nonprofit to get more blacks and Hispanics into law, because I--because law is a source of power in our--in, in the society.
Speaker 1: What, what, what are the five black law schools?  I know Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], I guess, Southern--
Speaker 2: Tex- Southern--
Speaker 1: Texas Southern [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Texas Southern.  I can't name them all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably Howard, Texas Southern, Southern [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: North Carolina.
Speaker 1: North Carolina A and T [sic. North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yea, yes, has a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Law school.
Speaker 1: That's four.  Yeah, well, that's close.
Speaker 2: That's, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I don't know if Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not Hampton.
Speaker 2: I'll think of it in a second, but--
Speaker 1: More--not Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] or, no.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay, well, that's, that's pretty good.  That's--at least we're, we're close.
Speaker 2: I think that part of the thing is that I think the law sc- I think the black law schools could have a better--do better with the students that they are getting if they would give up on traditional pedagogy.  And I--the, the problem with black stu- schools is that they have adopted a traditional white pedagogy, so it's like sending black students to white schools instead of saying okay, we have a special mission.  Let's cha- let's ignore how other schools teach law, and let's think of how we could teach law where our students will do well, become good lawyers, pass the bar the first time.  But what we do in these black law schools is just duplicate what's going on in white schools.
Story_ID: 352063
Speaker 1: I don't know if you'd agree with this, but I, I think that Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], you know, back in the--under Charles Hamilton Houston that had a, like a, a mission.  You know, the law students had a mission to, you know, change the, the civil right laws and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, they did.  And I think they still do to some extent, but I still--and, and, and Howard still has the good rep, reputation and, and, and does that.  Howard law school I think is one of the largest sources of black lawyers.  The black--the, the fact is black law schools is still the biggest source of black lawyers in--than all of the, almost all of the other law schools combined, because I think--look at, we have 192 law schools.  Very few of them are admitting more than 5 to 6 percent black students, and they're flunking out half of them, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Have, have you ever thought about teach, teaching at a black law school?  Did you ever want to do that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Someone asked me, especially since it--I mean, if, if you know my history at UD [University of Dayton School of Law, Dayton, Ohio], you would wonder why I stayed, because you count and recount the history after things that happened.  And someone once asked me, why don't you just move to a black law school?  And I'm gonna be terribly honest here.  I don't want to deal with black male sexism.  And I just felt like as, as opposed to dealing with racism or sexism, I guess I'd rather deal with racism than sexism.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, the--well, so the, they, the things that you hear and know about those schools keep you out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Keep you from working.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, the things that I hear--I mean, they're good schools.  I'm not saying their schools aren't good.  There are good schools.  They are good schools, and they're doing a good job in terms of what they're trying to do.  They could do a better job if they're doing the pedagogy.  But it's, it's not what I hear about the school.  I'm involved in the minor--the, the minority list--law professors listserv.  I'm involved in the minority--there's a pet- a black teaching conferences and stuff, and I, I, and, and, and I meet people and stuff.  And I think there's--my feeling is that there's a lot of sexism at the schools.  And so, from what I see and what I hear, and, and so I, I just decided I'd rather just stay where I am.
Speaker 1: You think the black, black schools on the whole are, are more conservative than they need to be?  I mean, they, they seemed to, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think they are, I think out of necessity, I think out of perceived necessity.  I don't think that there's really necessity.  I think what happens is they're always under the gun.  There's always people looking over their shoulder, trying to get rid of them, you know, black schools.  And I think they're always trying to prove that they're as good as the white schools.  And they're always wanting acceptance from the, from the white institutions.  And as long as you're doing that, you have to kind of play the tune and, and, and that be--and so I think they end up being more conservative and, and, and, and, and less willing to change in some ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Than--they're not, they're not gonna be at the forefront of pedagogical change (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I think, because they're not going, they're not going to want to catch criticism.  They're already catching criticism.  They're already--people saying oh, that's a North Carolina [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina] graduate, or that's, you know, that's a Texas Southern [Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] graduate.  So they're always--already feeling the pressure of that, and then to be different in how they teach their students (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's too much of a risk for them--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And for me, I want--I believe that the only way we are really going to overcome is to shed ourself of white supremacy pedagogy and to look at pedagogy in a way that says what is it that we want to do for our students and then teach to that, whatever that is.  And, and, and it's, and it's gonna look different.  It has to look different than, than what's already been done.
Story_ID: 352064
Speaker 1: Well, let's about your book.  Now, your book is entitled 'Dying While Black' [Vernellia Randall].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And I'm looking at a stack of them over there on the shelf.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And tell us about--now what does it, it--have you--is this--well, tell, tell us what it's about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's actually, my scholarship has been on the health status of black Americans and what--and system changes.  And I think one of the things that people don't realize is that when I give my talk--hundred thousand black people die every year that would not die if we had the same death rate as whites; and, that it's not about class, that studies have shown that the difference between length--life expectancy for poor whites and poor blacks is three years.  Poor whites living three years longer.
Speaker 1: Longer than poor blacks.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So the, their economic status does not account for that three, those three years.
Speaker 2: What do you think the difference is between middle class blacks and middle class whites?  Ten years, ten years.  And, and so what, what I have been into, there's, I mean, there's this--my book--first of all, there was slave health deficit that was coined--it wasn't a term that I came up with, and I'm trying to think of the authors who did, and I'll just tell in a minute, in minute.  But it basically, as a health person, what we know is that the health status of the child was affected by the health status of the parent, okay.  And so, once you acknowledge that, then you can trace our health status all the way back to slavery, because people came out of slaves--out of slavery unhealthy, so their children is affected.  Nothing was done during--very little was done during Jim Crow.  In fact, Jim Crow made it worse in some ways, so their health was affected.  I was born in the fif- '40s [1940s].  My health was affected by my mother's [Mary Hall Randall] health, who's of Jim Crow.  My child's health is going to have been affected by my health.  And so there's this, there's this slave black health deficit that has been traced.  But in addition, I look at current racism, 'cause I think that the, that the issue of health is not just about changes that occur to you biologically because of slavery and segregation and racism but changes that occur to beca- that occurs to you as you live your daily life because of the stress of living in the pool of racism, okay.  Plus, we haven't had--my book looks at the racist healthcare system that we have.  Blacks are more likely to get amputated limbs.  Black are more like--less likely to get pain medication, less likely--every area of health that there's been studies in, and there's been studies in every area, health, the healthcare that a black person get is different than the healthcare that a white person get, on average.  We're not talking about any individual person.  So I look at that, and I try to look at why within the law that is happening.  And the reason is--one of the reasons is because we don't have an effective discrimination law.  I mean, wa- you know, pe- we--there's the myth--there ma- there used to be a reality that you couldn't discriminate based on race, and you still can't overtly discriminate based on race.  But you can discriminate all you want if you have another reason of doing it.  And you can't sue, because our laws don't outlaw disparate impact discrimination or unintentional discrimination.  We have an intentional standard for discrimination instead of a negligent standard, and that's kind of what I propose.  I'd like--I should say that it shouldn't matter whether you intend.  It just should matter whether you knew you shouldn't--whether you knew or should have known that you would discriminate.  And if you knew or should have known that you would discriminate, you should be re- you should be responsible for not discriminating.  That's a negligent standard.  That's a lower standard that would require--that would catch a lot more discrimination.  But that's not what we have, so my book talks about that.

Speaker 1: My book ['Dying While Black,' Vernellia Randall] talks about why this new managed care system that, that we're in will promote discrimination, because it promotes--at its core, it requires doctors and providers to not provide services, in order to earn money, and that doctors and providers are going to rega- rely on implicit stereotypes and biases and when they do.  And we, we already know that.  It's already happening.  I look at--to the--how the black community has been targeted by tobacco companies, by alcohol companies in a way that they haven't target white communities.  They disproportionately spend advertising budget in, on our community; billboards, types of drinks.  Just if you--just look at the whole idea.  When you go to Rite Aid--when you step--go into Rite Aid store here and then go out to the Rite Aid store out in Kettering [Ohio] and count the number of banks that have beer, you know.  And you know, so if you--so you--so I look at the targeting of the African--the historical targeting of the African American community and how the, the tobacco settlement completely ignored our community and our needs even though we were targeted, you know.  And so we got really very little out of the tobacco settlement directly as a community.  I look at how the United States signed the treaty on the elimination of all [International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]--took the United States thirty years to ratify the, the treaty of the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.  I, I don't think most Americans even realize that, that, that the treaty was passed in 1960, wasn't ratified until 1995 [sic. 1994], and that, that the treaty requires them to do reports every year.  They didn't do the first report to two--every two years.  They didn't do the first report 'til 2001.  They had--they just did the second report.  So the United States is in breach of this human rights treaty.  We're, we are--we talk about human rights all over the place, but we never talk about our human rights failure.  And we have huge human rights failure in, in how we use the death penalty in our, in this breach of the treaty.  So I talk about how, how we had a re- what our responsibilities was on the treaty and how we have failed to, to look at that treaty.  And then finally, I talk about why we should look at reparations as a, as addressing the issue of black health and black healthcare.  But I look at not, not damages reprua-- reparations, but equi- equitable reparations.  The damages reparation is about giving you money and saying, okay, I've harmed you; here's some money.  Equitable reparations is about saying that you have to repair the harm, and you have to spend whatever amount of money it takes to repair the harm.  And so that would mean building hospitals, building schools, making--it, it would mean that you--the United States would say okay, we never fixed the health of the black slaves coming out of slavery, and we were the cause of their poor health by making them slaves.  And so, since we had this obligation that we never fixed and we know that this obligation has affected every generation, we are going to fix it now.  We're going to do whatever we take.  And that's the same for education.  So I look at a broad-based approach.  I, I believe that there has to be class-based approaches.  I don't believe that you can only do certain things for black Americans.  I, I, I believe, for instance, that in, that in order to fix the health of black, black Americans you gotta have living wages.  You can't just give living wages to one group of people.  You gotta give it to everybody, okay.  So that would be a class-based solution.  But I also believe that you gotta have some race-based solutions.  You have to say we're gonna get rid of all those toxic dumps that we put in black communities, you know.  Even if we don't--even as we don't do something else for other communities, we are gonna do this for black communities, things like that.  So that's, that's the focus of my book.  But it's, it, it wasn't a book that I just sat down and wrote.  It really is thirty years' worth of work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, these are issues that come out of your life's work--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --in healthcare and in law.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So, okay.
Story_ID: 352066
Speaker 1: How has the book ['Dying While Black,' Vernellia Randall] received and--?
Speaker 2: Very well; extremely well from non-lawyers (laughter).  It's been well received.  And I actually do a lot of speaking on it.  And I, in fact, I do--I have to limit my speaking engagements to two a month to take care of my health so that I aren't traveling too much, but, and, and also to keep up with my responsibilities when I'm teaching.  But I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I just came back from South Carolina, Pittsburgh [South Carolina], you know.  So, I just--someone just asked me to come down.  Now I'm gonna go to Cleveland [Ohio] in, in April.  And so I do about two to three trips outside of the state.  I, I went to, I went to Amsterdam [the Netherlands] back in De- in November and, and spoke to a group of African descendants there.  And, and I went to London [England] and spoke to a group in London.
Speaker 1: They had the group from Suriname in Amsterdam, right?  Was that the, the group pri- primarily, the black group that was there?
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: A group from Suriname.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: So the book has been well received, and it's, it's not gotten as much publicity as I would hope.  I, I, I'm very disappointed in the--that it's getting very--has gotten very little play among the black radio stations, talk stations.  I would think it would be a wonderful topic, but it hasn't actually.  Most of--I get good radio and television but only in the context of when someone invites me to talk.  And inviting to be talked is almost someone--I'm a good speaker.  And someone hears me talk, and then from there I always get another.  They go back and say oh, I know this great person, you know, and so I speak from there.  But I really, I really use it as a way to say--to get people to thinking about institutional and systemic discrimination and a need for a new civil rights law.  We really have an antiquated civil rights law.  The--most discrimination, most people don't know they've been discriminated against.  And the law requires you to know in order to be able to get into court.  The law requires you as an individual that, that an individual like you who have been injured brings suit.  Well, most of this is group-based discrimination based on statistics.  And so we need to allow people who--we need to allow organizations who are working in racial justice to bring lawsuits.  We need to be able to say: no, we don't have a particular person who have been discriminated against, but we have statistics, and so we are bringing a lawsuit based on these statistics.
Story_ID: 352067
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You think we'll ever get to that point, or what will happen I mean?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I'm really fearful about what's happening, because I believe that Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign is--that he's adopted a campaign strategy that is--acknowledged the racism in the United States, that is if he talks about race at all, he'll be labeled as a black--he'll, he, he, that he won't get--a large percentage of whites won't, won't coalesce around him, and that what, what a large percentage of whites have hoped for in him is to get rid of all of these discussions around divisions.  And in fact, he says that.  The problem with that is divisions do exist.  So, talk--not talking about it isn't getting rid of it.  Class-based solutions isn't going to get rid of it.  But if people now believe that that's the right way to go, they may be opposed to a civil rights law that would, that would make it easier to sue based on race-based discrimination, because they may believe that it doesn't exist, or they may believe--I mean, you know, there's this whole thing going on now about the way to get rid of racism is to stop talking about racism.  I'm like what (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's sounds like Spiro Agnew was let's cease this rhetoric of discontent and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.  And I'm like well, you know, that doesn't get rid of racism.  That just buries anybody from having to deal with it, you know, and having to confront, and that puts more--  So I, in some ways, I feel that the coming generation is going--I think we're moving into a new era of race relations but not a better era.  I think the new era is going to be a colorblind, class-based approach to things and that we will find ourself unable to address problems because people will be unwilling to talk about them and to acknowledge their existence.
Story_ID: 352068
Speaker 1: We spoke off camera about a measure that Ward Connerly sponsored.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ward Connerly has been, he's been active in the anti-affirmative action, but he's also been trying to get a racial privacy act.  And the whole idea is to get the government to stop collecting data as based on race.  And his--he bills this as an individual rights issue, that is you, no one should have to tell the government their race if they don't want to.  I mean that there's an obvious fallacy in that, that, that not telling your race doesn't mean that people won't discriminate, but not telling--if not collecting racial data means that people won't be able to prove discrimination.  One of the things that we have in United States that has, in, in our racial justice quest, that has, that's put us far ahead of other countries like your--where African descendants are in the dis- diaspora, Canada, England, the Netherlands, all these other places, is, is we have a lot of good data that is collected by the government, not just research, because when you do research, people can always attack your research pedagogy, methodology and say that, well, that research doesn't apply here because your pedagogy is flawed or your, your research methodology is flawed.  But when the, when the government collects population data, and that population data shows discrimination, you can't say there's no discrimination, you know.  And so if, if you get the government--if the government stopped collecting the data, that's gonna make it a lot worse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm think we're--I think we're--that there--between this transcended post-racial campaign of Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], and, and I think it's gonna happen whether he's elected or not, it's gonna be worse if he's elected, but he's already said it.  It's like setting in motion something that can't be taken back.  All of these people--in fact, I get angry--I'm start--I have started getting angry emails from people who, who used to get my newsletter, who's saying why are you still using the word race?  You know, you should, you should stop talking about race.  We need to move on and have hope.  I'm like (unclear), you know. And it's (laughter)--and so you, so you, so, that's have been set in motion, and we don't know where that's gonna lead it.  And lor- I may live a long enough to see the beginning of where it's gonna lead us, but I don't know that I think it's gonna lead us--leave black people to a good place.  I think what we're gonna end up with is class--that there will still always be discrimination and that middle-class blacks will be unwilling to take up the struggle of getting, get rid of racism for fear of move--live--losing their middle-class status.  And that's gonna leave poor class, poor, poor people, and poor black people who don't have the resources to take up the struggle, because it's always been the middle class and the working class people who have been at the front of the struggle because they had the resources to do it.  And so, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, what they call the underclass now does not have the resources.
Speaker 2: They don't have the resources, and it's unfair and unrealistic to expect them to do anything but take care of day-to-day needs the best they can and you know, to do what--and it's up for us, the working class and the middle class, to take up the struggle.  But we are gonna be so afraid because we're gonna be living in this environment that any discussion of race is going to be seen as black people are racist.  Fact, I've been called racist so many times, and it's like, I'm like, I just, okay, I'm a racist; I'm a racist because I'm trying to get rid of race problems.
Story_ID: 352069
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, and I guess it just kind of dovetails into what we're talking about, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: And that's just the--my, my, my major, my--I believe that we as a black community have progressed enormously.  I believe that, that whatever problems we have (laughter) are--pale beside, you know, the whole idea that at every turn in our history, there's a barrier that we have to overcome, a barrier not constructed by us, constructed by others.  And so, first there's a barrier coming here, coming here without any language, coming here and being forced to get rid of our culture, coming here and being slaves, coming here and not being able to generate any kind of wealth or stability, then there's the barrier of Jim Crow, and the legal apartheid, and being forced into just narrow kinds of jobs.  There's the barrier of going to World War II [WWII], fighting a war, my dad [Ernest Randall] fighting in the war, coming back and having these laws passed which were supposed to help G.I.s gain wealth, but not us; we didn't get the, we didn't get the benefit of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]; we didn't get the benefit of buying FHA [Federal Housing Administration] homes and stuff, not in mass.
Speaker 1: No, we didn't move into Huber Heights [Ohio].
Speaker 2: We didn't move into Huber Heights.  And we know that the number one way of passing wealth in American society is buying a home.  And yet, up until the mid-'70s [1970s], black people, for the most part, couldn't buy homes 'cause they couldn't get loans.  And now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or really, they couldn't, couldn't because they couldn't 'cause it was the house--the contract of the house, it couldn't be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's--
Speaker 1: --sold to--
Speaker 2: The contracts, that's right, and so every barrier; people on welfare.  People complain about the black men not being in the homes.  Well, I remember, yeah, black women haven't always been married to the men, of the fathers of their babies, but the fathers were around helping.  But then welfare came along and said we're gonna send women into your house, and if we find anything in your house that looks like you can't afford it, we're gonna--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know, so you--so the, so then the black men get ran out of the house because they can't get no jobs.  They know they can't get jobs to support the women in the same way.  And, and, and if they give them anything, the, the social workers that are coming around--and I'm old enough to remember that--they come in the house.  They'd say where'd you get that clock?  Where'd you get that tea kettle?  You know, how can you afford that?  And, and, and, and your, your welfare check would be deducted.  I remember myself where they told--they wouldn't give me welfare because I was in college [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  I had to lie.  I had to say I'm not a--I, I, I've quit college, and I can't find a job, because they said if you're in college you can't get welfare.  So they, you--they--you struck--the systems are structured to keep people subjugated, and then we complain because they are subjugated (laughter), you know.  I hope that we will be a--and, but, but I think we've risen to the occasion.  I think that if you looked at our education rates, if you look at everything, the progress we've made in the last hundred and fifty years is enormous, even though we've had these continuous barriers.  And I think we're continuing to make progress.  Our drug rates are down, less than the, than the white population at whole, something that no one really talks about.  I mean, we're not--no one is celebrating the fact that black people are using fewer drugs and--than, than the white community, okay, that our education rates almost ten--we're 12 percent of the population, 12 percent of the population.  Ten percent of the people trying to get into law school are blacks.  Now they ain't getting in, but that's not their fault.  They don't control admission committee, you know.  So I think that we have--that I feel very proud of where we are as black people, and I feel we, we have progressed a lot.  But we still are 70 percent in, in terms of wealth, in terms of, of a lot of things.  We are 70 percent of the white population, and so there is still this huge gap that needs to be closed.  The problem is I think we're moving into an era where we're not gonna want to acknowledge the racial gap.  And without acknowledging it, we won't be able to do anything about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 352070
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently; any major thing?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I don't think there's anything I would do differently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not--I think the only thing, I, I guess the only thing that I do regret, and I don't think--my brother [James Randall] hadn't died the first time we interviewed, I don't think.  My brother died.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I think my major regret that I have right, in my life right now, and this is one of the reasons I'm going to Honduras with my sister [Brenda Randall], is that in all of my raising my children [Tshaka Randall and Issa Randall] and taking care of the community and activism, I don't--I didn't spend as much personal time with my brother, and I regret that.  And I think that if that--if I could do anything over, I would spend more personal time with my family than I--with my brother and my father [Ernest Randall] and other people than I did.
Story_ID: 352071
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done this point, again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My sons and the, and the individual students that I've taught and helped on an individual level.  I think that my kid--my oldest son is thirty-six and a law professor at Wagner University [sic. Wagner College, Staten Island, New York], Tshaka Randall.  He's getting married in May.  I don't have any grandchildren.  And my youngest son [Issa Randall] is a fine arts photographer who travels all around the world and has been able to live in Africa, South Africa, lived in Korea, lived in Japan, lived in Japan for two years, and lived in England.  And I, and I just feel like, I feel very proud that I have raised children who have been able truly to go and live and prosper anywhere, you know.  And so, but in addition, I feel like that my work as a law professor, that I can ta- I know I can name individuals, a lot of individuals, who would not be lawyers today except for me working with them and helping them, and, and knowing that, that if nothing else, had changed their lives and changed the lives of their children and their family.  And who knows what lives it may change in the future.  To me that's my biggest legacy.
Story_ID: 352072
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we've covered the bases (laughter).
Speaker 1: At least maybe.  But the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I pride myself on speaking the truth, no matter how difficult it is.  And I guess I would like to--my, my son was four years--well, he was older than that.  He was in the first grade.  He was, he was asked by his teacher to draw a picture of his family and to, to sort of name them.  And so he put--he drew his picture of me and his brother, and, and he, he said that, on his paper, she's one tough cookie (laughter).  I think I'd like to remember--be remembered that way.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of Tom Randall, my dad's father.  I'm not sure when that is, probably 1920 or '30 [1930].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of two of my cousins.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Lois [ph.], and I'm not sure when they're, when those pictures were taken.  They're in their seventies now, so that could give you an idea about when it was taken.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my [paternal] great-grandparents, Manlis Randall [Manlis Randles], who was born in 1845 and died in the 1930s, and my great-grandmother, Narcissus Randall [Narcissa Dean Randles], and her sister.  We don't know which is which.  But Manlis built--lived until 1930s and was listed in the 1930s census as a merchant.  He, he was born in 1845.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and a group of students when I was first started teaching at law school and running the academic support pro--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --the academic support program, so a group of black law students that and minority students that I tutored and helped graduate.  I just--
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother's family.  And my mother is in the back row on the left corner, Pauline Hall [Mary Hall Randall], yeah, and my great-grandparents, the McGills [Francis Craddock McGill and James McGill], and my grandparents, Maude Hall and Jesse Hall, are on the back row on the right.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a picture of my mother's parents, Maude Hall and Jesse Hall, and a cousin in ni- in the 1950s, early 1950s.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my dad, Ernest Randall.  I think he--it was him coming in the [U.S. military] service during the war [World War II, WWII], so that would have been around 18--oh, excuse me--1945 or so.
Speaker 2: Was he tall?
Speaker 1: Yes, not real tall but taller than the average person.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother, Mary Pauline Hall, when she graduated from college in 1946 or '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Got it.  Where did she go again?
Speaker 2: Jarvis Christian College [Hawkins, Texas].  Yeah, my father did too.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my [paternal] grandmother, Cora Phillips [Cora Phillips Randall].  I--she died in 1928 or so, and I think she was in her early fifties when she died.  I don't know when that picture was taken.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my grandfather.  This was taken, I believe, before my dad was born.  And my dad was born--so that would make it in 1910 or so.
Speaker 1: What's your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Oh, Tom Randall.  He was born in 1870.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my, my dad--my grandfather Tom Randall's kids.  This is in, at our 1980 picnic.  Uncle Bud [ph.] is at the far left, Aunt Mary [Mary Randall Talley], Aunt Ora [Ora Randall Carey].  My dad is in the back row, the--he's between the woman with the glasses and the man, Uncle Elmer [Elmer Randall], and Uncle Arthur [Arthur Randall].  This was about, like I said, 19--mid-1984 or '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my foster parents, Christine Rogers [Christine Perkins Rogers (ph.)] and Major Rogers [ph.].  They took us in after our mother died, about five years after our mother died and raised us.  I stayed with them from the time I was twelve 'til I grad- left home.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my brother [James Randall], my sister [Brenda Randall], and me before our mother died.  This is the only picture I have together of us before she died.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and my sons.  Tshaka is to the left of me.  He's the shorter of the two.  And Issa [Issa Randall] is to the right.  Tshaka is the law professor.  Issa is the fine arts photography--photographer.  This was taken about fifteen years ago when they were in their twenties.
