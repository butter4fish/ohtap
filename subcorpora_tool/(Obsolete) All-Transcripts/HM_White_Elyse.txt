Speaker 1: Good morning.  My name is Shawn Wilson with The HistoryMakers, and I will be the interviewer today.  And you've already met, but you meet again, Neculai Burghelea, the videographer.
Speaker 2: Hi.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): How are you?
Speaker 2: And we will--I'll start by asking you several basic questions, your full name, if you can spell out your full name for me?
Speaker 1: My full name is Elyse, E-L-Y-S-E, White, W-H-I-T-E [HistoryMaker Elyse White], which is, of course, my married name.  And I was, my birth name was Elyse Oretha Woods, which was my family name.
Speaker 2: Now, you changed the spelling of your first name?
Speaker 1: I had a teacher who didn't like the way that, of that spelling, so she says, "Now, you must change the spelling of your first name to a more proper spelling."  And so she made me change my name from A-L-E-A-S-E to E-L-I-S-E.
Speaker 2: Now is it E-L-I or E-L-Y?
Speaker 1: And I added the Y because people invariably called me Elsye [ph.], and I don't like the name, and so I put the Y there so they could be sure to call me Elyse.
Speaker 2: Elyse.  Your date of birth?
Speaker 1: October the 1st, 1908.
Speaker 2: Your place of birth?
Speaker 1: I was born in Roanoke, Virginia, a small town of about--well, right now, it's about a hundred thousand population.
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Today's date--
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: --is February the--is it the 24th?
Speaker 2: Twenty-second.
Speaker 1: Twenty-second.
Speaker 2: Is it the 22nd?
Speaker 1: I was close (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, 22nd [February 22, 2007] (laughter).  Your occupation?
Speaker 1: I was a social worker and then I was a then teacher and then I was a travel agent, so I have had many different careers in the course of my life.
Speaker 2: People have called you a cultural historian.  Is that a title you like or dislike?
Speaker 1: I like that title because it somehow embodies the many facets of my life.  And it broadens the horizons of what I have done in my life.
Story_ID: 372908
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask you five basic questions--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I'll accept short answers.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Is chitterlings (laughter).
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is green.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Is, well, Christmas.
Speaker 1: And what about--this will be a good one for you--your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Jamaica.
Speaker 1: No place in Africa?  It's Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Is there a part of Jamaica you--
Speaker 2: Well, we go usually to Montego Bay [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: And you have a home in Montego Bay.
Speaker 2: We have a home there where we enjoy the warm weather and climate.
Speaker 1: And what about your favorite phrase or saying?  Is there something that you like, a phrase?
Speaker 2: Phrase, don't let anything defeat you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, from my life, which has been full of obstacles, which I have surmounted.
Story_ID: 372909
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna start, and we're gonna talk about some of the obstacles--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and some of the rewards, the highlights.  But I want to start by talking about your family.  And we will start with your mother's side of the family first.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So if you can give me your mother's full name.
Speaker 2: My mother was Julia Johnson.  And of course, she married my father, William Woods, and she became Julia Johnson Woods.
Speaker 1: And she was born in what year?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I would, I would guess about 1875.  I haven't really tracked it down.  But from the age of my older siblings, I have done a little arithmetic and arrived at that date, 1875.
Speaker 1: Now was she born in Roanoke, Virginia?
Speaker 2: She was born in a small country town called Big Island, Virginia, a little rural community of farmers.
Speaker 1: Was that community a predominantly black community?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  It was very sparsely populated.  But there were a number of white residents, but her sisters and brothers lived there in Big Island.  They were fairly prosperous farmers.  They had homes, and they had acres of land, and of course, they, they grew cotton, which was their main money crop.  And that was how they survived.  They were honest, God-fearing, churchgoing people, but they did not obtain higher obtain higher education.  My mother was the first in her family to, who go to normal school, and she became a teacher by profession.
Speaker 1: Now where did your mother go to school?  Where did she--
Speaker 2: My mother went to Petersburg normal and industrial school [Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute; Virginia State University] located in Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And where did she go to college to teach--
Speaker 2: Well, that was the end of her--
Speaker 1: That was the end of it, okay.
Speaker 2: In those days--
Speaker 1: But it allowed her to teach.
Speaker 2: --if you went to a teacher training school, you got a, a diploma or certificate enabling you to teach, and that was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So she became a teacher.
Speaker 2: She became a teacher.
Speaker 1: Where did she teach?
Speaker 2: Well, she taught in Bedford City, Virginia, and that was where she met my father.
Story_ID: 372910
Speaker 1: My father [William Woods] had finished Virginia Theological Seminary and College [Virginia University of Lynchburg] located in Lynchburg, Virginia, and had obtained a degree of DDS [sic.], Doctor of Divinity.  And they were both fellow teachers in the rural school there in Bedford City [Virginia], and they met and married there.
Speaker 2: What was your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: I would think he was born about 1872 in Stewartsville, Virginia, another small town in Virginia, which I don't know of too much about his origins.  But his parents, his mother was Martha Woods [sic. Fannie Woods], and his father was John Woods.  My cousin, [HistoryMaker] Donald Bogle, whom you might have heard of, he's an author.  Donald traced back and found out that the two, that the parents were married.
Story_ID: 372911
Speaker 1: So are there--how far back can you trace your family on either side--
Speaker 2: Actually--
Speaker 1: --your mother's [Julia Johnson Woods] side?
Speaker 2: --I haven't really researched too far back.  I only know what my mother has told me.  And of course, we have done a family tree of the Woods, so we are able to trace.  But we haven't gone that--say, like some families are able to determine the slave master, and I haven't not really done that.  I, I look forward to having someone in the family do that.
Speaker 1: So what do you know about your grandparents, about your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: I knew very little about them.  I, I remember meeting my grandmother [Matilda Johnson] when I was small, but she died.  I remember going to the country, Big Island [Virginia], and being held up over her deathbed to say goodbye.  That was all I remember.
Speaker 1: And on your father's side, did you know your--
Speaker 2: On my father's side--
Speaker 1: --paternal grandparents [Fannie Woods and John Woods]--
Speaker 2: --I didn't ever know any of his parents, only his siblings, his sisters.  And that was--and only what I could find out by word of mouth from other members of the family.
Story_ID: 372912
Speaker 1: So when you look back over your mother's [Julia Johnson Woods] history and your father's [William Woods] history, did, can you think of any stories they may have told you that stands out about things that may have happened in their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my, my mother used to tell the story about when she would return to her country home, she would meet this white man there, Mr. Turpin [ph.].  And she said Mr. Turpin was her mother's [Matilda Johnson] half-brother.  Of course, in those illicit relationships, he was white.  But she said she would feel like kissing him because he looked so much like ma, she said (laughter).  And that was the, about the only story about their early years.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about what her childhood was like on the farm?
Speaker 2: Well, she had nine brothers and sisters; they were a family of ten.  And we had occasion to revisit Big Island [Virginia] and to enjoy meeting her sisters and brothers, and they were delightful.  They were, well, not formal educated.  They were literate and were, I would say, on a, not downright illiterate; they were able to converse, and they were able to run their famil- their farms on a prosperous basis.  They were subscribed to the farm journals so that they were up to date on the latest farming methods.
Story_ID: 372913
Speaker 1: So your--was it your father [William Woods] that owned several rental properties, and he owned a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a store?
Speaker 2: My father, in Roanoke, Virginia, he did not have the temperament to become a, a pastor, you know, to talk to the sisters and soothe the sick.  He was rather brusque in manner, so he became a businessman.  He bought several, what they call, shotgun houses and rented them to the people there in town (laughter).
Story_ID: 372914
Speaker 1: So what are your earliest memories of growing up in Roanoke, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Well, I, we had a fairly happy childhood.  We had a great big house.  To me it was, seemed like a big house, as we had a big front porch.  And we had lot of good neighbors I remember, the, even remember the names of my neighbors.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Well, there was Mrs. Gaskins [ph.]--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --her daughter, Eva [ph.], was the--
Speaker 1: And, and just tell me what they did also.  So Mrs. Gaskin--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, Eva was a teacher.  Mrs.--the Olivers [ph.] were very wealth--well-healed.  I don't know exactly what they did, but they had a very imposing house there in Roanoke (laughter).  But I would say--
Speaker 1: And who else--
Speaker 2: --it was--
Speaker 1: --who lived on the other side of you?
Speaker 2: It was a middle-class neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about who else lived in the neighbor, this neighborhood.  Who--you--who lived on the other--who lived to your left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --or to the right side?
Speaker 2: Well, the Curtises [ph.] and the Agnews [ph.] lived (laughter), one on one side and one on the other, I remember very vividly, and of course, the Clarks [ph.], because later their son was murdered by one of--another neighbor.  So as I say, our life was not without tragedy, even though it was fairly tranquil.  My graded school, there was a terrific explosion.  They were doing some construction nearby, and apparently a dynamite charge exploded prematurely.  And some of the shards came into the school, and it created a panic.  We had to rush out.  And I remember people walking over me to get out (laughter).
Story_ID: 372915
Speaker 1: So this, this is when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: That was in elementary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you go to--
Speaker 2: --school.
Speaker 1: --elementary school, Roanoke [Virginia], or that's--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --when you moved to--
Speaker 2: --attended school in Roanoke until I was ten years old.  We moved Washington, D.C. in 1918.  My father [William Woods] was dissatisfied with the educational facilities provided in Roanoke.  There was no high school for black children.  The, the next year they built Addison High School [Lucy Addison High School, Roanoke, Virginia].  But he was determined that his children would get a good education.  So he packed up his belongings, and we moved to Washington, D.C., and I was age ten years old.  It was 1918, and the World War [World War I, WWI] was concluding.  But we, he delayed our move there because they had some race riots in Washington, in which some people were killed.  I think the black recruits from Camp Meade [Camp Meade Cantonment and Field Signal School; Fort George G. Meade, Maryland] objected to the segregation which they encountered in Washington.  And so it, it, it erupted into gun battles, and people were actually killed.  So we moved there in about November 1918.
Story_ID: 372916
Speaker 1: When you were in Roanoke, Virginia, before you moved to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], you said you lived in a middle-class neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I would say.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what was the main street in the neighborhood where all the black businesses were located?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I remember more vividly Henry Street, which was like the street of sin (laughter).  But actually, I lived on 7th [Street]. We, my address I remember vivid, 222 7th Avenue [sic.] Northeast.  We lived in the northeast section of Roanoke, which, of course, the northwest section was the upper, upper class (laughter).
Speaker 1: So tell me about Henry Street.
Speaker 2: Well, there was gambling going on and freaking.  We only heard about it vividly.  There was a movie theater.  And of course, our neighbor, John Willie Clark, was killed going to the--as he came out of that movie theater.  There was a robbery with Andrew Douglas [ph.] over the girl who was with him, Scottie Parlard [ph.].  And so (laughter), so Andrew pulled out a gun and killed John Willie Clark, who was our neighbor.  And of course, it was very tragic.  Another tragedy was the killing of our principal.  His name was White, Mr. White [ph.], who was a principle of our grade school.  A jealous woman shot him in school (laughter).  And so I remember these tragedies very vividly, because otherwise, things were fairly tranquil.
Story_ID: 372917
Speaker 1: Now did you attend a church?  Did your family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --attend church?
Speaker 2: The, the church was about 80 percent of our activities.  I attended what they called the High Street Baptist Church [Roanoke, Virginia], which was pastored by Reverend Burke [sic. J.H. Burks].  And later years I met his daughter [sic.], Beulah Burke.  She was a sorority sister of mine [in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] (Laughter).  But we went to Sunday school, and we took out pennies and put them in the collection plate.  And we attended the service, 11:00 service.  And of course, we played with our dolls while the service (laughter)--because we terribly bored.  But the church was the center of our existence.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Julia Johnson Woods], mother and father [William Woods] attend the same church?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  As I said, my father was a minister.
Speaker 1: He was a minister.
Speaker 2: But he did not have a church.  But many Sundays he was invited to be the guest preacher.
Speaker 1: And he could pack the house (laughter).
Speaker 2: He went and we learned to know the names of the neighboring Christiansburg [Virginia], Stewartsville [Virginia], Vinton [Virginia], Hollins [Virginia].  These were little towns where we was called upon to preach.
Story_ID: 372918
Speaker 1: Now when you moved to Washington, D.C., what did your father [William Woods] do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, actually, he did not have a, a job there.  At one point, he worked in the Alexandria shipyards [Alexandria, Virginia].  They were still on a sort of a wartime footing, and they were still building ships, warships.  And so papa worked in the Alexandria Shipyard, and there he--he wasn't used to manual labor, and so he contracted the flu, and he died in 19--and I was twelve years old, so I add the years twelve and eight--and he died in 1920 of the, of the flu--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and left us.  But fortunately, he had taken out a ten thousand dollar Metropolitan Life Insurance Company policy, which was very unusual for a black man to be able to get that much insurance.  Their mortality was high, and therefore the Met would, would give them those cheap policies, you know, a thousand dollars.  But he looked--my father could pass for a white man, and so he passed and obtained this ten thousand dollar insurance policy.  And with the proceeds of that policy my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] purchased a big house in Washington, which she used as a rooming house to support us (laughter). So that's--
Speaker 1: These are good stories.
Speaker 2: Are they good?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are (laughter).
Story_ID: 372919
Speaker 1: So I want to talk a little bit about your father [William Woods] passing for white.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I don't think he purposely passed for white.  But among other things that happened, he infiltrated a secret order called the Independent Order of Red Men.  And he learned their rituals and learned their regalia, and he set up a black Independent Order of Red Men, entailing all the regalia, you know, the tomahawks and fringe pants and so forth.  And it was like a--what would you say--like an insurance company.  You wrote policies, and people derived death benefits and sick benefits.  And we children were used as his secretaries to write up the policies (laughter).  And my father traveled.  The, this order was mainly in West Virginia, where my father had worked as a miner.  He had worked as a coal miner in West Virginia.  And he had set--(unclear)--made many friends there, so he set up charter chapters.  In fact, my middle name, which was Oretha, was the name of the last tribe that he had set up.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: O-R-E-T-H-A, Oretha.
Speaker 1: And that was the last Indian [Native American] tribe--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's--
Speaker 1: --that he--
Speaker 2: --that was the last charter chapter of the Independent Order of Red Men that he set up.  He was known as the Great Incohonee, I-N-C-O-H-O-N-E-E.  And my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] was known as the Great Pocahontas (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now were the Red Men broken down into two groups, the whites and the blacks?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as I know, my father's group had nothing to do with that other order, because the separation of the races in Virginia was very complete.  We went to separate schools, separate churches, and as far as I know, we didn't even have any white friends.  But the neighborhood itself had some white residence.  I remember that the chief of police, a Mr. Griffin [ph.], who was white, was, lived a few doors down for us--from us in Roanoke [Virginia].  So, actually, I don't think the separation of residences was so emphatic as it later became.
Story_ID: 372920
Speaker 1: When you were a child in Roanoke, Virginia, do you remember segregation?
Speaker 2: I do remember well.  I was very fair, compared to my sisters [Lucille Woods and Evelyn Woods] and brothers [William Woods, Jr. and Gregory Woods].  They were light-skinned, but I looked like white.  And so the--I remember when my friend, we would go to deliver laundry in the white neighborhoods.  They'd say, "What are you doing with that white child?  Why don't you take her back to her folks?" (Laughter) And she, and my friend would say she's--of course they didn't use the term black then; they used the term Negro: "She's Negro."  "Oh no, she's not."  And they would start fighting, and I would run and hide (laughter).  I was a real coward (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now how old was your friend, and how old were you?
Speaker 2: Well, she must have been about nine.  I was about seven.  But I, I was not going to stay until the bitter end (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you understand what was going on?  Did you understand that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --light-skinned black?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I--that was the closest that I came to--because, actually, as you know, there are many very fair blacks in Virginia, in Washington [D.C.], wherever, so that it was not a revelation.  And many of my relatives, they ranged in color from snow white to jet black (laughter).  So I had a very close association with the color, not in an unfriendly way, but I was not fazed by it.
Speaker 1: Were there any other family members who, that you know of that passed for white who went off and lived their lives in an--
Speaker 2: Actually--
Speaker 1: --easier way?
Speaker 2: --in, in, in later years, some members of my family are passing right now for white (laughter).  But they, they married white; their children are white; and to all intents and, and purposes they are white because that's how they look, and that's the association that they have grown up with.  It's not a purposeful removal from the black race, but it's like a, what shall you say (unclear) the state of the art that brought about this state of things.
Speaker 1: Did you ever consider living white?
Speaker 2: I really did not.  It never occurred to me.  Because many times I have been mistaken for white, and they say, "Oh, you know, those other people--," (unclear) oh, and when I went to work for the Department of Welfare [City of New York Department of Welfare; City of New York Department of Social Services] in New York City [New York, New York], I was asked, "Do you object to working with--," at that time it was Negro people.  I said, "Well, I can hardly object.  I'm a Negro myself," (laughter).  And the lady turned about twenty colors (laughter).  So it's been a source of, of amusement I think more than anything else.  But I don't--it never occurred to me that that--because all of my friends--I mean I, I was black.  I grew up black.  My traditions were black.  I knew very little about the white race.
Story_ID: 372921
Speaker 1: When your father [William Woods] passed away you were in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Were, you were what, twelve years old, you said?
Speaker 2: I was twelve at the time, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you go to Lucretia Mott Elementary School [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: In Washington?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other students that were there at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, Howard Fitzhugh [H. Naylor Fitzhugh].  You've heard of him I'm sure, he became a famous vice president of Pepsi-Cola [PepsiCo]; Stanton Wormley [Stanton Lawrence Wormley].  Have you heard of him?  He became a professor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Let's see, Eddie Carol [ph.], he became a bishop.  He went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and became a bishop in the Methodist church, and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: So what were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Benny, Benny Butcher, James Butcher [James W. Butcher], he accompanied the Howard Play--he taught drama at Howard University, and accompanied the Howard Players [Howard University Players] when they went to Denmark to perform Ibsen's [Henrik Ibsen] plays.  You remember?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Isn't it we're running down?  We're gonna stop here and change the tapes.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: We're, we're gonna stop here, change the tapes, and we'll keep going.
Speaker 2: Okay, good
Speaker 1: But you were just telling me that--
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: --the Harlem Players [sic.] did Ibsen.  And where, where, where did they do that, you said in?
Speaker 2: This was--I did have a picture.  Roxie Krav- Roxie Roker Kravitz [Roxie Roker] was a member of the group.  You've heard of her.  She was the black wife of 'The Jeffersons' and the father of--I mean the mother--
Speaker 1: Mother.
Speaker 2: --of Lenny Kravitz.
Story_ID: 372922
Speaker 1: You were telling us about the, the dun- what do they call it?  The Dunbar Players?  No, no--
Speaker 2: The Howard Players [Howard University Players].
Speaker 1: Howard Players.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that they'd done Ibsen [Henrik Ibsen].
Speaker 2: --asking you if you knew one of my classmates, who was James Butcher [James W. Butcher], who was a teacher of drama at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Did you ever hear of Owen Dodson?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, he--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --he was the mentor for the group of Howard Players.  And my niece was one of the players.  She was my namesake, Alease, Alease Tiller.  That was my sister's daughter.
Story_ID: 372923
Speaker 1: At Mott Elementary School, Lucretia Mott Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], what type of a student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was always a bright student (laughter).  I, I remember my high school teacher telling some people that I had scored the highest on an IQ test.  That was the advent of IQ tests, and she remarked within my hearing that I had scored the highest mark (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how did that make you feel?
Speaker 2: Oh, it made me feel good (laughter).
Speaker 1: What, what else do you remember about Lucretia Mott Elementary School?  Were there any other teachers there that served as role models for you?
Speaker 2: Well, there was Mrs. Netherlands [ph.].  She was married to an African man named Netherlands.  She was my eighth grade teacher at--I remember she had a class of about forty-five students and kept them under perfect control (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was he the first African you had ever met?
Speaker 2: You mean African, African?
Speaker 1: African, African.
Speaker 2: The first African that I met was when I went to, I would say, Kenya, which was in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay, but before we get there, you said her--at--
Speaker 2: Her--
Speaker 1: --the teacher's--
Speaker 2: --husband.
Speaker 1: --husband was African.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I never met--
Speaker 1: You never met him.
Speaker 2: I met him, but I don't remember too much about him.  I just remember his name is Netherlands.
Speaker 1: Nether--what, what makes you remember that he was African?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you, I had an aunt living in Baltimore [Maryland], and we used to go to visit my aunt.  And she knew Mr. Netherlands and, and Mr. Netherlands, and she told us that he was African.
Speaker 1: And she told you he was African, meaning he was from Africa.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Did that have any--
Speaker 2: --an African African.
Speaker 1: --impression on your at the time?
Speaker 2: And also--
Speaker 1: Did that make an impression on you?
Speaker 2: --another African that I met in the course of our dealing with Virginia, we were very closely associated with the Virginia Theological Seminary and College [Virginia University of Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia].  And they sometimes took African students.  And there was one--my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] was a great matchmaker, so she would try to match up her cousins and nieces with students at the Virginia seminary.  And one African student that she tried to match up with my cousin was Mr. Persetti [ph.], P-E-R.  He was studying for the ministry.  And I remember my cousin says, "I don't like him.  They say he eats snakes (laughter)."
Story_ID: 372924
Speaker 1: I mean did you think of them in any way at the time, like, "Oh, one day I'm going to go to Africa."  Was it ever a dream (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I never had the--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --slightest dream.  In fact, when I lived in New York [New York], before I got married, I belonged to the Abyssinian Baptist Church [New York, New York].  And Adam [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and I were very close friends.  We were on first-name basis because Isabel [HistoryMaker Isabel Powell], his first wife, and I had gone to the fourth, were in the fourth grade together [at Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  And so he was offered a chance to go to Russia.  At that time, Russia was wooing blacks to join the Communist Party.  And so they were making a film in Russia I guess having to do with the civil rights struggle.  And they offered Adam an opportunity to come and be in the film.  So he said, "Elyse [HistoryMaker Elyse White], I can't go, but I recommend you to go if you wanna go."  So, he recommended that I go over.  At that time, I had never dreamed of even going around the corner (laughter).  And so I, I didn't take advantage of the offer.  But my first trip abroad, my sister [Evelyn Woods] and I went on a cruise (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cruise, and we'll get to that cruise.  I want to go back, so I don't, so we don't jump too far ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 372925
Speaker 1: But I want to go back to when you were still in, in elementary school [Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have any de--what did you think you were going to become, a teacher, a nurse?
Speaker 2: Well, I think at that time, your, your options were limited.  It was--
Speaker 1: What were your options?
Speaker 2: I think I didn't even think about the future, but I, I, I said well, I guess I'll be a teacher like my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] and my father [William Woods].  They were teachers, so I figured that I would also become a teacher.  And of course, the Great Depression, when I graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I did my first job was in the sharecropping area of North Carolina.  I had never in my wildest dreams dreamed that people could be that poor and not own even their houses.  They were living in the sharecropping huts that the owner provided for them.  And I, I had opened my eyes to the world, that here were people who didn't even have enough to eat and who didn't have any steady income.  They depended on credit from the company store for their living.  In fact, I would ask the children--we would have plays, and I'd say well, "Bring ten cents tomorrow to pay for your costume."  They said, "We don't have no ten cents."  That, that was a revelation to me that there were people in the world who were so poor they couldn't even provide a nickel or a dime for a paper costume for a play.

Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1926 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty--so that was three years before the Depression [Great Depression], the, the crash and the--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I--
Speaker 1: How had your family been doing up to that time?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] was very ingenious.  She did not work.  After my father [William Woods] died, as I said, we got this--
Speaker 1: The big rooming house.
Speaker 2: --ten thousand dollar insurance.  And so papa had sold some properties back in Roanoke [Virginia], and we still derived some income from payments that the purchasers were sending us periodically.  And--
Speaker 1: And so your mother didn't have to work.  She became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She should have worked (laughter).
Speaker 1: --a, a landlord though, but, but, 'cause the people were living in the house.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so, but it was the Depression, and people weren't paying the rent.
Speaker 1: So how did the Depression affect you and your family in 1929?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1930, as I said, I taught in this depressed area [in North Carolina], and it was even more depressed by the Depression.  So, actually, I had a good look at poverty, stark, dismal poverty.  For the first time in my life my mother actually had to send me boxes of food at the, at my place of employment.  And my salary was eighteen dollars a month.  I actually, I stayed with one of the families.  They didn't have any running water.  They had no central heat.  They had, every morning the father had to build a big fire in the fireplace in our bedroom for us to get up by.  And (unclear) of course they had the toilets out in the yard.  So that was my first contact with real, real poverty.
Speaker 1: And that happened in 1930?
Speaker 2: That happened in 1930.
Story_ID: 372927
Speaker 1: Just to go back to fill in some of the blanks, when you were at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], who helped you get into college?  Who helped you fill out your college applications?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who--
Speaker 2: --actually, I won a scholarship from the American Association of University Women of one hundred dollars (laughter).  But at that time, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was on a quarter system, and one hundred dollars paid for my first quarter's tuition of thirty-five dollars (laughter).  So the second quarter I had to drop out because I didn't have no more money.  And I went to work.  I went to an employment agency, and I got a job as a bread girl at the Hamilton Hotel [The Hamilton Crowne Plaza, Washington, D.C.], which meant that I went around to the tables with a hot breadbox, giving customers hot bread (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is a job you did for how long?  How long did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, until I earned enough money to pay my next quarter's tuition.  So I re-entered Howard at--after the first quarter, I was able to pay my tuition.  And then I got another job as a waitress in a tea room in, on Connecticut, a very fashionable tea room on Connecticut Avenue, where the proprietress boasted that all of her workers were college students (laughter).  So that's what I, I did.  Then, after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 372928
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], who were the teachers that may have helped you or served as role models?
Speaker 2: Well, the, one that was most outstanding was Gibson [ph.].  Her name was--later she became Huntley [ph.].  She was a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France].  And she was my French teacher, so I developed a love of French, and I perfected my French under her.  She demanded that we speak impeccable French and grammatically correct and so forth, so that I continued my studies of French after I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] so that I, when I go to the African countries where they speak French, I'm able to act as a translator for, for the, for our group.
Story_ID: 372929
Speaker 1: Now what year did you join a, did you become, did you pledge the sorority AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What year did you join the sorority--
Speaker 2: I joined the--
Speaker 1: --Alpha Kappa Alpha?
Speaker 2: --sorority in 1928.  I'm what they call a diamond soror- back then.  See my pin.  That means that you've had, I've had seventy-five years--where is it?  Here, oh yeah, here.  That means that I'm been the sorority for seventy-five years.  And I--
Speaker 1: And in 1928 is when you joined?
Speaker 2: It's 1928, correct.
Speaker 1: Now can you talk to me about the history of that organization?  What was it like--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that--
Speaker 1: --in 1928?
Speaker 2: --that organization was founded at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And there was several founders, Lucy Slowe [Lucy Diggs Slowe], Beulah [Beulah Burke]--I can't think of all the names, but they, these women, got together and decided they wanted an organization which would emphasize high scholarship.  And so that's what--in fact, in 2008 they are going to celebrate their hundredth anniversary at Howard.  And in fact, one of the founders of the sorority, Lucy Slowe, was the dean of women at Howard when I was there (laughter), which is a coincidence.
Speaker 1: So how many diamond sisters are there?
Speaker 2: Well, there are actually two in my chapter, in the New York graduate chapter.  One just became a diamond soror (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who are the--it's you and who else?
Speaker 2: Her name is Eva Jordan.  She is the second diamond soror, and there, Audrey Hudson Tavares in Texas is another diamond soror.  So you're in Chicago [Illinois]; you can run over to the headquarters and say, "Hey, give me the list of diamonds (laughter)."
Story_ID: 372930
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 19--
Speaker 2: Thirty [1930].
Speaker 1: Thirty [1930], with--
Speaker 2: Cum laude (laughter).
Speaker 1: --cum laude--with, with your B.A. degree in what?
Speaker 2: Education.
Speaker 1: Education.  So you were, you were setting out to become a teacher.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did you know where you wanted to live?  Did you, did you want to live in Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you, I, I hadn't gotten that far.  You know, it wasn't like today.  Kids make their plans almost from kindergarten what they want to do, where they want to live.  But in my day, you just live for the day, day by day, and you--whatever presented itself, you took.  So therefore, I couldn't plan ahead because, you know, I didn't have any money, and I, I was just surviving from day to day.
Speaker 1: So what, what--you were living where at the time?
Speaker 2: I, when I finished (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the time you graduated Howard.
Speaker 2: I was living in this house which my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] had bought--
Speaker 1: Still?
Speaker 2: ---with my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --father's [William Woods] insurance comp--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were living with your mother still?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 372931
Speaker 1: When did you move out and on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Julia Johnson Woods] remarried and to a man from Roanoke, Virginia.  And she moved out and left me in charge of the house, so that after a year's teaching in Washington [D.C.], I had passed an exam, and I taught one year at junior high school in Washington.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Browne Junior High [Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] (laughter).  I got a memory of everything, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Browne Junior High School.
Speaker 1: So that was your first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember the principal was Dr. Ranfro, R-A-N-F-R-O.  And another one of the--but--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.  So your, your mother moves out, and she leaves you in charge of the house.
Speaker 2: That's right.  She remarried and moved to Virginia and left me in charge of, of the house.  And I continued with roomers (laughter), not so successfully, 'cause at one, one, at one point, by a neighbor across the halls said, "Honey, after you leave the house," said, "there's some ladies that have men streaming in," (laughter).  And I noticed that when they paid their rent, it was always in quarters and (laughter)--so I had to conclude that they were ladies of the evening (laughter).
Speaker 1: Ladies of the evening.
Story_ID: 372932
Speaker 1: So when did you decide that you were going to leave Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a cousin here in New York [New York].  Well, after this--as I taught one year of junior high school [at Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], and I was small of stature.  I was, weighed about 111 pounds.  And I had a discipline problem, and the kids would say, "Ms. Woods [HistoryMaker Elyse White], you want me to beat him up?" (Laughter) Course I, and I had a, a gay young man in my class, and the children poked fun at him and teased him.  And he came to me and he said, "Ms. Woods, they're, they're teasing me."  So I didn't know how to handle the situation.  I was completely unequipped to handle, so I said, "I'm gonna get out of this teaching profession."  And when my cousin made me the offer to come to New York in 1933 during the height of the Depression [Great Depression], I came.
Speaker 1: And her name was Beatrice?
Speaker 2: Beatrice Walker, yes.  And she--I lived with them.  I took domestic work scrubbing people's floors, and that was the best I could do, you know.  And then, Bale La Guardia [sic. Fiorello H. La Guardia], who had set up the (unclear) this was at the height of the Depression.  And FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] became president in '32 [1932], and he saw the desperate situation in which the country was in.  It was about to collapse.  Wall Street had collapsed, and people were rioting in the streets.  There were bread riots, and, and there were food riots, and people were being evicted and put out in the streets.  So it was a desperate situation.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to power, and he said, "There's nothing to fear but fear itself," and he took over.  He declared a bank moratorium to allow the banks to reestablish their credit.  He closed the banks for three or four days, and they could borrow money, because before that, there was a run on the bank.  Customers were lined up for blocks to take their money out of the banks because they feared they would lose everything.  So he restored calm, and he instituted programs like the Works Progress Administration [WPA], whereby people--sort of like maid work, but they were given a job.  He created the jobs, like he, rebuilding roads, or rebuilding bridges.  They rebuilt the Bourne Bridge up in Massachusetts [Bourne, Massachusetts].  That was one of the works.  They built LaGuardia Airport [New York, New York].  That was a project that the WPA built, LaGuardia Airport.  And many of the clients of the welfare worked--I remember very well that the musicians were forced to work.  And they said, "Look, our hands are our (unclear) of (unclear) who had we play our instruments."  And so then they created a musicians project.  They created an artist project [Federal Art Project] and allowed the artists to paint freely and store, as I said, store their paintings.  And later they decided to break him out, and they were worth thousands of dollars.
Story_ID: 372933
Speaker 1: Who were some of the artists that you had the opportunity of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --working with?
Speaker 2: --Beauford [Beauford Delaney] and Joel Delaney [ph.], Palmer Hayden.  My daughter [Carol White] brought a pa- Palmer gave me that painting.  You ever heard of him?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: As I said, he lived in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] us.  I, my friend and I, in about 1935, we moved to the Village, and we--she was dark-skinned, and they, they was prejudice.  And they said, "Oh, you'll, you'll have to say she's your maid for you to get," (laughter).  I said, "No, I can't do that."  But anyway, we got an apartment, and we lived--we were neighbors of Carmine DeSapio.  You remember?  Oh, you heard about him.  He was caught with the money in, in, in the cab?  But he lived on MacDougal Street; so did we.
Speaker 1: Can you describe for me the neighborhood at the time, the Village?  What was the, the--
Speaker 2: Well, where we lived in the Village, as I said, they were mostly cold water flats.  That means that they had no, no bathrooms.  The bathroom--the toilet was down the hall, and the bathtub was in the kitchen with a big board over it (laughter).  And, and the places stunk.  People had used them, the--(unclear)--the halls as bathrooms, and so it smelled bad--but Palmer Hayden, Joel and Beauford Delaney.  And as I said, Romare Bearden worked with me in the welfare department [City of New York Department of Welfare; City of New York Department of Social Services], so he was a victim also of the Depression [Great Depression].
Story_ID: 372934
Speaker 1: What did you do at the welfare department [City of New York Department of Welfare; City of New York Department of Social Services]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was your job at the welfare department?
Speaker 2: Social investigator.  That meant we investigated the applicants for help.  We went to their homes to determine if they were eligible for this service.  And--
Speaker 1: And was it up--I read that it was a very unpopular job to have.
Speaker 2: Yes, because you had to look in people's iceboxes and look in their closets (laughter).  And they, and then if they didn't conform to all the policies, you'd have to close their case.  And they'd tell you they gonna beat you up (laughter), and many of them did.  And then you had a very active club called the Workers Alliance [Workers Alliance of America].  It was a Communist organization.  And of course, they would incite the clients to rebel against the welfare--, "You're not getting enough money, and you're killing our children."  And, and they would come in, and they would walk up and down with a coffin and say, "Look what you did to us."  And they had, had placards that says, "Welfare is very unfair to us," you know.  And they would come into--invade the welfare center.  Sometimes they'd grab the case supervisor (laughter).  It was very hectic, but anyway.
Story_ID: 372935
Speaker 1: There were other artists that you had an opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, so--
Speaker 1: --to work with.
Speaker 2: --most of them were on welfare.  As I said, they were either working for welfare or on.  So Palmer Hayden, we would--my friend and I were investigators, so we would read the cases of these artists, and we'd find out all the lies they had told (laughter).  But anyway, it was a, a very exciting time, but it was also a time when people were very poor.  And as investigators, we had to participate--had to stand by while people were being thrown out of their houses.  We had to find them new housing.  We had to find a, a landlord that would accept them.  At, at that time they were giving vouchers, and the landlord would say. "We don't want no--we want cash."  And so, also it was a time when there was a lot of corruption.  Some investigators were found guilty of taking bribes from the clients or taking their client's money and using it for themselves.  And they had what they called special investigators.  But what happened, I worked at Williamsbridge [sic. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York], you know, the Jewish area.  I don't know if you know it, Debevoise Street, Scone [ph.] Street; I worked there.  And my caseload had been given to me by a Polish girl.  She hadn't qualified.  In other words, they were now demanding college graduation.  And I might say, in order to get this job, I had to have reference certifying I had done social work.  So who gave me a reference?  Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] (laughter).  I said, "Adam, I, I can't get this job because I can't swear I've been working as a social."  He said, "Don't worry about it, Elyse [HistoryMaker Elyse White]; I'll take care of it."  He wrote me a letter, and he said I had worked in his church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] as a social worker.  And he did that for so many people, they said the ratio had really been determined, was like one on one (laughter).  But Adam was a very--it was about this time that he began to fight for jobs for black people.  I remember he instituted a bus strike.  In other words, he ordered us not to ride the buses until they hired black drivers or black workers.
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker] John Matthews?
Speaker 2: John Matthews?
Speaker 1: Mr. Matthews?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The name doesn't ring a bell.
Speaker 1: But he worked on that campaign also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he did?
Speaker 1: So ahead.  But to get--
Speaker 2: With Adam?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, to, to get black drivers.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess Adam was not alone.  But he preached, from the pulpit, he preached civil disobedience.  And he was like a forerunner of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I guess.  He--
Speaker 1: Did you participate?  Did you not ride the bus?
Speaker 2: I didn't ride.  And there was a white girl who was cripple.  She walked with crutches, and we said--I don't remember her name--but say, "Of course, you're going to--."  She said, "Do you think I would ride the buses and you all are--."  She, "I'm gonna walk right along with you," and she did (laughter).  And eventually--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Eventually, they broke the back of the segregated buses, and they--Adam was allowed to recommend people for the job.  We had one guy who was Joe Bachelor [ph.].  Joe was so clever, he had built his own plane.  And so Adam said, "Surely this man is qualified to work on repairing buses, since he has built his own airplane?"  And they really, they accepted some of the people whom Adam recommended.  This was also a time of Father Divine [Reverend Major Jealous Divine].  You've heard of him?  "Peace is truly wonderful."  Well, Father Divine created kingdoms, and he also served discounted meals.  For eleven cents you could get a whole lunch.
Story_ID: 372936
Speaker 1: You're going to just complete the story you were telling me about your days as a social worker in Williamsburg, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, I was assigned to a territory in Brooklyn known as Williamsburg.  And I did not have any black people on my caseload, which is a surprise to many people, because they thought that blacks were the primary recipients of, of welfare.  I had Polish; I had Italian; I had Jewish; and I, I think I had may, out of seventy-five, I might have had one black family.  But among other people, I had a Mr. Newman [ph.], and Mr. Newman looked very able bodied to me.  So I said, "Mr. Newman, why aren't you working?"  And he grumbled and mumbled something.  So I said well, "I'm gonna close your case because I think you are able to work, and you are unlawfully on welfare."  So I closed his case, and all hell broke loose (laughter).  I think Mr. Newman was with Murder, Incorporated [Murder, Inc.] and politically well-connected.  And then the supervisor came to me, and she was trembling; she was white and trembling, and she said, "Oh, you shouldn't have closed his case."  And so the--I think the political group demanded that I be fired, so temporarily she let me go [from the City of New York Department of Welfare; City of New York Department of Social Services].  But they investigated, and they found that I had not accepted bribes, and therefore they had to reinstate me.  But anyway, it was--and so later someone told me, another supervisor who inherited my caseload, she said, "You know you were servicing Murder, Incorporated (laughter), and the man whose case you closed was a member."  See, they would get on welfare to substantiate their way of live, living, that they were all, that they were indigents, blah, blah, blah.
Story_ID: 372937
Speaker 1: So, what were you doing at this time for entertainment?  You were working (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --with the WPA [Works Progress Administration].
Speaker 2: --for entertainment.  Well, my friend and I lived in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].  And we were rather shy and reticent, so we, we didn't do very much of anything.  It was just exciting to live in the Village.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever go up to Harlem [New York, New York] to the Apollo [Apollo Theater], to any--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My sister--
Speaker 1: --to the Cotton Club [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to go to the Apollo--I mean to the Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York] for our sorority, we'd have different affairs there, dances and whatnot, so we had entertainment.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go to the theater?  Did you see Paul Robeson?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we went the Apollo, and I saw some famous shows.  They had the Jewel, Jewel Box [Jewel Box Revue], which was the gay, a group of gays who presented a, a chorus, and they were very talented.  And I saw--what's his name--Satchmo [Louis Armstrong].  It was a time of the World's Fair [New York World's Fair, New York, New York] also.  And they had a production of 'Carmen' called 'Carmen Jones.'  And he played the part of--what's the guy's name that was the le- leader in, in 'Carmen Jones'?  Satchmo, he wasn't, he was not--he was famous then, but he was, you know, just trying to make it.  He hadn't gained fame like he has today.
Speaker 1: When did you see the 'Shuffle Along'?  Did you see--
Speaker 2: Oh, I saw--that, that was in Washington, D.C (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eubie Blake and Sissle [Noble Sissle] and Blake.  And that was, actually, that was while I lived in Washington [D.C.].  I had a cousin who worked at the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.], and he would let us in for nothing.  And so I saw that show about five times, but I loved every minute of it.  Doris Rubottom was one of the singers.  But they had real funny slapstick comedy, and they had vaudeville.  They had showgirls, chorus lines, you know.  It was so different then because I guess they were underpaid, but they were very entertaining.  I loved it (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about Rose, Rose McClendon?
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: Rose McClendon, the actress.
Speaker 2: I've heard of her.  I mean I, I did knew her, but I didn't know her personally.  Yeah, she was a great actress, yeah, Rose McClendon and who else?  (Unclear)--a lot of famous--
Speaker 1: Noble Sissle and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Eubie Blake, and--
Speaker 2: And I saw most of the--Cab Calloway, of course, and all of the--actually, I saw Cab Calloway while I lived in, in Washington.  He used to come in his, "Hi de hi de hi."  He was very popular.
Story_ID: 372938
Speaker 1: Moving on to your, in your professional life.  When you left the, the WPA [Works Progress Administration], or you--what, where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Well, from the WP--from the social investigator, I then went into, I became a medical social worker.  In other words, with the qualifications that I had obtained as a social worker, I was eligible to become a medical social worker in the department of welfare [City of New York Department of Welfare; City of New York Department of Social Services].  And then from the medical social work, I became an attendance--I became qualified to move on to the board of education [New York City Department of Education] as an attendance teacher, which was a step up, because we had the hours of the teachers, you know, nine to three.  We had the summers off, and so, and that was a step- (unclear) an advance, an advance step for me.
Speaker 1: Now, did you want to continue to teach, or you had no desire to teach anymore?
Speaker 2: Well, I did some sub work, but mostly as an attendance teacher.  We were what used to be called truant officers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: And we went to the homes of children to find out why they didn't go to school.  And actually, it was an eye-opening experience for me.  I found a mother who really had murdered her child.  And I turned it over to the police department.  They found the child's body in Alpine, New Jersey, and identified him by his shoes.  My neighbor had--Cora Water [ph.]--had given me a pair of her son's shoes, and they identified him by the shoes and other, and evidence.  They claimed he had wandered away, and they didn't know where he was, the mother.  But his, the little sister, said, "My mother beat David [ph.], and he lay in the bed, and he couldn't move."  So what I figured is she and her boyfriend beat David to death, and they took the body and dumped it in the scout camp in Alpine, New Jersey.  And I--there was big headlines in the Daily News [New York Daily News].  And they, of course, had come to our office to find out the facts, but my supervisor wouldn't allow me to talk to the reporters.  So that remained an unsolved case, 'cause who was pressing for a little kid, for who killed a little kid.  Who cared?  Nobody cared.  Society, you know, things like that happened every day.
Speaker 1: So no--his mother was never, was never prosecuted for--
Speaker 2: An interesting after--I, I, I had the case in court.  We had the power to bring it, so I brought the case of the remaining children.  And the oldest child was beginning to show the same truancy that the--and it came before Justine Wise Polier, you know, Rabbi Wise's [Stephen Samuel Wise] daughter.  She was the judge, and she says--and this mother, of course, she was a superb actress.  She cried: I warned her (unclear) so Justice Wise says, "I'm going to dismiss this case because I think this mother is going to, to do the right--."  I said, "Just a minute, Judge Polier.  This is the same mother whose child, David Erizarie [ph.], disappeared, and they found his body."  She said, "Oh yes?"  So she said, "No, on second thought, I'll continue the case."  But they never prosecuted that mother.  What can you do?  Nothing at all (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 372939
Speaker 1: So were there any other incidents like that, that stands out for you during your time as a social worker?
Speaker 2: As a social worker, well--
Speaker 1: An investigator [for the Works Progress Administration]?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Or truant officer [for New York City Department of Education], during all that time?
Speaker 2: Truant officer, well--
Speaker 1: I mean during that time you, is when you met your husband [Clarence White] also.
Speaker 2: I met my husband--I didn't meet him.  He was a Washingtonian, so actually, he was a classmate of my older sister.  But, you know, how he became interested in me, I was dating--I was engaged to a guy, who was Dr. Shelby [ph.].  He was a pharmaceutical student.  And I had an engagement ring and everything.  But we took a trip to New York [New York].  His mother--but he was--if ever there was a case of--what do you call that, incest? This mother, she said, "Whoever marries my son will have to share him with me."  So when we came back of home at Baltimore [Maryland], I insisted on jumping out of the car because I'd had too much of this unhealthy relationship (laughter).  So, of course, he was staying--they was staying with my future father-in-law, who had a big house in Washington [D.C.].  Mr. White had a, like a rooming house where he kept Howard University [Washington, D.C.] students.  So Shelby was living there with my future father-in-law.  And he said about my husband--my future husband says, "I became very much interested in this girl who was so feisty (laughter)."  He said, "I wanted to meet her."  So that's what hap- how we--he became interested in me, and we got married in 1936.  And he was, he subsequently got a job with Mary McLeod Bethune, Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  He worked in Florida and I remained in New York [New York] and, because by that time my son [Charles White] was born.  And I--
Speaker 1: When was your son born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-seven [1937].  And so I was living in the Dunbar [Dunbar Apartments, New York, New York] with my sister, and my husband was teaching in Bethune-Cookman.
Story_ID: 372940
Speaker 1: How would you describe New York [New York] at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, we were just coming out of the Depression [Great Depression].  It was 1937, and of course, Germany declared war in '39 [1939].  And I think it was an exciting time.  As I say, we found plenty of entertainment.  The fraternities gave dances, and at those dances they would bring food, and you'd really enjoy yourself.
Speaker 1: When did you meet Thurgood Marshall?  Was that when you were in--
Speaker 2: Thurgood lived right here in this development [Dunbar Apartments, New York, New York].  So I, I knew of him, but I knew him and his wife very well when they lived here.  We were friends.  And he would come from his excursions to South to fight for his cases.  And he would just barely be able to drag one foot.  I said, "Thurgood, you're working too hard."  He said, "Well, Elyse [HistoryMaker Elyse White], somebody has to do it.  And if anybody is gonna--we'll, we'll do it; we'll get it, we'll get the job done."  And Sissy [Cecilia Suyat Marshall], of course, was his secretary, and he said, "I, I think I'm gonna marry Sissy because she's at my house more than she's at her house," (laughter).  And of course, at that time my son [Charles White] had a little problem at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  New Year's Eve they were out.  He was an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], and they were out celebrating.  And so he was arrested because they ordered them to go home, and he says, "I'm not doing anything.  Why should I go home?"  So they arrested him and put him in jail.  And when I found out, I talked to Thurgood about it.  And he told me his partner, who to call and, because I didn't want that on his record.  He was graduating from Howard, and you know, when you apply for a job, they ask you have you ever been in jail.  And so, Thurgood said, "We'll see that it's taken off his records."  And so my son, we set it all up, and that rascal said, "Mama, I was in the middle of my finals.  I wasn't gonna go down for (laughter) that."  So that, that stood against him.  He was released after three days I think.
Story_ID: 372941
Speaker 1: Did you ever run into any problems with the police or any problems, racial attitude problems, during--from this time up through the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was a very good, law-abiding (laughter) citizen.
Speaker 1: Did you ever participate in any of the--because you're from Virginia.  Did you ever participate in any of the rallies that were taking place in the South in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, most that I did, I protested the nuclear submarine at Groton, Connecticut.  That was--I was a member of Riverside Church [New York, New York], and we would, we organized a patrol that went up, and many of our group were arrested, and you know, for that demonstration.  But Rosalynn [Rosalynn Carter] broke that bottle of champagne over the Nautilus [U.S.S. Nautilus] in spite of us (laughter), and that was that.  But I was about--what was that--
Story_ID: 372942
Speaker 1: What made you decide to leave this, the board, the board of education [New York City Department of Education]?
Speaker 2: Well, I retired from the board of education.
Speaker 1: What made you decide to retire?
Speaker 2: To retire?
Speaker 1: You'd just--
Speaker 2: Well, I was--
Speaker 1: --done your time, and you wanted to move on to something else?
Speaker 2: No, my--I wanted to start traveling (laughter), and that's what I did.  My sisters had, had bought me a ticket on the Ile de France [SS Ile de France] to go to Europe.  And she said, "You have to retire."  I said, "Okay," so I retired.  I was retirement age, sixty-two.  And I, we took our first trip to Europe on the Ile de France.  It was great.
Speaker 1: And that was the trip you took with your sister [Evelyn Woods] when you, you went to how many countries, and you'd spent three or four--
Speaker 2: And that's the--
Speaker 1: --days in each?
Speaker 2: That's the ticket there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in 1972.  I was, I became a travel agent.  I was all, also, actually--what you call them-a, outside agents.  You sign up with an agency, and when you have clients, you take them to the agency.  They book their trip through you, and you get a small commission.  So I became, I came in like at the back door (laughter).  And so I said I'm gonna make--I told my sister, I said, "I'm gonna make you a travel agent so you can travel."  We, you know, you get a discount.  So, she had been a teacher, and so she had retired a little bit earlier.  So, I initiated her into being a travel agent.  And so we went around the world, and we visited I think it was ten countries and in thirty days.  We left from New York [New York], Thanksgiving eve, November 25th, and returned to the shores of the U.S. in, in, in Honolulu [Hawaii], which is U.S., in, in, Christmas, two, a few days before Christmas.  That's the first time I heard the--(unclear)--I mean the, a minister bring in the New Year in Tagalog (laughter).
Story_ID: 372943
Speaker 1: So, but, just to go back to your--you went back to school in the 1940s, to Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Well, from time to time I took graduate courses, University of--oh yes, my husband [Clarence White] was teaching at Hampton, Virginia.  And my son [Clarence White] had asthma.  It's a very damp climate there, so much so that, you know--(unclear)--burst from the dampness.  And so the doctor recommended a dry climate, and we decided to go to Arizona.  And we lived in Arizona for about three years, and he did improve; my son did improve there.  But while we were, while we were in Arizona, a woman stole my husband (laughter).  And so, so my husband met this woman, this white faculty member in Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  She, you know, they see a nice clean-cut white man--black man--and they, they figure he's up for grabs (laughter).  So she--he asked for a divorce, and we were divorced in about, let's see, about 1942 I guess it was.
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you divorced and you're, you are--
Speaker 2: After I divorced--
Speaker 1: --single parent?
Speaker 2: --I returned to New York [New York] and reentered the welfare de--reentered the social work field.
Story_ID: 372944
Speaker 1: And that's, is that when you worked at Lincoln Hospital [Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Bronx, New York] and Fordham [Fordham Hospital, Bronx, New York]?
Speaker 2: That's when I worked at Lincoln Hospital--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do at those particular hospitals?
Speaker 2: I was what they called a medical social worker.  You're like the doctors.  They would, "They'd say what are you, a nurse?"  They can never (laughter)--the role of the social worker is very unclear, but you solve problems from patients who have to go home.  And you find out do they have someone at home to take care of them, and, or do they need welfare or that sort of thing, you know.  You have any contact from the social worker?
Speaker 1: I have.
Speaker 2: I guess so you know a little bit--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --about that job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a tough job.
Speaker 2: Un-huh, a tough job, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that--
Speaker 2: Ill pays (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's a good--yep, but they help a lot of people.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So when you started to work at, at the hospital, Fordham Hospital, there's another hospital in the area at the time that I remember them opening.  David Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] was a part of the opening.  Maybe it was a cancer center or something that was really big here.  I can't remember the name.  [HistoryMaker] John Matthews talked about it.  Do you remember the name Neculai [Neculai Burghelea]?  No.  It was a big hospital opening here in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: In Harlem?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  North General [North General Hospital, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Was it North General and--
Speaker 1: North General, yes.  Yes, I don't know much about that hospital.  I've been there, and it seems to be, you know, an efficient facility.
Speaker 2: Did you consider yourself a, an activist in Harlem?  Did you consider the work you were doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I do.
Speaker 2: --to be that of an activist?
Speaker 1: I, I, I think I am.
Story_ID: 372945
Speaker 1: Well, what I, what I consider my achievement is introducing people to travel, black people to travel.  I've taken groups to Africa, to Hawaii, to Mexico.  And for many blacks, it was their first travel experience.  I've also brought people into the industry.  I can name about five people who became travel agents through my intervention, because I could see that they--they were my best customers, but they also had a propensity for--they belonged to churches, where people want to travel.  And so I--that is not a role that you get a lot of credit for, but I've taken a lot of people on their first trip to Africa.  In fact, my cousin, Rita Lewis [ph.], she was the wife of Norman Lewis.  She--I'm just reading a card, and she said, "Elyse [HistoryMaker Elyse White], you took me on my first trip to Europe, and I've been traveling ever since."  So I consider that an achievement.
Speaker 2: Where do you think that desire came from, to introduce travel to--
Speaker 1: Well, my mother [Julia Johnson Woods], she was a teacher, and she attended the Jamestown Exposition [Norfolk, Virginia] (laughter), which was about 1902 or something [sic. 1907].  I know I remember she said my oldest brother [William Woods, Jr.], she had him in her arms when she went.  She also went to the Chicago exposition, which was around nineteen-o--I don't know the date.  But she was thrown off the train, she and her fellow teacher, they, because they were black.  And she sued the train, and she got about a hundred or a couple of hundred (laughter)--so I say I got it from her.  She just loved to travel, and she loved to take us on train trips and wherever.
Speaker 2: So do you consider that first trip you took with your sister [Evelyn Woods] to, to be the trip that started it off for you?
Speaker 1: I think that started it off.  I got the travel bug from--
Speaker 2: So why did Africa become such an interesting place--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --for you?
Speaker 1: --I'll tell you, people that I was associated with wanted to go to Africa, and I said--and they asked me would I set up some trips to Africa.  And so in 1975, I met a man who was organizing the Africa Travel Association.  At that time, I was organizing a trip to Africa.  And he said, "Why not join us?" And I did.  And I traveled with that organization.  Every, every year they would meet in a different African country and have a conference there.  And their aim was to bring more tourists to Africa, because Africa is greatly under-visited compared to Europe and the Caribbean and other countries.  But now--so they were trying to encourage people to go to Africa and to show them that it's a delightful country.  It has many virtues.
Speaker 2: When did you become a member of the, the travel bureau, the travel--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Africa Travel Association--
Speaker 2: Are you a founder?
Speaker 1: --in 1975.
Speaker 2: In '75 [1975].  Were you the founder of the organization?
Speaker 1: I worked with the founder, and we, together, we founded it, yes.
Speaker 2: And who is the founder?  What's the founder's name?
Speaker 1: Vidoc-  Murray Vidockler.  He was the, he was a man who was active with the British--not British--British-Ameri- but British Airways.  And so he had long had this dream of forming a group that would encourage people to go to Africa.  And so I became a, a founding member.  And we, I, I visited Africa for twenty-six years.  After that, I visited Africa with the Africa Travel Association.
Story_ID: 372946
Speaker 1: So you've been to a number of the countries in Africa.
Speaker 2: I've been to twenty-six African countries.
Speaker 1: Which ones stand out for you?  Which--
Speaker 2: Kenya I think is the outstanding country, Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] country (laughter).
Speaker 1: What makes it outstanding?
Speaker 2: Well, it has a lovely climate.  And the British left many amenities there, you know, housing and so forth that still remain there.  And so, and you can live--I could live in Kenya.
Speaker 1: What do you--what, when you look back over, like, the different sectors you've been involved with, what are the, some of the things you're most proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll say I'm proud of taking people to Africa and introducing them to the continent for the first time.  I'm proud of, of having them travel for the first time out of the, for the first time out of the country.
Speaker 1: What have been like in--within that, what were the struggles?  What were the challenges in taking people?  And we're, we're gonna pick that up on the next tape.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I want to talk about some of the challenges you had to--
Speaker 2: To face.
Speaker 1: --overcome.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 372947
Speaker 1: First we're going to talk about the challenges of taking, the challenges in doing the work whereas you're taking people to Africa--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and countries, the countries in Africa for the first time.
Speaker 2: Well, as you know, Africa is not Paris [France]; it's not London [England], so you don't run into up-to-date modern hotels.  You have hotels that claim to be modern, but many times the plumbing is faulty or whatever, so that I used to make people sign a manifesto.  They called it Elyse's [HistoryMaker Elyse White] manifesto.  And it read: "I have--I know that in visiting Africa, that many times the hotels that are deemed five-star do not come up to standard.  The plumbing is faulty, and the travel is unreliable at times, but if you roll with the punches, you'll have a wonderful time.  And I, and my signature affirms that I have read this," (laughter).
Story_ID: 372948
Speaker 1: You were saying before that, or we talked, that maybe we lost more than we gained during integration. And you said racism was alive and well today, and you were going to give me an example.
Speaker 2: Well, I think people helped, helped each other, you know, more so.  And actually, jobs (unclear) certain jobs that were seg- separated for blacks that they, they were guaranteed a job, teaching jobs.  And with integration they had to compete with all nationalities for those same jobs.  But I don't think I would want to go back to separation because I think it was a great step forward for being (unclear) for, for being integrated.  It was a great step forward.  Of course, the statistics show that segregation is even more pronounced in some areas than before Brown vs. the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  And that is because the residential pat- patterns.  For instance, you go into any school in Harlem [New York, New York] now, and you don't--you'll see 95 percent blacks because that's the way people live.  And until this country really addresses full force the problem of integration, integrated neighborhoods, integrated jobs, then we'll continue to have these problems.
Story_ID: 372949
Speaker 1: Well, you've lived long enough to see a lot of things change and a lot of things perhaps not change.  What do you consider to be the greatest changes within the country, given the amount of time you've had to, to live and, and--
Speaker 2: Well, the modern inventions, the Internet (laughter), and the cell phones, and the ray, ray, the radio.
Speaker 1: What about in people's attitudes?  Have people's attitudes changed over the years?
Speaker 2: People's--I, I'll tell you, I'm really disappointed because there's not the closeness between the races.  Even though the barriers have fallen, they still are not those--I had some very close white friends, and now I, I don't think I have any at the moment because it just seemed that the, the, you know, it brought us closer together; adversity brought us closer together.  But now, we don't seem to have occasion to meet white people.  So that, that is when, so that is when I think the government could address this problem and could change it.
Story_ID: 372950
Speaker 1: What do you consider the role of your sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] to be?
Speaker 2: Well, a, a sorority emphasizes high scholarship, and participation, and community activities that benefit the black people.  I mean they are outstanding in judicial positions, school positions, so that they have emphasized high scholarship.  That is the one thing that they have done.  And I think it has been of great benefit to many people in many communities.
Speaker 1: So when you step back even a step further to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], were there professors there that you can remember that stand out for you?
Speaker 2: Well, Professor Julian of course.  You've probably heard or saw Nova.  Well, Dr. Julian [Percy Lavon Julian] was outstanding.  He came from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to Howard.  And of course, what happened at Howard was that he taught a course in organic chemistry, which many aspiring doctors had to have to get into med school.  So he--they accused him of imposing Harvard standards on Howard students, so half the class flunked (laughter).  I took the course with him, and I got a C.  And we, we were at a dance, and he asked me (unclear) he said, "Oh, you were one of my students?"  He says, "I think I gave you an A, didn't I?"  I said, "No, you gave me a C," (laughter).  But I said many of those aspiring med students would have given their eye tooth for that C because--and so, what happened, he was involved with a fellow professor's wife.  He subsequently married her.  And at that time Howard had, like, what they called a purge that kicked him out, that kicked out my English professor, Dr. Lorenzo Turner [Lorenzo Dow Turner].  He was a specialist in, in the Gullah culture.  He had gotten his Ph.D.  And there was Moses Peters, who was in drama.  They accused him of, of being, un- being familiar with one of his students.  They all seemed to be rather trivial.  But anyway, Julian, I, I remember him very well.  He was very debonair and dapper.  But--
Speaker 1: So Julian is someone you remember very well from Howard.  Is there anyone else that's--
Speaker 2: Anyone else (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that may have made contributions--
Speaker 2: --at Howard.
Speaker 1: --to who you later became, that when you look back over your life you say these people--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --contributed to who I am today?
Speaker 2: I was working when I went to Howard, so I had little time to involve in social activities, so that it was almost like a world apart.  I would have liked to have--aside from the sorority, I didn't engage in too many other activities.
Story_ID: 372951
Speaker 1: What do you consider to have been, to be the crowning effort of the work you've done?
Speaker 2: Well, I like to think that my travel, as it has affected other people, has been one of the outstanding phases of my life; introducing people to travel; and travel to Africa, which is used to be called the Dark Continent; and letting people know that it's a very enlightened continent.
Speaker 1: What do you think travel does for people?
Speaker 2: Travel, it broadens their horizons.  It, it, it discourages pettiness, and an--animosity, and racial divides, because you learn that people are the same all over the world and that religions, instead of dividing people, unit people because they all have a common goal, the welfare of its members.
Speaker 1: So you said that you've been almost or at least or over twenty-five countries in Africa.
Speaker 2: Right, African countries.
Speaker 1: African countries.
Speaker 2: And of course, I've been to Fiji, Singapore, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, Alaska.
Speaker 1: So when you were doing all the, this travel, you were usually probably one of the only black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, not, not, not really.  You know, our people have always loved travel.  Black people have--even though there's just a few of them have the means to travel, but whenever they've had it--and many of them have been employed in those areas in foreign countries and where they apply their skills to their problems (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which country were you enstooled queen?
Speaker 2: Ghana (laughter).
Speaker 1: Ghana, and, and--
Speaker 2: There's my stool, and there's a picture of the ceremony.  You see the picture there?
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I, through the African Travel Association, they felt that I was so devoted to Africa and had visited so many African countries that I deserved to be honored by the African countries.  And so Ghana in a, what they call enstooled me as, and I'm Queen Nana Yaa, Nana Yaa Asantewaa.  She was a very brave queen, who braved the wrath of the British by opposing the British domination of Ghana (laughter).  So, so they had an actual ceremony, and they, and she--and swathed my legs in gold and my (unclear) all kind of gold bracelets.  And the chief, several chiefs were present, and they had the handmaidens who danced for me.  So it was very impressive ceremony.
Speaker 1: And that took place in 1998?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When did that take--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --place, 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998], correct.
Story_ID: 372952
Speaker 1: So have you received any other awards that you've been really proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I have--I was a president of the Howard University alum, New York alumni club [Howard University Alumni Club of New York City], and that is a tribute--one of those is the tribute.  And then, of course, riverbank park, where I go twice a week for water aerobics, they named me, Senior On the Move, the outstanding senior on the move.  And they dedicated a whole luncheon to me, and I have pictures of that.  And of course, city council, [HistoryMaker] Bill Perkins (unclear) gave me citation.  And periodically, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] has given me citations for my attaining my--on my ninety-fifth birthday I receive a commendation from Howard and from the city council.  So that's about it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So next year--you were born in 2--you were born in 1908?
Speaker 2: Eight [1908], yeah.
Speaker 1: Next year you'll make a hundred.
Speaker 2: I hope (laughter).
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: If I live right (laughter).
Story_ID: 372953
Speaker 1: So what, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What do you want to be, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say I want to be remembered for having two nice children into the world, my daughter [Carol White]--where are you--and my son [Charles White], he's retired civil engineer in Los Angeles, California; and I have two grandchildren.  And I want to be remembered for travel, for introducing many black people to countries that they never would have gone to otherwise, and showing them the way.
Story_ID: 372954
Speaker 1: What do you--what are your hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: My hope for the black community is that they will become a part of the American dream, much more so than they are now.  For instance, Wall Street, you know, where millions are traded, billions.  So, how many blacks do you have involved (laughter) in that process?  We are nickel and diming it, but they are pulling deal, merger, and, and buyouts of billions of dollars.  So that's what I hope, that they will become a part of the larger scene and be, become truly American, you know.  Right now they're on the fringes.  Do you agree with me?
Speaker 1: I agree with you.  I agree with--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So do you feel we have a long way to go still, or we've made--
Speaker 2: I think we--
Speaker 1: --a lot of progress?
Speaker 2: --I think we are getting there.  I think we're getting there, but we have to rid ourselves of some of the old shibboleths.  I think the churches, who are a very strong influence on blacks, need to modernize and restructure instead of preaching so much gospel.  They need to preach economics (laughter).  Am I right?  They need to preach the power of the dollar, and organize buying clubs, and, and buy a million-dollar building.  I was reading in The Wall Street Journal that they're--this developer is going to turn Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, New York, New York] into condos.  And so that, are we a part of it?  Maybe we are, but I doubt it.  But I'd like to see black people become involved in, in the real business of America.
Story_ID: 372955
Speaker 1: Are there still places left that you want to travel to?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to go to the Congo when it becomes a little more--I've, I've been there, but just to say I've touched down there.  But I haven't; but I'd like to go there once it's--because it's a rich country, you know, in metals.  And what I'd like to see is Af- for Africa, I'd like to see them get their share of the material wealth that is theirs instead of being exploited by greedy rulers, who use the money to buy more Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] and build bigger palaces.  I'd like to see them use that money to benefit their populations.  And that it seems not to be a, a goal right now.  Like, there, if they all (unclear) who is it?  The president of Sierra Leone, he had five palaces and ten cars, and that, that's so unfair.
Story_ID: 372956
Speaker 1: So when you look at the state of, of black America today, like the state of it, what contributions do you think you've made to make it a better place?
Speaker 2: I think that I have--well, as I say, I've reared two children [Charles White and Carol White], and I've taken part in community activities and tried to improve the lot of people that I come in contact with, offering them help.  And that's about it.
Story_ID: 372957
Speaker 1: The last thing I want to talk about is the Big Apple Greater Hospitality Association [sic. Big Apple Greeter, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: The Big Apple Greater Hospital Association [sic. Big Apple Greeter, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you're working with now.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was--I'm not with them anymore.  I retired because it required physical exertion to take people.  I took people through Harlem [New York, New York], and they like--they used me for French-speaking guests who didn't speak English because I speak French.  And I would take them through Harlem, and they were delighted.  I have so many letters of appreciation: "Thank you for the wonderful day that we spent in Harlem."
Speaker 1: When you take people through Harlem, what aspects of Harlem do you point out?
Speaker 2: Well, we usually start out at 125th Street.  And I, and first I point out the corner of--in front of the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York], where Castro [Fidel Castro] met Khrushchev [Nikita Khrushchev].  Just, Castro was here, and Khrushchev made his famous speech where he slammed his shoe on the podium of the United Nations [UN].  And I said how Castro expected the black people to rally to the side of Communism and that, that he was very surprised that they just looked on in curiosity (laughter) and never blinked an eye.  So that is one part of the Big Apple Greeter.  And I would take them to the Schomburg collection [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  Many of the French people were surprised to know that some of the French, the black French artists had paintings in the Schomburg commission.  And that, that gave them a new idea about blacks.
Speaker 1: So you've done a lot for the community, and--
Speaker 2: I could have done more, but I've done my best.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorite people to work with here in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Well, Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] was.  Well, I love that man because he was so human, had so many human faults.  But he still (laughter), he still was my hero because he was fearless, and he was, he did a lot in [U.S.] Congress.  He respected that he was respected in Congress because of his ability.  He was a shrewd statesman, and we need more people like him.  I think Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] is going to have it--he has this commanding role as head of the ways and means committee [U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means].
Speaker 1: You stay up on your politics.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), I have to be.

Speaker 1: I didn't even have time to tell you when I was arrested in Tunis [Tunisia].
Speaker 2: Oh, well, tell me now.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You were arrested?
Speaker 1: I was with a group that went to Tunis.  We were invited.  I was a member of the American Society of Travel Agents, and they offered us a trip to Tunis.  And so when we came back to the capital of Tunisia, we stayed at this hotel.  And I had taken some pictures.  Roman Polanski had, was making the film called 'The Pirate' [sic. 'Pirates'] and they had recreated the pirate ship.  And so I took some fantastic pictures, but I ran out of film so I went outside in the street to get more film.  And I asked several people where I could buy more film.  I point to my camera, you know, and because they speak Arabic, and I, I speak French, and some of them don't speak French.  But suddenly this man comes up, and he says--very rudely, he grabbed my camera, and he said, "Give me that camera."  I said, "No, it's mine."  And he said--so finally, I realized he was police.  And he says, "You have to go with me to the station house."  And he says, "I have a vehicle for you."  And he had this cage, you know, like for parade animals (laughter).  He said, "Get in."  I said, "Je refuse, je demande votre un civil, I demand a civilian, votre."  And so he brought a, a car and took me to the station house, and he took my, took my film, ripped it right out of the camera.  He said, "We'll have this developed now."  You know that once it's ripped out, it's not--and so, he said at least I got my camera back (laughter).  So I figured I was go, a goner.  They keep these people forever.  I said well now, he'll (unclear) me in the states, and somebody might come to my rescue.  But they kept me, and they said, "Where is your passport?"  And I had come out of the hotel with nothing.  I said I don't have it.  It's back at the hotel.  So finally, they (unclear) they realized this is just a little old lady in dirty sneakers (laughter) and not a spy.  But what had happened, the Israelis had dropped a bomb in Tunis, trying to kill Yasser Arafat because he had set up his headquarters in, in Tunis, and they feared I was a spy (laughter).  But anyway, he finally let me go, just as my group is pulling out for the airport. I said, "Hey, wait for me!"  So the guy said, "What happened?"  I told him.  He says, "Wait 'til they see those gun emplacements that you took pictures of," (laughter).  So it turned out to be a fun thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a good story. How much time do we have left on this tape?
