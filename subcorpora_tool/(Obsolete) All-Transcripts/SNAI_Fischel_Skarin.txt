Denhard:

This is Alice Denhard, and I'm interviewing Miriam Krock
Skarin and Eleanor Peterson Fischel, from the class of 1948, on
April 30, the day of the annual nurses' alumni luncheon. I'm
just going to be asking you questions about your nursing
experience and training. Why did you decide to became nurses?

Skarin:

I'd been wanting to be a nurse since I was about in the
fifth grade. I had a cousin who was a nurse, and she did some
very dramatic things, and I idolized her. That really was my
focus from about the fifth grade on.

Denhard:

Eleanor, how about you?

Fischel:

I didn't have anybody in particular that influenced me, but
it was something that I wanted to do ever since I was probably
about in the eighth grade or the first part of high school.

Denhard:

Why did you decide to come to Stanford?

Skarin:

Well, you want me to be perfectly frank?

Denhard:

Yes.

Skarin:

All right. It was the time of the war and the cadet nurse
corps, and when I found out that I could go to any nursing
school, I said, "Shoot for the top."

Denhard:

Good for you.

Skarin:

And so I went to the best school I could find. I applied to
the best school I could find, and was accepted. And I never
regretted it. The cadet corps was a wonderful thing for
students. It would be great for today.

Fischel:

I was in a nursing program at UC Berkeley, and I applied to
both UC Berkeley and to Stanford, because I felt that those were
the two top ones, and the one that first accepted iny application
was Stanford, so that's where I came. [Laughter]

Denhard:

They won the prize. Great. Where did you each have your
pre-nursing experience?

Skarin:

I had started at Santa Ana Junior College for the first
year, then, because of a move in the family, Salinas Junior
College. Then I had to make up some units in social science, so
I had to go to San Jose State summer school.

Denhard:

You just had to work a little harder.

Fischel:

I went three years to UC Berkeley for my pre-nursing.

Denhard:

Oh, that was a long time, then. You had a long time . . .

Fischel:

Well, that's when they went to school all year round, so I
went six semesters straight through.

Denhard:

Do you remember your first days in the nursing school, when
you first came to 2340 Clay? What did you think of 2340 Clay?

Skarin:

Well, it was awesome. I was really awed by it all. To be
in the big city—I was a small town girl—to be in the big city
and to be in this big place, this big hospital. I was just awed,
I was really awed and I felt, "I'm not sure I'm going to fit."

Fischel:

I can't remember. I had been over in Berkeley going to
school and had several interviews over at Stanford. I knew one
other girl, Barbara Schary, who had been in the nursing program
at Berkeley in the same classes that I was. But other than that
I didn't know anybody, and I can't remember a lot of details the
first few days.

3

Denhard:

Do you remember meeting your classmates?

Skarin:

I remember the very first day, standing in the lobby, not
knowing what to do or where to go. Wahneeta Hayes and Eleanor
Kruth and Naomi Thorson were all together from the San Joaquin
Valley, and they saw this poor lost person, and they took me
under their wing. Their influence has been very great in my
life, just for a lot of reasons, but they were the first real
contacts that I had. They gave me some sense of security, which
I needed greatly at that point.

Fischel:

I can't even remember who I first met. I met Millie Dye
Howard, who was my roommate and has been my friend all through
these years, and Ann Shick Delehanty. Those were the first two
people, I think, that I met. But other than that, I can't
remember.

Denhard:

Well, it's kind of a long time ago.

Fischel:

It is. A lot of water's gone under the bridge.

Denhard:

Do you remember who was dean when you entered, who was the
director of nursing?

Skarin:

Sally Heitman.

Denhard:

She was acting Dean. Miss Pohe had left and Sally was
acting Dean. Pohe, F-O-H-E.

Fischel:
Denhard:

No, I don't remember her at all.
So she had left. I think she joined the cadet corps to be
in administration there.

Fischel:

Yes, Sally Heitman was acting Dean, a delightful person.

Denhard:

Do you remember your teachers, your faculty in the school?

Fischel:

Mrs. Eriksen, who could forget her?

4

Skarin:

Lawrence, Bessie Lawrence.

Fischel:

Bessie Lawrence.

Skarin:

Ritter, Miss Ritter.

Denhard:

Madeline Ritter.

Fischel:

Alice Denhard, I remember.

Denhard:

No, I wasn't there.

Skarin:

Dorothy Anderson took her place, did she not?

Fischel:

You were head nurse, I guess.

Denhard:

I was head nurse. I could have been.

Fischel:

OB?

Denhard:

OB. Lane maternity

Skarin:

Sally . . .

Fischel:

Burbank.

Denhard:

She was a probie pusher.

Fischel:

Julie Higgins and June Bengston were our probie pushers. I
can remember them. I was trying to think of the head nurse on
first east. She was a Stanford graduate. Tall, attractive,
grey-haired woman, she wore glasses.

Fischel:

Ann Shick and I did our first rotation after probie on 2nd
west.

Denhard:

That must have been an experience.

Fischel:

I think they were trying to test us. [Laughter]

Denhard:

You survived.

Fischel:

Yes, we did. We survived very well.

Denhard:

Where did you go right after probie?

Skarin:

Women's medical.

Denhard:

That's a little safer.

5

Skarin:

Who was the head nurse in men's medical?

Fischel:

Jane Knox.

Skarin:

That's who I was trying to think of, yes, Jane Knox.

Denhard:

She's about to retire; she was associate dean of the school
of nursing at Pittsburgh.

Skarin:

I can see her in that position.

Fischel:

Jean Green Arnstein[?] was on women's medical.

Denhard:

What historic events occurred while you were in nursing
school? Well, it was primarily the end of World War Two.

Skarin:

V-J Day was in August, which was just before we went in.
And the United Nations was down at the Mark Hopkins Hotel.

Denhard:

Oh, how great!

Skarin:

That was exciting.

Denhard:

That must have been exciting. I'd forgotten all about that.

Skarin:

People from all over the world were there.

Fischel:

Roosevelt had just died the April before, April of '45?

Fischel:

And Harry Truman was just . . . . I remember I voted for
the first time when I was at Stanford.

Skarin:
Fischel:

Wilkie, I voted when he was running.
And everybody I voted for, for about the first twenty years,
lost. [Laughter]

Denhard:

I'd forgotten all about the UN. That was the initiation.
It was starting.

Skarin:

It was conceived at that time.

Fischel:

It was big-time.

Denhard:

Do you have any special funny memories that you remember
about your training days?

Skarin:

Well, the things I seem to remember are not that funny, just
disastrous. I just remember things that other people did, I
don't remember ray disasters. I wouldn't remember mine, except
that I gave somebody yesterday's dose of phenobarbital today. I
felt like I should quit nursing because I was not capable of
being responsible.

Fischel:

Hew dreadful.

Skarin:

Oh, I felt terrible. It was an unusual occurrence, a slip
up and all that stuff.

Denhard:

Yes, they put you through the ringer whenever you made a
mistake.

Fischel:

I have thought so many times. Millie Dye Howard was working
seven to eleven, and you know those breaks we had. She came
running up to me at lunch, and she said, "Ellie, I've just made
the most awful mistake." "What is it?" She said, "I gave a
person ten grains of aspirin instead of five." And I have
thought about that so many times.

Denhard:

But that was how you were trained.

Fischel:

I know.

Denhard:
Fischel:

Medications, you did precisely what was taught.
Now Mrs. Eriksen, that was one thing that she was so
emphatic about. If you have any question you get somebody to
help you.

Skarin:

Well, this doesn't directly relate to nursing, but the
nursing school, the nurses residence. Somewhere toward the last
of our time the doctors, the interns, residents had their
graduation party, and I was living on the fifth floor and had my

dry rack out in the hallway with my laundry on it. I came off
duty, I think I worked three to eleven, and all my white clothes
had brown spots on them. There was a strange smell in the hall.
My friend Muriel Whitaker was across the way and I went over
there, and she came out and she said, "Yes, I smell it, what is
it?" And we listened and we could hear some noise, we could hear
some men's voices, fifth floor. And men didn't get above first
floor, no way.
Fischel:

No way.

Skarin:

We were afraid to use the elevator, so we went down the
stairs, and we could hear these voices. There were two sets of
stairs, one on either side. We went down the north one, they
were on the south one. And we went down, and we went through the
tunnel, and we went over to tell Miss Sikes, who was then
night-duty, "There are men over there!" and she came back. It
turned out, it was a bunch of residents.

Denhard:

Dr. Second?

Skarin:

And another good solid family man. They were drunk, and
they had taken whisky and just spread it all over the nurses'
residence, and anybody that had clothes drying . . . [Laughter]

Fischel:

Oh, that's such a cute story, I hadn't heard that at all.

Skarin:

Oh, and Miss Sikes, you know how very prim she is. And she
just came like a jet.

Denhard:

Did she find them?

Skarin:

I don't know. She didn't find them at that time, but by the
next morning, it was known.

Denhard:

Oh, that's a cute story. That's great.

8

Skarin:

We were really scared.

Denhard:

I wonder hew they ever got up there?

Skarin:

They might have come across the tunnel.

Fischel:

That's the only possible way.

Skarin:

I can't remember new what protection we had against it.

Fischel:

Oh, didn't you have to ring a buzzer?

Denhard:

Yes, you had to ring a buzzer.

Fischel:

Don't you remember coming in from dates and stuff, you'd
have to ring that buzzer? It was an operation.

Skarin:

That's right. I'd forgotten about that. Oh, and another
thing about the nurses' residence and the dieticians. Muriel
Whitaker's sister was a dietician—I feel like I shouldn't be
telling this to you.

Denhard:

Yes, by all means. [Laughter] This is the fun part of it.

Skarin:

We used to go over to the dietician's room and, you know,
near there was a physicians' dining room and the dietician's
residence. So we'd go over there to visit the dieticians, and
they would go down and raid the icebox. The food that they had
was leftovers from our dinners. We'd go down there and get fat.
Ice cream and rice pudding, chocolate pudding, all those good
things.

Denhard:

You had a good friend.

Fischel:

I had infectious hepatitis when I was in my second year in
training, and I was hospitalized for about three weeks on
high-protein formulas. My friends were in the diet kitchen at
the time, and I'd get formula colored purple and I'd get all
these little goodies on my trays. The thing is, I think it was

Dr. Northway, who if you were ever hospitalized, you just became
bosom pals, because he came in to see you about four times a day.
Skarin:

The thing that I remember about Dr. Northway was the lecture
that he gave us the very first week that we were in training, the
second day or something like that. The thing I remember most is
"You've got to take time to go to the toilet." [Laughter]
Because once you'd graduated you didn't find time.

Denhard:

It's fun, when you start remember these things you have all
these good memories start floating back to you.

Skarin:

It's just like the doors open up, and then things start to
come out.

Fischel:

We had such a fun class.

Denhard:

It looks like you did.

Fischel:

We actually did.

Skarin:

Oh, I remember something else. There was a time when Dr.
Jan Popper, a musician, would came up from the campus, and he'd
have music appreciation. That was a very precious time.

Fischel:

Right, right.

Denhard:

Oh, lovely.

Fischel:

I remember.

Skarin:

Very well received. Once a month, or something like that.
Many times. Remember that?

Fischel:

I remember these Friday afternoon teas.

Denhard:

Oh, yes.

Fischel:

And who was the housemother?

Denhard:

Alice Fridell. Mrs. Fridell.

Fischel:

Was she the little short . . .? She was delightful.

10

Remember her?
Skarin:

Yes, but I have now forgotten.

Fischel:

I can't remember her name.

Skarin:

Was she the one who used to sit at the desk, who would come
in. . .

Fischel:

Oh, yes.

Skarin:

When a girl was engaged, she'd put red roses on the desk.

Fischel:

Right.

Denhard:

Did you have any real rough spots in training.

Fischel:

Oh, yes.

Skarin:

Yes. I did something bad. I didn't do something. legally,
according to the letter of the law, I didn't do anything wrong.
It's that I didn't do something that ethically I knew I should
have done. No one could take me to a court of law and say, "This
was wrong." A child came in with a something-or-other infection,
and I was the night nurse on pediatrics. And he wrote the order,
penicillin, so many units, you know, BID or once a day or
whatever. And the routine times would be like 8 am and 8 pm. He
should have written "Stat" and whatever. And I looked at it and
I thought, "I wonder if I really ought to give it now," and I
didn't, and so when the day shift came on I got it, I just got
it.

Denhard:

You've never forgotten it.

Skarin:

I really felt terrible about it. Because I really felt that
ethically I should have done it. Now, I knew in my heart, I
should have done it. But it's one of those things, you know.

Denhard:

Well, you have to be told precisely, and you were not told

11

precisely.
Skarin:

But, I really felt like I was wrong. If I had, I should
have checked it. I don't know. But that was a low.

Fischel:

Well, I remember, now that we're talking about this, a real
traumatizing experience. I was working nights on first west,
men's surgical, and there was a man in that cubicle who had
tuberculosis and had had thoracotomies.
He was there for a month, and every night—he was in
isolation, of course—we'd go in and give him his sleeping
medication. I was on the night that he tried to commit suicide.
He had not swallowed his medication. I mean, he gave me all the
indications that he had, but then after you left the room, he had
taken out the medication, from what we could decipher, and put it
in a big capsule, and one night he took it. I went in there
about four in the morning, making rounds. You know, you were
sometimes so busy, you didn't have time to make rounds as often
as you should. I went in there and his respiration—I thought he
looked strange—and his respirations were about four a minute.
So I called Miss Sikes, of course, and she was wonderful. We
could not figure out what had happened to him. And I have never
forgotten that, in all my life.

Denhard:

Of course not.

Fischel:

You know, every time you, even after that, when I went to
give sleeping medication, I thought, . . .

Denhard:

Open your mouth.

Fischel:

Open your mouth and let me see you swallow.

Denhard:

Yes, you don't forget these things, no.

12

Fischel:

But that was really traumatic.

Denhard:

Yes, it would be. And particularly, as a student—well,
anytime. If you were a student or a graduate, that would be
traumatic.

Fischel:

Oh, yes, and you're on there by yourself. I think there'd
have been an aide that night, or something like that.

Denhard:

Sick people, too.

Fischel:

Closed off, and you've got about twenty-five of them and a
person in isolation, and they take time.

Denhard:

Yes, oh yes. Gowning and all that.

Fischel:

I knew him really, he'd became really a good friend, and I
thought, how could he do this to me?i?

Denhard:

That's right. OK, let's see. What's your memory of the
doctor-nurse relationships during training?

Skarin:

Basically, I felt that I was treated with, in general, with
the respect due a student. I realize that because I was a
student, that I didn't command the respect that, say, a graduate
nurse would. But I felt, basically, particularly the younger
doctors, the interns, the residents as a rule, they treated me
pretty well. I felt that we had a good working relationship. We
talked about things, and when they'd give orders, or they were
dealing with somebody, they would listen to what we as students
said. There's certain of the older doctors that were just
pills. I mean, they were that way to everyone. You just said,
"Nasty physicians" and you stayed out of their way as much as you
could.

Fischel:

Especially, I think, you had a good working relation when

13

you were on the clinic side, just working with interns and
residents, because they were kind of in the same boat that you
were. I learned an awful lot from interns and residents.
Skarin:

Yes. They went out of their way. They seemed to take
delight in teaching. They taught us things that were very, very
helpful, practical.

Fischel:

Well, I think they felt the same way about us, because they
thought that we helped them a lot, too.

Denhard:

I'm sure you did.

Fischel:

I thought it was a good working relationship. When you hear
other horror stories that other people from other schools have, I
felt that we had a real good working relationship.

Skarin:
Denhard:

I'd agree with you.
What did you think, in looking back, about the strengths or
the weaknesses of your curriculum.

Fischel:

I wish, desperately, that we had had more public health, so
that we could, along with our bachelors degree, have gotten a
EHN.

Skarin:

I agree with that.

Fischel:

Definitely.

Denhard:

That didn't come 'till later.

Fischel:

One of the regrets that I have, and there was no way that we
could, in retrospect, get that.

Skarin:

You couldn't get credit for your VNA at all.

Fischel:

No.

Skarin:

It took an extra year to get that, the school nurse
credential.

14

Denhard:

At that time.

Skarin:

Because of having the bachelors degree. See, we didn't get
the bachelor of science, even, we got the B.A. So it took a
year, then, to get the school nurse credential, to get the
public, the specific courses that were required.

Denhard:
Skarin:

Who went on to get that?
I didn't do that until 19. . . Edith got that in 1976, so
things have changed.

Fischel:
Denhard:

The longer you waited, the more that was required.
Were there any skills you felt you should have learned that
you didn't?

Skarin:

There was one thing that I have problems with. Math has
always been my weak subject, and the way materia medica was
taught, I could not comprehend it. I got an A on it on state
boards, but only because I knew it was a

?

. I sat

down with the book we used, that big thick red book, and for
weeks I just went over that and I learned how to dose to be given
by dose on hand. I learned how to do all that stuff, but in
class I was totally confused by the instructions. Dear Miss
Eriksen, for all the lovely lady that she was, she did not know
how to teach math. That was not her strength.
Fischel:

No. Yes, materia medica was a tough one.

Denhard:

OK, what about graduation. Do you remember how you felt on
the day of graduation and what your feelings were?

Skarin:
Fischel:

I think I was awed all over again.
When we graduated down here on campus, I thought it was
wonderful, at Lawrence Frost Ampitheater.

15

Skarin:

The Baccalaureate, I thought, was very impressive, being in
the chapel. Of course, I hadn't gone to school here. I didn't
have the familiarity with it that some of the others did, and it
was a unique, special experience. Of course, on graduation day,
my family came up and my sister, with her little two year old
boy. Just about when it was time for us to start lining up to
receive our diplomas, Jimmy decided he wanted to go to the
toilet. I said, "I'll go with him," because my sister was
pregnant. So I walked down with him, and he went into the boys
bathroom. He proceeded to lock his door and crawl under and lock
the next door, and crawl under and lock the next door. And he
stayed in there. And I said, "Jimmy, come out." And Jimmy
didn't come out. [Laughter] Some student saw my plight and
flushed Jimmy out. I don't know what he did, but he was lovely,
he got that kid out.

Fischel:

What a thing to remember on Graduation Day.

Denhard:

But you did graduate all right.

Skarin:

I did graduate, but really, that was just one of the high
points of my life. [Laughter]

Fischel:

Not the toilet.

Skarin:

Being there in that lovely, beautiful setting. I don't
think it's there anymore, is it?

Skarin:

I don't know. I haven't been back.

Fischel:

I think they razed it, I don't think it's there.

Denhard:

I felt quite privileged there. What about your first job,
after you graduated?

Skarin:

Well, I guess we had the same one, didn't we?

16

Fischel:

The first job that I had when I graduated was at Children's
Hospital in Los Angeles. I worked two days on the floor and then
went on nights for six weeks, in charge of this huge ward on
medical floor, with one aide, and when we were giving penicillins
every three hours. I thought I was well prepared, and I guess I
was. But to go to a new place, like that. They were very short
of nurses.

Denhard:
Fischel:

You wonder, sometimes, how you survive, don't you?
I do. That's when we had to draw blood. We didn't draw
them, but we had to get them ready for the doctor to draw them
the next morning. And IVs running. It was an experience.

Skarin:

They would leave you with these vast numbers of patients.

Fischel:

Sick, sick kids.

Denhard:

You've only got two legs and two arms to do everything.

Fischel:

You'd want to sit down in the middle of the hall and cry.

Skarin:

I was working at Children1 s also. We went down there, when
did you start, Ellie?

Fischel:

January of 1949.

Skarin:

Yes. So did I. I think you must have started a little bit
before I did.

Fischel:

Probably.

Skarin:

I started later, the end of January or something like that.

Fischel:

I think so.

Skarin:

We were both working on the medical floor.

Fischel:

I'll tell you, though, if it hadn't been for Margaret Ann
Power, who graduated two years before we did, I don't think I
would have even stayed. She was so encouraging.

17

Denhard:

She was working there?

Fischel:

I think she felt responsible, because we had just
graduated. She had been working there for a while. But it was a
wonderful learning experience. I ended up loving the place and
stayed there for years. Of course, not on the floor. I worked
in the outpatient department, in-service office, and all kinds of
neat jobs, and I loved the place.

Skarin:

I worked there for about a year and a half on the medical
floor, and then I stopped and had . . .

Fischel:

. . . her own pediatrics.

Skarin:

. . . three kids. And then it was back working three to
eleven of relief, about three days a week, because I loved the
place so much. It was really an exciting place.

Fischel:

Wonderful.

Skarin:

A good teaching hospital.

Fischel:

Yes. Wonderful. I ended up working in the outpatient
department, a big outpatient department, and I was assistant head
nurse, and clinical instructor, and it was a great place to work.

Skarin:

I think one of the reasons that the medical floor was so
good was because Ellie was there and Margaret Power was there,
and then we had three girls from another university. . .

Fischel:

St. Louis University.

Skarin:

. . . and they were excellent nurses.

Denhard:

That was good for you.

Skarin:

A great staff, and the people just worked together. The
personalities made it really nice.

Denhard:

Oh, that's great. That was a good experience for your first

18

job.
Fischel:

I can remember Mrs. Owings used to tell us, "This is the
best staff." And it was, it was just wonderful.

Skarin:

Everybody was responsible, really responsible.

Fischel:

A thing that you do not see any more.

Denhard:

Not too much any more. What do you think of nursing today?

Skarin:

It's rough. It's really hard. I've been working with the
Red Cross, as a volunteer, and I go to these various training
things, preparing to work at health fairs, and a lot of people
will come who are currently working in hospital settings and, one
of the things that I see as the hardest, is that the trend in
some of the big hospitals is to not hire very many staff nurses.
They get them from the registry.

Fischel:

Oh, really.

Skarin:

The Kaiser does this a lot. And they only have to pay them
when they work there. They don't pay them benefits or anything
else. And it's rough for these girls.

Denhard:

Per diem. That's tough. It's bad enough to be a float
nurse in your own hospital without floating to different
hospitals.

Skarin:

For the staff nurses who are there, it's different people
all the time. You can't get the same effect, like we had at
Children's. The kids got good care.

[END OF SIDE A]

[BEGINNING OF SIDE B]

19

Fischel:

I work in a college student health center. We have some
really good nurses, that have been well trained and who are
responsible. But, by the by, it just seems that they're not
getting the training that we had in skills or why they're doing
what they're doing. It's just kind of disappointing. Not
responsible.

Skarin:

I agree.

Fischel:

They don't have the team concept.

Skarin:

They're not as conscientious, wouldn't you say.

Fischel:

Right. Not as conscientious. Just, you know, get my eight
hours, or less, or whatever I can get by with, done.

Denhard:

What would you say to a youngster who would come up to you
and say she was thinking of becoming a nurse. Would you
encourage her?

Fischel:

Well, I'd encourage her, but I'd encourage her to go to a
good university with a good program, like Mount St. Marys down in
Southern California that still has a baccalaureate program.

Denhard:

Do they? There aren't many.

Fischel:

They might have phased theirs out within the last couple
years. Does UCLA still have one?

Denhard:
Fischel:

I don't think so, but I'm not sure.
They get the academic, the bookwork and that type of thing,
but their actual hands-on experience leaves much to be desired.
I'm not saying that you have to have as much as we did, like
twelve weeks in surgery or whatever it was, but I do think one
day is hardly enough.

20

Denhard:

I agree.

Skarin:

What I told girls that are interested, especially when I was
working in the school and kids would come in and interview me. I
was "School Nurse," you know, one of their little jobs. And I'd
tell them, be very careful what it is you really want to do.
Because if you go in to became an EN it's going to be a different
jcib than if you go in to be an LVN. Know what it is you want to
do. Do you want to be a teacher, an administrator, or you want
to just take care of people?

Denhard:

That's right.

Skarin:

Find out about the schools and go to the very best school
that you can go to, for what it is you want to do.

Denhard:

That's good advice.

Skarin:

But I encourage them. I have enjoyed my work so much, the
various different kinds of involvements. It's been very
fulfilling, very satisfying to me.

Fischel:

If you would have asked me that last week, I probably would
have said, "No." But, yes, overall, I would say so.

Skarin:

And when you stop and think, nursing has been very
satisfying as a profession to work in.

Fischel:

Right. The thing that upsets me, though, is that we're
still haggling over the entry level to the baccalaureate
program. That's been going on for seventy-five years. It seems
to me like we could get that one thing off the ground, don't you?

Skarin:
Fischel:
Denhard:

I agree.
And that, I think, would give us more professional status.
I think there's a lot, also, to help the young graduate. I

21

guess I'm not supposed to talk, so I'll stop this for a minute.
Anything else you'd like to talk about?
Skarin:

Well, one thing, I've appreciated my education from
Stanford. I felt that it was absolutely top-notch. Of course,
my education is pretty shabby now, it's worn out. I'm not
updated, but as far as when I was working in the hospital, I felt
that we had the best, we really did. That was just from my own
perception, and wherever we went, the jobs would open up.
Anywhere you went.

Denhard:

It opened the door, didn't it?

Skarin:

A lot of doors. Not just jobwise. Because you had the
Stanford degree, other things were open to you too, just in
general life.

Fischel:

Yes, I agree with that.

Skarin:

It was a very valuable experience.

Fischel:

I would never have gone as far as I did in Children's, I
don't think. I'd had a lot of experience by the time I left
there. But I would never have gotten the job I have now, if it
weren't for the experience I had and the fact that I graduated
from Stanford. That was very impressive.

Denhard:

It's very impressive to people.

Skarin:

The Los Angeles School District has an excellent impression
of Stanford nurses. There're quite a few who worked for the
IAUSD, and when I went down there to apply, I was almost
automatically hired.

Denhard:

Isn't that good to hear.

Skarin:

So our girls have made a good impression. They've been

22

responsible and leaders.
Denhard:

That makes you kind of sad that we don't have a school any
more, doesn't it?

Fischel:

I know. Are we ever going to have one again?
