 Finchum  Gill  Today is August 8, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re doing an oral history  project called    Spotlighting Oklahoma,    in particular the 1930s. Today  we   re in the Stillwater Public Library and we   re going to be talking with  Roy Gill. Thank you for coming today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us where you were born and when.  Well I was born in Norman, Oklahoma in 19 and 22. June the 15th.  Down the road from here.  Down the road. That other town. (Laughter)  Did you have siblings? Brothers, sisters?  I was the only one for seven years. Then I had a brother, and then I had  three sisters.  A house full then.  A house full, that   s right.  What did your parents do for a living?  Well, a combination of farming. My dad was a bird dog trainer.  Really?  He trained bird dogs for years. It got to the point where the farming  5  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  didn   t make any money. So he went full dog training altogether.  And you can make a living dog training?  Oh, yeah. And he sold dogs too. I remember back   oh it was probably  in the late    30s, early    40s, he had one dog he sold for  750 and they just  got the hunting rights to it. They didn   t get to own it. As soon as the  hunting season was over, they had to bring him back because they used  him for a stud dog, you know. And he was a real good dog, also.  I would never have guessed that in Oklahoma.  Yeah and he broke gun-shy dogs. Gun-shy dogs were real hard to train.  People would come down there and say,    Well, I   ve had this to another  trainer and they didn   t do any good.    Dad said,    Well, I   ll tell you  what.    I   ve forgotten how much it was, like  125. He said,    I   ll train it  and I   ll guarantee it. We   ll take it out and you be the judge. If you don   t  think he   s trained, you don   t owe me anything.     So how many of those a year would he do?  Oh gosh, he   d have a whole pen full. I don   t know, I really don   t know  how many. I guess probably 40 or something like that. And, of course,  he   d have to go out in the field and train them. So he got a lot of  exercise, too.  Beagles or bird dogs?  Bird dogs. Pointers and setters.  Make any pets out of them?  Oh yeah, there were some of them. He always had one particular dog  that he kept. He didn   t sell it, you know. He hunted with that. And he   d  run loose. The rest of them were in the kennels.  What kind of farming did he do before?  Well it was mostly the horse drawn   mules mostly.  Plowing the fields?  Plowing the fields, that   s right. He eventually got a tractor. First tractor  we got had big iron wheels with real   oh a cleat, I guess, diagonally  across the wheel about two inches thick, dug into the soil, you know.  Then, of course, he ended up with a Ford tractor for years. Most of the  6  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  time, when I was a young kid, we had mules.  Did you have to use them yourself?  When I was seven years   you know people matured at an early age  back then. You had to mature early back in those times. But when I was  seven years old, I started getting up at four o   clock   we had a dairy  also, I didn   t tell you   milking cows. Okay, we   d milk the cows and I   d  take the cows to the pasture. Our place didn   t have enough land to graze  the cattle. One section had 360 acres, I guess it was. One had 160 over  here. And we   d alternate which one. When I went to school I   d ride a  horse. And I   d have to come back by and round up the cows and bring  them home. I had a great big steel drinking trough out there and didn   t  have electricity at the house. It had a gasoline engine. I   d start that and  all that nice cool water, all those old cows would come in and they   d just  drink and drink, especially when it was warm. And too, talk about warm,  in the summertime when they built the cow barn, it was a lean-to to the  big barn. And, of course, it had on the south several windows in there.  But that old sun bore down on that tin roof. You   d be milking and sweat  was just rolling off of you. In the wintertime, you   d go in there, of  course concrete floors and everything, you know. Oh, you   d be a  freezing. Your feet would just be numb. The only warm place about it  was your hands.  Talking about cows, there   s one thing. You know when I was a kid, my  grandpa had a bunch of cows. But he had one cow that one of her front  teats was cut off in half, just about half way. And she   d come in from the  pasture and the old bag was out, big. And there   s a stream of milk just  about the size of a match stem and they had some cats down in the barn.  There was one cat, he met that cow as it come in the lot. She   d get out  there and go (sound effects). Boy, that cow would move and she   d move  over (sound effects). She   d follow her all around until she got her fill. I  liked to watch that, used to, as a kid.  When you plowed, were you planting cotton or wheat or what?  Everybody back then   you know money was hard to come by back then  during the Depression. And cotton was a money crop, but we planted  corn and Hygear and Kafircorn and, of course, they had peanuts. You  know, a lot of different areas. Always a big garden.  Canned beans and all that?  Canned green beans, corn, peaches and tomatoes. Well, they had an old  homemade cellar. They just dug a hole and they   d put a big timber  across, all the way across. And then they   d put logs from the top up here  7  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  down. Then they   d finished that with tin. And then you cover it with  dirt. I remember they had shelves right down the center, and that was all  full. And down each side of this   we called it a cellar, I guess that   s a  basement or whatever you want to call them. But anyway, those things  by fall, they were filled. And you know, back then you didn   t go to town  and buy a bunch of groceries. We   d buy like baking powder and soda  and sugar and salt and stuff like that. But most of the things we raised.  Had a big garden and, of course, a watermelon patch and a cantaloupe  patch and all that stuff.  What were some of your chores?  Well, I   ll tell you what. When I was a kid, you stayed out of trouble that  way, I guess. Anyway, I did it all, I guess. Just about by the time I was  seven years old, I went down to plow. I was telling Jerry  his son   yesterday, I don   t know whether you know what a turning plow is or not,  but it throws the dirt one way and leaves a ditch there. Well, I   d get  down before it turned the corner. I wasn   t strong enough to pull it  around like a man did. So I   d stop just before I got to it and let the team  pull it around and plow. You   d get this field all plowed then you   d take a  harra  plow . A lot of times if it was a little dry then the bigger clods,  well you   d put a one by twelve all the way across the harra and then  you   d ride on that, get up there and get a little more weight, bust up  those clods. One time I got, oh I don   t know, fooling around but I  stepped off and got my foot into the harra and it was dragging me. I got  the team stopped, though.  At seven and eight years old, that   s     Seven years old when I started going to the field. My grade school  teacher, he was a heavy weight wrestler from OU. So I think I was ten or  twelve years old .They had milk routes, see. In the summertime, they  had to get the milk twice a day, morning and evening. Well, in the  winter, just once. Well anyway, to make a long story short, I was loading  a milk can. Well, I didn   t muscle it up there. I   d take my knee and get it  kind of horizontal and then I   d push it over and then I   d set it back up.  Well, the teacher he said,    Oh man, you   re too small to be doing that.     He said,    Let me do that.    So he didn   t use his knee or anything, he just  muscled it up there. Well, the bottom of the can hit the bed of the truck  and come falling back down and he kind of turned red in the face. In the  summertime first we   d milk then we   d come back and have breakfast.  Then, Dad, he   d have the teams harnessed up and ready to go to the  field. Well, we   d go up to the field and work until noon and we   d stay at  the house about 30 minutes or something like that, time for the stock to  get fed and everything then we   d go back to the field. Well, I   d take off  about four o   clock in the afternoon and saddle my horse and I   d go  8  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  gather the cows up and bring them in. Then we milked after that. By that  time it was dark and you were tired. I tell you, I   d come in from the field  and be sweating   soil would just be stuck to you. Your legs would just  be surrounded with dirt.  How did you cool off and clean up after that?  Well, you had a number three wash tub. Some people, they had one of  those elongated ones but we just had a number three wash tub. Oh I  guess it was three and a half  feet  in diameter or something like that and  you get in that. That   s what you     Warm the water how? Or did you?  Well, yeah. You could leave that water out in the sun and it   d heat that.  Otherwise in the wintertime, of course, we didn   t get so dirty then but  you warmed it on the woodstove.  And one tub per person? Or did you have to share one?  Oh yeah. Well just one person at a time.  Have to use the same water then, did you?  No, we didn   t have to use the same water. You   d have to have a new  supply of water.  Did you just have the one tub?  Yeah, best I can remember, that   s the only big tub. We had some smaller  ones. But the ones we all take the bath in.  What did you do after it got dark?  We   d go to bed. (Laughter) Well, that   s not quite true. We had the radio,  you know, battery radio. We   d listen to Fibber McGee and Molly and  Red Skeleton and all that. That was entertainment. And on Saturday  night we   d get Nashville, Tennessee, the country station.  The Grand Ole Opry?  Grand Ole Opry, that   s right. Wasn   t a very exciting time, but     (Laughter)  Do you remember listening to any of Roosevelt   s Fireside Chats?  9  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Roosevelt was the first time I voted for a president.  Really?  FDR, that   s right. Sure did. Oh yeah, and I lived in Norman as an  electrician and our shop was pretty close to the rail road tracks. And  Harry Truman came by storming through the country, you know. He was  on a backup platform on the railroad and he gave a speech out there.  Cool.  Yeah, let   s see, I guess I was in San Diego when FDR passed away.  When you were in grade school, first, second grade, talk a little bit  about grammar school.  Well first, in the grammar school, we lived with my grandpa and  grandma. Dad, he leased land out and farmed around there. So I went to  Blackburn School for two years. It was a rural school, a two room  school. Actually, it was one big room, but they had big folding doors  across there, make it for several activities why they   d open it up, you  know. But I went there for two years. Then my folks bought a farm, so I  moved three miles east to South Gale School, a rural school. And at that  time, there was a bunch of Indians that went to school there. And, you  know, I   d never been around Indians. All I heard about was how vicious  they were and everything. I guess there were probably a dozen Indians.  And boy, I steered clear of those guys. And one of them, I guess he kind  of got the idea   anyway he figured I was afraid of them, so he followed  me around. He was giving me a bad time. So I come to point, I said,     Well, I   m either going to have to fight him or run. I   d hate all of  school.    I was fortunate enough to whip him, so we were good friends  after that. What really impressed me though, at that time the Indians  drove to school in a    29 Chevrolet. The boys all had Pendleton shirts,  and the girls were dressed   the Indians, they got federal money. I don   t  know exactly how it was, but they got money. So they were dressed real  neat, you know. I thought that was something. I was lucky to have  overalls.  Did you have school clothes and Sunday clothes and work clothes?  That   s right. Yeah, that   s right.  I understand you played some softball or baseball?  Well, both. When I was in grade school we played softball. We won the  county championship when I was in eighth grade. And I played for the  10  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Little Ax Indians for about three or four years.  How did that come about?  Well, you know, I can   t remember exactly how that came about. I played  ball, I was really interested. My dad, he was a ball player, you know. I  can   t really remember exactly how I got situated with the Indians. But  anyway, I got over there. We lived six miles from the school where they  played ball   actually the field by the school. And it was six miles over  there. I   d carry my glove, walk six miles over there, and a lot of times  we would play 40 or 50 miles from home, north of Shawnee or  something like that. Time we got back to the field, it was dark. Then I   d  have to walk six miles back home.  That took a long time to do six miles.  It certainly did. And also, last night, my cousin   s wife passed away last  week so we were going to the funeral. We were talking about it and I  told her that softball team, every one of them has passed away, not one   is left . Well, I got to thinking about the Indian baseball team, not a one  of them is alive. So I outlived a lot of them, anyway. Of course, I was  real young. And most of them, especially when I played with the  Indians, they were all older than I was.  What position did you play?  Well, mostly outfield and I pitched in high school. I played in outfield  and we had one old big Indian. Oh, he could smoke that thing. He had an  arm you couldn   t believe. I played the outfield all the time. So one  day   those Indians were real bad about drinking and sometimes they   d  have a hangover and they couldn   t play. Well, the second basemen, he  was gone that day. So the manager told me, he said,    You come in and  play second base.    I said,    Really. I   ve never played the infield in my  life.       Oh,    he said,    You   ll make it all right.    So anyway, I was playing  second base and they had a runner on second. He was playing off quite a  little ways. I knew Woody was catching at that time. He had a whale of  an arm, so I figured boy, he   s going to   and I waited and waited and  waited and he didn   t throw it. So just about the time I started to turn, that  ball hit me right in the chest and the runner, he was still eight feet away.  If I   d just looked around and caught it, he would have been dead.  Did you have to go the hospital or anything?  No, no, I didn   t. It hurt a little bit I guess, but it didn   t bother me at all.  Did your parents get to come watch you play any?  11  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Well, my mother, she wasn   t in for sports, but my dad, he loved sports.  He was a baseball player. He was a lot better than I was. In fact, after I  played a year or two, he come over and played with them. Golly, I guess  he was 50 years old then and he was good, I   ll tell ya. Well, to make a  long story short to tell you how good he was, we had a tournament late  in the season. And this one team, I forget where they were from, but  their pitcher, he had played in the major leagues. That season, he had  played in the Texas league for Beaumont and he   d come up. His home  was around southern Oklahoma some place. Anyway, he couldn   t throw  very hard, but oh, he had pin point control and he shut us out. We got  three hits on him all day long. My dad got all three of them, and he was  50 years old  I grounded out three times to the short stop.  It was hot to play in weather back then too, I guess.  Oh yeah, most of the time it was hot. I remember when we played at  Luther, Oklahoma. It was a misting rain. I was playing center field. And  that ball, oh it went, I mean real high. And it was kind of misting. Boy,  you had to keep your eye on the ball and the mist was getting in my eye.  Boy, I was having a time blinking and trying to focus on the ball. And  that was prohibition then. I remember over at Luther   there was a  colored team, by the way. This colored man had a suitcase and he had it  full of whiskey. He was peddling his whiskey right out at the ballgame   And you would have been 16, 17 years old, right in there?  Yeah, that   s right. I got married when I was 17. See, I mean we   ve been  married 70 years in September.  Well let   s talk about that then. How did you meet her?  Well, back then, for entertainment, they had the old country dances. But  for the young people, they had play parties, they called them. It was kind  of like square dancing. So anyway, it was kind of by accident. We had a  car and my neighbor, a kid, they didn   t have a car. It was quite a little  ways away from the house where a party was that night. He asked me if  I   d like to go. I said,    Yeah, I   ll go with you.    Went down there and  that   s where I met my wife.  Meant to be. And that was in the late    30s?     39. Out at the play party, that   s where I   yep.  And then how long did you date before you got married?  Oh, probably six months, something like that.  12  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  And then you had a big wedding, small wedding, or eloped?  Eloped. That   s right. We didn   t have any money so we couldn   t go on no  honeymoon or anything. We just barely had enough money to buy the  license.  You got married in Oklahoma then?  Noble, Oklahoma with a Methodist minister.  So that   s a little ways from Norman?  Three or five miles south of Norman. It   s just right next door.  I was thinking Noble County, which is     Oh yeah, Noble County, that   s a different.  Did you have pictures from the wedding?  No, no pictures. Nope, that   s right. We ran off and got married. My  parents didn   t know we were going to get married even.  Were you out of high school by then?  No, I just went to high school two years. So anyway, after we got  married, just about a little over a year the war started. So the federal  government, they didn   t have enough skilled people, so they set up  schools all over the country. Boy, they started just as soon as they  bombed Pearl Harbor. They had all these barracks up and buildings and  aircraft factories and all that. They needed people to fill the jobs. So I  went to school at   they called it the National Youth Administration.  Didn   t cost me anything. I went to school six months, eight hours a day,  five days a week for six months. And when I finally got into the Navy,  then they give you an aptitude test. I did real well on the electrical, of  course, I   d been to school. And an old boy said,    Boy, you did well on  the electrical, would you like to school?    I said,    Yeah, I sure would.     So they sent me to Jacksonville, Florida, the Naval Air Station, and I  went to school for six months down there, same thing: eight hours a day,  five days a week for six months.  And that   s how you made your living the rest of     That   s the way I made my living. I went to Seattle and worked in the  shipyards for a short while. To start with, they were building  minesweeper boats down in San Francisco. Well, they were building  13  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  them so fast they weren   t   the wiring, they called it the gauzing, they  weren   t getting it on in time so they just shipped them to Seattle and we  put the gauzing on them. So I worked I don   t know how long there.  Then they finally, I guess they got their situation fixed up down in San  Francisco so they stopped that so the ship went over to the new Seattle-  Tacoma Shipyard, Pier 41. Boy I tell you, they   d have that big old thick  steel about an inch thick. And my god, half as big as this room. And  there were old cranes going over your head and everything. I didn   t like  that.  A long way from Norman, Oklahoma, huh?  A long way from Norman Oklahoma, that   s right.  And not on the farm, so it was different, too.  That   s when the farming, you know all the kids lived on the   well most  of us went in the service, you know. And the service, I got a call from  the service in January in    43. So I got my physical, got okayed and chose  the Navy. They said,    Okay, we   ll call you in 21 days. We   ll give you a  ten day notice.    Well, I didn   t even own a car then. You know,  everything was rationed, gas, tires, everything just about. So I told the  wife, I said,    Well, I   ll just work until my ten days notice. Then I   ll quit.  Then we   ll still have a little time, you know.    So I waited. 21 days  passed, then a month passed, two months passed, and six months passed.  And golly, about a year passed.  Anyway, there was an old boy that came in from the service. He was  wounded, so he got back in defense, Douglas Aircraft Factory back in  Oklahoma City. And anyway, I was telling him about it. He said,    I have  got some good news for you.    He said,    Don   t you go by the draft board.  I   ll tell you why.    He said he was a fireman out in Los Angeles. And he  said all the young guys that had already been drafted and gone, he said  he went right by the draft board every day to and from work. And he  said,    I don   t know what in the world made me do that. I stopped by  there one day and we talked about all those people who had gone. They  had just a bunch of steel files rotated all in lines there. Went over to one  of those and pulled it out. And it said diagonally, all the way across that  in red letters, DECEASED.    He said,    Six weeks from then I was in  Guadalcanal     (Laughs) He said,    It didn   t pay to go to the draft board.     So what did you do once you got out?  Well, of course, I was an electrician. I worked for the International  Brotherhood of Electricians. I went in, I think in,    49 or    50, something  like that. I retired in    85.  14  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Pretty good living?  Yeah, it was a good living. I went to work for an oil company for an  electrician for about ten years of that and moved to a little town,  Lindsay, Oklahoma   that   s where Jerry   s from, graduated from. I don   t  know why I ever went down there. You know, the kids all married and  everything from there. Then I went back to Oklahoma City and, of  course, a lot of the time we could get to work in Norman. Of course,  they had a lot of work in the insane asylum out there and the University  and, of course, the industrial area, too. Most of the time I had to work in  Oklahoma City.  I was working in Oklahoma City in 1980. That was a hot, hot summer. I  mean hot. I think there were either 21 or 23 straight days that it was over  100. We have a daughter who lives in Seattle. So I told my wife,    Let   s  go on vacation. Maybe by the time we get back, it   ll cool off.    Well, I  left Seattle coming home. It was 78 degrees when I left Seattle. I got into  Oklahoma City at the airport. It was 6:30 that night it was 104 degrees. I  thought, well, we didn   t stay long enough   It   s unusual that she ended up in Seattle after you   d spent some time  there.  Yes, it was. Well, actually she married a man from Lindsay and he had a  brother who worked for Boeing and he was an engineer. He worked for  Boeing up in Seattle. He knew he had a job up there. So that   s where  they moved and they live about 100 miles north of Seattle now on a little  island up there, Camano Island.  So when you first got married, you were on the tail end of the  Depression, right? If you got married in    39?  Actually, the Depression wasn   t completely over until after the war  started and anyone that wanted to work, there was a job for them then.  Well, the Japanese kind of caught us with our britches down, you know.  And from then, everything skyrocketed. I mean the barracks and  everything was building, all the bases were full. And boy, they were  really preparing. Of course, overseas, especially in the islands of the  Pacific, we   d have an island and they   d hold it as long as they could and  they   d fall back to another island, and then Japanese would take that  eventually, until they got built up. And then they started taking those  islands back.  Did your wife move with you each time you moved for the military?  No, she didn   t, she stayed at home. I had three kids then. Well, actually I  15  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  had two. Jerry, he was born when I was in San Diego.  So you had to send money back, then?  Well, of course, you didn   t get very much money then, but there was an  allowance. I forget now   it wasn   t very much. I think like maybe  125 a  month that the wife got. Of course, I just got the little spending money,  which wasn   t very much in the service.  Did she have to work?  No, she didn   t. She had a full time job at home.  With kids.  That   s right, yes. She sure did. But we were renting the house, and the  Navy base was out there and you just almost couldn   t find any place to  live. We had one area of the house, I guess it was two rooms. Anyway  she rented that to a sailor   s wife and they had a little boy, I think, at that  time. So she got some income from that then.  It was hard to make ends meet when     Oh, it was hard. It was really hard to make ends meet back then. We  didn   t have any money and the family didn   t have very much money, so  we were on our own.  It   s kind of hard to ship canned goods, I guess, from home.  Yeah. Oh yeah, that   s right. That   s right.  So back on the farm, what would do for fun? If you had to work from sun  up to sunset?  I   ll tell you what, of course there were games. You know, we built stilts.  We   d walk on the stilts. And we   d play ball, Annie Over. And my  brother, he was seven years younger than I was, I had to let him win  occasionally or he wouldn   t play. I had a tennis ball, I   d throw that and  I   d let him hit it until he   d get close and then I   d shut him down. Well,  I   ll tell you, I threw to him so much that boy. I   ll tell you I had to bear  down before I could get him out  And we   d go up to the river and swim  in the river. And we had a lot of hunting, squirrel hunting and rabbit  hunting and so on. During the Depression, oh I guess I had 15 to 20  rabbit tracks. Before I   d go to school, I   d run the traps. I made a little  spending money that way.  16  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  On the skins or the meat?  Meat. Oh yeah, skinned rabbit. And Dad always had a good squirrel dog  so we   d go out and about. When I was working for the oil company,  why they had a bunch of water wells all about 25-35 miles south of the  plant. If one of them would go down, the pressure would go down. So I  went down to check on them, see what the trouble was. Went down there  and saw a squirrel had gotten into the high voltage line and kicked a  fuse. So I called the power company and they were on their way out. In  the mean time there was a colored boy come by and he was squirrel  hunting. He was real friendly, you know, we were talking. And I said,     When I was kid my dad had a real good squirrel dog. I   d take that dog  and my nigger shooter and go out       Just as soon as I said that, oh my  god, I knew I   d said the wrong thing. But I didn   t know what to say, so I  didn   t say anything. I was afraid I   d make it worse. But he wasn   t  friendly after that. I can tell, he didn   t appreciate that at all. And I could  understand, too, but it wasn   t intentional by any means. But that   s what  we always called them, nigger shooters, ever since I was a kid. But oh,  various games, you know. We were always in a contest for pitching  washers or something like that.  When did electricity get to the house?  It didn   t get to the house until   in fact I wired our house. It was like in  the late    40s or something like that before they got electricity out where  we lived.  So they cooked with a woodstove then, your mother?  Cooked on a woodstove, heated on the woodstove. And they had a great  big copper. I don   t know whether you call it a kettle or not, but they   d  put that on the stove and boil the water and they   d put their clothes in  there to wash. My wife   s folks, they had a great big black kettle that  they   d put outside and they   d build a fire under that and heat that up and  that   s what they used. And too, talking about what we ate, outside of all  the fruit and vegetables and everything we canned, of course we had  milk cows that had milk. We also sold eggs. We had 500 head of White  Leghorn hens and we sold them to a hatchery over in Shawnee. And  we   d kill hogs. That was for meat. They made soap out of that, lye soap.  And we had what they called hog lard. When you first started getting on  to that, oh it was rank. But you ate it a while and got used to it. Well, as  soon as it got  to be  warm weather that stuff got strong. By that time,  my mother, she would discontinue using that and she   d get Mrs.  Tucker   s. She couldn   t afford Crisco.  Mrs. Tucker   s, I don   t know that brand.  17  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Yeah, oh Mrs. Tucker   s lard, shortening, whatever you call it. Oh that  was on the market for years. That was before your time. And you know,  we had our milk, eggs, we had our meat. And occasionally they   d  butcher a calf or something like that, but they   d go around beforehand to  everyone because no one had refrigeration or anything so you had to get  rid of that meat pretty quick. So they   d go around and get people on the  list that wanted to buy meat and they   d kill them and distribute that out  and you had to eat it pretty quick or like my wife, she said that they had  to buy a big chunk. She   d put it in the oven and cook it.  A little bit different than pork because you can smoke it and keep it for a  while, right?  Oh yeah.  But beef you couldn   t.  Yeah. Dad had a smokehouse. And they   d put them big hams in there  and then the smokehouse. I was always tickled to death when we got a  new ham. And you know at breakfast, they didn   t just have one egg or  something for you and me. They   d have a whole platter of eggs. When  we   d get those hams why they just had a whole platter of hams. And too,  I always remember we had a jersey cow. She gave really rich milk and  Mom would take a gallon crock. She   d put a gallon in there and oh,  probably two inches down there was solid cream. I remember she   d take  a cup, skim that off and put that in your oatmeal and oh, it was good   But I   ll tell you, there weren   t any fat people back then though.  They worked too hard.  The only fat person I knew   and she wasn   t quite fat. She was a little  overweight in high school. But boy, those little old girls, I   ll tell you,  they were just thin. My wife weighed 105 pounds when we got married.  She doesn   t weigh very much more than that now.  Nothing went to waste much then?  Nothing went to waste. And I   d tell them. You know, outside of canning  and everything, they planted peas, black eyed peas, mostly. You   d take  those in a sack and you   d stomp on them, they were dry, and get those  hulls and then you   d pour them in a tub, you had another tub over here  and the wind was blowing. The wind would blow the hulls off and the  peas would fall in the tub over there.  Kind of ingenious.  18  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Yeah, it was.  Well, did your mother sew much?  She wasn   t a very good seamstress. She   d kind of patch our clothes a  little bit. Allene   s mother, she was a real good seamstress. I think there  were 11 in her family, though. She said she   d take a newspaper and  she   d hold it up, she   d whack out a pattern and then she   d sew it up.  Allene said, I think, she picked cherries down in Noble, Oklahoma at a  cherry farm out there for money to buy some clothes. I think she just  bought fabric and for her mother to sew. She went to high school, and  she didn   t have any money. She played basketball. Well, the first two  years she went to Macomb, Oklahoma. Then the second two years she  went to Noble High School. She said she   d go to school, she didn   t have  any money to buy anything. All the other kids would go to the cafeteria  or go home or something to eat. She said she   d go down and shoot  hoops. Said she   d go home and she   d just be starved by the time she got  home.  They didn   t pack a lunch for her?  Didn   t even pack a lunch. I don   t know why they didn   t. You know, they  didn   t encourage    I think maybe one of them went to college, but the  rest of them have just a grade school education. And oh, there were two  or three of them that went to high school.  They lived on a farm, too?  Yeah, they lived on a farm also.  You would have thought they could pack a lunch then.  Well you would, but her family was kind of funny. They weren   t  interested in her getting an education. She graduated from high school  when she was 16. Anyway, one of the grade school teachers years later,  they were teaching some of my younger sisters and they mentioned  something about my wife. They said that Jerry, I guess maybe he was in  college or something by that time. Anyway, he always made real good  grades and everything, and they mentioned to this old school teacher  about how good of grades Jerry made. They said,    Well, he come by it  right. His mother was as sharp as a tack.     If your mother didn   t sew, you didn   t have homemade clothes. You had  store bought clothes?  No, she put patches on there. She knew how to put a patch on. And too, I  19  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  know you used to come in in the wintertime and your feet would be  cold. You had an old woodstove and it had a chrome guard around it  where you   d put your shoes up there. And that old stove would get hot.  And boy first thing you   d know your shoes would be smoking. If Dad  seen it, man he   d get all over us.    Those shoes cost money, don   t burn  them up      Jerry, he was a corker. You know, where we first lived there was a little  old bar ditch out on the side of the house over something. Anyway, he  got out and   kids will wade in that. Water just attracts kids. And he got  out there and he lost one of his new shoes in that. Then, I think it was  that same winter, he got new shoes and he got out in the snow and got  them soaking wet. We had one of those old clay back heaters, you know.  I   m sure you   ve seen them. Well, he didn   t want his mother seeing that  so he put them up on there. One time Allene said she went in there and  the toes had turned up. You know, the thing about that back in the  Depression, you work so much that you didn   t have a lot of spare time.  And being on a farm, you don   t notice not having   .  Well the thing about that, we were poor, but everyone else was poor  also. And too, back then, I can remember people when the Depression  hit, you know there   s people in town that had jobs working in a filling  station or the grocery store or something like that, renting. Well, they  had to get out. They couldn   t pay their utility, couldn   t pay the rent. So  every little shack in the country, they   d come out there and they   d put  doors and windows in. They   d plant a garden and they   d have a cow for  milk and then get a few chickens for eggs and so on like that. They  survived, I guess you could say.  Sure. Well being so young and getting married in the    30s and making a  go of it, that was just     Well I   ll tell you, that   s right. We don   t have an awful lot now, but I  thank the good Lord every day for what we do have. Considering  everything, I think we   re doing great, really, because not having a  formal education or anything. But I was lucky to get into the electrical  trade. I guess I was just extremely lucky to get into it and then I thought  I did well. Anyway, they give you a pretty stiff test in the Union. You go  in and I thought, man alive, I don   t know whether I   m good enough to  be a Union electrician or not. But anyway, I take my test and there was a  friend of mine, he was on the examining board. I was the last one  through. I went through everything and then I went back through it  again. And when I came up with the test, he said,    I couldn   t make up  my mind whether you were going to be the worst score or the best score.  I knew it had to be one.    I did real well on it. Of course, I had a lot of  20  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  schooling, you know.  Being in the Union, what was that like?  Well, you know there   s a lot of people that have a negative view on  unions and I   m sure that some of them are bad. But I was in there for 50-  some odd years and never had a strike. The contractors and the  electricians, they had to have a board that they would bicker on the  wages and so on like that and made all the rules and regulations. I   ll tell  you what, that was the only thing that saved me I think. I get three  pensions now from the Union. And two of them I didn   t put a dime in.  No complaints then.  No complaints. Boy, I   ll tell you if it weren   t for that, social security is  good, but that just goes so far. But those three pensions just put me over.  I   m not well off or anything like that but we have all we want to eat and  have a good home and good car and go when we want to go.  And you probably pay cash for everything?  Yeah, I bought a new Honda two years ago and paid  22,000 for it in  cash. I got to looking at it the other day and I have 12,800 miles on it  and that   s counting the trip to California. Yep, the wife   s folks, most of  them after the war started, all the farm hands they left and the kids went  to the service. A bunch of them went to California. I saw Grapes of  Wrath the other night, it was on television. They   d cut out a lot of it, but  those people, especially in the northwest, went four or five years without  bringing in any crop or no money coming in, so they didn   t have any  choice. They had to starve or go someplace, so they all gathered up and  went to California, Oklahomans, Texans and Arkansans and a lot of  those. Yeah. And, of course, the Okies, they were all good workers, you  know.  So they went out there and every one of her brothers did real well out  there. Had one brother that he fought all through Africa in Rommel   s  Army  in Africa . He went up into Anzio Beachhead, that   s where he got  all of the meat shot out of his leg. They sent him to three doctors. Two  of them wanted to take his leg off and the other said,    Why don   t we just  leave it and see how it works out?    So they left it and he   s all right now.  It wasn   t fun then, but looking back, it wasn   t really that bad. Of course,  it   s each one   s point of view, but like I said a while ago, we were all  poor and you didn   t feel quite so bad. You weren   t going to school with  some rich man   s kids.  Did your parents stay on the farm all the way through?  21  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Well Dad, he quit farming and went entirely to training dogs.  How long did he do that?  Well, he did that up until he passed away. He had a heart attack. You  know, those older people, they didn   t hardly ever go to the doctor back  in the Depression, especially. They didn   t have any money. I   ll tell you,  if you went to the doctor, you were in bad shape. And if you ever went  to the hospital, you were about dead. He never did go to the doctor and  I   m sure he had high blood pressure. He had a heart attack. He was 60?  I   ve forgotten now, 66 or   young anyway. Young. Mother, she passed  away, she was 97 though. Got a lot of longevity back then.  A lot, yes. How did she make ends meet after he passed, those 30 more  years?  Well the only thing is she was got social security. She lived with one of  her daughters almost the rest of her life. Finally she got to the point  where she couldn   t take care of herself and they put her in a nursing  home then.  With bird dog training, he wouldn   t have much retirement built up?  Oh no, that   s right. And too, a lot of times, they   d pay cash and he  wouldn   t even turn that in. So really, she didn   t get very much social  security. I don   t know for sure what she got, but I know it wasn   t very  much. Probably  600- 700 a month or something like that. But she was  living with her daughter.  Did your parents use the bank a lot or did they pay cash for everything,  too?  Oh, they paid cash for everything just about. At one time, before the  Depression hit, they had a checking account. But after that, they didn   t  have any money to put in the bank, so they spent cash. I remember Dad,  to put in a crop or anything, he   d go to the bank and borrow money for  seed and this and that and the other or equipment. And he   d pay it back  in the fall, the cotton crop or something like that.  You just had to be a good planner.  Yeah, that   s right.  Plan it all out. And can, can, can. Did she teach you how to can?  No, I didn   t, but the wife, she   s not very good at health and I   m getting  22  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  to where I can cook pretty good now  And I   m a real good dish washer.  And, you know, to get the dishwasher full, you don   t have any utensils  left. So we run it once a week. She says it will rust out if you don   t. So I  do the rest of the dish washing. She   s got real bad arthritis on her hands  and everything, so I do all the housekeeping. I mean I do all the running  of the sweeper and mopping the floors and everything.  Keeps you busy.  Yeah, it does. And we   ve got a pretty good sized lawn so it   s quite a  little chore to keep that up. I   ve stayed really busy at doing something.  Most of the time it doesn   t amount to an awful lot, but I keep occupied.  And I think, when you retire you can   t sit down on the couch and sit  there because, you know, you don   t live very long like that.  Back in the    30s or    40s did you go to movies or drive-ins?  Just before the Depression hit, my dad, he ran a dairy and his brothers  run a dairy and his brother had a milk route. His brother ran the milk  route. And every once in a while, his brother, my uncle, he   d have some  business that he would have to take care of and Dad would run his milk  route. Well, I   d go with him. I saw my first movie, oh I guess it must  have been in    28 or    29 or something along in there. And I think I ate at  a restaurant, I remember, for the first time.  Do you remember what the movie was?  No, I don   t.  It had to be black and white?  Yeah, it was black and white.  Probably a western?  Probably. Yeah, that   s right. Us country boys like westerns.  I know Gone with the Wind came out in the mid    30s, so it would have  been before then.  That was on the television here last week, I believe. Only thing is, it  lasted for four hours  I said,    Well, my gosh  That   s past my bed time      Had work to do, chores to do, too.  Well, didn   t have anything to do really. But I didn   t want to stay up that  23  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  late. It wasn   t over until midnight.  What was your first car?  My first car was a 19 and 40 Ford. I drove that for a while, and then after  I joined the Union, I got rich then. So I bought a 1951 Ford, new.  New. Was the Ford a new one or a used?  No, it was a used. Yeah, it was used. And then I think I bought a new     53 Ford. I was working in the power plant over in Anadarko. I was  going to work one morning, still dark, and this big old Hereford cow run  out on the highway. I slammed on the brakes and there was a big milk  truck behind me. He didn   t get slowed, he turned out around, but the bed  stuck out. He just made a screech down the side of that car. So I traded it  in and got me another one.  I   m assuming you paid cash for those too?  No, I don   t think I paid cash for them. I would never miss a payment on  the mortgage, never missed a payment. Our groceries, we would put  them on a tab; never missed one of them. But as far as I know, we don   t  owe anyone in the world. We don   t have all that much.  You   d have a grocery tab when you were first married? Is that what  you   re saying? Or for your parents?  No, that was after we had married. Yeah, my parents, they mostly paid  cash. But I remember they lived two miles from Franklin. At one time  they had a couple of grocery stores and probably 15 houses or something  around there. But we   d go to the grocery store, I think we   d buy five or  six dollars worth of groceries, and I   m telling you it, you can   t believe,  we had a wagon almost full of groceries. And I remember the peanut  butter   they had a little tray or something, they   d fill that up. They had a  big old round deal of peanut butter, five gallons I guess. They   d dip that  full. And your oatmeal, it was bulk and they   d put that in a sack. I  remember going up to the grocery store to get coal oil and if you   d lost  the spout or the cap for it for, they   d take a potato and stick it down over  that to keep. Poor people have poor ways.  Well, they made do and they could fix it.  They made do, that   s right. And everyone was friendly. At one time, like  I said, I did a lot of hunting. And for four or five miles around, I didn   t  have to ask or anything, I   d just go hunting, I knew those people. After  the war, I started going hunting and I   d be hunting on this place and  24  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  some old boy would come down there and say,    Who in the world gave  you permission to hunt?    I   d say well    and he   d say,    They don   t own  that, I own that. I don   t allow hunting here.    That happened so much I  just quit hunting.  Were you hunting squirrels?  Well, mostly I was hunting birds, quail.  Not deer?  No. You know, that   s something else. I   ll tell you, there   s a lot of deer,  there   s a lot of things here and now that during the Depression they  killed all the turkey, they killed all the deer. I mean, and it wasn   t for  fun, that was for food. And boy, it   s not like it is now.  Now we   ve got a lot of deer.  Yep, there is a lot of deer. In fact there   s getting to be too many. They  were eating out in Jerry   s backyard this morning. In fact it got to the  point where there   s a friend of mine, he lives about a mile out of town.  He had a big garden and those deer just eat it up. In fact he said,    I   m  not even going to plant a garden this year because you can   t keep the  deer out.     Well, I   m supposed to ask you to tell your story about when you had to  ride three miles to get feed?  Oh. (Laughter) Well, when I first got my first horse I was five years old.  So my dad, I was telling you, they lived with my grandpa and grandma  for seven years. And Dad would lease land around there to farm. He   d  have a hired hand to help him. So we were about a mile from their place  and they run out of seed. A young guy, he   d rode a horse over but he  didn   t have a saddle on or anything. And they said,    Well, you go to the  store,    (and it was three miles from where we were at to the store)    And  you need to get some seed.    So I went without a saddle, bare back, five  years old, went three miles down and got the seed. And you know, I  didn   t think anything about it because I   d been riding a horse. I knew  how to ride. It wasn   t anything exceptional to me. So I went down, they  got the seed and it wasn   t full. They kind of evened it up on each side  and tied it off and put it up there and set me up behind it, you know. And  I went back with seed.  Didn   t get lost along the way.  Oh, no. I knew the country and everything. And I had a horse, he was  25  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  shy. I remember one time I was going down the road and it was winter  time. The leaves along the ground over there were dry leaves. There   s a  rabbit out there and those leaves are shuffling. Well that horse, he  jumped sideways about ten feet and left me out in the middle of the  street. But he just stood there, so I got up and dusted myself off and got  back on.  Good days. Good memories.  Well it was. There were some good days. I remember my granddad, he  planted his corn and Hygear and Kafircorn and stuff. And he had a  lister   not a lister but a plow that throws dirt both ways. I guess it was a  lister  plow . But anyway, then he   d have a horse-drawn one-row planter  go behind him. I   d have to come over with my horse and run the one-row  planter behind all of that. I remember one time we were   I forgot  now what it was, I think it was Kafircorn. But anyway it was down on  some real good land. My grandma told Grandpa she wanted to put some  peas out down there. He said,    No, no, no. No peas down there.    And so  we were all planting and she come down there and she called me over  there. She put a stake down beside the row. She said,    When you get  here, I want you to turn that planter off.    She went down there about 25,  30 yards maybe, she put another stick,    When you get down here turn it  on.    And I forgot how many rows that was, but I remember all that  started coming up. My grandpa, about the meanest thing he ever said  was    old goose.    He looked at that and said,    Well, I see the old goose  got her way after all.    And too, I   d come over there and boy, that was  during the Depression. Grandma would give me a dollar bill. I thought I  had big money.  Did they give every grandkid one or just you?  Just me. I was the only one who worked. I had a cousin, he lived in  town. He   d come out and play with me during the summer. But as soon  as I had to go to work, he   d go over to Grandpa   s house. He was allergic  to work.  What were holidays like?  They were just another day. Oh, Fourth of July, sometimes we   d get just  a few firecrackers, not very many. And Christmas, I remember, you  wouldn   t get very much for Christmas. I remember one time I got a little  truck with a bed on it and everything. You put a battery in there and it  had lights on there. And I think I wore the knees out of my trousers  rolling that around the yard. Best I remember, that was the only  Christmas present I got. You know, when you went to grade school  though, they   d have pie suppers and get some money together and  26  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  they   d put a sack for everyone. They   d put a big orange and an apple and  some of that crinkledy candy and nuts and so on in there. And oh, we  thought that was a big thrill.  Pie suppers, would they auction the pies off?  That   s right. The girls, they brought the pies and, of course, the  boyfriends, they all tried to figure out which ones were their girlfriends   .  And then they   d bid on it and some of the guys, they   d know what  would happen, they   d run it up on them. They   d keep bidding. But it was  fun times, really. We didn   t know any better, that   s the thing. We  weren   t exposed to anything different so we didn   t know what we were  missing. There wasn   t very much crime then, you know that. Of course,  I guess the way the news is now, you know everything that   s going on  all over the world. But we were out of the community, we didn   t know  much of what was going on anywhere else. Today they fly from one  continent to the other and everything. My god, if we got out of state, we  were a long ways from home.  Probably didn   t do that much.  No, we didn   t do that. No, that   s right. And I remember oh, my aunt, she  took me and two or three of my cousins down to Turner Falls. Oh, I  thought that was a big thrill. We loved that. Then we got into grade  school, we graduated from grade school, why the school teacher took us  down to Turner Falls. After the kids were all small we took them down  to Turner Falls and up above the falls there was   I don   t know what you  call a camping ground, but anyway there was nothing up there and we  set up camps and had the cots. There were some trees up there and there  was a screech owl up there. And the oldest daughter, I don   t know how  old she was, she wasn   t very old. That screech owl let a howl out. Man  alive, she come out of there and she said a mountain lion jumped right in  the middle. We took the kids to Platt National Park down in Sulphur a  lot. Boy, they loved that. They   d get in that cold water and that was a  thrill for them.  Did you worry about the smell?  Well, no. Of course, the smell was on down west of there. So the other  water was coming out of the creek. It was nice and cool, in fact it was  cold. And Jerry, he was a daredevil. He was always getting into  something. At that power plant over at Anadarko we lived in Chickasha  and oh, he was in second grade I guess, something like that. They had  those pools where the kids were supposed to stay down in the shallow  areas. Well, Allene and I were sitting over there and they   ve got a high  board up there. And I just kind of glanced up. I said,    That looked like  27  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Jerry going down.    And man, wait a minute, here he come. He   d jumped  off the high board up there. He didn   t dive, he just jumped off.  I   ll tell you, we went down to Sulphur one time and then I had a motor  but didn   t have a boat. I   d put that motor in the back of the car and rent a  boat. We were going to camp out on the other side of the lake, so I  rented a boat and put the motor on. I got Jerry and he was just a little  guy, I told him, I pointed it over to an area where it was to go. I said,     Now take off and go over there. We   ll meet you.    So I got back to the  car and started it up and she said,    Where   s Jerry?    He was about 200  yards out across the lake. Oh, she gave me a tongue lashing for letting  him. Yeah, Jerry was always pretty aggressive. Everyone liked him,  though.  He   s athletic, too.  Yep, yeah, oh yeah. He was really athletic. I guess one of the first things,  the kid next door was two years older than him. I was home one  weekend, and this kid, if Jerry wouldn   t do something to suit him, why  boy, he   d just box him. He   d send him home bawling. Well, that  happened two or three times. I said, well something   s got to happen  here. I took Jerry out the back and I gave him some instruction and told  him what to do. I did a little boxing in the Navy and FAA. Anyway,  nothing happened the rest of the weekend. Come back Monday  afternoon and the next door neighbor, she came over. She was eating on  Allene, she said,    Jerry beat up on Roy Lee     Roy Lee never did mess  with him after that.  Jerry, when he was young, he   d make an area out in the  ball field. He   d  kind of sull up, he   d go out and he wouldn   t hustle. So we were on the  way home and I said,    Jerry, I don   t care if you go out there and every  ball that comes out there you make an error. Or if you go up there and  strike out every time. If you   re putting out and doing the best you can,  that   s great for me.    But I said,    Now I   ll tell you, if you   re going to  play, you   re going to do the best you can do all the time.    And I   ll tell  you, from then on, he was   and you know back then, of course he  changed school from Norman to Chickasha and Chickasha back to  Norman and then to Lindsay. Every time he   d change schools, of course,  there   s always a bully, you know. He   d have to fight the bully at every  school. I guess he was lucky enough to have won all of them, or most of  them anyway.  As I understand it, in high school you pitched a good game against the  Capitol Hillers?  Oh, yeah, I did pretty well. Capitol Hill back then, it was about like  28  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Jenks or something now. They won the State Championship about all the  time and in just about every sport. They were real good. They had an  American Legion team, I think, Moser   s American Legion team. And  just about all the Capitol Hill kids were on that team. They   d win the  American Legion championship about every year. Oh, I say about every  year, they were good every year, I   ll put it that way. But talk about that  game though, they got one hit. The old boy, he hit it hard, I   ll have to  agree to that. Went by the second baseman, he let it get by him. And it  went to the outfielder, he come in and tried to scoop it up and it got by  him and went to the fence. And that boy got a home run  We got beat  one to nothing. I didn   t have much smoke, you know, but I had a real  good control. And I did real well as far as high school and even when I  played for the Indians. I played American Legion ball. That was when I  played Tecumseh one time. I couldn   t throw very hard, but I had good  control. I had a little movement on the ball. I heard them talking over  there, talking on the side. That old boy, he was a real good athlete and he  could hit the ball. They were talking to the boy and said,    You tear him  up.    Well, I got up there and I didn   t give him anything to hit at. Left  hand side, outside and he didn   t get a hit either.  Did many people come out and watch?  Yeah, they had a pretty darn good crowd. It sure was. And I know  American Legion, I was always pretty fast and so I got a hit and got on  first. We were playing American Legion ball and we were playing  Tecumseh. I stole second, I stole third, and I had home stole. Except,  there was two outs, and that old boy had two strikes on him. He reached  out over the plate and swung at that thing and it was out of the   oh it  was even a foot off the plate. And of course, I was home safe but he was  already out before I got there.  Did they have uniforms?  Oh yeah, we had uniforms. And I was telling the wife the other day I  come off the farm and went to Norman high school. Boy those showers,  you know, that was something else. First shower I had ever had  Yeah,  nice uniforms and so on. I thought I was uptown.  Did the Indian team have uniforms, too?  Yeah, they had uniforms. Most of the time it was kind of makeshift  uniforms. A lot of times it wasn   t even the same uniform, same name on  it or anything.  When you were going to elementary school, did you walk or ride or  how   d you get from home to school?  29  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Well, most of the time I rode the horse to school.  Even that young?  Oh yeah. I rode a horse to school the first time I went to school, grade  school, when I was in first grade.  And then just tied it up and rode him back?  Tied him up and rode him back home. We   d get out and have a horse  race during the lunch hour.  So other kids did too, then?  Yeah, some others rode their horse. When I first went from Blackburn to  South Gale, Blackburn was a two room. I was telling you it had the  folding doors in between. South Gale was one big room but there were  75 people over there and that one room, one teacher. And they had one  old boy that was 21 years old and they had another one that was 19 years  old, in grade school. Of course, that was about    27 or    28 or something  like that. And too, like I was telling you before, the Indians come in with  those Pendleton shirts on and driving a nice    29 Chevrolet. It was  different back then, that   s for sure.  Was the house you grew up in two stories?  No, it was a single story. And you know back then, they didn   t have any  insulation. And boy, it got cold in the wintertime and it got hot in the  summertime. And of course back then, the houses all had a lot of  windows. But the wind didn   t always blow.  Well in the winter, you didn   t want it to.  Oh yeah. In the wintertime you didn   t want it to blow. Back up in the  panhandle, there were some neighbors down in Lindsay. They lived up  in the panhandle area and he worked for Philips Petroleum. And he said,     You can shut those windows, doors, everything and the next morning,  the sand would be piled up on the window sill, under the door and  everything.    And one old boy was talking about, they had a house and a  lot of times they just put blocks or rocks or something under it for a  foundation, instead of a foundation. Well, they put linoleum on the floor  and that wind would blow and that linoleum would just jump up and  down.  And another reunion there at Norman High School one time, two guys  were talking over there. And one of them   s talking about the Depression,  30  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  he said,    You know, I didn   t get but one pair of shoes a year when I was  young.    And this other boy said,    Man, I never got a new pair of shoes  until I was 16 years old. I wore them walking backwards to look at my  tracks.    He probably wasn   t too far off, either. You know, you handed  down. If you had a big family, as soon as one kid outgrew his overalls,  why there was one younger than him and they   d fit him then.  Were shoes the same way?  Shoes were the same way. Everything. Boy, you didn   t throw anything  away that was good. It was put to use. Of course, I was seven years older  than my brother, and my sisters were even younger than that so I didn   t  have much to hand down.  You got newer.  Yeah, most of the time I got new stuff.  Did you have very many family gatherings at the farm?  Oh my grandpa and grandma, they lived in Franklin, Oklahoma. He had  a big two story house and they had eight children and, of course, all the  grandchildren. We   d gather down there and have a big meal and cookout  and play games. In fact we got one of the pictures   Jerry, I think it  showed him, he   s short. He was probably three years old, something like  that, in the last picture.  Did the carnivals come through town?  Yeah, that was before the Depression. My folks took me to the Ringling  Brothers, I believe it was, some circus. And man, I thought that was  something. Of course, after the Depression, all that stuff went by. Dad  had had a new Ford car, Model T. The Depression came, why he had to  sell that to get some money.  And did you go to county fairs?  I don   t remember going to county fairs when I was small. We went to  the State fair a time or two but I don   t remember ever going to county  fairs.  Your mother didn   t enter any of her cans or pies?  No, she didn   t enter any. My mother, she wasn   t very outgoing, you  know. She was kind of shy. Dad, he was just the opposite. He was really  outgoing and full of bologna and so on. But Mother, she kind of stayed  31  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  to herself. She really wasn   t outgoing.  Too busy canning.  She knew how to can. You know, she was the only child though. And  I   ll tell you, she wasn   t a very good cook. Dad, I don   t know how come,  boy he always bragged about how good his biscuits were. He said,    I  taught her how to cook.     Well your wife will be teaching you how to cook biscuits next, won   t  she?  Well, I already know how. I take them in the bags, you know. I take  them out. I put some spray on there, put them on there and put them in  the oven.  Cheater biscuits.  Yeah. And cornbread, I use the Jiffy mix. I put an egg and a little milk  and put it in the oven.  Jerry had told us to ask about the Indian stomp dance?  Oh yeah. We used to go up to the Indian Stomp Dance. And what they   d  do, they had logs all around. Didn   t have benches or chairs or anything  like that. You sit on those logs. They   d build a big fire out in the middle  you know, and of course those Indians, they   d stomp dance all around it.  And there were certain dances, if Indians had a white friend why we   d  get to dance with them, you know. Of course, there were a lot of them  we weren   t allowed to dance with them. And too, I don   t guess you   ve  ever seen the Indians    ballgame. I don   t know what they called it but it  was kind of like soccer. The boys would play the girls. They had clubs  and I mean they   d get rough out there. I don   t know how the ladies stood  up to that. It was a rough game.  So anybody could go to the stomp dance, or you had to be invited?  Anybody could go, but you had to be invited to participate. When I was  playing ball, I played against Jim Thorpe   s son. Over there, the Jobson  Indian we   d call him. He was a   let   s see what tribe was they from? But  Jim Thorpe   s son, he wasn   t near the athlete his dad was though.  They lived in Yale and Prague.  Yeah. Well they had a   I can   t remember the name of that tribe. It   s  over Northeast of Shawnee.  32  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  The Sac and Fox?  The Sac and Fox. You   re right. That   s it.  Well your dad played and you played, so     Yeah, well for a long time I was the only white man on the team. Then  he played a couple of years with us. He was the next white man, and the  oldest.  And when you played baseball, you stayed with your aunt and uncle  in   ?  Dad told me when I went to high school, I   d like to have played a lot of  sports, but he said,    You can pick one sport.    I had an uncle and aunt  that stayed in town. He said,    You can stay in town for that one sport.     So I chose baseball. You always had something to do. And, I guess, he  figured I probably might get into mischief or something if I stayed in  town too much.  Did you have to share a room with brothers?  With cousins.  But in your house?  Oh, in the house? Well yeah, everybody had to. You know too, in the  wintertime, I was telling Jerry the other day, Mom had a rock just almost  as big as a football, a round shape just like a football. I don   t know  where that came from. But she would put that, in the middle of the day  or the evening or something, on the heating stove and get that warm, and  then she   d take a blanket, wrap that blanket around it, and then she   d put  it down at the foot of the bed. Boy, you   d climb in that bed. Of course,  there wasn   t any heat in those bedrooms. Man, that felt good.  Did she do one for each bed?  Yeah, one for each bed. Sometimes they   d put those old irons, you   ve  seen them. I   ve got a couple of Grandmother   s. It   s got a handle. She  had two of them. She   d put them on the stove and get them all hot and  she used one until it   d get a little cold. She   d take it and put it back in  the stove and then she   d put that handle in the next one and she   d iron  until it was cold. I   ve got a couple of her old irons.  Those are heavy.  33  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Yeah, they are. And the kitchen stove was a big range. They had a big  black kettle and they   d pull an eye off the top of that stove and that  kettle would just fit down in that. That   s what they heated their water on.  And then they had a reservoir in the back. That heat going through, why  it would warm up enough water to wash the dishes and everything in.  So heating wasn   t as big an issue as refrigeration then?  Yeah, yeah. That   s right.  Did you have an ice truck come?  Well, not out where we were at. In town, my uncle and aunt, what they  did, I was telling Jerry the other day. They had a little old placard about  a foot square and they would have    25 pounds,       50 pounds,       100  pounds    on there and you   d put the right card up out in the front. The ice  man, he   d come around, he   d bring it up to the house and knock on the  door and he   d come in. And it wasn   t a refrigerator, it was an ice box.  He put that ice in the box, you know. Of course, out in the country,  about the only time we got ice was when we were going to make some  ice cream or something like that. Dad would go to the store and buy a  big chunk of ice. A 100 pound chunk of ice probably didn   t weigh 50  pounds by the time it all melted.  That was a real treat.  Oh that was, that was a real treat. Yes sir, it was.  And then you had watermelon chilled in the creek, instead of other ways.  Oh yeah, watermelon, you talk about that. Then we had so many  watermelons, we   d just bust that watermelon. All we   d eat is the heart.  We didn   t eat any of the rest of it. You know the heart, a lot of those big  old watermelons have a heart that     No seeds and really sweet.  Oh, it had a lot of seeds.  The heart though?  Oh yeah, just the heart of it. That   s right. Oh that was really good. And  too, they had some out in the cotton patch. We   d be picking cotton in the  fall and it would have pretty cool nights. You   d come up on one of  those watermelons out in the cotton field. Oh you   d bust that open, it   s  still pretty cool but it wasn   t cold by any means. But it was cool and  34  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  Finchum  Gill  good eating.  So you had to pick a lot of cotton, too?  Well, I didn   t pick too much cotton. I wasn   t very good at picking  cotton. My dad, he could really pick that cotton.  It would take a lot of work and pulling a bag behind you.  That   s right. They said they used to have those big cotton fields and  those people would get the colored people to come in and pick the  cotton.  Did what you had to do, I guess.  You had to do what you had to do, that   s right.  Well, have we forgotten to cover anything?  I can   t think of anything. I think we   ve covered about everything.  We   ve gone through most of my questions.  Well good.  Well thank you for coming today, it   s been great.  Oh you   re welcome. It   s a pleasure.  -------  -------
