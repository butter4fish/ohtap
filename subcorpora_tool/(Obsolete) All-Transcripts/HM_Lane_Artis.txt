Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a story behind your first name, Artis?  Is it--?
Speaker 2: My mother listened to God a lot.  She loved the name.  She heard of someone whose name was A-R-D-I-S, that's the usual spelling and she loved the sound of the name.  It wasn't that she predicted that I'd be an artist, she just--on my birth certificate it's A-R-T-I-S.  Thank heaven there wasn't a "t" on the end cause I get teased that, because I am an artist--
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?

Speaker 1: Okay.  Last question is in this set is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have two.  The first one my grandmother said to me, us, "If it's only a board if it's clean."  She was a cleanliness person.  She was obsessed with cleanliness.  And my own was, "Rise above it, whatever affects you rise above it.  Anything negative rise above it."
Story_ID: 18396
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Julia Marie Shreve, Shadd--I'm sorry, Julia Marie Shadd, she was born a Shadd.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her married --
Speaker 2: Married--
Speaker 1: --married name was Shreve?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charles Albert Shreve, her husband, my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what year was your mother born in and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Oh dear.  She was born in North Buxton [Ontario].  I'm ashamed to say I don't know the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '27 [1927]?  I have to know that.  I'll send it to you.
Speaker 1: Was she born after the turn of the century or was she born before?
Speaker 2: Well she was 20 when I was born and I was born in '27 [1927].  That makes her--
Speaker 1: 1907.
Speaker 2: --born in 1907.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  Okay.  And well what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well they can be traced.  I myself cannot do it.  There is a whole family tree.  But the--I can say that with my mother I only knew her parents.  I did not know her grandparents.  Flavius Shadd was her father and her mother was Mary--all I know is Shadd.  Her Christian name was O-R-R, I think.  Mary Orr.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right now these are the--I'm not asking you necessarily if you, you know about the ones that you knew but could you tell us something about the, the Shadds?  They're pretty famous in black history these--Abraham Shadd and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Abraham Shadd was the father of Mary [Ann] Shadd Carey and he was born in Delaware, came out of Delaware.
Speaker 1: He would be your great-great-great (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right, three back.  He partnered with the white abolitionist, [William Lloyd] Garrison.  Now I have an uncle named Garrison Shadd, named after him.  So often in the village where I was born, North Buxton, they would talk with pride about my great-great aunt Mary Shadd Carey.  At that time I was quite young and don't remember references to Abraham Shadd.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Mary Ann Shadd Carey, now I know you know, you can tell us something about her just for the record here.  What, what are the family stories about her?
Speaker 2: Oh my well, to differentiate between the Shreves and Shadds, did you ask about--you'll get to my hus--my father's, Shreve--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll get to his side, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well the Shadd family, large boned, quite fair, very--quite vocal, quite silent, very stoic in the sense those who are talkative were talkative, those who were silent were like granite.  They had, because in that all black village there was sort of a standard of lightest, that paper-bag whatever called down to the darker family, they were the fairest.  My father was of, of a darker lineage.  But I do know that they stressed education.  We were encouraged to either stand, sit, in that first row or be dishonored.  It was scholastic abilities.  That was the highest achievement you could have, education.  They were almost like isolated from the rest of the village in the sense that they were like the colonel of--I once worked in Bloomfield Hills out of Michigan where there was a colonel.  The--my uncle Garrison was called the colonel.  There was like the, the, in the forefront of the community.  Very reserved I would say.
Story_ID: 18397
Speaker 1: Well they had been leaders and the family moved from Connecticut to Canada during, just before the Civil War [1861-1865] about ten--around 18 --
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --1840s or [1850] '50s?
Speaker 2: That's right and they were encouraged because they had--were considered wealthy.  A shoemaker, Abraham Shadd had inherited a shoemaker's business but the writing aspects of it had to do with Mary [Ann] Shadd [Carey] being educated by the Quakers and wanting to be a teacher to those slaves who were able to get into Canada.  And she was trained as a teacher.  She taught in New York and Detroit [Michigan].  But her speaking abilities and her writing abilities I think were her gift.
Speaker 1: Right.  She, she toured the United States and Canada on behalf of the cause of abolition in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --1850s.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: She was well known as a public speaker and a--
Speaker 2: And praised by--Frederick Douglass has written about her, praised her as a speaker, very strong speaker.  W.E.B. DuBois described her as--she was also a very attractive lady but mostly her intelligence I think and her zeal and her zest for moral standards.  She became a--in many instances others in the black community were wanting to be separatists.  She believed that the greatest way to advance would be to be accepted in the whole community, including Caucasian and those who were opposed to her on that issue.  She had to fight that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well she was famous--she was an editor of the Provincial Freedmen and--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, you want her full history--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well that's, that's, that's significant.  She was the only black woman that was an editor--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of a major paper.
Speaker 2: North America--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --South America.
Speaker 1: I think, think she was the only woman--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --editor of a paper in those days.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Our claim to fame in my family was that she was a writer.  In fact my grandfather, Flavius Shadd wrote a column for the Chatham [Ontario, Canada], all white newspaper in Chatham coming from the influence of his aunt, Mary  Shadd Carey.  He would write about our history.  He wanted so much to come south because he wrote, exchanged letters with other people who had been in the freedom movement and was turned away at the border.  I'll never forget he was a broken man when he came back.  And so they took him, had a celebration when he left North Buxton [Ontario, Canada] to come to the border and they would not let him cross the border because he refused to sign as a Negro in his passport.  He said that's a bastardized name.  It isn't.  It is an English German and he fought against that, but he was refused admission into the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also, just one thing about Mary Ann Shadd Carey, she was, I think she was the first black woman lawyer in the United States?
Speaker 2: First lawyer student.  She, she studied at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Went through the four years because they never, they had never had a female student.  They did not allow her to be recorded as the first student.  It was that next year another female student was acknowledged as the first.  But she did, was the first to actually--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The first student but she wasn't allowed to be the first graduate?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well that's, you know so it's been established you come from, on your, on that side it's an illustrious history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Shadds are you know, were all involved in all, all aspects of abolition.
Speaker 2: And continue to be.  A number of my cousins are still working at the museum there in North Buxton, that's family, Shadds in Chatham as well.
Story_ID: 18398
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Julia Marie Shadd] talk about growing up now, in, in [North] Buxton [Ontario, Canada]?  Did she tell you anything about what things were like when she was a little girl growing up there?
Speaker 2: I had to beg her to write a letter to--and I distributed it amongst all my--I have three sisters and a brother.  And the stoic side of them that the, the quiet suffering or elation, you just didn't laugh loudly, you didn't express yourself in a very enthusiastic way.  It was just sort of a gentle quiet.  But you sensed a very strong presence so that when she wrote she described what had once been a forest practically, had been so chopped--the wood chopping, the lumber business was so important in that area that by the time I was raised there and it was just merely a woods.  Because we acquired, my grandfather [Flavius Shadd] acquired over a 100 acres outside of North Buxton and a lot of that was farming and lumber--and picking berries.  The rural area the--was really impressed with the home that my grandfather built for his bride, my grandmother [Mary Orr Shadd].  They had been raised in a log cabin and he built this magnificent two-story raised home that always had a, an unusual silhouette so that you could always come driving back from Ann Arbor [Michigan] to North Buxton, this home outside North Buxton was, it seemed so grand at that time, nothing like it, two-storied and special architect in the detail, the wood, the choice of woods, materials.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your mother grew up in this big house?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wore the white gloves.  I have a beautiful photograph of she and my aunt, very, dressed very properly.  They had, because of their background being one of affluence, relatively speaking affluence, they held to that image and carried it off beautifully.
Story_ID: 18399
Speaker 1: I started get into the Shreve side because when my father [Charles Albert Shreve] came to court my mother [Julia Marie Shadd] she --
Speaker 2: Well, how did they meet?  I mean what, what's your father's full name?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Charles Albert Shreve.
Speaker 2: Charles Albert Shreve and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: It would have been two years before her birth which was--
Speaker 2: Okay, so 1905.
Speaker 1: --'5 [1905].
Speaker 2: So was he born in North Buxton [Ontario, Canada] too?
Speaker 1: Outside of North Buxton--  There are many outlying rural homes because they farmed and the village itself was just one road cutting through the main road.
Speaker 2: How much do you know about your father's side of the family, do you know?
Speaker 1: Not as much as the Shadd side unfortunately because every year they'd have a Shadd reunion.  And more recently my sister, Delores Harold has encouraged history and reunions for the Shreve family and it was only then that I was able to know more about him than I had before.  I knew my great grandmother, Grandma Dyke.  I can still see her.  She lived to 104, tiny little lady with a wisp of white hair.  And her daughter, my grandmother, Elizabeth Shadd [sic, Shreve] was very perky, very tiny.  The Shadds were tall, large bones, Shreves small and darker family.  Not that much darker but--and not as wealthy.  I speak of wealth in a relative term.  The village itself was not that prosperous.  They had a lot of acreage and farmed and did business with the white gentlemen farmers in that area.
Speaker 2: And just for the record, North Buxton was founded by Reverend William King--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: --I think in the 1840s [1849].  He was a, a white planter from one of the Southern states that took his whole group up, he took a group of blacks that he freed actually up to Canada and formed this model settlement.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there's been a biography of William King written by Victor Ullman and I think, you know a lot of information about William King. And he was one of the prominent abolitionists of the 19th century.  So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I always heard about the queen [Queen Victoria] who appointed a Lord Elgin.  I, I was born in Elgin County, Essex County, the Raleigh Township, all these English names and so that Mr. King, although I heard about him the royal or English names given that area were more, predominant in history.  And I know one story of a white slave owner who, because he loved his mulatto mistress, brought her out there, established her and went back to his home.  Things like that, that were sort of romanticized but when you look at it from another point of view it was as though it were as, just that he had actually deserted her.
Speaker 2: Yeah there are stories about Canada being a vacation site for Southern planters in the 19th century.  They would often go to Canada for a vacation.  It was cooler there.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: Then go back South in the wintertime.
Speaker 1: Yes.  We were only five miles from Lake Erie so that a lot of the properties, vacation spots were along the lake, beautiful.  A lot of Canadians are known for their gardening and I remember every summer vacation we would go cherry picking, strawberry, peaches, all that beautiful produce that came from there we experienced it.  We didn't, we weren't pickers of cotton, we picked the produce that was, that came from the Canadian colder region.
Speaker 2: I'm going to ask you, I want to move on to the rest of your life but I--we do ask about these ancestors.
Speaker 1: Yes, I wish I knew more.
Speaker 2: But are there any stories from either side of the family that are passed down about any of your ancestors on that side or any, any incidents that happened in Canada you know in those villages that come down as like an interesting story?
Speaker 1: Oh, we had a horrible fire.  My grandmother [Elizabeth] on the Shreve side witnessed her young husband burn to death.  Ran screaming from the house and no one was there to save him.  But she watched as he burned and, that's grandma Elizabeth Shreve who remarried later, much later, one of the suitors she had chosen the first as husband, Mr. Shreve and when she married a Mr. Vincent.  That's the grandfather I knew.  But that whole village lived in a very primitive manner and they also would come to the barn raising.  I, I do remember those occasions when my grandfather [Flavius Shadd] raised his, the largest barn in that region and the farmers who came there, they--I'll never forget the pageantry when maybe thirty or so farmers would come and my grandmother and the ladies, the wives would fix pan, pans of the chicken pot pies, chicken in the pan, the cobbler, peach cobbler, a huge feast on these long benches that were built into tables and, and benches.  And how after dinner the women would all congregate in a home and the, the men who had helped the farmers, the males, would go fight and talk politics.  And I know that as an artist I was allowed to listen to the politics, to all that was going on.  And the men's--I preferred male conversations over the female gossipy sort of things.
Story_ID: 18400
Speaker 1: Were you drawing pictures as a child--?
Speaker 2: All my life.  Preschool--I have an aunt, Viola Shadd, my mother's [Julia Marie Shadd] younger sister who was quite adept at drawing.  I'll never forget a painting she did of a basket of flowers.  I can still see it in my mind and that idea of being an artist, there's a, [Peter Paul] Rubens, a print of Rubens' painting of the, 'The Madonna and Child.'  And before school every summer vacation we would come and stay on my grandmother and [grand]father [Flavius] Shadd's home and she had no toys for us to play with but she did have a broken doll.  And she gave me that doll to play with.  Instead I took that doll down near this stream that ran through that 100 acres and there was a place we called the Siamese Park.  There was a tree that was Siamese in form.  And something told me to do a likeness of that doll.  No one, I mean I couldn't have been more than five and a half.  No one had told me and my aunt who was the artist has never forgotten that story.  She's still in her 90s now and always has a respect for the gift I was given.
Speaker 1: Did you do a sculpture of the doll or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I sculpted in the clay from that just off the stream near the park--always off by myself off creating.  And so that what--from an artist's point of view the lineage there from my aunt.  We had, there are two other sisters who were just as gifted as I was but preferred to go toward education.  They became teachers and then family therapists and gave up that gift.  But I stayed with it and made a profession of it, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so from the time you were a little girl you were creating.
Story_ID: 18401
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what are some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know I'll never forget seeing a giant turtle.  There were ditches along the road leading out of this village [Buxton, Ontario] and I don't know where it came from.  It must have been over a 100 years old, huge turtle, snapping turtle.  We were just children.  And I remember in order to do a short cut through to get to our house--we're talking miles we had to walk from my grandfather's home [Flavius Shadd] to the village.  And trying to cross this pasture, this, at an angle to short cut getting there and here was this herd of cattle with this bull that was, and we had to run back.  And I remember another time a plague of grasshoppers terrified us.  The sounds, we went to Ann Arbor [Michigan] during the Depression [1929] years so that when we returned to that farm area we were city kids by that time.  And the sounds, the crickets, the, there were bats that, that lived in trees.  A fox had gotten into my--my grandmother took care of the, the garden, a little like a victory garden and, and the chickens and a, a fox had gotten into the henhouse.  Little things like that that you wouldn't have no idea happening in a city.  The long distances, I remember my uncle Art Alexander was a principal of this two-room school house when we came back from Ann Arbor.  Two-room schoolhouse, he was a principal in one room and my teacher was in the other.  His son, Ronald Alexander who was just retired as a film, professor of film at Stanford University [Stanford, California], he would--we would get behind him in those cold winters.  We had to shovel our way out of the, to get to the main road.  The snow could be so high over the front door.  And trailing behind him snuggling, trying to walk, he'd cut the path through to the school which was over three miles away from their home.  Oh, I remember in the school they would create an ice slide and the, and the older children would do this crack the whip on the Thames River which is right nearby, hayrides.  We lived that.  I'm so sorry that my granddaughter can't experience those wonderful days of all the Grandma Moses pictures you see, we lived it, um-hmm.
Story_ID: 18402
Speaker 1: Tell us about Raoul Abdul.  That's your cousin right?
Speaker 2: All right.  Well yes, but we thought of him as Peter Pan because he used to come every summer and visit there.  He used to stay with his aunt Mary.  And his father was East Indian as, he had come through that all-black village [North Buxton, Ontario, Canada], fallen in love with his mother and they married.  So he was half East Indian and half African Canadian which is very unusual, very unusual.  But he would perch himself up in a tree and we had to all gather around like Peter Pan and Wendy and he would tell us stories.  He would regale us with one story after the other, make them up or knew them.  And so we didn't realize that he'd later go on to be this great opera singer, opera teacher, go to Vienna [Austria] every year.  He's still teaching opera, German opera and he's such a talker.  Now he's a Shreve from my father's [Charles Albert Shreve] side and often, not that there was intermarriage but a Shreve would marry a Shadd or a Shadd would marry a Shreve in a little village like that.  So the--we could be related on both sides.  But he's a brilliant man.  He, he writes the column for 'The Amsterdam News.'  A lot of achievers in that little village because his uncle, Art Alexander I was telling you about, he demanded that we have the highest standards in all the spelling bees, all the, any contest in the white city of Chatham [Ontario, Canada] whenever we competed and we did very well--
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said Spencer Alexander is one of your, is your nephew, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Spencer Alexander is one of the children of Arthur Alexander, the son, older son--middle son of this principal, Phillip Alexander who taught in North Buxton School, two room schoolhouse.  Arthur Alexander went on to be a, a war hero, honored, he had to return to England.  He had he, he was, what was that big rush they did into France?
Speaker 1: Oh, Battle of the Bulge?
Speaker 2: Oh wait, would that be it?
Speaker 1: Was that the D-Day [June 6, 1944]?
Speaker 2: D-Day.
Speaker 1: D-Day.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The Canadians were first in--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Normandy when they landed in Normandy, France, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was it.  And he was honored.  I had--so the son of this principal, the second son or rather the third son, Ron [Ronald] Alexander, he became Queen Elizabeth's special--he was the cameraman on her tour across the whole dominion of Canada.  He was honored for that.  He, he was an inventor.  He invented in this little school in order to, to blank his father [Philip Alexander] out, he invented a little, like an intercom situation wire where he could listen to music or any of that.  That's way back in the early what, '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s].  He went on to teach in Ottawa [Canada].  His inventions garnered the interest of Stanford University [Stanford, California] and he accepted the position there in the film division and was just honored recently at Stanford by the students he'd had.  But his beginnings were in that little all black village called North Buxton.
Story_ID: 18403
Speaker 1: That sounds like quite a place [North Buxton, Ontario, Canada] and I've had a chance to visit.  And the people there really keep a warm relationship with each other and they have a reunion every year.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Rosa Parks came there because in, of the honoring of the underground railway she of course was an instigator of that beginning deep in the South in the United States on up into Canada.  And they would take--my sister [Delores Harold] volunteered as a docent on one of those bus trips that students would take up there.  The Canadian government finally after much petitioning, to grant it as a historical site and they put some monies into it.  And now the tourists just flock there.  They had always done it on a smaller scale because a lot of the Canadians would marry, we were considered sort of prize, the girls were very proper, most of them virgins.  So American fellows would date the American girls and come over and marry us.  That, that was what was said, not making any moral judgments.  But my father [Charles Albert Shreve] would go down, and he and other men, Canadian men were very resentful that these young Americans would come over and tried to stone them at the border, the Detroit [Michigan]-Windsor [Ontario, Canada] border.  So a lot of interesting stories came out of that.  Most all of my sisters married Americans.  My brother who was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan preferred Canada's relations with people of color, I'll put it that way.  He chose not to live in the United States when he was 21 and became a Canadian citizen.
Story_ID: 18404
Speaker 1: Well tell us about school.  What school did you attend?  You named it earlier but what was it officially?
Speaker 2: North Buxton School [North Buxton, Ontario, Canada].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was this a school for all grades or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well they had two rooms and ran through--oh dear.  You see I only spent two years there or was it one winter.  So I'm not that familiar.  But I know there was a junior room and, and the seniors so it must have been ready for, they were ready for high school by the time they graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started there then you, you moved to--?
Speaker 2: Didn't start there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the year that we, we were sent back from, out of the United States back to Canada, deported.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you said you know you said that you were, let me retrace this, at the beginning of the Depression around 1930 I guess you--?
Speaker 2: 1929, I was born in '27 [1927].  I was two years old when we moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my father [Charles Albert Shreve] couldn't make a living in Canada during the Depression years.  It affected Canada and I moved there and that's where I first went to school.  In Ann Arbor, Michigan there were very few African Americans or African Canadians in that school but they had a music teacher who was black and I remember being chosen, I thought I had been left out of this whole--at the end of the year they gave a great program and everyone had costumes but me.  And I think because she was African American she had an understanding of what we as students went through.  And here I was crying about why was I left out.  She said you got the star role.  You get to be the person with the water pitcher, we water, I watered the flowers and there were white girls with the flowers and I was the one who got to pour the water on the flowers, little things like that.  She also took us to many of the cultural events, 'Midsummer Nights' Dream' with her own money, pocket money.  She saw to it that we had the best education.  I was put into an advanced school in Ann Arbor for art.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school in Ann Arbor, do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the name of the teacher that helped you out?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: If you don't it's all right.  But--
Speaker 2: No I don't remember names, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she was an old black teacher in that school?
Speaker 2: Yes um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In music of course, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So how long did you live in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was two years old when I went there.  I think we came back when I was seven so maybe five years.
Story_ID: 18405
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, you were starting to tell us how your mother [Julia Marie Shadd] and father [Charles Albert Shreve] met, the story of how they met.
Speaker 2: Oh--Well when he came a-courting it was quite an occasion because being the primary family, first family of that little village [North Buxton, Ontario, Canada] and the Shreves were not considered as affluent, and I had a very proper mother who was always being watched to see that she behaved herself in a very ladylike way.  My father was interviewed by my grandmother, grandfather [Flavius Shadd] rather and he, he was a very free-thinking--the Shreves were to my mind, were very spirited and as I say the Shadds were much more reserved.  And he asked her to go to this school dance, said she danced like she had a broomstick up her back.  She was so rigid, just so afraid of appearances or concerned about that.  But opposites attract and I think that his open, free, loving lifestyle helped warm her up and over the years as we were raised in her way, the younger two children she had was much more open with expressing her feelings for us, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they--and did your grandfather approve of your father eventually or--?
Speaker 2: I wish I knew the full, full story but I just know how very different the two families were and that it carried through in our--it became a matriarchy because my father was, he was overrun with females.  It was a house of women.  He, we had one brother but the matriarch, we were very strong women, daughters and mother and my father became quite quieted by being outnumbered and strong like Mary [Ann] Shadd Carey.  We had that Shadd side to us that really felt equally even equal or rather maybe superior to males, independent, trained to be self-sufficient.

Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Charles Albert Shreve] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was an automobile mechanic.  He learned that when they had to fix their own tractors, their own cars.  It was a gift.  He was, he had the highest IQ in the whole village and they were tested by an Englishman, [Dr. H.A.] Tanser.  I do remember that name.  I'll never forget that man came from England to prove that we were inferior intellectually and it was proved, the lie was proven but he still wrote the book claiming that.  And I found out that later, much later in London, Ontario there are still two white Canadians testing black students, trying to prove that having a smaller brain and cranium whatever yes, and wrote about it in a book, Tanser.  I'll never forget being embarrassed, being sent to the principal's room, school, the principal's office to take these tests and no one else was.  I was the only black student in the room, in high school and it turns out that this same Dr. Tanser was behind this book he was writing to prove--and yet I stood first in the class in school, so just a part of our experience.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story, yeah.
Speaker 2: Actually can, Canada I would say, I'll never forget when I read [Ralph] Ellison's book on 'The Invisible Man,' just, I was like 15, I think reading it in the library but if they only knew that we as African Canadians are even more invisible.  There was an--in Canada there was an aura of denial that we existed.  When I was asked to ship two of my six foot six bronzes later to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto in their history museum there was no mention of even, of the slaves in all of the history.  It was all pure white, French and English.  And that was the first time there was an image installed in their history museum.  I used an African from Benin as my model and they installed that after much pressure actually from the Caribbean the, the people who, islanders who came to Canada and had a festival every year.  And they, they were persuaded to install for one, I think only a week.  Canadian government paid for the two bronzes to be shipped there and then sent back.  So that, that's unknown I think, or seems unbelievable to African Americans that we would be more ostracized than they or as much.  In small numbers, we were so few, there were so few African Canadians, that there wasn't enough pressure put on to acknowledge, even though Canada did invite in the early years of slavery where they need labor, they need the country to be built up, but they tried to close down that migration after many of the white farmers protested.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's the environment that I was raised in, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in, but in the village of Buxton [Ontario] it was basically all black--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Can you imagine, it was a beautiful experience for those two years to be in a predominantly African Canadian community.  Everything was black except the white grocery store.  And the daughter of that white grocery--they're from Scotland actually, Jean, was so in love with my cousin, Arthur Alexander.  And when he went off to the war just before he went off to the war, they were married and I resented that.  I was going through my first afro I had.  I was you know, why didn't he marry a black girl and all of that.  But I learned to love her because she did, was a very devoted wife and how she must have felt as a minority in that all black village.  She was sort of, she was a redhead too and very white skinned and we weren't used to that, although a lot of the African Canadians were so mixed with actually a German settlement that it was mostly--we didn't know about Native American as much as we did African and German mixture.
Story_ID: 18407
Speaker 1: Okay, so you finished school in Chatham [Ontario, Canada]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I obtained a four year scholarship there to study in Toronto [Ontario, Canada].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you were in school--did you get a chance to do your artwork when you were in high school and I mean were you--?
Speaker 2: You know what happened?  I was invited by my public school art teacher to have a tea, they arranged a tea for me to meet the high school art teacher.  Her name is Miss Hall from the public school because of this gift I had, wanted me to meet the art teacher from high school, Alice McCoyk.  And it was Alice McCoyk who fought to give me a scholarship.  They had never given it for art, it was always for law or for medicine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, were allowed, they had, did they have art courses in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were able to--
Speaker 2: Very special art teacher.
Speaker 1: So you were determined to become an artist when you were, you had, you really thought that that's what you wanted to pursue as a--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh no question, preschool on up.  That's, and the name too, the word, unusual name Artis, I'm sure that strengthened that you know encouragement.  But my mother [Julia Marie Shadd] said, "You have to study fine art, not, not fine art but be either a commercial artist or a teacher."  And I said I don't have time in life to teach.  I knew then maybe 14, 15, but I kept devoted to fine art and that I wouldn't have to worry.  I knew that it all would be provided for me.  The gift, the gift you're given comes the audience, the collector, the financial abilities to survive.  I truly have found that in my life.  I've never had to teach.  I have taught but I, it's been a full rewarding profession for me.
Story_ID: 18408
Speaker 1: You had a scholarship to the--?
Speaker 2: I had a, first the four year scholarship was not enough to substantiate my living there on it alone so I also won an Edith Chaplain Scholarship .  But in those days it was only four hundred dollars a year so fortunately my sister [Delores Harold] had gone there to learn to become a teacher.  We boarded in the same room and the little village [Buxton, Ontario] made quilts and things to support our, us to be able to stay in the big city of Toronto [Ontario].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, well what was, were there, there very many, I suppose there weren't that many black students there I suppose?
Speaker 2: I was the only black student in the Ontario College of Art [and Design, Toronto, Ontario, Canada].  I took some classes at Toronto University [University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario] but I'll never forget the day I registered I was the only black and in walks this elegant, dark, gorgeous woman with her father.  Her name was Dorothy Enriquez from Jamaica.  She had this beautiful Jamaican accent and there was so much questioning of what my nationality was.  They'd never had one.  In fact I became queen of the Beaux Arts Ball and they only described me as dusky.  They newspapers didn't know how to describe--they didn't have African Canadian in those days.  So--
Speaker 1: So they had no, no term for you?
Speaker 2: No term.  Colored, you could say that but no title.  And when Dorothy Enriquez came in and with this very superior Jamaican attitude, she'd never been enslaved.  Her whole history was that of a free person.  She immediately was accepted as being superior in a sense just because of her attitude.  I took on a Jamaican accent.  I was so insecure and she found me a date and the four of us would go out and I lived that lie and I would come and go.  And then the fellows--there were only white male students to date and he questioned after, "Why does your accent come and go?"  And I was so, in those insecure days 19 through 21, I didn't get my fourth year there.  No wait, 17, 18, 19, I left the fourth year and married an African American and moved to Detroit [Michigan].  I missed my fourth year but I used that scholarship to study at Cranbrook Academy [of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan], an art academy--
Story_ID: 18409
Speaker 1: How did you meet your first husband [William Clay Lane] from Detroit [Michigan]?  Well he's close by.  I mean he's just right across the--
Speaker 2: He was a writer for an all black newspaper, 'The Michigan Chronicle.'  And he claims that there was another Artis living in Detroit that he had mistaken me for another Artis as far as character.  Because here was this virgin Canadian woman coming over to, as a summer job I took a job as a cosmetologist, a make-up girl for the House of Beauty, an all black beauty school.  And he came, he said to interview me for the newspaper and that's how I met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is, his name is, last name is Lane.  But--
Speaker 2: Bill Lane.
Speaker 1: Bill Lane.
Speaker 2: William Clay Lane.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was from Mississippi so you can imagine the cultural shock to go from Canadian upbringing to quite British influence into Detroit, which is a very progressive city.  They were the first I think politically to rebel and to speak out and of course that newspaper did.  And I joined him in those protests to break the barriers to being served at a bar ad--next to the Fox Theater.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?  What year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: It was my first year of marriage.  It was in the 50s [1950s], we jumped, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was in the early 50s [1950s] then, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I married on Christmas vacation and went back to Toronto [Ontario] to study.  And that summer I took my husband to meet my white art teacher from high school, Alice McCoyek who had fought to get me the scholarship and she refused to let him come in or to meet him.  She was so disappointed in my not going through the four, four years.  But as an art student I was so, like a nun I was so dedicated to art.  I was never going to marry.  I was never going to be a commercial artist.  It was going to be all fine art and, and live this artist life.  And then to have married an American in my third year, she totally disowned me and I'm very, very ashamed of that period of my life.  But I went on to use that fourth year scholarship at Cranbrook Art Academy [Cranbook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan], once I married.
Story_ID: 18410
Speaker 1: Cranbrook's [Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan] a fairly respected art school--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --in the United States anyway--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, the first student there, first black student.  There was another male student who was in the crafts department I believe it was, arts and they had a crafts division but to have studied fine art at Cranbrook it took a struggle.  They accepted my portfolio.  That was taken out to them, not realizing I was a black student.  So I went for my interview, they had accepted, I had an appointment and they turned me down.  And it took Francis Kornegay of the, not NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] but the Urban League to write a letter threatening to make an issue of this and so that when I spent that last year there.  Here I was married and isolated.  The students, one played a joke on me by asking me to borrow my still life over the weekend, students who stayed there.  And I said "It'll rot over the weekend."  "We'll take care of it."  I came back and there it was just ruined with flies and what have you.  And I, I was accused of having left it.  I only left it for them, the student to use and they thought it was quite funny.  Years later they asked to have me as a guest there.  The Booth family, I did a portrait of one of the members of the family.  They paid for me to be flown out here, the Booth family who founded Cranbrook Art Academy, so in a sense they were vindicated with my being honored for one day there, years later.
Story_ID: 18411
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Julia Marie Shadd and Charles Albert Shreve] feel about you marrying a black American from Detroit [Michigan] with a Mississippi origin?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So many tales were told about Americans to black Canadians.  They, they always carried a knife, that they were promiscuous, that they, that's why we weren't allowed to date them.  And my mother fell in love with my, this [William Clay] Bill Lane, he was so, he was handsome but he had such charm.  I think she overcame that prejudice that she might have against Americans.  In fact as a writer he came up and interviewed the whole village [Buxton, Ontario].  He did an article in the 'Michigan Chronicle' about the family.
Story_ID: 18412
Speaker 1: You were telling us about Cranbrook [Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan].  That's where you finally got your bachelor's degree right, in art?
Speaker 2: I don't have a bachelor's degree.
Speaker 1: You don't?
Speaker 2: I don't have any degrees.  I could have gotten one in UCLA [University of California Los Angeles] and I should have.  All we had to do is pay more money and the teacher, the professor at UCLA he actually kind of panned that idea, he was snobbish about masters and bachelors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well how long did you go to Cranbrook?
Speaker 2: Just that last year.
Speaker 1: Just that last--
Speaker 2: I got my four years-- and I went in, not as a senior, but it would have been senior status in Toronto [University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada].
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you weren't allowed to graduate or--?
Speaker 2: No, I had one year at Cranbrook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had three years at Toronto and the final year at Cranbrook--
Speaker 1: Okay, but as a final year but you weren't given a diploma or anything?
Speaker 2: No--
Story_ID: 18413
Speaker 1: What did you do after that year [at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]?  Did you determine to go to a school, I mean to go to another school or did you just, you start (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was married that year, so in order to make a living I started doing what I had done in public school.  In Chatham [Ontario, Canada] I was painting the portraits of the wealthy white children so when I came to Detroit [Michigan] I started doing portraits of the wealthy Caucasians in Bloomfield Hills [Michigan] and Grosse Point [Michigan] but also the prominent African American doctors and lawyers there, judges.  I was commissioned by the Gotham Hotel owner to do many of the major black leaders of that community.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people whose portraits you've painted?
Speaker 2: Done millions, thousands of people.  Names, Dr. [DeWitt T.] Burton was well-known there.
Speaker 1: Was this the white Dr. Burton?
Speaker 2: No black.
Speaker 1: Oh black, okay.
Speaker 2: White, oh dear.
Speaker 1: Well you can tell us the black ones, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Judge Wade [Harper] McCree, Herb Jeffries.  This hotel did blacks, notable blacks of all different professions so that the, the six or ten I did of them, they've left my memory.  They're all prominent African American--
Speaker 1: Well but the--
Speaker 2: --males.  In fact the--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Portraits done of the, that hung in the hotel--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --as sort of a hall of fame (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: -- or wall of fame or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay .
Speaker 2: I don't know where they are today.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of this hotel again?
Speaker 2: Gotham.
Speaker 1: Gotham Hotel.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was a black owned hotel?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 18414
Speaker 1: So you painted portraits for a living?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my husband [William Clay Lane] was this black writer for 'The Michigan Chronicle' was of course very well connected with all the major people in Detroit [Michigan].  Sometimes he would arrange for a commission and then word would spread if they liked the work.  [Dr. Alfred E.] Alf Thomas who was well known to be, he was from Florida I believe.  He was quite prominent.  I did a portrait of his wife and Alf Thomas was very civic minded.  I think in Florida he financed a university.  I don't know his historical background but he--I did most of the major prominent people there.  I did the mayor in Detroit later, a full length life-sized oil painting.
Speaker 1: [Former Detroit mayor] Coleman Young (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Coleman Young and that hung in Cobo Hall [Champaign, Illinois].  The Diggs family, I did a huge portrait of the Senior Diggs [Charles Diggs, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --who had just come back from Africa, made me want to go to Africa and I finally got there just this year.  He brought me back one of the elephant tail bracelets and I had never thought of an African American getting that, going that far away into Africa.  In those years I mean that was, talking the 50s [1950s] and that was unusual, the Gordy family, [Motown Records founder] Berry Gordy, I can't remember names of the other Detroiters.
Speaker 1: What about, now I can't remember.  But what about Judge [Damon J.] Keith and Congressman not Diggs but the other one, John Conyers, the Conyers family?
Speaker 2: John Conyers, wonderful, experienced--he was very helpful in my doing a portrait of Rosa Parks.  He sent me a lot of research.  As you know he invited her to come and share his offices after they received a threat on her life in Montgomery, Alabama.  And that year I was, I really wanted to go down and meet this lady and the newspapers had said that the Polish community had threatened to stone us.  We had to go march through their area to go downtown to this wonderful apartment a doctor had where she was given a reception.  And Huey Lee-Smith, a famous artist and Oliver LaGrone walked on either side of me.  I was divorced at that time and walked, we walked down to meet this lady.  I thought she'd be tall, strong.  Tiny, short as I was and quiet spoken.
Speaker 1: This was in the '90s [1990] right?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: This was in the 1990s, right?
Speaker 2: When she was first--no, much earlier than that.  I'm speaking when John Conyers invited her to leave the South and come to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Oh to leave the South to live, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: She was a seamstress in Detroit for a while too.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is when she was still fairly active and everything?
Speaker 2: Yes--'cause it must have been in the late '40s [1940s], um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is in the--what year do you think this is around--?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957], '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay, so she, yeah I think she came to Detroit not long after the Montgomery (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) was that?
Speaker 1: -- Bus Boycott.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes--She and her husband Raymond [Parks].
Speaker 1: Yeah so that would have been '56 [1956], '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So she, about '57 [1957], '58 [1958] I guess she was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Detroit.
Speaker 2: My daughter was born at [Hutzel] Women's Hospital delivered by oh, Dr. [William Thomas] Love was the one doctor whose wife [Josephine Love] now has a museum for children there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So basically you made a living as a portrait artist and--
Speaker 2: From the minute I married. Left Cranbrook [Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan].  I was invited by another artist to go down with her for an interview to be a portrait artist in the J. L. Hudson Company and unfortunately he chose me, not her.  She thought the two of us would be invited to paint portraits and the man in charge of the galleries, there were three galleries in the J. L. Hudson Company.
Speaker 1: That's a big department store in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, but it had fine art galleries in it and I did a lot of work through the, they had at least a dozen decorators there.  And that was so embarrassing because it's like an actress going in for an interview, takes a girlfriend in and the girlfriend wins the part.  Both of us were struggling, divorced young women.  She had a baby, I had a baby girl.
Speaker 1: So, were how long were you married to Mr. Lane?
Speaker 2: Seven years.
Story_ID: 18415
Speaker 1: So you're working at [J.L.] Hudson's [department store] doing--?
Speaker 2: Well it was freelance.  I mean yes I would do the portraits of those who came in for an appointment.  The decorators, the sales people would set up the appointments and I did portraits there, yes.  And that really made quite a good living for me.  In fact I was earning more than my husband [William Clay Lane].  They don't pay writers much in those days.  But when I was divorced and moved here to Los Angeles [California] it came about through the Cranbrook School [Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan], the Booth family paying for my way to come up and paint one of their family members.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's, so you initially came here to paint one of the Booth family members from Cranbrook?
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is like, when is this?  Is this around 1960?  Is this shortly after you started at Hudsons or--?
Speaker 2: Yes--let's see.  I worked there, I don't know how many years, but my first trip out here I stayed with my ex-husband and his new wife so add that up.
Speaker 1: That's kind of unusual.
Speaker 2: It's unusual but it was, it was--what blesses one blesses all.  It was a blessing for me to be a free artist, let's put it that way working on my own as opposed to a housewife who was, whose whole life had been geared to being an artist, professional artist and who was now set free to go back to my center and still support my daughter as I had during our marriage, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you just, when you came out here to make that, to paint the portrait for the, the Booth family--
Speaker 2: Booth family.
Speaker 1: --yeah, you were determined to stay here.
Speaker 2: I did.  I swore not one more winter would I spend back in the cold Detroit [Michigan] or Canada and moved my belongings out here, found a place.  For a while though I, while I was staying here I took a job as an au pair for a black widow or a widower, Harold, what his name, he had two children so that I was able to have my child with me.  And I created a portfolio, brought it into Universal Studios and made quite a large sum doing renderings, drawings of oh, different, Max Van Sydow for instance, with Julie Andrews.  I did sketches of them aging for that epic called 'Hawaii.'  I've always as I said been able to maintain a living, a living, fairly comfortable living standards for my daughter and myself through art um-hmm, and not having to teach.
Story_ID: 18416
Speaker 1: You painted a representational style.  I mean you're really good at capturing an image of a person pretty much as it--
Speaker 2: Yes, I went through a period of almost expressionist paintings, portraits.  I was always in tune with what was going on in the fine art world.  And a lot of my paintings were of either the impressionist influence, very loose and using complementary colors stacked up beside one another so that the color would vibrate using--I, I devised a method of my own where I included wide brush strokes, wide brush strokes of oil paint for the structure and then hit the paper, the canvas with pastel so it had more depth to it than just a pure pastel.  And I did that because the darker skins, I was never happy with pastels, painting the dark skins so I used the dark umber oil strokes incorporated--and to my knowledge I'm the only artist who has ever done that, combined oil painting with pastel and it was--
Speaker 1: With a, with an oil pastel or chalk?
Speaker 2: No, pure (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did it my first time actually was with Diahann Carroll's daughter, Susan, trying to get that beautiful satiny brown, chocolate brown skin color and that's why I invented that out of necessity-- And I stayed with her maybe for a year in New York [New York], my first time ever went to live in New York I stayed with Diahann Carroll who invited me--I was living in Detroit [Michigan], divorced, went to see 'No Strings.'  She was doing a play called No, a musical--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with Richard Kiley, Richard Kiley and found myself inviting her back after the show to a friend of mine, Dr. Lawson, his home and we've been friends ever since.  I was 27 then.  I'm 77 now.  So over the years we've met in different cities, New York or here in California.  I was the first, I came up before, not before she did but met her, met up again with her out here.
Story_ID: 18417
Speaker 1: Is there anyone that you think, that you can think of that really taught you anything of significance in terms of art because I know a lot of what you've done has been kind of on your own.  Is, in all your years of school was there any teacher or anyone who really taught you anything of significance that really stayed with you?
Speaker 2: Well actually in Toronto [Ontario, Canada] they had the finest art instructors, many of them from Europe.  I asked them why they never had black models, being the first black student there.  Got tired of painting one race and they had never thought of it.  But a teacher who was most influential was this Jans (unclear) at UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I studied with him.  He just blew my mind I mean out of all the conservatism.  And he, his theory was that we are born in a, the theory of a black box.  We're born in a womb box in darkness.  We come out and live in a house box.  We die and we're buried in a coffin box and after that, that's all there is, it's a black hole.  Well I was diametrically opposed to that belief and so we would war those four years, the four years I was with him over this issue because in my study of metaphysics and the belief of an eternal life and that this is only one flash in the whole sense of eternity.  But the approaches he used which were quite avant-garde, he'd pour white paint in one hand, black paint in the other and he tore into your canvas.  You, you--did an expressionist period which took me totally away from any traditional Renaissance way of approaching painting.  And it loosened me to work in a style that I really needed to be more expressive, to be less conservative Canadian and to really vent my feelings on the canvas.
Story_ID: 18418
Speaker 1: So you say you felt that, that being a conservative kind of, coming from a very kind of stiffer kind of family kind of put a, a lid on you I guess until--
Speaker 2: Well I was considered more like my father [Charles Albert Shreve] and that was not a compliment, quite radical and independent.  And I was the first to say I'm not going to attend another funeral.  It's a pagan ritual.  We sang in the choir and had to, all those things that you did I, I thought it was nothing but a pagan ritual because I would know in the community that the, these same people they were talking against, once they, they're sitting there lying in the coffin that they would come out with these glorified adjectives describing them.  It seemed hypocritical to me and that was just a for instance.  But I just was not, not to be held down by that.  And so to get away free to live in Toronto [Ontario, Canada] away from parental conservatism and define my center there, the real Artis who had nothing to do with being held back as a Shadd.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it that religion didn't have, wasn't one of your favorite--?
Speaker 2: Formalized religion was not.  I was very impressed with twins who came through the village [North Buxton, Ontario] when I was very young, very impressed.  And my mother [Julia Marie Shadd] who was a Methodist.  Father was a, not a practicing Baptist so we were encouraged to go to the Methodist school, that's Sunday school and church.  These two ladies they seemed so spiritual, so filled with a, a transcendent kind of joy.  Nothing localized.  I was told they were students of Christian Science.  My--
Speaker 1: Were these two black women?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  My great-great aunt Mary [Ann] Shadd Carey had been raised by Quakers but she never joined or became a part of.  For a while she became Methodist but I was curious about her background because this [William Lloyd] Garrison white abolitionist used to visit the home of Mary Baker Eddy who originated Christian Science, originator of, the founder of it.  But he also visited my family, my, the Shadd family so I know there must have been some sort of discourse speak, they must have talked about one another, Garrison to the black family and Ms. Eddy's family who was accused of being not nigger-lovers but lovers of, of black people that they were looked down on because they were against slavery and that appealed to me.  But this was not a religion it was a science.  It rose above conforming to man's standards or set, ritualism into metaphysics that word was like a freeing word for me that it didn't have to have a denomination, a name behind it.  It was a one on one study of the spiritual reality of our being, not the human mixed with the spiritual.  But like oil and water which do not mix our interpretation of man.  The false one is of the human man and the true definition of man is created in God's image and God being spirit, therefore the definition of man is pure spirit if we are indeed created in God's image.  So that all my work took on the metaphysical aspects of mankind as opposed to the belief most religions have that it's inside a body and that it comes and goes, a mixture of good and evil.  But to aspire to that purity of the image we've inherited would have to be the invisible qualities which really determine what man, the definition of man is.
Story_ID: 18419
Speaker 1: That's how I got into this search for what we would call generic man, the oldest skull being found in Africa.  So I chose an African model as my subject to symbolize all mankind and I worked with women first, with an African American woman who happened to be an athlete, Rene Felton.  And when, she wanted the natural childbirth and when she came into my studio in 18--in 1984 she had already been chosen in Santa Monica [California] as Woman of the Year, young girl from Watts [Los Angeles, California] who wanted to be an Olympic finalist.  And she was chosen in '84 [1984] as the poster girl for Crohn's disease.  She had Crohn's disease and in spite of that she went on to beat the Russian in the Sunkist meet and just missed the final because she had a, had to have an operation and wasn't able to make the finals.  But she became my, a prototype for a strong, black African woman and modeled for me.  And then when this young man Djimon Hounsou came into my life, I met him at Sidney and Joanna Poitier's home at Thanksgiving.  We were always, my husband [Vince Cannon] and I were always invited to their home for Thanksgiving.  Joanna, I was teaching her how to sculpt and how to paint and we bought a [photographer] Herb Ritts book and in that book on man and woman, two separate books was this beautiful, gorgeous African man, Djimon Hounsou.  And she called up the day before Thanksgiving said "Artis, guess who's coming to dinner?"  And it was this Djimon Hounsou.  I met him and he became my model for generic man.
Speaker 2: And he's, subsequently I guess the star of 'Amistad' and many others, yeah.
Speaker 1: Way before 'Amistad' I met him, but yes.  He had done a Moliere play, a French play.  He only spoke French and his own native language and a bit of English.  And my husband and I sort of watched over him that night at the Poitier's home.  Joanna said "Now these, this is a couple who should watch over you (unclear)."  So--.

Speaker 1: But your career has really been sort of just grown here from the days when you were an au pair and trying to get your portfolio together and working at Universal [Studios] and painting portraits of various people.  And it's just sort of, just grown I guess right?  Is that right?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I feel that the deeper I studied metaphysics the more enlarged or more progressive my career became.  And encounters with people who were very well known, charismatic people, political figures, people in the film industry, all of that became a part of this search for the soul of mankind or in doing a portrait it wasn't about a photographic likeness so much getting the feel of them, their individuality.  And so I began to working on three levels which had to deal with portraiture, individual studies and then social injustice when I met Rosa Parks.  I did other things on orphaned children, blind children, during the '60s [1960s] I did a lot of images, the tear on the face of America.  And then as I got more understanding of metaphysics I started my search on my own to create a body of work that dealt with generic man and his rise out of darkness into light, enlightenment until now I have a body of work through body language of the man lying in the field posed of death, darkness, ignorance and rising up in prayer and kneeling then rising up searching for this God, his true identity, and then into a crystal-like figure of the man standing totally balanced on one leg like the Masai who stands watching over the cattle with the staff in a clear, invisible figure in the light in a God presence, in God presence all through the study of metaphysics

Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about some of the people that you've been commissioned to either paint a portrait of or do a sculpture of, you know and just give me your impression of what that session was like and of those people and any stories associated with them.  What about Dorothy Height?
Speaker 2: Oh, Dr. Dorothy Height, before she acquired this building she was wanting so badly she sat for me in the older building and was telling me about her dreams and that she was privy to comment that she made regarding the placement of Mary McLeod Bethune's sculpture on the grounds of the White House is it, in Washington [D.C.], whatever park it's in [Lincoln Park].
Speaker 1: In the [National] Mall?  Was it in the Mall or at the White House?  Well I don't know, go ahead.
Speaker 2: And she, Dr. Dorothy Height had such an input and influence in the political arena that she called and said that Mr. [President Abraham] Lincoln has his back to Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune and they turned it around.  I hope, I think that's a true story but because Dr. Dorothy Height objected to the fact that his back was to the lady once his sculpture of her was installed that they actually turned, repositioned it. But that dream was realized because I believe that the [William H.] Cosby family was a major contributor to the new building that she, of her dreams.  And on occasion when I was there to do the sculpture of Rosa Parks, she invited me to come and look at the portraits that stood side by side, heroic-sized bust of herself and Mary McLeod Bethune who was her mentor.  And she was extremely pleased to have the building and then the two busts because Mary McLeod Bethune had been her mentor.
Story_ID: 18422
Speaker 1: Now you sculpted and painted some of the Hollywood stars like Cary Grant and Charlton Heston and some others?
Speaker 2: Yes, I took my portfolio into Universal Studios through an art director and I only did them not hoping to sell them but to get some work from the studios and make a living and they promptly bought them.  Elke Sommer who is quite a well known artist herself, Rock Hudson, in that era many of the stars had cabins or cottages on the lot there.  And when I painted Cary Grant it was, I was introduced by a Korean lady he--who owned the restaurant where all the stars would go.  And so I got a call, "Artis, he wants you to come over to his cottage," and I walk in with the portrait and it was just about pre-dinner time.  And he look at the, had a look at the portrait, said "Have you had dinner?"  And I said no.  I cancelled--he cancelled his own dinner at home and took me to this Anna Ko the Korean girl who had told him about me.  I'm sitting there in the restaurant.  I had never sat with such a, an icon or a living legend.  One woman came over to my table, insisted that she knew me at, to our table.  And he said young lady we were--he had owned a champagne company up north and wine company and said "Young lady you can have one drink and then you can go back to your table," because it was obvious that I, she had pushed herself on us.  And we became very good friends, a confidant.  He married Dyan Cannon, who asked my husband [Vince Cannon] to manage her career.  She saw what he was doing with mine and we would get different calls from him.  They divorced shortly after they married and he returned the portrait he commissioned me to do of her in exchange for a little boy's, a study of a little boy, unhappy to, unable to live with that portrait.  But the kind of friendship was just--he was very deeply into metaphysics believe it or not.  But going through that LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide], a series of treatments under supervision and so we'd have strong arguments about that against it.  Anything that altered the mind I felt dishonored the God mind we are given so we would go round and round about--discussions that other people don't know about.  There have been many books written about him but my husband called him the, encouraged him to accept the Oscar [Academy Award] cause he was very upset that they did not give an Oscar to a leading man when dealt with comedy, romantic comedy and felt that they should, that that was just as serious an art as the dramas.  So over the years even into when Jennifer was born she would come to our house to do the homework.  He would call because of the views he had on women, very old traditional opinions about a woman's hair shouldn't be so, over a certain length after a certain age and that very few women in the film industry maintained their femininity because of the pressures put on them.  They ended up almost talking like men you know they had to be balls-y and that one of the few--I asked him if he ever went, had a friend--"Do you have any black friends?" I said to him.  And he said, "Joe Louis because I was also a boxer.  We got to be good friends and Count Basie [William Count Basie]"--because I always challenged people when they claimed to be liberal, "Do you have any friends of color," you know?  That for me is a, a test of sorts.  You could seek them out if you're a race that's more accepted I think it's the responsibility of the white race to make an effort to develop a friendship with people of other races rather than remain in that clique and still maintain your liberal (unclear) open.
Story_ID: 18423
Speaker 1: You had a chance to create a work, a portrait of Charlton Heston and his wife [Lydia], I believe right?
Speaker 2: Well I was commissioned by the International Art Association to do him.  I didn't choose to paint Charlton Heston.  And he claimed to be an artist himself.  He was directing me not to leave out--he was very proud of this broken nose in one of the battle scenes in one of his biblical films he had done.
Speaker 1: Was it 'Ben-Hur' or something--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact, but his wife Lydia was a fine art photographer who whenever he'd go on location in Egypt she did some fantastic photographs of Egyptian, the culture and used a certain darkroom technique that presented a very strange, unusual image, not the typical, pretty photograph--
Story_ID: 18424
Speaker 1: You had a story about Ronald Reagan too I think you--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, that was another.  I was commissioned to do him for the library, Ronald Reagan [Presidential Foundation and] Library museum [Simi Valley, California].  So the sittings though were given in his office I, he posed for me in his office and when I walked in there he, with the finished bronze or rather the wax, I work in wax, it was--I add black oil paint to the wax.  He said, "I used to be as black as that when I was a lifeguard," and he said "Come look."  And he showed me a photograph of a trunk of a tree just near the water's edge that had seventy-some notches in it that he had saved those many lives.  He was a very personable man.  I didn't at all agree with his politics or any of his stands or lack of stands against apartheid, lack, reticence there to deal with that.  And, but as I say, charming man, given to little anecdotes.  Told me about photo technique to divert the others in the group to it and then stare into the camera because people rifling through newspapers they always are drawn to a photograph where the person is looking directly at them, little light things.
Story_ID: 18425
Speaker 1: What about Nelson Mandela, now you had a chance to-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, Quincy Jones commissioned me to do a portrait with both he and Winnie Mandela, but later I was asked to do a separate one because they did separate and then divorce.  But when Nelson Mandela was here, Lindiwe Mabuza, who became the ambassador to Germany for South Africa got us an audience, private audience, my husband [Vince Cannon] and I with him at the [Regent] Beverly Wilshire [Hotel, Beverly Hills, California] and his daughters had flown in to surprise him.  And to see him the father side of him was just such a privilege.  And I later just last year went to South Africa and visited Robben Island where he had been.  And I, the years before when I first met him in California I asked him what sort of sustained him over those 27 years and he said the 'Christian Science Monitor' was at that time the most reliable newspaper to get reports on what was going on out in this world outside.
Story_ID: 18426
Speaker 1: Now what about the Kennedy piece that you did, a portrait of Kennedy, of John F. Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Well I was supposed to do portraits of the children just before the assassination [1963] and I was watching television when they were in Dallas [Texas] and stopped what I was painting and started working just from this, the replay, replay, replay, crying and painting at the same time.  I have never been able to part with that painting but it, it captured all that Camelot image, later when we heard about other aspects when the press went after his private life and all of that.  As an artist you strive to, as a portrait painter you strive to catch the essence of the person.  I go for the finer qualities as opposed to Alice Neal who would paint portraits of say the [Andy] Warhol's.  She was fascinated with the stitches when they, they tried to kill, this woman went berserk and tried to kill him.  She did a painting of her housekeeper whose child had died and that, she painted her with the child nursing at her breast, had turned blue, that dark side.  But for me, my whole effort and inspiration comes from searching for that inner quality that in a sense symbolizes man created in God's image which is, are the qualities of perfection of principle mind, soul, spirit, life, truth and love that we reflect according to biblical statements.
Story_ID: 18427
Speaker 1: Tell us about Yeslam bin Laden.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Now this is a--
Speaker 2: Well I had done a jewelers, a family of jewelers and their--Yeslam bin Laden and his wife Carmen had come to this city of Los Angeles [California] and were here to learn how to fly his and her jet planes, also to pick up a tiara for her for these occasions.  And he chose me because he said when I went out to meet him and this is a man who believed in, that it is a man's world, that the woman should be subservient or acquiesce to the man.  But he was pleased to know that I was of darker skin as he was and he said that we had something in common in that while he was studying in England, business in England he was ostracized until all of his belongings, belongings, material belongings were shipped over from Geneva and Saudi Arabia to London as a student.  And they saw that his affluence and were impressed and then they opened the doors.  He's quite a bitter man about that.  But Carmen later invited my husband [Vince Cannon] and I to spend time there painting their third child.  The news is--Diane Sawyer  has done an interview with this Carmen.  They're still going through a divorce.  And when I stayed with her in Geneva, Switzerland she was going through a very hard time.  She's Persian and he had promised not to have other wives.  They were students together and when, after three daughters he wanted a divorce, he wanted a son.  We had to give--she asked us for character reference for her because he had a battalion of lawyers behind him and she was still dependent on income for the children.  So I got a call from Carmen when she heard my husband passed on, invited me to come live with her and her daughters.  The daughter was flown out.  The mother came here with the bin Laden name in New York, she's studying in New York, that she called inviting me to live with her.  There's sort of a relationship that you have that it's almost an instant connection with people.  They come before you without their crown, without their status and just, it's a connection that bares all, it levels the playing field and it's just an honest rapport that you seek when you're striving to say this is how I react to you.  This is you.  I've done identical twins and it's a different brush stroke that happens even though the physical features are similar, but still that individuality is there.
Story_ID: 18428
Speaker 1: Can you give me an example of somebody you felt much closer to and somebody you really couldn't get--is there anyone that you really couldn't get close--?
Speaker 2: There was a child protégé, brilliant little boy who was really not the child himself.  He came in a business suit, couldn't have been more than 9 years old with the attaché case and sat so rigid and it just broke my heart.  I said I can't do this young--he's not revealing himself, the boy, the child in him.  And there was such pressure from the parents for him to--they were so proud of his IQ (unclear) so that I finally went to his home out of my studio into his home, didn't let the parents in and they, in his baseball cap and his you know, his play, playful side of him so that the two images of him are very revealing.  He hung both of them because he was a split personality.
Story_ID: 18429
Speaker 1: Your a portrait of Rosa Parks hangs in the National Portrait Gallery [Washington, D.C.].  Is this the first one?  Was that the first one or--
Speaker 2: First I did a painting.  I was so moved by that.  It was this API [sic, UPI, United Press International].  There was a photograph that went around the world that had been posed by a reporter sitting behind her, of her on the bus looking out the window.  And I took that painting and used it all in black and white and oil, black and white and she was the only bit of color and I used that figure behind as a ghost.  It was done more in an expressionist way called 'The Beginning' and in the window the secret little sketch of a church, a flag and a school, her vision for an equal opportunity, a country that she took a stand on by remaining seated.  And when she saw that painting, Oprah Winfrey unveiled it here in Los Angeles [California] and they were impressed with that and she's agreed to sit for me for a sculpture.  But I just did out of my heart wanting to honor her and later it was purchased and donated to the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] by the Anheuser-Busch Company.
Story_ID: 18430
Speaker 1: Is, is there a particular piece of work of yours or what are your favorite works?
Speaker 2: My favorite works are my metaphysical.  That's what I was put on this earth to do.  I think I finally through--there's a kind of search in life where it gets to a point where portraits aren't enough and then it gets to a point where social injustice isn't enough, where the whole of me wants to be expressed, my reason for being here, the gift that's given me and to give back.  And so my search in metaphysics inspired me to do coming from a trip to the foundry, I saw a piece I had done of a woman who called herself during the time a Twiggy, she called herself, she's a sassy black, young, attractive gal, called herself Niggy and everyone knew that in Beverly Hills she got away with it, Niggy Twiggy.  Anyhow I did a, a head of her and went into the foundry and the skull had broken the, the--I'm sorry the, the shell on the bronze had broken a clean line right down the middle and gave me a profile of her, the shell.  And I, it was like an epiphany.  This is how I can express this emerging like out of, breaking out of a shell into the realization of our true selfhood, our spirituality and to finally arrive at doing this in the clear, crystal-like material, shown through body language of the fetal pose of death, the kneeling, the rising up into the light, the light of truth, that journey that, that I've studied to know, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what's the title of this, this piece?
Speaker 2: Well they have a series of names because really the first man which was the Adam man and then the new man which was the Christ figure, but they're seen through the eyes of African American or African perspective uh, by use of Djimon Hounsou who came from a country, the Republic of Benin where the first bronzes were ever uncovered.  That whole journey of my meeting him, desiring--God knows the desires of your heart before you ask.  And there he was at the Poitier home.  I was ready to do it.  He agreed and he never sat through a sculptor before and has since taken me down the red carpet for the Oscar [Academy Award] nomination.  He calls me mommy and all of this I feel was predestined.
Story_ID: 18431
Speaker 1: Well tell us about the Clinton, is it the Clinton Library or is it to the--?
Speaker 2: No, at the White House when [Bill] Clinton was president and the unveiling of the design for the Congressional Gold Medal.  C. DeLores Tucker was called to intervene on an issue where the U.S. Mint had refused to let an outside artist do the bas-relief and Ms. [Rosa] Parks had specified that she had wanted me to do it.  And it took many calls and many different contractual signings in a short period of time.  And so the event comes to pass and I'm in the VIP room and introduced to all the people who were part of that ceremony.  And I was told I was just to stand to be acknowledged as the artist.  In the rotunda so many people there, Colin Powell came up to me after and congratulated me.  But I thought I was just to stand and Clinton because of the long process of getting it to the point where an outside artist, myself, did the design, called me up on the podium and in my frustration of--I whispered to him "How do I get down from here?" And so he takes me by the arm and escorts me down.  And Diahann Carroll, who had seen it all, said "Artis he was just all over--he's such a," you know but he's such a gentleman.  He's so easy to know, to meet.  And never forgets--a Rhodes scholar, never forgets a name.  Later, years later here at the home of 'Babyface', what is his actual name?
Speaker 1: [Kenneth] Edmonds.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He gave a reception for Clinton speaking about this new endeavor.  He's partnering with someone to make, to self empower the third world countries and a little boy said to me, take that picture that was taken at the rotunda and I, maybe you'll have a chance to show it to him.  I, and sure enough I, at this huge gathering in their home, Lionel Richie who's work, who collected my work, we ended up standing right next to the President [Bill Clinton] as he was giving a speech and I whip out the little photograph from--he signed without asking my name.  He'd remembered that incident of, with Mrs. Parks.  So little warm things like that, that remind me that there is a common denominator of the heart of people no matter how much acclaim they get.  If, if you reach or connect with someone that you're painting, sculpting even if it's just one sitting, one brief moment.  That connection of the one mind, the one heart which is what my studies reveal to me, that, that's why I paint with love not with criticism, not with judging which transcends all the political issues and diversities.  The whole division in our races, in our politics can be transcended to a higher question of who are we and is life eternal, does this life end in one dark black hole?
Story_ID: 18432
Speaker 1: You sculpt in, in wax primarily right?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: You cast it in bronze.  Can you tell us about the process that you use?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I'm happy to because I find that I have to travel so much. [Scultor, Auguste] Rodin  used to carry a piece of wax around in his pocket.  You can work with wax wherever you go, just work in the sun.  It warms it up and it's pliable.  But I find that if I incorporate tubes of black oil in a large turkey cooker and heat that wax, victory brown wax, add the tubes, mix it together, the result is that the wax you do resembles, it even photographs like a finished black patina bronze so it cuts one step out you know in trying to get an idea of how it will look so that, that's my way of working through that system.  I'm very rapid in many, on the sports figures.  I'll do gesture pieces that take minutes as opposed to this long--I've spent two and three years on a piece perfecting--if I want it to feel a very rested, calm.  The agitation of a gesture leaves--you need that raw finish, the, the swoop, scoop of wax.  Often I've taken like a machete knife and just slabbed it on the armature.  First you work of course with an armature to center through the body.  So it's exciting to portray an emotion through a gesture or through the calm work, work, work, try working the surface and perfecting it.
Story_ID: 18433
Speaker 1: Tell us the story of the Malcolm X sculpture and the Ronald Reagan sculpture.  Now you got commissioned about the same time right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was commissioned at the same time to do Ronald Reagan for the Library Museum, Ronald Reagan [Presidential Foundation and] Library museum [Simi Valley, California] and I had sort of turned it down over the years and said well if proceeds of the sales would go to benefit Watts [California] or any social problems, issues.  And right during that time even after meeting Reagan, I met the art director Spike Lee who was doing the epic about Malcolm X.  And it sort of balanced my abilities to work on both with the thought that you're dealing with two extremes in a sense.  Of Reagan who considered himself to be a Christian and Malcolm X who had gone through that whole journey of being Muslim and going, traveling to Mecca [Saudi Arabia].  So all of these elements to fulfilled of any artist who is portraying someone and it was very exhilarating to do the two opposite characters, two opposite philosophies that seemed to be in a sense coming together with age or maturity.
Story_ID: 18434
Speaker 1: What are you working on now?  Do--?
Speaker 2: Well my dear son Djimon [Hounsou] has finally been--with all these movies he's doing has taken the time to pose for the first two images for that emerging out of matter into spirit of 'Generic Man'.  And I've just completed the kneeling figure which will be seated on the fetal pose.  And it's being shown at the Thelma Harris [Art] Gallery in Oakland [California] now.  It's the newest.  But I'm currently also working, it's gone to bronze.  But now in the wax I'm doing what would symbolize love knowing no race.  It's an image of a couple, interracial couple and that was part of my experience.  My first husband [William Clay Lane] was black.  My second husband [Vince Cannon] was Italian, although the definition was once given of an Italian as being an African who wasn't afraid to swim.  That Italians really are black in, at, at heart or in their soul or soulful.  My husband was so for the African American cause it just, he tried in every way to produce quality African American films.  He was a dear friend of so many people in our community, Roscoe Lee Brown and Bernard Kinsey, who gave a tribute to my husband.  Even though he's Italian he was like a brother, you know.  And in fact I wasn't quite dark enough to suit him.  I mean he loved that chocolate brown.  Not the look, the soul of--I was much--not too conventional a Canadian, but needed a little loosening up that the American experience gave me, United States.  And--
Speaker 1: What was your husband's name?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Vincent Aloysious Corelli.  My real name is Corelli, Artis Marie Corelli, marriage name.  But his acting name was Cannon and when I met Dyan [Cannon], he, the agents had turned his name from Corelli which was too Italian to, and called him Vince--gave him the name, acting name of Vince Cannon.  And it was shortly after that, when he agreed to being her personal manager, that when they traveled together and I was here in my studio they would mistake him either as his, her--her brother or her boyfriend or her husband.  And so we were quite a trio, although I remained a friend of Cary's [Grant] after the divorce.  Dyan Cannon and Vince and I were going all around the world together, the film they produced.
Speaker 1: You trying to think of the name of the film?  Well--
Speaker 2: Dyan Cannon's ['Growing Pains:] Number One.'  It was nominated for an Oscar [Academy Award] and Warren Beatty and Cary Grant sat behind us at the screening of the movie and said it will never go.  It will never win the Oscar because it was about parents' influence on children whether it be why they overeat as a child, why they are, why they are ashamed of their bodies, why they are afraid to speak.  They covered many from Dyan's own personal--she wrote and directed it.  Vince produced it.  And it was nominated but didn't win because it was criticized because they showed little, a scene of nudity, little girls go into explore the boys' bathroom and the principal comes in and catches them talking about how you use the, the boys' urinal.  Just a little, innocent child portrayal of the over, obese child was force fed by the mother while she and her, the father argued over his head and would feed him, feed him, so food became his escape.  It was quite a deep, it was highly--it received great critique from New York film critics and as I say was nominated for an Oscar.
Story_ID: 18435
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: It's one word, respect.  For us to respect one another, to finally be given the full respect we deserve in the overall community, for our culture to be more recognized, taught, that education part of, the educational system would concentrate on the visual artist as they do other areas of our culture such as sports, movie industry, writers.  Ever since the Harlem Renaissance [1920s] there's not been that acceptance in the major white museums which really belong to the public, accepting on an equal status, the contributions of African and African American artists.  And as an African American woman I would like to also mention that there's been a neglect as far as recognizing the bodies of work of art, African-American women.  There's an organization out of New York that's--what is the camouflage with the group, when the, the uniform is camouflaged, what's the name for that?  Starts with a "G", the--come on, what is that garb you where when it's all khaki and green and brown?
Speaker 1: Camouflage.
Speaker 2: No, that's--no.  I can't--I don't know.  That's all I know.
Speaker 1: Well these women artists [The Guerilla Girls] secretly uncovered statistics to prove the major galleries in New York would not accept female artists into their stable.  And that in being left out the images were left out in history, black or white women.  And Judy Chicago for instance, who is Caucasian, fought that system here in California and made the world, made the news.  There was a, [Maurice] Tuckman at the LACMA, L.A. [Los Angeles] County Art Museum [Los Angeles, California] who claimed that we were incapable of conceptual art, of arriving at a concept and had to be forced to show the work, the migration series by the black community, that they took over and made themselves the curators of it instead of allowing someone of African-American, a historian to curate the exhibition.  So that my hope would be that, that often well deserved credit and respect be given to our race and that eventually it all become one or at least equal.  I love the diversity.  I don't mean to make us all one color or one persuasion.  It's just that all the colors of the rainbow be given their own individual characteristics, that they be applauded on an equal basis.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done thus far, is there anything that you would do differently, any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I think I would have done, I can't say fewer portraits because that's what sustained my creative work, the body of work that, where there's no guarantee it will sell but it's from your, your deep insides.  By that I mean your deep desire to express while you're here on this earth to express what you're here for.  And that gift I was given in the sense is giving back our glorification of God.  It's giving back a tribute.  I did many birth pieces, one called 'The Seed Within The Seed' and the pregnant woman is expressing adoration, I call it celebration of life to the God who created us all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done thus far, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is this emerging outer matter into spirit.  The message of it is that in truth we are all invisible.  We, none of us, with the eye can see or know another.  It's only through our qualities that we recognize one another.  And it would, might, it might seem that portraiture should be obsolete, but while we're on this earth when a portrait is done out of love or to depict the love of a, in a person, there's a value to that.  It adds to the whole atmosphere, I think a portrait in a home.  But on the other hand this message of God created man in his image, I think that emerging outer matter into invisible qualities out of darkness into light is, I hope no one has ever thought to leave the shell on the bronze as I did to symbolize that breaking through the shell.  No one has thought to leave that--it's a, the honest process of the foundry which I consider the womb for these pieces.  The--it symbolizes the breaking out of slavery.  There's a wire wrapped around those black patina figures in the shell which is the degree that we break out of that shell and that final crystallized man standing on one leg proud like the Masai, an African man, he's becoming visible, caught up in the light of the God presence.  There was a temporary contemporary, an artist who had a womb, an installation of white fog.  My husband [Vince Cannon] walked through that at the opening and two seconds later I couldn't see him.  I saw only white fog.  And I thought this is where I want this crystal figure, the top in like an installation, like a silo, dark with a lying man dead, lying dead.  I even wanted worms crawling below the earth's surface in this black darkness.  And then as he moves on up through a transformation of his mind into an awareness in search for truth and finds that he is created in God's image, that really the mortal cadaver of the body is nonexistent, that only the qualities, the true definition of man is portrayed.

Speaker 1: How did your parents and your family members feel about your success as an artist?
Speaker 2: You know it's a sad but joyous combination because I hadn't been able to partake in all the family reunions that, and return to that all-black village where they all go [North Buxton, Ontario].  I've been able to go there not as many years as they do.  I don't know, I've gone out into the world.  My mother [Julia Marie Shadd] was totally astonished that someone from her family would get out into the world and meet these people who are known around the world.  But I know that it's a, it's a calling but it's separate from family into the family of man that I had to do what I had to do.  Even my daughter who lives nearby Pasadena [California] has had to live without me.  She stayed with my sister [Delores Harold] for years while I had to go where I was called to go in this journey.  But as I was able to introduce her to people of great note, she's a very poised young lady who understands.  And I have a greater, I think I have a greater relationship because my mother understood it and gave me up to the world, and my daughter as well.  And I have regrets but I have gratitude at the same time that they understand that my life was separate.  But I'm so happy when they come and visit me.  It reminds me of my home life when I was always off painting or day dreaming and hear their laughter and that camaraderie we had say in the kitchen or in, homecoming.  The artist's life is separate but it mingles with historical figures, political figures, actors, are drawn to creative people.  And we all in a sense, you as a writer, we all have those creative gifts that we have to express whether it means bringing our family with us or having to separate from them for a while.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think because I'm not what you would call termed an intellectual.  But I work from my heart and I don't have the drive that some have that perhaps might have taken me higher in a sense of acceptance or recognition.  But I really would hope for each individual to recognize that gift they have and explore it to the fullest whatever it might be.  It all honors God, it all--the person who gives it to you, the gift giver.
