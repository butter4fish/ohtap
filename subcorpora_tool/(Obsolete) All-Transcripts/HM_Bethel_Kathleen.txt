Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: We'll try (laughter).
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food? Chesapeake Bay crab.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 1: And, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I quote my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] on this, "Just because you're paranoid, does not mean they're not out to get you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  I can understand that.
Story_ID: 483027
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna ask about your mother's, your mother's side of the family and your father's [Frederick Bethel] side.  But--
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: We're start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Helen Evonne Roy Bethel [Helen Roy Bethel], H-E-L-E-N, E-V-O-N-N-E, R-O-Y, B-E-T-H-E-L.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 20, 1930, Kansas City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there stories passed down in your family about the origin of, I mean, of the family, or how far back can you trace 'em?
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family, her grandfather was born a slave, February 14, 1865 in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Prince Albert Goines, P-R-I-N-C-E, A-L-B-E-R-T, G-O-I-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Prince Albert Goines.  Now, is here a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: His mother was young, and, now, we assumed that she knew of the Victorian era, and had heard some tale of Prince Albert.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he might frequently have used P.A. Goines as his initials, but also in the press back then they tended to use people's initials as well.  Not certain whether the Valentine's Day birthday is accurate or not.  But, would love to get down to that genealogy that I've been avoiding doing for years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he was named during the time when Prince Albert was the consort of Queen Victoria, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, that was a big deal in those days.  I guess it was in the papers, so.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about--now he was born in slavery?
Speaker 2: That's what I'd always heard.  But, now that I think of the date, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, certainly--
Speaker 1: It was right after--
Speaker 2: He would've been in a southern state during the Confederacy, so yes.
Speaker 1: He was born--
Speaker 2: He would've been--
Speaker 1: During Reconstruction, if nothing else, right?
Speaker 2: Well, the Civil War ends--yeah, I guess, he was not born a slave then.
Speaker 1: Well, in--
Speaker 2: Eighteen sixty-five [1865], February.  I'm not sure what the emancipation date recognized in North Carolina is.  But, somehow I wonder about that.
Speaker 1: Or, who the people who called themselves owning him recognize, 'cause he could still be in slavery.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Like, there are people, you know, who thought they were in slavery years after slavery was over from what I've read.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, yeah.  So, he could very well.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, his mother was a young girl and family lore says that the father was a relative of the owner.  Yeah, a male relative of the owner.
Story_ID: 483028
Speaker 1: So is there a story about what the--what the family did after, after emancipation or during Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know how he [Bethel's maternal great-grandfather, Prince Albert Goines] worked his way up to the Washington [D.C.], Baltimore [Maryland] area.  I know very little about his youth.
Speaker 1: But, you just told us something about it, 'cause he actually worked his way to Washington, Baltimore area, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was educated.  At some point he got an education.  Don't know when and where, how that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, he did migrate from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where he was to--?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From Raleigh [North Carolina] to D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you know what he did for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a secretary for the colored YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] for many years.  There's a very nice photograph of him in a pictorial history of the YMCA where he's standing in front office where he worked in Bluefield, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and, what, do you have any idea what period that dates back to?
Speaker 2: Probably 19--I wanna say '12 [1912], or so.  I understand that he was a roofer, a slater.  And, he slated some roofs in Washington.  And, so, when he went to the Y, I don't know.  He had done some work family lore says with the Spanish American War veterans perhaps for the YMCA.  For some reason he was in something that was supporting soldiers involved in those campaigns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's what, 1898?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, his children are born in Washington, D.C. in the 1890s.  And, I think he worked as a slater then.  So, when he went to the Y I don't know.  But, he retired from the Y.  He's listed in a couple of editions of 'Who's Who Among Colored Americans.'  So, he had a reputation of sorts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are some reports in the archives of the YMCA at--in the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] collection, some reports that he had turned in about activities of his particular unit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's great that you know exactly where to go to find the information (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: It's helpful.
Speaker 2: But, when I saw the photograph and I made copies of them and sent to my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] and her cousins, I was certain it was him but wanted some confirmation.  Then of course, I looked at the book and said, "Hey, where did the photographs come from?" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this--this is your great-grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother's [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] father, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 483029
Speaker 1: Give me the next generation on your mother's [Helen Roy Bethel] side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side there were four children.  I'm not certain when he married Mary Frances Geary [Mary Geary Goines], who I believe is in the Washington [D.C.] area.  The tale is that her mother was a foundling in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  Katherine [ph.] Geary who was one of the mothers of the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church [Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church] in Washington, D.C.  Her name is carved in the entryway.
Speaker 1: That's G-A-I-R-Y?
Speaker 2: G-E-A-R-Y.
Speaker 1: G-E-A--
Speaker 2: Yes.  J- G-E-A-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, Katherine Geary's daughter married--Frances Geary--married P.A. Goines [Prince Albert Goines].  And, I'm not certain when but 1889, 1890 or so.  The oldest boy Albert Nathaniel Goines [Albert Goines], A-L-B-E-R-T, N-A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L, G-O-I-N-E-S, was the oldest.  My grandmother, Margaret Kathaleen, which I had learned later, M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, K-A-T-H-A-L-E-E-N, Goines [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott], G-O-I-N-E-S.  Her sister, Helen Douglass Goines [Helen Goines], H-E-L-E-N, D-O-U-G-L-A-S-S, named after Frederick Douglass, Goines.  Frederick Douglass and her father were friends I believe.  And, or at least knew each other.  He may have just respected him.  But, I sense the circle that he ran in, he may have been--encountered him in the Washington area.  And, the youngest was George Geary Goines [George Goines], G-E-O-R-G-E, G-E-A-R-Y, G-O-I-N-E-S.  Yes, and if I could think of the address, there's a house in Washington, every time we would pass by coming home from church, they would say, "That's the house where Uncle George was born."
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's youngest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, these are your, this is your grandparents' generations?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, they're born--?
Speaker 2: Eighteen nineties [1890s].  My grandmother's--
Speaker 1: Eighteen nineties [1890s] through?
Speaker 2: --July 11, 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I have dates for the others birth and death dates, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you mother, did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived together.  We were a three generation household.  My grandmother and her second husband, my mother and my father [Frederick Bethel], and my brother [Geary Bethel] and I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, did she tell you any stories about what life was like when she was growing up, or?
Speaker 2: She did.  She would tell interesting stories about Easter egg rolls on the White House [Washington, D.C.] lawn.  She talked about Howard University [Washington, D.C.] being out in the country from where she lived in downtown Washington.  And, about the shopping and the schools.  She went to M Street High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], where Anna Julia Cooper would've been principal.  And, yes, stories of the neighborhood and things growing up, she did.  Her mother died when the youngest was, was born so for quite a while they were cared for by the grandmother and aunts until her father married again.  And, he married a woman that had a son, Alphonso Goines [ph.], whom Papa adopted, Prince Albert Goines adopted.  Yes.  And, I don't think the stepmother and the children got along.  I know that they didn't.  And, I don't know what prompted some other decisions.  For example, at some point Uncle Albert went to the Bordentown training school for boys [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey] in New Jersey, where I found out he graduated in auto mechanics in 19-something or other.  I have that date from just an inquiry off the Internet which is really opening up research opportunities now.  That I had heard about Uncle Albert going to a training school in New Jersey and, I saw a website of photographs of this Negro training school for boys.  And, so, there were pictures and we can get a sense of where he was and what he was doing.  He later became a chauffeur.  He traveled on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary to England with one of his employers in the vehicle.  He served in the First World War [World War I, WWI], where he was gassed and suffered aliments, digestive aliments with his throat; could only have soft foods and things for all his life.  He had been listed as being killed in the war and had to work hard later to establish that he wasn't to receive some sort of benefits from the First World War.  As far as I know, he never married.  He liked the racetrack and the horses, lived in New York for many years and was in White Plains, New York at the end of his life.
Speaker 1: This is your uncle (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I knew all of this, my grandmother's oldest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's your great uncle then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My great uncle Albert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 483030
Speaker 1: My grandmother's sister [Helen Goines] went to Bluefield State College [Bluefield, West Virginia] I believe it was called back then.  And, she fell in love with an older man, a teacher, and married him and moved to the Ohio area.  And, later on--I'm not sure what she did.  For a while she was a dorm matron at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I believe she was head of housekeeping at the Theresa Hotel [Hotel Theresa] in New York [New York] for a while.
Speaker 2: I bet she had some stories of--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The Theresa Hotel.
Speaker 1: Auntie did, I'm sure.  And, I remember going to a retirement party in New York but I don't quite remember what she did.  But, I had a photo and I know that's all written down somewhere that that's easier to find.  And, yeah, very exciting.  My grandmother's grandfather [sic. father], Prince Albert Goines--my family had an unusual tradition.  They vacationed every August in Ocean City, New Jersey at a Negro owned hotel, the Hotel Comfort, which drew professionals from the East Coast to vacation.  My mother [Helen Roy Bethel] tells stories of wanting to go swimming, to the beach, and Papa having sessions with Carter G. Woodson with--what is his name?  He was very big in advertising in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Channing Tobias [Channing H. Tobias]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was a big (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's not who I'm thinking of but he as another--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --person I believe.
Speaker 2: Channing Tobias was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] person.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a--head of the Harlem Y [Harlem YMCA, New York, New York] at one time, went to--
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, someone who was like a leader in public relations in Philadelphia.  Joseph, Joe, that's escaping me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd like to know that.
Speaker 1: I'll have to ask my aunt about that.
Speaker 2: In those days, he was doing public relations and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 483031
Speaker 1: And that [Ocean City, New Jersey] is where my grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] met her second husband, William Walcott, who had been in charge of cadets at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And, he had fascinating stories in that connection, so.  My grandmother married her second husband--I should talk about the first one though.  Let me go back.  Since we were talking about New Jersey, there was some relative, an Aunt Mae [ph.] somewhere in New Jersey.  And, as my grandmother was finishing high school--she went to M Street [M Street High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] in Washington [D.C.] but she actually graduated from Orange High School [Orange, New Jersey] in New Jersey, and I have a photograph of that--and, my grandmother was getting training as a seamstress.  And, she worked for a young woman who told her if she went to Kansas City [Missouri] she could get her all the customers she would need.  So, for some reason, my grandmother decided to go to Kansas City where she indeed did set up a home based business of being a seamstress to--when we were little what we thought of as wealthier white woman.  They may have been middle-class or officers' wives, yeah.  And--
Speaker 2: You say officers' wives, was it, was her business set up near a based or something, an [U.S.] Army base?
Speaker 1: No.  I just recall when we were in Washington and my grandmother worked out of the home.  Mrs. Lee's [ph.] husband was like a colonel or something.  I'd have to ask my father [Frederick Bethel].  He would, he would know.  But, I do know there's a published biography of them out there.  So, he'll be easier to identify--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if I needed to.
Speaker 2: What's the name of the biography?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I--this is gonna have to work.  It may not come to me for a couple of days.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As well as the guy from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who I'm gonna, gonna remember.  And, he had some physical deformities as well.  I don't know if he had been ill as a child or what had happened to him.  But, I recall him in a wheelchair or on crutches, this gentleman.  And, so my grandmother goes to Kansas City and lives with someone that my grandfa- her grandfather knew.  No, her father knew, my great-grandfather [Prince Albert Goines] knew in Kansas City.  And then waits a while before she and my grandfather marry.  'Cause my grandmother was like twenty-eight when she married.  She married Leonard William Roy [Leonard Roy], who was one of fifteen children, had a farm in Bunceton, Missouri.  I know that his mother was a teacher and had had, had been educated, and the fifteen children, they were very fair skinned.  'Cause there was a brother that came to Chicago [Illinois] and passed for white who they never heard from again.  But, somewhere in a family Bible are all the dates and all for those fifteen children, and of which I believe he was the oldest.  So, they married in Chicago in 1930, I believe.  No, no, my mother was born 1930--1922 I think.
Speaker 2: So, what did Mr. Roy do for a living?
Speaker 1: He was a chauffeur.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But some illness befell him when my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] was a child, and I'm not sure what it was.  It may be something in family records or if I bother to find the bir- death certificate that might tell me just what had happened.  But, apparently he was sick for a year or so, and--in the home.  And, it was a traumatic thing for my mother to lose her father.  She was like, I don't know, seven or eight or so.  So, she rarely talked about him.  She rarely talked about him.  Nor did her brother [Leonard Roy, Jr.].
Story_ID: 483032
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Helen Roy Bethel] talk about what it was like growing up in Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Kansas City was hot.  Kansas City was the place.  Her father [Leonard Roy] had belonged to a gentlemen's group, The Beau Brummells [The Beau Brummell Club].  My grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] was a member of the Blue Birds Social Club [Blue Birds Social and Pleasure Club].  Their activities were covered in the Kansas City Call [The Call].  Jazz was happening on 18th and Vine [Kansas City, Missouri].  There was nothing better than Kansas City barbeque, and the school, the neighborhood.  My mother's cousin who just passed this weekend, lived on the same block with Basil Phillips [Basil O. Phillips] who worked at Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] for many years.  So she loved Kansas City and growing up there.  And apparently it was a very close community.  They had Negro League baseball and, big time Negro League baseball.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  The best teams.
Speaker 2: The best teams.  Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] and the Buffalo Soldiers were not far.  So, the Buffalo Soldiers would come down for the parades or whatever the holidays were.  I think Negro customers were treated kindly in stores, as well as they had their own businesses.  Yes, she very much like it.  She and her girlfri- girlhood friends stayed friends for, for life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, where did she go to high school in Kansas City?  I'm interested (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lincoln.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've never been there.  Lincoln High School [Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri] was that the--?
Speaker 2: Lincoln High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which still 'til this day has a national alumni group that has conferences pretty much based out of people graduating, I guess, '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s].  Years back--I'm trying to think, my niece is twenty-two; she might've been ten or so.  So, perhaps a dozen years or so.  I was going to Kansas City, I was working on a project looking in--at black museums and wanted to see the Negro League [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Missouri], the jazz [American Jazz Museum, Kansas City, Missouri], the black America--Mid-America black archive [Black Archives of Mid-America, Kansas City, Missouri], and some other historic sights and, in efforts.  So, my mother and my niece flew out from Washington, D.C. to join me.  And, we were able to get around Kansas City.  It was unfortunate that highway development had really destroyed the neighborhood where she grew up.  So, there was no block.  There was no neighborhood to see, actually, the remnants of a school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, urban renewal (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Urban renewal, urban removable.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, she was pleased with the effort to try and develop 18th and Vine again.  And, we enjoyed the experience at the hotel and meeting with her cousin who took us to a cemetery where family members were buried.  And, could identify several members of the Roy family.  Some of whom I had not heard about.  For example, an aunt which must've have been, like the grandmother's sister, or grandmother's relative, grandmother's sister-in-law or some relation there.  When I had had a list of the children, I just had not had a list of members of the parents' families.  There may be names in the Bible, but I didn't have stories of them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There was stories of the aunts and uncles but not of grandparents.  So, I don't think that my mother knew her grandparents, 'cause she didn't tell me stories of them.  The stories I know are of Papa [Bethel's maternal great-grandfather, Prince Albert Goines] who was the most dominant member of the family.  Yes.
Story_ID: 483033
Speaker 1: Does she have any stories to tell about growing up in Kansas City [Missouri]?  What was the--? A lot of rich black culture around--it was--
Speaker 2: It was.  It was.  They went to the movies.  You know, she had her dance lessons, and Shirley Temple was an idol and they would see big entertainers when they would come to town.  Bill Robinson [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson], or my grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] would've like to have supported perhaps more concert performers.  If a Roland Hayes or a Marian Anderson or that kind of event was happening; would've partaken in that.  Church activities.  My grandmother at some point joined the Episcopal church.  And, her--what I remember hearing was that when my grandmother's mother [Mary Geary Goines] passed, that the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] funeral was just too emotive for her and too demonstrative.
Speaker 1: The A.M.E.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is--
Speaker 2: Which is kind of a sedate as--
Speaker 1: Yeah, compared to the Baptist.
Speaker 2: 'Cause Baptists.  Right.  But, she wanted a quiet, quieter church.  And, her sister [Helen Goines] became a Christian Scientist early in life.  I don't recall the brothers being involved in churches.  But, I don't know what Papa's membership would've remained but I can probably find that out as well from things.  So, my mother's stories about growing up--my mother had one brother.  My grandmother's--the first child did not live and she was named Mary Frances [ph.].  And, either it was for, she didn't live for a few hours or for a few days.  Or, I don't know how long, but the first child did not live out of infancy.  And, then my uncle, Leonard Williams Roy, Jr. [Leonard Roy, Jr.] would've been born in 1927; January 20, 1927.  And, she talked about how her brother tortured her (laughter).  And, her girlhood friends talk about he was very mischievous.  And, she said, every day of her life, (laughter), that he tortured her.  My grandmother, as I said, worked out of the home but must've done well enough to have had a domestic.  Irma [ph.], I remember Irma, I don't remember her last name.  And, at some point Irma had two daughters that lived in Chicago [Illinois] that my mother visited in my day as an adult.  And, that in the summers, soon after school let out in Kansas City, they would head east.  They would take the train to Chicago and visit relatives here, and make their way across the country and visit with relatives in Washington, D.C., spend August at the seashore, and then go back to Kansas City before school started which that's a real leisure--
Speaker 1: That's a length of time, yeah.
Speaker 2: --item to be able to take the summer off and to do that kind of thing, that I imagine my grandmother was good with money, and planning.  I'm not sure if there was insurance after the--her husband passed.  But, that's what she talked about; enjoying the train travel, and visiting.  They would've gone to World's Fairs, 1939 [1939 New York World's Fair, New York, New York] and what other dates are involved; would've done that.  She was good at double-dutch and hopscotch and other girl games.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She talked about being shy.  And, I didn't ever think of my mother as shy.
Story_ID: 483034
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Helen Roy Bethel] was shy.  You were kind of surprised that she was--
Speaker 2: That she would say she was shy and I would never think so.  But when I became older, and I would observe her in situations, I could see that.  She spoke of being a child and being the youngest in the family so they were always sending her to run errands, to do whatever, that kind of thing.  And, with my family names, my grandmother being named Margaret [Margaret Goines Roy Wolcott], her sister being named Helen [Helen Goines], Helen's daughter being named Margaret, and Margaret's daughter being named Helen, the Helens and the Margarets, she said was a bit much.
Speaker 1: Kind of confusing there.
Speaker 2: A little confusing.
Speaker 1: So, now, what did you mother, what were her aspirations?  Did she wanna go to college?  Or, did she go, or--?
Speaker 2: She did.  She went to Saint Augustine's College [Saint Augustine's University] in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  That's Episcopal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) An Episcopal school.  The Delany sisters [Sarah Louise Delany and Annie Elizabeth Delany], wonderful tradition, something that my great-grandfather, P.A. Goines [Prince Albert Goines], would've been proud of or facilitated.  My mother's cousin Mary Frances [ph.] who was my grandmother's sister's oldest daughter had gone to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And, with my grandmother's sister having gone to Bluefield, West Virginia [Bluefield State College, Bluefield, West Virginia] they knew what we know call HBCUs, historically black colleges, but that would've been the choices there.
Speaker 1: So, what was her track?  What was she trying to become, a teacher, or what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't--I'm not certain what she was going to do.  What was her major?  She finished high school [Lincoln High School; Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri] at sixteen.  So, I believe she skipped a grade.  And, she was good with number and math and chemistry, and items.  But, after leaving college where she met my father [Frederick Bethel]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who when to Saint Aug [Saint Augustine's College] on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] because someone told him there were a lot of girls down there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, my father being a native Washingtonian they moved back to Washington [D.C.].  And, so, civil service; that was the only game in town.
Story_ID: 483035
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side and then we'll get 'em together in college.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So, give me your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father is Frederick Errington Bethel [Frederick Bethel], F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, E-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N, B-E-T-H-E-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's a dignified sounding name.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, what is his date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: February 20, 1926--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about his side of the family?  What can you tell us about--how back--how far back can you pick them up?
Speaker 2: I know of my great-grandparents.  But, I, I don't--and I know family lore about a great-great, but otherwise I, I don't have that.
Speaker 1: What's the lore about the great-great?
Speaker 2: The--for some reason she was a German woman, that my grandfather's grandmother was a German extraction.  My father's--
Speaker 1: Do they mean full-blooded German woman, or part German, or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Just German.
Speaker 1: A German, okay.
Speaker 2: I assume was full blooded.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, for our, our family coloring, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, she would've been a--would she have been a resident of Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: No.  This would've been in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's father was William, I wanna say it's Albert, but I'm gonna hold on that, Albert Bethel.  And, he was born--he was from Hillsborough, North Carolina.  And, I'd have to check his birth and death dates, and, I've seen them with the World War II [WWII] draft records, and census records.  So, I have locations and dates for folk's places.  I need find that box (laughter), to pull that out.  My father's mother was Glendora, I don't remember what her middle name is.  But, her maiden name was Parham, P-A-R-H-A-M, Bethel [Glendora Parham Bethel].  And, she was one of four girls: a sister Lucille [Lucille Parham], sister Annie [Annie Parham], and a sister Mary [ph.].  And, their mother was Agnes, Agnes Parham of whom I do have a photograph of.  And, it's not an obit, but the four sisters did some sort of acknowledgement of an anniversary in an obituary page that someone clipped and stuck in the picture frame.  I don't know the story of how my parents got togeth- my grandparents got together.  But--
Speaker 1: They were both students at Saint Augustine [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: No.  That's my parents.  I'm sorry, my grandparents--
Speaker 1: Your parents.  Or, your grand--I'm sorry your grandparents.
Speaker 2: My father's, my father's father--
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  Yes.
Speaker 2: --and mother.  Or, where--I wanna say it was somewhere in Virginia.  But my father's mother lived in Washington, D.C. as I was growing up, and seemed very reluctant to talk about the family except that she had had a hard time.  So when I became older and was talking to her sisters, it seemed like the mother put them, I'm gonna say in a home for a lack of a better word, while she went to find employment.  And, went to Washington, D.C. I believe to find employment.  So, my grandmother would talk about it being an orphanage but the sisters would say, "It was nothing like that."  You know, it, it had a name, which I wrote down somewhere, someplace, that much like for example, in Chicago [Illinois], the Elam Home for Young Women [Melissia Anne Elam Home for Working Women and Girls] or something.  There were homes for people back then, you know.  Harriet Tubman home for whatever, that kind of thing.  So, it wasn't, I don't think a true orphanage or, if may well have been a true orphanage but they were not orphaned.  She needed a place for them to stay while she went and found employment.  So, I don't know anything about my father's grandfather.  That I don't know; haven't heard any stories there.  I'll have to ask my cousins.  They're a little older than I am and may have family stories from there.
Story_ID: 483036
Speaker 1: And my father's [Frederick Bethel] parents separated and/or divorced when he was young, and it was pretty rough for my grandmother [Glendora Parham Bethel].  She had three boys.  My father was the youngest.  The older brother, William Bethel, the middle brother, Albert.  And, I, I have their middle name someplace, Albert Bethel.
Speaker 2: A lot of Alberts in the family--
Speaker 1: Yeah, on both sides.
Speaker 2: From both sides, yeah.
Speaker 1: On both sides.  Except Washington [D.C.] is a city of nicknames.  So, it was Uncle Buddy [ph.] and Uncle Fuddy [ph.].  So, you're usually pretty grown before you realize that Uncle Buddy isn't really his name (laughter) and that kind of thing so, yeah.  And, I believe my grandmother and her sons moved into one of the first housing, public housing setups in the country, Langston Terrace [Langston Terrace Dwellings, Washington, D.C.].  Which at that point was under the [U.S.] Department of the Interior.  My grandmother kept a letter that official st- stationery from the department that's talking about my father running a little gambling game in the home during the day.  And, there's been some work done on Langston Terrace, and there's an alumni group, and my father's even featured in the film ['Home: The Langston Terrace Dwellings'] that's talking about growing up in this development.  That the architect [Hilyard Robinson] was a black man who took the design from some development he had seen in Europe to make this, this public housing in Washington.  But my father talked about they lived a variety of places.  He told me all the schools he went to.  That he must've gone to six or eight of the public schools in the Washington area that would've educated Negro students back then.  And, he didn't see his father [Albert Bethel] too much.  But, I just learned that his father played the piano and would rehearse a choir on Saturdays.  He would be the pianist for the choir rehearsal.  And, he gave me the name of the church.  I just wrote that down.  So, I am still learning some, some family lore, some family stories.  Other than that, I'm not certain what he did for a living.  I can remember when my grandfather would come to visit us though.  But, long about, 'til I became a teenager, they called it senility then, which may have well have been Alzheimer's that he didn't really know us.  And, his wife would call and say, "He's gotten out again."  And, the sons would go looking for him and that kind of thing.  And, he passed when I was a teenager and he's buried in Arlington National Cemetery [Arlington, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Because of his--him being a veteran?
Speaker 1: Of the Second World War [World War II, WWII], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As well as my father's oldest brother who served in the [U.S.] military for a long time, retired from the military.  And, he just passed last year.  And, he's, as well, is buried in Arlington.  Yes, so, my father and his brothers--and my father 'til this day is still very good friends with the guys he grew up with, that they were children together.
Speaker 2: Now, what part of D.C.--
Speaker 1: Running the streets in D.C.
Speaker 2: Did they grow up in?
Speaker 1: Northeast [Washington, D.C.], primarily.
Speaker 2: Northeast, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Some more northwest of, near Garnet-Patterson High School [sic. Garnet-Patterson School, Washington, D.C.] or Shaw [Shaw Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] or all of that.  But, yes, they all came up through the Washington schools.
Story_ID: 483037
Speaker 1: Where did your father [Frederick Bethel] graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't know.  He's born in '26 [1926]. I don't know when he goes off to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's all right, you know--
Speaker 2: --to war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: I just, I just thought I'd ask, if we can get in the record.  But, he--did he graduate before he joined the [U.S.] Army, or?
Speaker 2: I believe so.  I believe so.  I'm fairly certain that he did.  I don't have that in my head, but I'll ask him.
Speaker 1: Well, has be talked about what his aspirations were when he was in high school or--?
Speaker 2: No.  Then as now, he was pretty much a jock.  You know, he liked sports--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was an athlete, right?
Speaker 2: An athlete and all of that, yes.  Yes, so, I know about his athletics in college [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] but I don't know about them in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he went to the service before he went to college?  Or, did he--what was his college--?
Speaker 2: Yes.	He went to service before he went to college.  Because he came out and he went to school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] I believe.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's what I had always heard.
Speaker 1: I know some of them would start and then they'd have to go to service and come back.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right, right.  No, no.
Speaker 1: So, he, he went right to the Army?  Was it the Army?
Speaker 2: He was in the Army, a quartermaster is the unit.  A photo is in the--framed in the house with a date.  He severed in Europe, talked about being in France a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in the Quartermaster Corps, they supply, they furnish supplies to the troops.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A lot of black soldiers end up in the Quartermaster Corps.
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: They didn't wanna 'em to win any medals or (laughter) get a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Reluctantly, acknowledging the Tuskegee Airmen and the, that battalion of tank drivers--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Red Ball Express, well, the 761st Tank [761st Tank Battalion].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Black Panthers.
Speaker 2: 761st Black Panthers, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they had the Red Ball Express too.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right, right.
Speaker 1: They were, they weren't in combat but they were in harm's way all the time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: But, did your--
Story_ID: 483038
Speaker 1: When he [Bethel's father, Frederick Bethel] came back from the war [World War II, WWII], he met your mother [Helen Roy Bethel] at Saint Augustine's [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was his family Episcopal too?
Speaker 2: I don't know when but, yes, my father's mother [Glendora Parham Bethel] belonged to Calvary Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.  Which actually is where we were baptized, at Calvary Episcopal Church.
Speaker 1: Well, the family seem awful close in terms of origin, North Carolina and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: In activities use--
Speaker 2: Such a small world seemingly.  Yeah, yeah.  Slight bit of a class difference maybe, but, you know.
Speaker 1: So, at any rate, when you, so, when your parents got together and your father now.  Let's see, okay, so, they, they got married--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, they decided to live in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your mother didn't go back to Kansas City [Missouri] and?
Speaker 2: No.  No, my mother had to spend some time in New York [New York] with my grandmother's sister and her daughters were in New York.  I think she did a little stint working for the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or something.  And, my father talks about going up to New York and courting my mother before there were turnpikes and that kind of thing, and how they would hitch a ride to New York.  And, his aunt, Annie [Annie Parham], lived in Harlem [New York, New York], and how they would camp out there.  And, they would hit the 57th Street jazz clubs and the ballrooms and the music and do New York and things.  So, my parents married in New York City, reception was at the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York].  They got married at St. Philips Church [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, New York, New York] I believe, in New York.  And, when they came back to Washington, they lived with my father's Aunt Mary [ph.] for a little bit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --and then got an apartment.
Story_ID: 483039
Speaker 1: So what did your father [Frederick Bethel] do for a living?  I mean, what he--what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father worked for the D.C. department of recreation [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation].
Speaker 1: So, his sports background helped him--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --land that job, I would suppose.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, because he also would coach their teams and that kind of thing.  He recently got an award from the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] retired coaches association and I was writing up some information about him for that and he was telling me about his, his job history.  And, he remembered the playgrounds where he had gone and like they had never had had a Negro tennis coach before in some of the recreations center in, in Washington.  And, my father's reputation apparently grew, because they began to send him to the roughest neighborhoods.  You know, 'cause my father didn't allow profanity on the playground.  And, my father would have a garden, and it was always a daycare center there, and he worked with seniors, and he really has had an impact on the community.  Even so, that now, if he shows up in some neighborhoods, they're like, "The mayor of Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.] is here."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, Barry Farms was like, just a notorious playground area.  So, he had coached--
Speaker 1: Barry Farms, they call it?
Speaker 2: Barry Farms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember him working at Deanwood [Deanwood Recreation Center, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: The mayor, the mayor of Barry Farms.
Speaker 2: The mayor of Barry Farms is how he got announced at a basketball game.  Similar to, like, a Rucker Park [Rucker Park Tournament] kind of deal, that Barry Farms invitational or whatever.  So, so, he enjoyed that.  I can remember him, umpiring baseball games.  We would travel these dusty roads in Virginia to go to these games where he would be an umpire.  A little extra money, I think he earned that way.  Baseball, football, he worked with Punt, Pass and Kick [NFL Punt, Pass and Kick].  He's--so many activities.  One of the most fascinating things to me is that my father on this playground had these young boys who were just banging on buckets and they were just making music.
Speaker 1: With the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The junkyard band.
Speaker 1: The drum, drum sticks?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Plastic buckets and whatever they were using banging on.  And, then the drum sticks, and they were really good.  And, if my father was--facilitate would take them to other playgrounds to perform for kids.  Or, if they were gonna be a parade, the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] parade, he would put them in.  So, this is a junkyard band.  And, this is a junkyard band that's the backbone of go-go music in D.C.  So somebody was telling my niece and nephew--
Speaker 1: For go-go music just to be clear, it's a, you know, a disc jockey playing a song but he's got like a conga drum player or a live percussion?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --go-go percussion beat.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I mean, Tim Bodley [ph.] playing the conga drums, and you know--?
Speaker 2: But, it's a particular--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Particular, unique to D.C.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think popularized--
Speaker 2: Musical.
Speaker 1: --by the EU [Experience Unlimited] band in the movie 'School Daze,' right?
Speaker 2: 'School Daze'--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.  Chuck Brown is--
Speaker 1: Chuck Brown, right, right.
Speaker 2: The godfather of go-go, which still I think, is dominate on the rap music scene in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that I would know a lot about that.  But, he's my father's facilitated musicians, as well as, athletes.  He's had Dave Bing, Adrian Dantley, these kinds of players through his playgrounds over the years.  He was quite instrumental in helping so many of these young men go to historically black colleges [HBCUs] with athletic scholarships.
Story_ID: 483040
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what your mother [Helen Roy Bethel] did.  What did she (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My mother began working for the government, and I'm not sure what agency she started with.  I have that written some place, but she did her civil service with United States government.  Growing up, I always remember her dealing with surveys and reports being a statistician for the National Institute of Mental Health.  And, from time to time different division whether it was alcoholism or something; some particular aspect that they were doing.  She would work with the statistics and numbers about things, so.
Speaker 1: So, did she retire from the federal government?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Now, when you look at your parents' personalities, their talents, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I look exactly like my mother.  I have a lot of traits from my father [Frederick Bethel], though.  But probably more of my father than my mother.  Even though I'm recognizing now, with my mother's passing a few years ago, of how much like my mother I am.  I'm not certain whether it's that or it's just her voice I keep hearing about things.  I definitely spent more time with my mother.  My father working the playgrounds work afternoons and evenings.  He worked night, so we rarely saw him during the week, and we had a good routine.  My grandparents were home during the day.  So, we didn't have any problem with after school care; my brother [Geary Bethel] and I, 'cause somebody was always home.  And, my mother came home and made dinner and I could tell you by the day of the week what the menu was gonna be, and that kind of thing.  And, we saw my father on weekends, for which he was pretty much a man of his generation, still wanting to go out and hang out with the guys.  He played basketball with the D.C. Old Timers until he was really old time, that kind of thing.  Or, he took up golf, or sporting events he would tell me about.  There's that movie ['Glory Road] about the basketball team from Texas [Texas Western College of the University of Texas; University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas] that beats Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: At Cole Field House [College Park, Maryland].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: My father says he was there.  I said, "I just saw this movie about it."  He said, "Yeah, I was at the game."  I was like, "What?  You were at the game?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know--
Speaker 2: Or, something else--
Speaker 1: You know where it was then (laughter).
Speaker 2: He says "Yeah," I'm like, "Who--where was I? (Laughter) Why didn't you take us?"  But, hanging out with the fellows, yeah, yeah.  He worked a part-time job sometimes driving a taxi or working at Jimmy McPhail's Gold Room [Washington, D.C.], which was a popular lounge and bar in Washington.
Story_ID: 483041
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is my [maternal] grandmother's [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] wedding.  My grandmother married when I was, I think I was turning three or four.  I'll have to check the date.  I think '56 [1956]--they were--born in '56 [1956] in August, so I'd just turn three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at your grandmother's wedding.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's wedding.  I remember that.  I remember going two doors down, that's the time I remember getting my hair curled and pressed, and the dress, and the house being full of people, and meeting new relatives and all.  So, that's my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 483042
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Washington [D.C.] was a--very much a southern city then.  We had roses and azaleas and lilacs and honeysuckle bushes around the house.  My parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] bought a house, where my father still lives, when I was three months old.  So, it was the only house I knew at 4928 3rd Street in Washington, D.C., a corner house. There was a huge oak tree out front with the leaves.  So, the smells of the outdoors; I can still remember the smell of burning leaves as a child, something you don't get as an urban experience now.  Cooking, my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] and my mother cooking in the house.  Ironing, as I said, my grandmother was a seamstress.  So, she was preparing clothes so there was generally an ironing board up all the time, the laundry.  Yeah, running up and down the stairs.  My grandfather [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott] sitting and playing Solitaire at the table during the day, yeah.  Yeah, I have wonderful memories of growing up.  Summertime would come and company would come and put up the awnings and the front porch became another room where the family could gather and have ice tea after dinner and, sit on a glider or a swing and see the neighbors going by.  We could also see a number of accidents.  We lived at a pretty dangerous intersection.  It took them a long time--
Speaker 1: Third Street and--
Speaker 2: Third and Farragut [Street].
Speaker 1: Farragut, okay.
Speaker 2: In Northwest Washington.  We were one block away from a small strip mall which had a drug store.  Which when I was growing up still had a soda fountain counter.  Shoe repair, cleaners, grocery story, other businesses coming and going.  So, it was a big deal when you were old enough to walk to the store, that one block by yourself.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you were able to make it?
Speaker 2: Probably like second or third grade, maybe.  And, probably then with somebody; my brother [Geary Bethel] or someone older.  Because in the fourth grade I moved schools and had to go in that direction to get to school [Keene Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  So, I walked.
Story_ID: 483043
Speaker 1: Now, what was your first school?
Speaker 2: My--I went to preschool at Rudolph Elementary [Rudolph Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] which was two block from my house.  And, then for first grade I went to Barnard [Barnard Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  And, I was given some test in the second or third grade.  And, I remember my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] were called to school.  I don't--I didn't know the reason why and then this discussion with my mother that, "You're gonna go to a new school."  Going to Keene Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], K-E-E-N-E.  And, so, there was another young boy in the neighborhood who went there.  And, I can remember, probably my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] walked me the first day, to Keene, to show me the way.  And, then the next day, the neighbors who went that way, we would go to school.  So, at third grade my brother [Geary Bethel] and I were going to separate schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that first day as being really traumatic because the teacher wanted us to write out numbers, and I couldn't spell eleven.  I didn't know what she was talking about; or, twenty-seven for something and I just, I cried that first day.  And, teacher was stern.  It's funny how you remember your sternest teacher.  I gu- teachers because I guess you learn the most.  But, Mrs. Travis [ph.], you know, she was nice--
Speaker 1: Now, what grade is that?  This is just the--?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Fourth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Fourth grade, yes, fourth grade.  'Cause I don't recall my second or third grade teachers, I'd have to look at report cards for that.  I remember Mrs. Pringle [ph.] was my first grade teacher.  Yes, and I can remember my very first day of school actually going to first grade, that my grandfather [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott] walked me to school.  My brother was supposed to walk me home but he left me--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and, so, some other girls in the neighborhood I just went with.  Even though, it wasn't far and had known where the school was 'cause had walked up there and seeing my brother in school, with him being a year older than I, and things.  So, the first grade and the fourth grade are the ones that stand out for me early.
Story_ID: 483044
Speaker 1: We're talking about school.
Speaker 2: School, yes.
Speaker 1: And, yeah--did you have a favorite teacher in school?
Speaker 2: Back then, no.  But, now I realize, even early on realized the impact of, of Mrs. Travis [ph.].  She, she was tough but at that point I was tracked in the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] school system.
Speaker 1: Now, this is at Keene Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Keene Elementary School.
Speaker 1: K-E-E-N-E.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Ms. Travis.  Now, what--?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Travis.
Speaker 1: So, how did she help you?
Speaker 2: I just learned from her, and learned that I did like school and it was good, and do your best, and all of that, yeah.  Met good friends there.  And, I can recall once that some young women on their, some college break, maybe it was Thanksgiving or something, and they came back.  And, they came in to see Mrs. Travis who had been their teacher.  And, we were like, "Who would wanna come back and see old lady Travis? Unh-uh."  But, surely when my friends, when we finished college, not finished college, went to college and we were coming back for Thanksgiving, we said, "Let's go up to Miss Travis' class."  So, we repeated that experience some, I don't know, years later.
Speaker 1: Well, did she teach literature or just a--?
Speaker 2: She was just a fourth grade teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fourth grade teacher.
Speaker 2: In class all day.
Speaker 1: Taught everything?
Speaker 2: Taught everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Taught everything and was, was stern about it too.
Speaker 1: Well, was your school all-black?
Speaker 2: That were--there were a few, a few students left, a few white students left, few Jewish students primarily left there.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that--
Speaker 2: But just a handful.
Story_ID: 483045
Speaker 1: I read that you, early on, identified an interest in yourself in black history and culture.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, was it in elementary school?  Yeah, or--?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure that it was in elementary school.  Of course, we paid attention in Negro History Week [Black History Month].  And, I knew some Negro history and my grandfather [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott] having, having been at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] with Booker T. Washington, and George Washington Carver and the things I was hearing as well as reading at home.  The home always had Ebony, Jet.
Speaker 1: My grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] was a seamstress so we also have Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.  We got newsmagazine, Time.  The Kansas City Call [The Call] would come.  The Washington Post came in the morning, the Washington Star in the afternoon; the Afro [Washington Afro-American] came.  So it was a lot of literature, lot of news and information coming into the house which I assume everyone had that flow into their homes.
Speaker 2: But, sadly, that's not the--
Speaker 1: Sadly that's not the case.  So, knew of that because we were supporters of, of black press.  And, even knew some people involved with the black press for years.  Fannie Granton [E. Fannie Granton] who worked for Jet magazine was close with my grandmother's brother and other family members.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were saying also, I guess, was it your grandfather who knew Carter G. Woodson?  Would talk to him at the resort [Hotel Comfort, Ocean City, New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  This is the gentleman that married my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Wolcott] when I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: William Holbrook Walcott [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott] who was from Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he would just--?
Speaker 2: And, went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  He went to Hampton when there were still Native American students.  And, he was recruited by Booker T. Washington.  This the way the story goes, to come down to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and do the, lead the cadet corps.  There he met and married a Bess Bolden [Bess Bolden Walcott], an Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] grad who comes to Tuskegee, starts the German department, the library, maybe the English department, the museum.  She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame [Marion, Alabama] a couple of years back.  And, they lived on campus and have four children.  So, just last month I went and saw the Carter G. Woodson exhibit at the Field Museum [Field Museum of Natural History] in Chicago [Illinois].  So, I called my aunt because in the exhibit they had a recording of his voice, and it surprised me.  He had this very high voice.  So, I called Aunt Frances [ph.] and I said, "He had his high voice and it's a wonderful exhibit."  And, she started telling me these stories about George Washington Carver--
Speaker 1: Oh, George (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) being her next door neighbor.
Speaker 1: George Washington Carver--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Not, Carter G. Woodson?
Speaker 2: Well, both of them.  He knew both.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, the one with the high voice was?
Speaker 2: The high voice was George--
Speaker 1: Washington Carver.
Speaker 2: Washington Carver.
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting, we just discussed him yesterday with another person that had family members and they confirmed this high voice, too, this very high voice he had.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I bought a book of reprinted recipes, and Aunt Frances talked about how he was always cooking things that he wanted her mother to try.  And, I said, "Well, did he have a garden?"  She said, "He grew things all over campus."  I said, "They were talking about his painting."  She said, "Yes, when he was like dorm--."  They didn't call 'em dorm matrons as women, a dorm master for lack of a better term, whatever the men were, that he would paint wonderful borders and flowers in his rooms.  Which he was certain they just painted over and let go.  And she mentioned that she and her mother had seen a display of him in a wax museum.  And they had him in a very pressed suit and looking very neat and wonderful and she said, her mother asked for the curator and took him to task.  And, said, "That is not how he looked.  He was your typical rumpled professor scientist."  And actually had them change the exhibit and how he was looking and things, so I knew those stories and accomplishments of people and what was happening.  So, I was quite aware of that.
Story_ID: 483047
Speaker 1: We went to St. Luke's Episcopal Church [Washington, D.C.].  While my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] were at Saint Augustine [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], one of my father's fraternity brothers, William Van Croft [William A. Van Croft, Jr.] became an Episcopal minister and came to St. Luke's Episcopal Church.  That may have been why we went to St. Luke's as children and perhaps were--had been baptized at Calvary [Calvary Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.] which my father's mother [Glendora Parham Bethel] had been a member of.  But, St. Luke's Episcopal Church was Alexander Crummell's church.  It's a national historic mark is one of the, if not the oldest black Episcopal Church in the country.
Speaker 2: You know, Crummell at one time was supposed to, he had a reputation as being the most erudite--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Black man in the country.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And, the only person that Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] would look across to--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In the black (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed.  Indeed.
Speaker 2: You know, so, Crummell was one of your--
Speaker 1: So, this is Talented Tenth, being in St. Luke's with his tremendous history and I think for just prior to Father Van Croft taking leadership of the church, the minister there, Bishop Brown [Dillard H. Brown] was sent to Liberia.  And, I can recall when we had boxes, we had to collect coins to donate.  So, we were donating to Liberia as children.  And, so, trying to understand that connection was, was an influence.  And, as a children, a dear family friend worked for the state department [U.S. Department of State] in Africa.  So, I had a much more realistic view of Africa than the Tarzan movies which my brother [Geary Bethel] and I enjoyed, but knew better.
Speaker 2: Well, how was it that worked for the state department and what did they, did they actually--?
Speaker 1: Sara Lee Owens worked for the, the state department.
Speaker 2: Did she work overseas at the--?
Speaker 1: Yes, she did.  She worked in Kenya for years.  I think she did a stint in Nigeria 'cause I have a photo of her with [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten Barnett at some Nigerian women's gathering.  And Aunt Sara Lee met the family in New York and I, I've seen some articles.  I don't recall what--she was like with some sort of social service agency, and I can't think of the name of it.  But, I did look at a digital version of the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] where she gets mentioned.  But, toward the end of her career she was one of the highest ranking black woman in [U.S.] Foreign Service.
Speaker 2: Now, did your parents know the Dawsons, Horace Dawson [HistoryMaker Horace G. Dawson] or Lula Dawson [HistoryMaker Lula Cole Dawson]?
Speaker 1: That's doesn't ring a bell.
Speaker 2: I know they're ambassadors in, in East African and in West Africa.  And, Liberia particularly at one point.  But, there are few, you know, they're more out here than we think--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that actually did work for the state department.
Speaker 1: That actually did work.  And, my cousin and I have talked about needing to do a biography of Sara Lee Owens, and the women and the work that they did then.  So, with Aunt Sara Lee and what was happening at church and my grandfather who we called Daddy Walcott [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott], and Daddy Walcott being in the house and my grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott], Kansas City [Missouri], and Metropolitan [Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.], and we were just, you know, steeped in it.
Story_ID: 483048
Speaker 1: Now did you ever--do you recall every having an assignment in black history to turn in, you know, in school? Had they had it formalized at the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And, I'm sure there were earlier ones--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that dealt maybe with coloring something or I can clearly remember that my seventh grade teacher, Enid Johnson [Enid Tucker Johnson], who was Mordecai Johnson's daughter-in-law.  Mordecai Johnson then president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  In her own way Mrs. Johnson in our class, ancient and medieval history, made sure we understood the African origins of ancient and medieval history.  So, during Negro History Week [Black History Month], it was those assignment, that year, that assignment in her class in ancient and medieval history and looking at African origins of it.  So, that's one; that's an assignment I can clearly remember writing.  But, all along I'm sure there were, there were things.
Speaker 1: Now, Washington, D.C. was really the, like one of the centers for the study of black people in African history.  I mean, African studies of Leo Hansberry [William Leo Hansberry] at Howard and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know any--did your parents discuss him or Frank Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.] and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Those people?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Wasn't so strong a Howard connection outside of our mother's [Helen Roy Bethel] aunt having been dorm matron there for a while.  And, I wanna say one of my father's [Frederick Bethel] brothers went.  But, I have to take that back, at Howard.  My father's best friend was a Howard grad.  Other than my father going up there to date women, I'm sure he wasn't going up there to look at Negro history.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That would not have been his, his bent on it.  He would've known more about Negro athletes and that kind of thing.  So, no.  I can recall being flip at the dinner table once when, you know, "Booker T. Washington was a Tom" kind of phrase came out, and my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] very calmly says, "You really don't know what you're talking about.  And, until you do some research, you, you can't make statements like that."  My grandfather [Bethel's step-grandfather, William Walcott] who had never chastised me, that was not his role in the family, and so that, that sent me to the books for my own education.  And, trying to learn how to appreciate circumstances.
Speaker 1: I mean, could you really discover the nuances of him in books in those days?  I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: No.  Not so much.  Not in the--at the level I was.  But, you could see his, his work, the organizing that he did with the business league putting this project together.  Even though didn't understand institution building then in the context that he wasn't the only one.  That there's certain other schools and other educators who were doing the same kind of thing.  But, beginning to understand what the Civil War and emancipation and then understanding there was this period of redemption.  And, then along comes more work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The institution building and having grandparents born during the (air quotes) Gilded Age and what it meant for them.
Story_ID: 483049
Speaker 1: Also, understanding some of the racial dynamics in Washington [D.C.].  And, a lot of things I didn't understand 'til I was older.  For example, I did know that if we went downtown to a store and perhaps saw someone we knew who was passing for white to work in a department store, we were not to acknowledge them, you know.  We know Miss So and So from church, but she's working down here at Woodward and Lothrop, you don't say hello.  Our treat was, if my grandmother took us downtown to Woodward and Lothrop, was to go to the soda fountain in the basement and have lemonade and oatmeal cookies which I thought of as a treat.  But it was only as I was an adult that I knew that my grandmother would've--could've well taken us upstairs to the dining room and had high tea, had they let her.  The first job I had was at a coffee shop summer I turned fifteen, and a little while before, my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] had taken me in the coffee shop and said, you know, Negroes couldn't eat here, when sh- my mother first came to Washington.  And, so, I was aware of somewhat of the racial dynamics that were happening in the neighborhood.  But I was really in a, growing up in an all-black neighborhood by the time I was able to run around, and we could play in the streets then, to know there were just a handful of whites still scattered around the neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, you grew up in what they began to refer to as Chocolate City?
Speaker 1: Definitely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was definitely, definitely chocolate that made that wave of where, where I was growing up and into the schools.  And, I think if not the last, one of the last, group of students to be tracked in Washington for--as Negro students, into advanced placement classes is what they would call it now.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, they don't do that anymore?
Speaker 1: Maybe they disguise it in some kind of way, and put you on an academic track or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, were you in the highest track?
Speaker 1: --a general track or that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Were you in the highest track as you (unclear)?
Speaker 1: To have been in a public school, I think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 483050
Speaker 1: What were you like?  I mean, what were your likes and dislikes, and what did you like to do as a little girl?
Speaker 2: I did like to read.  I can remember reading under the covers with a flashlight.
Speaker 1: What did they tell you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Loved TV.
Speaker 1: "You shouldn't read if you're going to bed."  You can't--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was supposed to be in the bed.  I was supposed been sleep.
Speaker 1: Be asleep.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I needed glasses early, very early on.  And, my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] was just set against it.  The, you know, "Boys don't make passes at girls that wear glasses."  My mother never liked wearing glasses, and for a number of years, if ever my mother knew she was having her picture taken, she would take her glasses off.  So, she didn't like that.  And, she just resisted, for some reason, taking us to get glasses.  And, so, it was unusual for my father [Frederick Bethel] to do those kinds of things with us, take us to the doctor, take us here and take us there.  But, it was he that finally took us to have our eyes checked.  And so, getting glasses, well beyond when I probably should've had 'em as a toddler made a difference.  So, I can clearly remember the difference between seeing and not being able to see.  There were some years I was tomboy where I could, you know, rip and run and climb trees, and play dodge ball and softball and all of that.  Television creeps in at some point, I liked that.  I liked dolls.  I had a dollhouse.
Speaker 1: You ever had a--did you have a favorite television show?  I mean, television show--shows when they came out?
Speaker 2: I was just in Anaheim [California] and went to Disneyland for the first time with my nephew and his girlfriend, and I had a ball.  And, like, had a hard time understanding why I was having such an emotional response to Disneyland.  So, as we were waiting for the fireworks, I'm thinking, Disney and my life.  Every day after school, 'Mickey Mouse Club' ['The Mickey Mouse Club'].  Every Sunday, 'Wonderful World of Disney' ['The Wonderful World of Disney'] you know.  You would have Sunday dinner and do the dishes so you could get ready to do 'Wonderful World of Disney.'  Barbie, all the characters and all of that.  So, I had a Barbie doll.  I had a Midge doll when--that was the first black Midg- black doll came out, that's what I got (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that exciting when the first black one came out?
Speaker 2: For Barbie, yes.  But, I had had black dolls before.  And, I had actually had black doll that had belonged to my mother as a child for which my grandmother made a dress for me and a dress for the doll.  So, that was just the cutest thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, that matched (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Nods head) That when I went out with my doll, and we were dressed alike.  Maybe that had something to do with my wanting to coordinate things now and match, I hadn't thought of that.  But, yes, so, I, I did like that.  I had a brother [Geary Bethel].  So, it was a lot of rough housing, lot of cowboys and Indians, you know, strap pillows to the bedpost and ride off into the sunset.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That kind of thing.  He liked The Three Stooges because he wanted to practice stooge stuff on me and that kind of thing.  The science fiction.  My father being with the rec department [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation] if he could show a film on the playground and he had the equipment for the weekend, he'd just come home and throw up a sheet in the living room and the whole neighborhood would come in.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a big deal in those days, right?  To be able to show a movie at your house?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was.  It was.  He showed the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in the living room.  Somehow when that creature came up out the water, I went upstairs with my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walker], and have had hard times with scary movies since.  I had to leave 'Aliens' [sic. 'Alien'].  When that thing shoot up out the body, I shot up out the room (laughter).  So, yes.  Also neighborhood theaters; Sundays going down to the Kennedy Theater [Washington, D.C.], double feature.  It was--it was fabulous.  It was wonderful.  We played either the alley behind the house or back then we could actually play on the street.  It was a lot less street traffic.  And, right across the street from the house was our lamp post which was home base for kids in the neighborhood.  So, all our parents knew where we were, and where we should be.  They needed to be able to see us under that light.  So, it was home base for hide and go seek, and every other game that we had to do.  Ice cream man came around, we would lose our mind.  Like Eddie Murphy say, "Ice cream man, ice cream," that kind of thing was always a treat.  My mother coming home from work, I remember.  My mother liked chewing gum and we might be getting a half a stick of gum to chew before dinner (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 483051
Speaker 1: What about music?  Was music a--the radio I know that--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, I was at--
Speaker 1: In that era.  That was--
Speaker 2: --there at the beginning of WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Soul radio in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]  And, there was music, our first television was a console thing that had the radio and the TV, and the record player.  And, there was still 78s so my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] would play 78s and all of that.  And, of course, when they--45 little machine comes that every girl had and could buy 45 records.  I did that.  I remember the first 45s I bought.  I bought 'Johnny Angel,' and 'He's So Fine' and--
Speaker 1: Is that The Shirelles?
Speaker 2: And, 'Please Mr. Postman,' I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Martha and the Vandellas.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  (Singing) "Do-lang, do-lang, do-lang, yes, yes, yes."  Yep, I was in New York [New York], I did that.  And, speaking of New York before Easter break in Washington's schools when I was growing up it was--spring break was always Easter week, so you would get off that Good Friday and you would have the next week off.  And, for more years than I can think, perhaps five or six or more, my [paternal] grandmother [Glendora Parham Bethel] would take me to New York [New York] for Easter week.  And, we would stay with her sister and be in New York.  And, just loved that.  So, I bought my first records in New York.  And, so, there was music.  At some point there was a piano in the house, early on.  My mother had to take piano lessons.  And the piano was in the house but my mother didn't play the piano.  And, I can remember her calling us in one day from play, hard at play, to ask us if we wanted to take piano lessons.  We said, "No, thank you."  Next thing I knew the piano was gone.  So, I regret not having said, "Oh, yes, let me take piano lessons."
Speaker 1: Did you play any instrument at all?
Speaker 2: I did.  They still had music education back then.  I played the flute for many years.  Not enough to, to do anything with.  I was spared.  One of my grandmother's cousins had a music school, Eunice Sheppard [ph.].  And, I was forced to go to the recitals but I wasn't forced to go to the school, so.  But, yes, there was music in the house.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: My mother's favorite record was 'After Hours.'  My father was a Dinah Washington fan.  My grandmother like, of course, Nat King Cole.  She liked Earl Hines [Earl "Fatha" Hines].  He liked Dean Martin, and she liked the good singers; Sinatra [Frank Sinatra], and items.  So, I frequently told people that over the years that I like westerns and sporting events and war movies because the men controlled the TV in my house.  When there was only one TV in the living room, the men controlled it between my grandfather [Bethel's maternal step-grandfather, William Walcott], my father, and my brother [Geary Bethel].  So, I know war films, and westerns, and sports.
Story_ID: 483052
Speaker 1: Now was the church a big part of growing up?  I know you, you're associated with the Episcopal church, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was it a big part?
Speaker 2: Not so much.  I mean, on Sundays and Sundays school definitely.  Can only remember Vacation Bible School once or twice.  As a teenager, I was president of the young people's fellowship for years, and our church [St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.] had a reputation for having slamming parties.  So that was a hard one to keep up.  And, we would sell donuts on Sunday after service to raise some money for whatever events and try to participate in church drives.  Toward the '60s [1960s] there was a lot of activity amongst churches to have young people get together.  So, we would go to what they would call happenings.  So we would go to these white churches or they would come to us for the kids, and we would have an evening of happening; play some music, maybe they'd be candles burning, something not quite hippie-ish but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A happening, huh?
Speaker 2: --nor was it very didactic about the theology or any of that.  As I said, Father Van Croft [William A. Van Croft, Jr.] was a family friend and I remember my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] taking him, taking me to him very early 'cause I had such questions after I decided, "Oh, I'm gonna read the Bible."  So, I'm reading the Bible, I'm like, "Boy, do I have questions for you," (laughter).  And, so, he was really nice and gentle with me.  You know, and talked about faith.  And, talked about creation myths and other stories, and that kind of thing.  And, gave me a better way to cope with my questions about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, he didn't--
Speaker 2: --the church.
Speaker 1: --try to defend the Bible as a literal piece that you had to take as written or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He actually--
Speaker 2: 'Cause he knew I had read a lot, and the questions I was having and this, that and the other.  And, said, "Well, you don't think, perhaps differently about something that time as we know it now may have not been time as it was known when the Bible was written, you know."  Or, you know, "Think that there other possibilities."  And as part of this kind of happening, which actually it happened a little later, we were visiting other churches and seeing what the other rituals were and, and what they meant.  And, being in the Episcopal church makes you somewhat of an Anglophile.  So when you find out that the Episcopal church is here 'cause Henry [Henry VIII] wanted a new wife, you know.  To a young person that's like, "Well, what kind of doctrine is this?  What, what am I, what am I practicing?  What am I believing?  What am I feeling?  What, what do I know?"  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But, other than that wasn't a lot of proselytizing in the home.  You know, we did our confirmations, which were big, and you go you do your catechism class so you can demonstrate an understanding of, of scripture and of lessons and why we do what we do.  Our church had a fabulous choir.  I enjoyed the young folk there, and there were people in the neighborhood that were involved.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: We often car- carpooled to go to Sunday school.
Story_ID: 483053
Speaker 1: Who were your friends, I guess, I guess when you were about twelve years old or so?
Speaker 2: When I was about twelve years old, Claudia Hill [ph.] lived across the street.  Classmates would've been Gwendolyn Price [ph.].  Twelve years old was that the fifth grade?  Tracy Thomas [ph.].  At that point, there were, there was a sexual skew in my classes that they were just a handful of boys.  Just a handful of boys and maybe twenty--twenty or twenty-six girls or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, that's odd for that age group, I guess.
Speaker 2: Not, for the track bit.
Speaker 1: Not for--oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Not for the students that have been tracked.
Speaker 1: So the girls had already begun to outperform the boys in school.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, once you were tracked early, we really didn't pick up new people.  What happened when you went to junior high school is other kids that had been tracked came in and it was just a lot of girls.
Speaker 1: So, if you got on the wrong, or a slower track, you were kind of trapped.
Speaker 2: You were.  You were.
Story_ID: 483054
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your friends in school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My friends, yes.  Friends in school, yeah, I mentioned Gwen [Gwendolyn Price (ph.)] and Tracy [Tracy Thomas (ph.)].  Pamela Yancey [Pamela Yancey Reed], her father [J. Worden Yancey, Jr.] was a dentist.  That was early on from, from elementary.  Joy Johnson [ph.] lived up the street.  Yeah, there were a set of twins Jeanette [Jeanette Saunders (ph.)] and Jeanell Saunders [ph.] when I got to junior high school [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] and picked up some other friends.  Barbara Wright [ph.] coming to high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] with Valeria Byrd [ph.], Nancy Lucas, yeah.
Speaker 1: I just wonder in Washington, D.C. such a--has such a strong history of organizations.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Black org- especially among black women.  Were there groups of girls or girls that had organized themselves in the schools even, around different things?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] when she came to Washington joined a social group called the Cornets [ph.].  And, these were young women had gone to high school like with my father [Frederick Bethel].  So, because she was my father's wife she has entry into this group of women who, this is from the early '50s [1950s], who fifty years later these women still meet as a social group.  They would, on occasion, would do things that were civic minded; food baskets for the holidays, old clothes for the needy, monies for whatever.  We would joke and call them the chitchat club because my mother was in a bridge club or some other activities as well.  So, knowing my mother and her social club, I think probably junior high school or high school, my friends and I got together to form a social club, a core which of them still meet in Washington once a month for dinner.  I don't believe with an agenda for that group, but, back then we did do the food drive for Thanksgiving and, I forgot how we raised some money to buy jackets so we'd all have the same jackets and things.  But, yes, yeah.  'Cause we weren't on that cotillion circuit.  We weren't that middle class to do that.  I don't think anybody in the group did.  I'm trying to think.
Speaker 1: But, there was another level of people that were in the cotillions and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All that.  The Links [The Links, Incorporated] club--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: People.  I don't know if there was a--
Speaker 2: But, my mother did send--
Speaker 1: Junior Links club, or--?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Probably is.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My mother did send me to Precola DeVore's School of Charm [Precola DeVore School of Charm, Washington, D.C.].  And, her sister [HistoryMaker] Ophelia DeVore was a black woman who made cosmetics, made her money with cosmetics.
Speaker 1: How do you spell their name?
Speaker 2: Capital D-E, capital V-O-R-E (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) DeVore.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Orphelia, O-R-P--
Speaker 1: Orphelia DeVore--
Speaker 2: H-E-L-I-A [sic.], I think.  Ophelia DeVore.
Speaker 1: That's quite a, that's an ornate kind of name for--
Speaker 2: And, I don't if it was just whatever but,--
Speaker 1: It was the real name or are they--?
Speaker 2: Ophelia DeVore.  But, the sister had the same name, so it made me think, same last name, that it may have been legit.
Speaker 1: So, that school of--
Speaker 2: And, I did look them up.
Speaker 1: Was it called a school of charm or a school of--?
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe so.  'Cause I had been a tomboy and my mother was trying to smooth out the rough edges.  So, so that--
Speaker 1: So, you're more of a daddy's girl, or?
Speaker 2: I did enjoy the summer that I would, we would go to work with my father, and be on the playground and be rough.  And, at some point he just stopped taking me without explaining 'cause he's not much to explain.  And, it was my mother that said, "Well, he no longer wants you to be around, you know, these rough kids."  "You're just outgrowing it," more or less is what she was saying.  But, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, you all were mirroring the social clubs that your mother was in since (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that my mother was a part of and my [maternal] grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walcott] and her husband [Leonard Roy] had been a part of.  You could call my father's a social club.  They called themselves like, the Corner Boys, and they just had a reunion, their annual reunion not too long ago.  And, these were all guys that, I'd have to think of what the Corner is.  I think it's something in Benning Road, but I'm not sure.  But, his generation from that, that time period when he was a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: That, that he's still quite close to.  Made a number of contacts being at Saint Aug so that two of my godparents had gone to Saint Augustine [Saint Augustine's College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and was close with their families, my mother's best friends.  So, it was also that kind of church connection if you would, or education connection.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Theodore Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School] in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Theodore Roosevelt, okay.
Speaker 2: Rough Riders.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Roosevelt High School.  Okay, and, well, what was it like?  Was it all-black?  I supposed it probably was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at that point.
Speaker 2: It was.  It was.
Speaker 1: Was it the teaching corps basically all-black too?
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  But, we had begun to see that infusion of young white teachers who didn't have to pay back their loans if they worked at inner city schools for a couple of years.  And, they, well, may have been well meaning but I think some of them might have done a little disservice for us.  They weren't as invested in the community.  It wasn't like, you know, you could run into Miss Travis [ph.] in the store.  So, you always had (laughter) to behave, because the teachers you--the people in your life were there in your life, your teachers, your ministers and that kind of thing.  Not that you were going to misbehave in public, but these young whites we were not gonna see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you started school around '67 [1967]?  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: High school?  I finished in '71 [1971] so, yeah, I guess, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did you have a particular concentration in high school?  And, did you, were you thinking about that, "Well I'm going to--?"
Speaker 2: Whatever the academic track was.  It was--
Speaker 1: College prep?
Speaker 2: It was never a question that, you know, we were not going to college.  That was just never a conversation in my circle.
Speaker 1: Were grades a concern of yours at all?  I mean, you're in the highest group but did you--?
Speaker 2: I was--I knew I could've done better, you know, done the work that I--I knew that I could get by with some things as well.  My brother's [Geary Bethel] report card perhaps challenged him a bit more.  And, all I had to wait for him to show his, and mine (scoffs) (laughter), you know, they'd be thrilled.  I be like, "Have you showed them your report card yet?  Go on and show 'em," you know.  And, then my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] would ask for the report cards.
Speaker 1: So he lowered the curve?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They were, they were like, "What are you doing?"  And, then me, they were like, "Oh, yeah.  You, you could do better.  You could do better."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a favorite subject in high school that was maybe different from--?
Speaker 2: In high school there were a couple of things that happened.  My first formal course looking at African history.  And, they tried a new project, a humanities track that combined history and literature.
Speaker 1: Now, these are new developments in the public schools--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the sense that, remember the era, the late '60s [1960s], the black power era and the Black Arts Movement era, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, black subject matter was infused into public schools around the country--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in one way or another.  So, this is the first wave of that, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I had actually forgotten about some of that 'til I ran across old report cards my mother had kept, or transcript or something, that I said, "Oh, yeah, I did take an African history course in high school."
Speaker 1: Well, what did you think?  Were you surprise at the information?  Or what kind of information was it?
Speaker 2: I was still disappointed that it was a history of the white man in African for an awful lot of it.
Speaker 1: Was the teacher white?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, no.  I believe she was an African American who may have married an African.  'Cause if I think long enough her name will come back to me, but, it's something with like an N-G-Y, Nyangoni [ph.] or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 483056
Speaker 1: Having, you know, attending an Episcopal church [St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.] were there a lot of Africans and West Indians in your church?  I know a lot of them are members of Episcopal churches over here when they come over, because of the Anglican, you know, connection.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I didn't have a sense of that, a sense of people with accents at church, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there probably--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: --there weren't very many.
Speaker 2: It was, it was pretty staid.  I think Senator Edward Brooke's [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] mother [Helen Seldon Brooke] went there.  I think Hazel Scott for a few years, somebody was telling me that when I was young.   And, I didn't know who she was.  They were professionals also folks involved in, in government and all, but, yes.  When I went to junior high school, I spent one year at Bertie Backus Junior High School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Bernie Backus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bertie, B-E-R--
Speaker 1: Bertie, okay.
Speaker 2: T-I [sic.], B-A-C-K-U-S.
Speaker 1: B-E-R-T--
Speaker 2: T- Bertie, B-E-R-T-I-E.
Speaker 1: T-I-E.
Speaker 2: Backus, B-A-C-K-U-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Now, who is that named after, do you know?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember what Bertie Backus did.
Speaker 1: Was that a black person?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bertie Backus, okay.  Well, go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then we went to a brand new junior high school, Rabaut, R-A-B-A-U-T [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], and I wanna say Charles [sic. Louis C. Rabaut].  But, I know he is the, I believe he was a senator who had the line, "One nation (air quotes) under God," put into the Pledge of Allegiance, was he claim to fame.  And, my homeroom teacher was Mrs. Black [ph.] who we had never had, what we thought was a stylish teacher.  I mean, she had a sharp haircut, she was clean every day.  She was like just a perfect role model for us 'cause we were like keeping track of her wardrobe.  "She hadn't worn the same thing twice in months," as the notes would go around class.  We had a stern principal, Mr. Graves [Lawrence E. Graves].  So, we couldn't wear jeans, we couldn't wear excessive jewelry, any of that.  That was just beginning to happen throughout the city.  He was not having it at Rabaut.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a transition there 'cause--during that period, late '60s [1960s].  Before that, youngsters could not wear jeans to school.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: I mean, not--girls couldn't wear pants.
Speaker 2: Right.  No, you could wear pants to school, couldn't wear pants to school.  The music teacher was Roberta Novosel who was signing nights at Mr. Henry's [Washington, D.C.] and later became Roberta Flack.  So, she was music teacher at my junior high school.
Speaker 1: And, her last name Novosel, is N--?
Speaker 2: N-O-V-E, I think, S-E-L [sic.].  Her husband [Steve Novosel] was a bass player.  And, she taught for a year and we thought of her as, we didn't think of her as eccentric but she kind of floated through the halls and her voice was so distinct and she wore capes or serapes and different color earrings.  She just had style and flash, so, these, these two women as teachers were, were influential then.  That's where Enid Johnson [Enid Tucker Johnson] was teaching as well.  So, Rabaut was a good experience those two years before going--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad we went back to get that.  I'm sorry I, I took from grade school and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Skipped middle school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, junior high.
Speaker 1: Or junior high school.
Speaker 2: I still don't with middle school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that some--
Speaker 2: That's some--
Speaker 1: That's the city's--
Speaker 2: --fifth, sixth grade, so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I went to sixth and then one year of seventh grade at Backus and two years at Rabaut.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then three years at Roosevelt.
Story_ID: 483057
Speaker 1: So Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] you come in the tenth grade then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is?
Speaker 2: Tenth, eleventh and twelfth, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, this is like '68 [1968] then, I guess, the year you you started.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because I was at Rabaut [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I must've been.  Yeah, April '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: We were at Rabaut--
Speaker 2: I was at Rabaut.
Speaker 1: When Dr. King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: For some reason--why do I think I was at Roosevelt?  No.  The National Guard camped out at Roosevelt.  That's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, you were at Rabaut?
Speaker 2: But, I was at Rabaut.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].  And, what--do you remember how you found out about it?  Or, were you in school when that happened?
Speaker 2: No.  I found out about it, Aunt Janie, Janie Connors [ph.], who lived two doors from my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel].  Aunt Janie was fascinating.  Aunt Janie did hair in the home as well as daycare in the home.  So, my first job ever, was after school helping Aunt Janie get her kids ready, get 'em fed and get 'em ready to go home when their mothers picked them up, or parents picked them up rather.  And, I was at Aunt Janie's house and the TV was on and that's when the news came about Dr. King.  And, I can remember going to school the next day and there were just a handful of white students there, and they had to have been protected and escorted out.  And, then by the afternoon, you know, all hell broke loose, and there were just riots everywhere.  And, we could see the smoke from the house and the neighborhood.  My grandmother's very good coat got burned up in a cleaners that was set on fire.  And so, smoldering Washington [D.C.].  Yeah, I remember that all so very clearly.
Speaker 1: I don't know, last summer they depicted the whole riot in a movie about Petey Greene ['Talk to Me'].  I don't know if you remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Petey Greene and my father [Frederick Bethel] were in junior high school together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He said Petey use to, "He used to rhyme even back then."
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I'd always known about Pete Greene 'cause they were friends.  And, yeah, trying to depict that, that time period.  So, yeah, I could clearly remember the riots.  I remember where I was when I heard about Kennedy.  I can, all of that are seared memories, yeah.
Story_ID: 483058
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], a tumultuous year, and you started high (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much so.
Speaker 1: --school at the, in the fall of '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, had you been expecting to enter high school at Roosevelt?  Was that where you planned to go, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, that year they changed the boundaries for high school, and there were a large number of students who came to Roosevelt that thought they were going to McKinley Tech [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.].  And, some people we thought were coming to Roosevelt went to Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  So, my class kind of got fractured.  And, when I was in high school with a class that was less than cohesive 'cause a lot of 'em didn't wanna be there.  And, they had to take the bus in.  And, they never got over it their whole three years that they didn't wanna be there, so.  It could've been a stronger class.  Also, the class ahead of us, my brother's [Geary Bethel] class, it wasn't Roosevelt, but one of the class trips, one of the trips the kids acted up so bad that they cancelled the next year's class trip.  So, our class didn't get a trip, and things like that.  But, yeah.  So, high school was something.  My father [Frederick Bethel] knew the principal who was known as Shirley Olivia Brown [sic. Shirley O'Donnell Brown].  That was his name.  His initials S.O.B.  And, for some reason I was in the principal's office with my friends.
Speaker 1: So, Shirley; this is man?
Speaker 2: This is a man.
Speaker 1: His name is Shirley?
Speaker 2: His name was Shirley Olivia Brown.
Speaker 1: Olivia?
Speaker 2: We understood that he changed it--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  My father knew him as a youth, as well.
Speaker 1: I know he had to be tough to grow up in the hood with a name like that.
Speaker 2: I, um-hm.  Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Did they call him S.O. Brown (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't know what my father said they called 'em?  'Cause they all had such nicknames.  My father's friends, Slim Jelly, Black Jelly, Red Jelly, you know, Hicks, Sandwich, you know (laughter), lots and lots of nicknames for Washington [D.C.], men of my father's generation.  But, yeah, one time I--whatever, for whatever reason was in the principal's office and he said to me, "Bethel [HistoryMaker Kathleen E. Bethel].  Are you Freddie Bethel's daughter?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "So, you know, I better never see you in here again.  You can go."
Speaker 1: What had you done?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  My friends and I been, for some reason a teacher put us out of class and sent us down there.
Speaker 1: Did you get in trouble for talking a lot?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking.  I'd been thinking that's probably the--
Speaker 2: Probably.  I probably had something to say about something.  I'm trying to re- I've been trying to remember what it was that I did, but, yeah.  So, so, my father had a tremendous reputation and knew a lot of people in Washington for which I'm sure it was more difficult on my brother than for myself.  But, I couldn't go anywhere where people didn't know my father.
Story_ID: 483059
Speaker 1: Was your brother [Geary Bethel] involved in sports too, like your father [Frederick Bethel]?
Speaker 2: Not as much as my father would've liked.  And I think he played tennis in high school.  And it, it was a lot of pressure.  And, also because my father was in the recreation department [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation], we had all the equipment at my house, you know.  We could just fill any, anything you wanted to do, we had the ball, we had the pump, needles; we had everything.  So, it wasn't like people really wanted to be your friend, they just wanted to use your stuff (laughter).  That, that kind of thing, so, yeah, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, were you involved in clubs in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm trying to remember what I did; would've been like on a junior council, some kind of student government thing.  One year in high school I participated in a Girls State [American Legion Girls State] bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That like--I've heard the Boys State [American Legion Boys State] but now they--
Speaker 2: Boys State, Girl State.
Speaker 1: So, they started a Girls State?
Speaker 2: Mock government--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, that kind of thing.  And, we lived on campus at Trinity College [Hartford, Connecticut].  And, another college experience I had earlier was, I went to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] one summer when they were testing out the new math that I think my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] signed me up or, I don't know if it came from the school or from my mother.
Speaker 1: The new math had never, did it ever catch on?
Speaker 2: The new math never did catch on, 'cause I didn't catch it that summer.  But, we were like testing out the new math.
Speaker 1: I remember the math, yes.
Speaker 2: So, it--I did that.  I was involved in some other group that we had some retreat at Hersh- Harpers Ferry [West Virginia].  I'm trying to remember what that was.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember what else (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What that at the old black college campus [Storer College] at Harpers Ferry?  The college that's now closed down.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't at the college.  It was like at an inn or someplace there.  I don't remember it being at a college.  If it was, it was like a conference facility.  But, I don't remember that we were at a college.  No, unh-uh.  But, let's see what else in high school.  Well, you know, I had this job after school, so I did that until--I'm trying to remember when I stopped helping Aunt Janie [ph.] after school.
Story_ID: 483060
Speaker 1: Aunt Janie [ph.] was fascinating too.  She would take me to New York [New York] as well.  Her mother owned a funeral parlor on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], Odessa Bailey's Mortuary [ph.] and could sit in the window and watch Harlem [New York, New York] all day long.  It was fascinating to me 'cause I'm coming from Washington, D.C.  There're a lot of Negroes there, but to be in New York on Lenox Avenue, on a Sunday, and the street corner preachers are out, and the churches are parading, and people are strolling, and Harlem is so alive and vibrant.  It was amazing to me.
Speaker 2: Now, are you reading the Harlem Renaissance poetry at that point?  Or, the stories that--? Are you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I never really was a poetry fan but I did know of the renaissance and the artists and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Of course, the Black Arts Movement that was going on when you were there, that's another high point, so.
Speaker 1: But, I'm also coming from Washington where family members were taught by Lois Mailou Jones, Alma Thomas.  For some reason Hale Woodruff and my grandmother were friends.  My mother [Helen Roy Bethel] tells a story about when my grandmother comes to New York to visit and wants to meet her at the home of a friend.  And, my mother comes in and she's really kind of flippant and looking around and: "Well, who's the artist?"  And, it's Hale Woodruff.  So, a real treat of my life was when I was able to purchase a Hale Woodruff piece for my mother.  So, so, no.  I knew of art and artists and had favorites even before the Black Arts Movement.  You know I knew of Tanner [Henry Ossawa Tanner].  You know, I knew of Savage [Augusta Savage].  I knew of these people.
Story_ID: 483061
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense then of becoming a librarian?
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that people dream of being.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, but it's--everybody knows the value of it but they don't seem to dream of being that, a librarian--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but I just wondered if you had a special relationship with any of the librarians that you, in the school or the neighborhood, or--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the librarians.  The library I can remember.  And, I can remember my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] sending me to the library and she was really good at suggesting titles to read.  "Well, try 'Joy in the Morning' [Betty Smith]."  Or, she turned me on to 'Atlas Shrugged' [Ayn Rand].  And, then I became a big architecture fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and things, so.  And, I can remember being able to no longer be in the children's department of the library and being downstairs at the Petworth [Petworth Neighborhood Library, Washington, D.C.] branch of the public library which sits right behind the high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  And, I--so, I can remember the first time I was able to go to the library, walking to the library by myself, that my mother let me go.  So, library was pretty much of a routine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old were you when you first were able to go by yourself?
Speaker 2: I think around, maybe the fifth grade.  If I was able to walk down to Keene [Keene Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] to go to school, fourth or fifth grade, she would've let me go to the library.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Nine and ten years old.
Speaker 2: And, I'm sure Miss Travis [ph.] had us assignments that sent us to the library.  'Cause other than 1935 set of 'World Book Encyclopedia' and other basic reference books, you know, what, what else were you gonna do in the home to do your research?  You had to go to the library.  You couldn't get it all out of, out of your text books and things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I do remember that.  And, becoming a librarian didn't really hit me 'til my senior year of college [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois].  And, then I became to recognize so many of the women in my lives who were librarians that I didn't known were librarians, you know.  I just, you hear somebody's in the school, you think everybody's a teacher.  You don't think of people being administrators or assistant principals or that kind of thing, or being school librarians.  So, when I was having a conversation with my family about being a librarian, my librarian aunts for which I had many for a small family.  I'm like, "Oh, okay."  She's like, "Well, you know down at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Washington, D.C.], Aunt Carol [ph.] heads the Veterinary Library [T.S. Williams Veterinary Medical Library] down there."  I'm like, "Oh yeah, right.  Okay."  My mother's cousin that just passed this weekend in Kansas City [Missouri] schools had been a teacher that went from the classroom to the library.  Same thing with Aunt Althea [ph.].  My Aunt Elizabeth [ph.] who lived in Chicago [Illinois], taught at Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't know she had library experience in her background.  And, they were all very responsive and encouraging to me to do that.  So, no.  I didn't think of it then as a job.  I knew I liked libraries and I could see why others did not.  And, I was troubled as I was getting through high school of trying to find more information about our experience and where it was kept in a library and how it was.  And, the kinds of messages I was getting out of black power and pan-Africanism, that you needed to have a skill for the liberation of African people and what was my skill gonna be?  I had grown up saying I wanted to be a lawyer.  Aunt Mary Frances [ph.] was a lawyer.  I wanted to be a lawyer.
Story_ID: 483062
Speaker 1: Where were these messages co- I mean, I mean, they're all around but like, who are you tuning into in those days?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: Well, definitely we're looking at women in the movement.  You know, looking at Kathleen Cleaver.  But, I would've come up being indoctrinated in a Mary McLeod Bethune, and [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, the work of those kinds of women, but for the black power kinds of things, you know, I was looking at the Panthers [Black Panther Party].  There was a Panther chapter in my high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh, in the high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, trying to take a look of what was happening with the riots.  And, not just the '68 [1968] riots, and not just the '67 [1967], but the '65 [1965].  And, then learning that there were riots in '46 [1946], learning that there're riots in New York [New York] in the 19th century.  Learning about protest, and rebellion and not accepting the visual and literary bits we would get about the slave experience.  I mean, back then, you would still have black and white movies, minstrel shows and things, you could catch on a late show, some of that imagery.  And, so, that was, was troubling.  Also, having learn that what I thought was a more realistic view of Africa now.  Why is Africa seen like this?  And, why do they call Africa poor when all the mineral worth--wealth of the planet is there.  What do they mean?  How does this work?  You know, who decided to carve up Africa?  Looking at who decided to carve up America, and what happens with European expansion of power on this planet?  And, just really a history buff.  My father's middle brother [Albert Bethel] used to tease me and call me [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis.  "Here come Angela Davis."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have a big afro by 1968, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't that big.  It was pretty big.
Speaker 1: But you had a--
Speaker 2: And, it was actually my mother who first started--
Speaker 1: Wearing an afro?
Speaker 2: Who told me to--who, who got me there.  Because my mother's hair was very straight.  You know, and, my mother's brother, Uncle Leonard [Leonard Roy, Jr.].  There were relatives on my mother's side of the family could pass, and many of them did.  Only one I know of forever, but I know others who might have done so to go to the movies, or to get a job, or that kind of things.  So, they had a whole different hair texture (laughter).  As a matter of fact, I asked my mother once, "What did my grandmother [Margaret Goines Roy Walker] say when you said you were gonna marry daddy [Frederick Bethel]?"  She just said, "Helen [Helen Roy Bethel], think of your children's hair."  So, you know, I've heard the--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  We have to pause here to change tape--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but that's--
Story_ID: 483063
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking off camera about color recognition in the black community and what it means and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) all those dynamics--go ahead a just--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was saying that my first afro was done by my mother [Helen Roy Bethel].  And, you were asking if my mother had one.  And, I was saying, my mother had a whole different texture of hair.  It was very straight and, what that meant in the African American community, and my recognition didn't come 'til much later about color and hair and all of that because it didn't happen in the family.  There were all shades all across the family and my mother detested any discussion of it.  My mother was, "You're black, you're black."  My mother was a one drop rule believer, "You're black, you're black," you know.  So, when her friends would say, "Well, what color?"  And, my mother said, "What do you mean what color?"  She would always say, "If you're black, you're black," so, those kinds of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's like it's a statement of allegiance--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: To the people that she--
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Grew up around and knew and were related to.
Speaker 2: Very much so to the community.  So, yes, it was.  It was.  And as we were talking about hair tales, and I mentioned that Aunt Janie [ph.] did hair in the basement next--two doors down, that she would do my hair, but on occasion, my mother would press my hair.  And, I can remember her teaching me how to tell time.  And, nothing could pressure you more than a hot comb behind your ear when your mother says, "Put the arm here and there, and what time is it?"  So, we had this play clock that she was teaching me to tell time on the face of the clock while she's pressing my hair.  So, that the pressure to, to learn how to tell time when I think of that it's just like, "Oh, am I gonna get it right?  She's gonna hold my ear."  And, and all of that time spent between certain colored girls with colored hair, and their mothers and the hair bit is quite precious and the stories and lessons that are imparted there where you do have somebody's undivided attention for quite, quite a bit of time.
Speaker 1: So, in that, did you, do you remember where you first saw a natural hairdo?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My New York [New York] cousin had one.  My New York cousin, Karen Baxter, my [paternal] grandmother's [Glendora Parham Bethel] niece, right.  Her name is actually Margaret Karen Baxter had the first, she was the first person I knew with one.  Had seen images of it, of course, but she was the first person I knew.
Speaker 1: What did you think when you saw it?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I loved it, 'cause at that point Karen was embracing things African, and in my mind she had been an artist anyway and as an older cousin that you looked up to and as a style maven, it was something.  And, as we would go to New York for our Easter week break, it was just me and my grandparents--my brother [Geary Bethel] didn't go--that if I stayed in Karen's room I had to help her decorate it, you know.  So, I would spend the week painting and we'd make pillows and we'd do all the kind of decorating things, so.  She's still quite an idol for me now, of the things she does.  So, she's the first woman I knew to dread her hair.  She also braided hair.  She braided and traveled with Stevie Wonder.  I mean, not traveled with Stevie Wonder but she did travel with Nina Simone, and do her hair and take care.  And, she did do a pattern of Stevie Wonder's 'Talking Book' album.  But, one they didn't like so they brought somebody else in to redo his hair; to do the braiding.  So, to have that kind of skill and hair look was something.
Speaker 1: Now, I know in 1968 or so that's when, well, maybe a little earlier, people started, black women started en masse going back to natural hair styles and--how did you feel about that at the time?  I mean, what was your, did you feel it was a political statement or just a style or what?
Speaker 2: No, I definitely knew of it as a political statement and a political style as well.  And, got compliments on it and liked it very much and saw some look in the older generations, "What have you done to your hair?" kind of bit, you know, but, yeah.  Yeah.  I actually can remember what I wore that day too.  The first day I went in with, with my hair in a natural.
Speaker 1: What did you wear?
Speaker 2: I had a white blouse.  I was in Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] colors 'cause I had a little orange tie and a blue knit vest, and a pleated skirt, blue, navy blue pleated skirt and I would've worn my black and whites probably with my pom-pom Roosevelt tassels on 'em.  I must--it must've been a pep rally or something that day or whatever 'cause I was in Roosevelt colors for sure, orange and blue.
Story_ID: 483064
Speaker 1: Was there any special recognition of you in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] at graduation time or--?
Speaker 2: No.  Not--no, no, no.  I'm trying to remember what year I was in the honors society and where, where was that in my career; my education background.  No.  I had been defeated in the office of class secretary so that was a mini blow.  But, I'd been on the senior class whatever, council or that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Were you on the yearbook staff at all or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't do yearbook.  No, I don't remember being--I have to look that up and see--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: --what I had done.
Speaker 1: But, when you were on--you knew you were going to college.  Had you already chosen your school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I applied to--I wanted to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  But, I knew my father [Frederick Bethel] wasn't gonna pay for me to live down the street.  My parents wanted me to go to a historically black college [HBCU].  It was the desegregation of higher education and majority schools were clamoring for black students.  And, the--one of the lessons of the day was, "You got to know the white man, you know.  So, go to a school there."  So, the Elmhurst College [Elmhurst, Illinois] where I'd ended up going had a recruiter on the East Coast.  And, the profile of the college said they had fifteen student from D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  I knew most of 'em had to be black because D.C. meant D.C. proper because if you were in Silver Springs [Maryland] you would've been under the number for Maryland, that people weren't able to fudge so much.  It was close to Chicago [Illinois], a major city and I had done things with my group in applying for colleges.  Like we all applied to Northeastern [Northeastern University] in Boston [Massachusetts] for which all of us being probably about a half a dozen.  For which four of them went there.  I didn't, I didn't apply to Northeastern; I applied to the University of Bridgeport [Bridgeport, Connecticut], Elmhurst, and I'm trying to remember where else--might've been American [American University, Washington, D.C.].  And, I was looking for a small white liberal arts college was my line back then.  But, they showed on their books an Afro American studies program.
Speaker 1: At Elmhurst?
Speaker 2: At Elmhurst College.  So, that was part of the traction--attraction in coming.  And, back then I had couple of aunts who were here in Chicago.  My grandmother's sister-in-law who was a long time organist for Good Shepherd Church [Church of the Good Shepherd; Church of the Good Shepherd Congregational United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois].  My grandmother's husband's daughter, Elizabeth [ph.], who was teaching at Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  And, somebody else was here.  Another sister-in-law of my grandmother's, Aunt Stella [ph.], moved out here and remarried.  So, there were people he- there were family--there was family here.  So, so, that was another draw.
Story_ID: 483065
Speaker 1: What was your first impression of Elmhurst College [Elmhurst, Illinois]?  What was the first day like?
Speaker 2: My parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] drove me up and I--we got there a day early.  And I was walking on campus and I was walking out of the arch 'cause there was a park across the campus, and a car drove by and white boys yell, "Nigger, go home."
Speaker 1: That's an introduction.
Speaker 2: Which I had never heard to my face before.  So, I was so taken aback, I went back to the dorm and my RA [resident assistant] was a black woman from Virginia.  So, I told her what happened.  So, then I was schooled.  "You never go to town alone.  If you take the train in, you call us and we'll send one of the brothers here to come get you."  And, I would admit that black men on that campus really took care of us and watched us, because it was hostile.  So, almost couldn't drive out in those suburban communities without getting stopped by the police a couple of times.  You had to deal with the students on campus, white students on campus.  But, one of the things, the Afro American studies program had been funded like for three years.  And, my freshman year was like the end of it.  So, what are they, ever they had acquiesce to the college was sort of pulling back from this commitment there.  And, the student had gone through whatever ordeals from '68 [1968] that most student groups did.  So, there was like a black wing and I had black roommates, so they had the community there, and black social life was, was quite strong 'cause our music was different, and you know.  My exposure to white people pretty much had been on the media.  I hadn't been in school with white kids.  Early on when I was little, one year I went to Girl Scout camp and I noticed the very first day, and I was really little 'cause I think I was still at Barnard [Barnard Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  It was like third or fourth, third or fourth grade maybe younger, that Negro girls came on one bus, white girls came on another bus.  Those white girls had never seen us, nor had we seen them.  But, I don't recall that we were all into their hair, and all into their face, and all into their business like they assumed they could be with us.  Which I, I didn't like.  So, I never wanted to go back to camp and I never did do camp.  Didn't do an overnight camp or any of that.  And, my god-sisters and others adored that experience but unh-uh, not for me.  And, the outdoors, bugs, snakes, no, no, didn't need that either.  So, it was some of that same feeling at, at Elmhurst.  And, then we were in Chicago [Illinois] and I was East Coast, and Chocolate City [Washington, D.C.], and you know, it was like, "Where am I?"  But, it was a good community here.  And I fell in quickly with a number of upperclassmen 'cause we would even drive back east together for somebody--if somebody had a car and we can do a ride, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You can name 'em if you want (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can name my--yeah, Hileria Godfrey, really, and Debbie Edwards (unclear).
Speaker 1: Hileria Godfrey, I know her.
Speaker 2: You know Hileria?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: She a chairman of the parent counsel at New Concept Development Center [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Indeed she was.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Hileria T. Godfrey, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep.  Hileria was a senior.  I was a freshman, yeah.  I still keep up with Hileria.  Hileria still checks on me just like she did when I was a freshman coming in, so.  So that was something.
Story_ID: 483066
Speaker 1: We had a lot of fun there but we also recognized that the institution [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois] had used the number of students coming in and the funding to build a library.  So, it was funny, we used to party in it when it was under construction 'cause we considered it was ours 'cause we thought that they got the money off of having us there.  So, it's gonna be our library (laughter), which is how we, we approached it there.  But, a good introduction to a number to great thinkers there.  I was taking a class from like Mike Smith [Micheal Smith] and the text was, we had to read 'Boss' ['Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago,' Mike Royko], the book on Richard Daley.  And, we had to read the paper every day, and see how our experiences, our lives, are reflected in the media and the policies.  It was like community development or something like that.  So, I was taking these black studies classes and my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] were like, "What are you taking all these black studies classes?  What are you gonna do with this?  You need to take--."  So, I was like, "They meet the requirement," you know.  "If I need to take an English class, why can't I take Afro American drama?"  You know, that kind of thing.  And, I was arrogant about school with my parents because they forced me to pay.  I had a savings, and they're like, "You're going to college, you're gonna pay."  So, I'm like, "That's my money."  They're like, "Yeah, it's your education."  And, one of my grandmothers gave a gift, a cash gift, for me to go to school as well as the complete wakes--works of Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] in a beautiful red leather volume.  And, some money came from the school.  So, I always said that it cost my parents little, that I educated myself.  I paid.  I took the loans.  I did that.  So, I was like, "I'm in school.  I'll take what I wanna take," (laughter) and all of that.  And, thought in terms of being a political science major.  And, it was an interesting time to, to do that with Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and Watergate and what we're learning about, what they're teaching me about government is not how government works.  You are not teaching me how government works.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're saying the critique then that the black studies department offered of American society seem to match what was going on better than the other--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) instruction?
Speaker 1: Even though it's like, okay, you have to learn the structure and I know that this is what law is about that you have to learn this law and the legal precedence and that's what it is.  Whether it's right or wrong has almost nothing (laughter) to do with it, little or nothing to do with it.  Just looking at systems around the world and all of that.  So, a tremendous, I--for me it was a good education.  And, given me what I thought were critical thinking skills.  And, knowing that I could write and research and find out about something.  You know, I was doing a paper on Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] in Little Rock [Arkansas] and my, that's where my interests were, in doing black studies scholarship and all, and still trying to get in all the required courses.
Story_ID: 483067
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So there were a lot of lectures on campus.  I mean, we got, saw everybody from Muhammad Ali to [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  Performers, [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, Friends of Distinction [The Friends of Distinction].  Elmhurst [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois] was just beginning its big jazz festival which they still do every year.  We were close to Chicago [Illinois].  That first day with that awful occurrence during the day, that night Debbie Edwards [Deborah Edwards] had a car.  And, we drove into Gladys' [Gladys' Luncheonette, Chicago, Illinois] and had greens and smothered chicken, and (laughter) peach cobbler, like at three in the morning or something crazy, when Gladys' used to be opened late.  And, I don't how we hung around and drove around Chicago, but I'm from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], they got a lot of black people in D.C.  I had never seen anything like I saw when I came to Chicago.  The number, the magnitude of it, you know.  The D.C. of my youth was still a, a southern town.  And, I mean this was a big whopping city, and so, I was impressed with the numbers and things happening here even though I was concerned about the slow pace of things, even though it seem to work to my advantage because I knew the, the dances.  I knew the, some of the music and the theater, and the trends before they would get to Chicago, you know.  I was the first person that double pierced my earrings [sic. ears] and I started wearing bangles.  And, then I was hustling bangles 'cause everybody wanted them.  You know, "Bangles, you like slave shackles.  My ancestors had to wear slave shackles, I can wear some bangles."  And, the kind of all-night rhetoric sessions we would have.  (Laughter) It was wonderful I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did you come into Chicago a lot for culture activities when you were in college at Elmhurst?
Speaker 1: I did.  I tried to, but I didn't like it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I came from Washington, D.C. with--we had the national gallery.  We have the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  I'm coming to Chicago to pay to go to what I thought of as inferior museums and collections.  And, certainly nothing that's reflecting my live and my interest (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was thinking about maybe the Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] or the Afro-Arts Thea [Afro-Arts Theater, Chicago, Illinois]--I don't know if the Afro-Arts were still going on when you got here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: We did do some of that.  But, they also made the rounds of the college as well.  So, they were more than likely to have come out to Elmhurst or some other school in the area; George Williams [George Williams College of Aurora University, Aurora, Illinois].  We would travel to hear people.  If [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis was at Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], we would go there.  Parliament-Funkadelic was at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and drove out for that concert at Cahn Auditorium [Evanston, Illinois].  And, Operation PUSH was still at the Amphitheatre [International Amphitheatre, Chicago, Illinois] and, we'd do that and the music--
Speaker 2: So, it was at the Amphitheatre in those days?
Speaker 1: I'm pretty--was it the Amphi- that's by the stockyards, right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I think that's what we're talking about, yeah.  It was something called the Coliseum [sic.], I don't know if that was still going on.
Speaker 1: I don't rem- Amphitheatre--
Speaker 2: But, that Amphitheatre, Chicago Amphitheatre, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sticks out when we were old enough then to, to get into clubs.  We'd see Ashford and Simpson [HistoryMaker Valerie Simpson and Nick Ashford] at The Happy Medium [Chicago, Illinois], and you know, those kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Happy Medium, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you know, we'd try and hang out some Rush Street places.  I don't recall getting to the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois] as a, as a student.
Speaker 2: And DuSable [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] was still fledgling kind of, I mean, (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was fledgling, but we would've been there.  I would've--I don't even remember my first time going to DuSable there.  I know I never went to Dr. Burroughs house as a sight for anything.
Speaker 2: Dr.?
Speaker 1: Dr. Margaret Burroughs [HistoryMaker Margaret Burroughs].
Speaker 2: Burroughs, okay.
Speaker 1: Where the mu- DuSable had been before they moved.  But, yeah.
Story_ID: 483068
Speaker 1: So Elmhurst [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois], you said that when you were a senior at Elmhurst you started really thinking about becoming a librarian seriously.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I'd enjoyed myself in college, partied a bit, and then my last semester I needed an extra class so I could graduate on time, and my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] had also talked me into taking a statistics class.  Which I did, much to my chagrin.  Even though I got through it, I was happy.  But, I'm like, "What am I gonna do?  What am I gonna do?  I'm not ready to take the law school exam.  I'm not sure I wanna go to law school."  Such disillusionment after Watergate, such disillusionment after the government's assault on black youth.  I had seen my neighborhood and my high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] under this wave of drug assault on young men that I knew was--had to be delivered, had to be.  It was just no other way that this just happened that drugs had been in the community for so long and all of a sudden every young black male has access to drugs, and government conspiracies as--my mother was a conspiracy theorist from way back, and things.  So, it was really disillusioned, and thought, "I'm not ready."  Really, the basic was, I'm not ready.  I hadn't bared down hard enough.  I knew I wasn't ready for law school.  So, I'm like, "Well, what am I gonna do?"  I like, "Hm."  And, I don't know where the library degree idea came from but I initially thought of it as a helping degree, that if I wanna go to law school, it'll help.  That I wanna be a librarian; it could be.  And, at that time Robert Wedgeworth was the first black president of the American Library Association.  And, my grandmother knew somebody that knew somebody that knew him so she told me to go see him with the American Library Association being headquartered here in Chicago [Illinois].  And, when your grandmother tells you to do something, you do it.
Speaker 1: Now, what library was he associated with, Robert Wedgeworth?
Speaker 2: I'm sure where he came from before he went to the American Library Association, but I believe he ended his career at University of Illinois Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], directing that library.
Speaker 1: So, they've got a couple of--'cause we interviewed a library in, I think in Nashville [Tennessee] or Atlanta [Georgia] that was associated with University of Illinois library too.  I can't think of his name now but, I--you know.  Oh, no it was St. Louis [Missouri], that's right, Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] who's associated with the University of Illinois, that's where--he was there before.  So, they had a tradition of training black librarians.
Speaker 2: Well, they have a library school, University of Illinois, has a library school and they do have a tradition.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Robert Wedgeworth--
Speaker 2: Not as much as some of the historically--
Speaker 1: So, he was the first black president of the American Library Association?
Speaker 2: No.  He was the first black director.
Speaker 1: Black director.
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, director.
Speaker 2: First black director.
Speaker 1: Okay.  American Library Association--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which was headquartered over here on Michigan Avenue, Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  On Huron [Street].
Speaker 1: Huron, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, he brokered the acquisition of that property on Huron which turned out to be a financial windfall later on for the organization.  They'll talk about his legacy in many, many ways and I hope they won't forget the kind of real estate deal he made over there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you went to see him?  Your grandmother--?
Speaker 2: So, went to see him, because my grandmother told me to.  And, said, I was thinking about becoming a librarian.  And, I frequently have thanked him over the years, because he took time out of his busy day just to chat with me and say, "Yes, this career has tremendous possibilities.  Yes, you can, can do this."  So, I also talked to my, who I've come to know as my mentor at Elmhurst, Reverend James Mack, who was teaching African American history and religion at Elmhurst; a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] man.  And, he thought it a good idea.  So, I looked at library school and then my mother was like, "Well, you need to talk to Aunt Althea [ph.], talk to Aunt Carol [ph.], talk to Aunt--."  And, I'm like--
Speaker 1: All the ones you mentioned before.
Speaker 2: All the ones I mentioned that I had recognized that that's exactly what they do.
Story_ID: 483069
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to Reverend James Mack.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you consider him your mentor at Elmhurst [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In many respects, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was he the director of the program there or--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't.  No he wasn't.
Speaker 1: --or he just taught--?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, his position was in an academic department.  And, the history of a lot of black studies programs is that if the positions weren't anchored in the department, once the program was over, the program is over.  And, that's that.  But, he is professor emeritus from Elmhurst College [Elmhurst, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And, he taught, did he teach black religion or spirituality?
Speaker 2: He taught a black theology.
Speaker 1: Black theology.
Speaker 2: And, I'm trying to think, I remember him in a history class too, 'cause we did [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's 'From Slavery to Freedom', third edition ['From Slavery to Freedom: A History of Negro Americans,' John Hope Franklin], Professor Mack's favorite, Reverend Mack's favorite.  Yes.  And, we had a Haitian woman who was in the English department, Huguette Theodore, who was very dramatic and, and very French and who knew black literature very well as French literature and could teach all of that.  I had Elkin Satolea [ph.] for ethnomusicology.  We had folks that would take us to hear Bobby Wright [Bobby E. Wright], and take us to hear [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti and other folk.  Elmhurst also recruited a number of people from the Chicago [Illinois] area.  So, you know, they were some of my classmates who were familiar with Communiversity and the Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Chicago, Illinois], and who kept those connections and we would go to some of that programming and events and things like that.
Speaker 1: So, it was what they call the Communiversity going on then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was over--I never went to it.  Who was still going on back then I'd be--
Speaker 1: I think it was like--
Speaker 2: Shocked.
Speaker 1: Prior to when you--
Speaker 2: I think it was prior to that.  'Cause there were a couple of prior to for me is, I wasn't in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] with Sly and the Family Stone.
Speaker 1: See, I was--
Speaker 2: So, there's certain Chicago landmarks that people--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's the story when Sly didn't show up, right?
Speaker 2: When he didn't show up, right.
Speaker 1: In Grant.  And, he actually--
Speaker 2: And, the riot broke out in the City of Chicago.  So, I never knew Riverview [Riverview Park, Chicago, Illinois].  I wasn't in Grant Park for the Sly and the Family--and, there was something else.  It must've been the blizzard of '67 [1967]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].  Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  So, whenever you talk about the snow it's like, "Oh, you weren't here in '67 [1967].  You don't know snow."  I'm like, "What?"  "Oh, let go amusement park.  There's no more Riverview, we can't do that," so.
Speaker 1: So, you know the Chicago stories that are--
Speaker 2: I know the stories that pre-date me that I--
Speaker 1: Pre-date you.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I cannot be a Chicagoan 'cause I did not experience--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --those, those things.
Story_ID: 483070
Speaker 1: So after you met with, with Dr.--not Dr.--but, yeah, Robert Hedgeworth [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Robert Wedgeworth, yes.
Speaker 1: We- Wedgeworth, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then, what was your next move?  Did you, you graduated from Elmhurst [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois], but did you, I mean, decided to go right into library science somewhere?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did.  I sent the summer in Chicago [Illinois].  I didn't return to Washington [D.C.] but to the chagrin of my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] who lamented to the end of her days that I didn't move back to Washington.  She'd always want me to move back.  And, went to, began library school that fall, at night at Rosary College which is now Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now, Rosary was famous for producing librarians I do believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I know some people that attended Rosary and--
Speaker 2: That their graduate program was there.  And, I also lived on campus.  I had taken the post office exam and got called up at the post office to be at the bulk mail facility at Triton--not at Triton.  What is the name of it where Triton is?
Speaker 1: Where Triton College [River Grove, Illinois] is, out in--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Maywood [Illinois].
Speaker 1: No, no.  It's not Maywood.  River Grove, Illinois, it was a bulk mail facility--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That I was hired as, I think it's called a ninety-day temp or something.  And early morning like from 6:00 in the morning 'til 2:00, frequently getting called for overtime and worked at the post office during the day and went to class at night and lived in the dorm.  At first I lived on the floor with other library science students.  And, as I was wandering the hall one night I ran into an African American undergrad and I asked him, "Where are all the black people?"  So, she dragged me down into her room and there was a whole room of black and Spanish speaking folks.  And, they were like, "She an LS-er," a library science student.  And, they said, "Oh, there's a room down here that's empty.  It's a double, you can have it as a single."  So, I lived, for the year, in the dorm.  And, because I had paid room and board, the kitchen would make me lunch up and I would pick it up at night when I would have dinner.  And, so, after a few days, I went in the kitchen to pick up my lunch and the black people that worked in the kitchen, they said, "This lunch is for you?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  You should've seen my lunches after then, huge bags, they--I could share with many at the post office.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 483071
Speaker 1: So, I, I slung mail for about three months and then took a job at the Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois] as a receptionist in the president's office.  So the Newberry Library as an independent research library was the absolute best introduction I could've ever had to libraries.  It had everything in it that I, I liked about libraries and also what I didn't like about them.  But, just magnificent collection, magnificent buildings with information, you know, to really make an anglophile happy that you knew how to read English and to see things so it was just, just incredible.  And, they were supportive of my being in school so I could get flexible hours or reduced hours to go to summer school.
Speaker 2: Now, this is what, 1976 or so?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, 1976 exactly.
Speaker 2: So, this is like an internship or something?
Speaker 1: No.  It was a job.
Speaker 2: A job, just a regular job, okay.
Speaker 1: Just a regular job.
Speaker 2: So, you were the receptionist for the president, you said?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Lawrence Towner [Lawrence W. Towner], T-O-W-N-E-R, was the president of the Newberry Library then.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so, now you were there for--?
Speaker 1: I was there for a very short time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For a little over a year.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Might've been fourteen, sixteen months.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause you--
Speaker 1: And, then I took a job at the Maywood Public Library [Maywood, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: By then I had moved to a studio apartment at Oak Park [Illinois] which I really liked.  The--at that point Oak Park had was, it was called the Oak Park Housing Center [Oak Park, Illinois].  And, they really help facilitate the, the integration of their community.  Set up in part because I believe they feared the crossover from Austin Avenue in Chicago [Illinois], the African American community, would just flood over into Oak Park and be--'cause difficulties and they worked with landlords and all of that.  So, I knew where I was applying I wasn't gonna run into racial problems.  Not like when I tried to book an Oak Park hotel for my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] to attend my graduation [from Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois].  My mother called from the hotel.  She said, "Where did you book us?"  She said, "They don't want any Negros here, they have treated us horribly.  Come get us.  Find us someplace else to stay."  So, Oak Park was still having some challenges back then, but the notion of being in a neighborhood where Frank Lloyd Wright had designed homes, and Hemingway [Ernest Hemingway] had lived.  And, so close to the city and very safe, and Jackson Park Golf Course [Chicago, Illinois], the whole thing was really nice.  So, this being able to live in Oak Park and work downtown Chicago, and go to school in River Forest [Illinois] was quite convenient.  And, then taking the job at the Maywood Public Library as branch librarian. I had yet to finish my library degree, and Maywood, because one of my library school classes was something about library history.  Anyway, I was writing a history of Carnegie libraries and Maywood was a Carnegie library.  And, I had gone in to use their archives and write a history of the Maywood Public Library for a student paper and had, was then introduced to the staff and the director and when the vacancy came up in the branch library, that's where I went as branch librarian.
Story_ID: 483072
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting, I was gonna--one of the--my next question was to ask you like what is the course of the study for a librarian.  What's the core thing a librarian has to know that they, that they--?  And, your paper on a Carnegie library, the Carnegie library is so important to the black community, you know.  I just wanted you to comment somewhat on those, on that history (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and I wasn't thinking about Carnegies back in that way even though I think in choosing Maywood [Illinois], a predominately African American community and understanding or learning the history of the African American experience in that community and the Carnegie library and all of that.  But basic course of study, everybody takes basic reference and bibliography and cataloging and collection management.  Many of the other courses that I took I really wanted to go out.  So I was like taking classes that just fit the schedule.  I ended up like with a couple of audiovisual classes.  Well, I've never used them in my career, but at some point there were audiovisual librarians doing that kind of thing.  I look at preservation.  Back then, computers was a theory class.  We had no hands on experiences.  In 1976, '77 [1977], when I'm finishing library school [Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois] with a computer.  It was all, all text.  A couple of class I think I took some children's literature.  Probably academic libraries, looked at library administration, those kinds of classes.  I took a class on communication which I really enjoyed, and I seemed to be the only one of the few people in the class that got what the professor was talking about.  Even a couple of years ago I went to hear him speak someplace.  And, everybody else was like in a muddle.  And, I'd always been so turned into this guy that I found what he was saying was really, really fascinating.  So, that communications class with Professor Williams, Patrick Williams, yeah.  So doing that, that worked well for me.  I was able to do nine classes, no paper.  I'm--twelve, sorry twelve classes, no paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Otherwise, it's nine classes and a paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I just did the, the course work.  'Cause I was able to do an intercession class in January and the summer school and to, to do it quickly.  And, then, I was already working as a librarian in Maywood, and then saw an opening at Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois], and came down on Michigan Avenue to work for Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].
Story_ID: 483073
Speaker 1: Before we get into that, say something about these Carnegie Libraries, though, and--
Speaker 2: Well, Andrew Carnegie made his money, Pittsburgh steel [Carnegie Steel Company; United States Steel Corporation], a robber baron so to speak.  But, he sat about to distribute his fortune.  And, he supported educational institutions, Carnegie Mellon University [Carnegie Institute of Technology; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and a number of efforts like that.  But libraries, he gave seed money for the construction of libraries in many communities where he thought of a library as a public good.  If I recall, it had been his own experience educating himself at a library that gave him this desire to use his money in that way.  So communities could apply to Carnegie to support funding for libraries.  And, he was apt to fund places where there was a need, and there were a number of (air quotes) colored branches.  There were several nuances to librarianship and information science and its relationship to African descendent peoples that attracted me to the profession.  And one of them was this notion of institutional racism that saw the library as one of the last bastions of institutional racism because it controlled information, it controlled knowledge and how difficult it was for us to find out about, knowledge about ourselves.  And how when we do find the knowledge of ourselves, it's categorized as a way that talks about a pathology.  It's not highlighted for example in the Dewey Decimal Classification system.  Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] has his own number, you know.  That's how important he is to, to their canon, to their world of knowledge.  And you wanna find out information about the African American slave experience, it's a call number way down at the end of something else.  And just how information is arranged.  How intimidating the physical structures are of libraries often, classical libraries with the columns and the locked doors and huge tombs and the forbidden white, the white woman forbidding you from touching or talking and that kind of thing.  And also about public libraries being another service that our community was used to paying for, but did not have access to.  If in our community we paid local taxes, it paid for library service so we, we were used to paying for services we didn't get.  We didn't get the same kind of garbage pickup as other communities did.  We didn't get the same kind of education as other communities did.  You didn't get your money back.  And, definitely libraries were becoming so foreign in African American communities or had always been.  And, for folks in southern communities, they couldn't go to the library.  They absolutely could not.  And in other communities there were just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a profound scene in 'Sounder' [William H. Armstrong] where a--the little boy wants a book out of the library and the white woman has to go and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --check it out 'cause he can't, he can't go in library.
Speaker 2: Can't go in there.  Yeah.  For so many people have talked about that, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, Congressman Lewis has talked about the library, you know, and his response to it.  And I was just meeting with a group that we wanna try and work on documenting colored libraries, and that African American experience.  So, this was a skill I was seeing for the liberation of African people, and I was having a commitment to work in my community.  With a collection or with the community, at some point I saw the library skills enhancing what I wanted to do with, with black studies and with empowerment and that kind of thing.  So, to have gone to Maywood [Maywood Public Library, Maywood, Illinois] and done some, been at a branch library and then go to Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois], I was very excited about that.
Story_ID: 483074
Speaker 1: When did you find out there was a job at Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] for a librarian?  I mean, how did you find out?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember how I found out.  I'm fairly certain, I still would've been on some sort of list at Rosary [Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois] for job descriptions.  It, it might have come that way.  That's what I can think of.  I don't recall how I heard about it.  I had toured the building, and when people came to town if you could get in on a tour that was a very nice wonderful free thing to do for folks.  So I'd definitely been in the building before I'd gone to library school so I knew there was a library there and things.  So, saw the position and applied there.  And that was, it was just, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: A library on the seventh floor of 820 South Michigan [Avenue].  You get off the elevator and first thing there is a Hale Woodruff painting.  The hallway to the library is lined with six or seven Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] illustrations.  This private library, he had on his shelf books by Phillis Wheatley.  I'd never seen this kind of stuff that was happening and it was, it was just wonderful, wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Now, is that, in that era, the Johnson Publishing was republishing some of the black classic--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --books.  As you said, the works of Phillis Wheatley and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Frederick Douglass and--
Speaker 2: They did 'The Underground Railroad' [William Still], and Douglass, Sojourner Truth--
Speaker 1: And, William Still's 'Underground Railroad.'  I have a copy at home from Johnson, you know.
Speaker 2: And that fine brown leather binding that they did.  Yes, it was, it was good.  Their book division was selective and Basil Phillips was a photo librarian, to, had known my family since, since he was a boy.  The seventh floor was also the office of Jet magazine.  And, Mrs. Johnson, Eunice Johnson, her office was there.  And she was doing Fashion Fair, the show, the models were there, the clothes were there, and the moderator that year happened to be a young woman from my high school, Shayla Simpson.  So, she was like my home girl.  And, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] was a classmate of Reverend Mack's [James Mack].  And, it was just, just tremendous, just tremendous.  There was a video room on the seventh floor as well 'cause Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] was on the board of 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation], I think, back then.  So we got to preview the movies before they hit the theaters.  I managed to be on a, not quite the A list, but a B list of staff members when there was a need for, I don't know, he was having an event for advertisers and needed some cadre of young women for all the men coming in, would get invited to things.  And, he was buying tables at all sorts of events that--and the giveaways, it's like well, "Who wants to go to the Saturday morning brunch for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History?" (Raises hand).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, those kinds of things.  So, had a, had a lot of fun and learned quite a bit about cataloging African American stuff.  I sort of did a reclassification and re-cataloging of some of the collection, identified some items for some preservation work and things.  Was really able to appreciate the morgue that's there and so much.  But it was a good time.  It was a good time.
Speaker 1: That was excit- very exciting I'm sure.  And, the Tom Joyner Show ['Tom Joyner Morning Show'] was coming out of there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: WJPC [WJPC Radio; WNTD Radio, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: WJPC.  And, for a couple of years, my--I wrote the Black History Month quiz contest.  I did that.  And, we'd get free records from Tom.
Story_ID: 483075
Speaker 1: You never knew who would come by.  Bob Marley and the Wailers came once, and I probably should've lost my job 'cause I just went down to the radio station and I didn't leave 'til he did.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, at that point, my cousin Karen Baxter who had worked with Nina Simone and Bob--I said Stevie Wonder, she worked for a management firm that managed Bob Marley.  So, when he would come to town, I would have tickets and big Marley fan.  And, you just never know who you would see.  The elevator door would open and there would be Michael Jackson.  So, I have a Michael Jackson autograph.  You get on the elevator, there's Lionel Richie, you know, Sammy Davis, Jr., Gary Coleman.  You name them, Alex Haley, on and on, the people that came by to the building that we were exposed to.  Back then they were still giving tours of the building.  So, you know, we always looked good for people coming through and doing the work and to just be at Jet on the cutting edge of stories.  So, you had to tear off the teletype and highlight the stories and clip the newspapers for information and stories.  It was, it was quite nice.  And, then came the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] recession.  My understanding is that it became lore in Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] the day they let, I don't know, thirty or forty of us go.  So, it was like, "Oh, gee, gee whiz."
Speaker 2: This is 1980?
Speaker 1: This would've been '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-one [1981], I'm pretty sure.  Yes.
Speaker 2: So, you worked from--to, at Johnson from 1978, I guess?
Speaker 1: I think '78 [1978] to '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the Reagan recession.
Speaker 1: And, actually, I can remember when Reagan was running for office, he came to Johnson Publishing Company.  They emptied the building and let us go home early.  So, we always thought Reagan had a fear of a black planet--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --from some event that happened in California.  But, it did not happen with anyone else who had come through.  And, he was just running for office then.  But, he wanted the building cleared (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 483076
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you left Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I went on unemployment for a year, and what turned out to just be ideal is, and I didn't know it at the time, but I soon learned that with my library degree [from Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois] I could substitute in the Oak Park [Illinois] public schools.  So, I did some substitute work in school media centers where my A.B. background, and children's literature background, and branch librarian and doing children services paid off as well as, a couple of classrooms.  I wish I had taken up an offer to go to Nigeria for a year with my mother's cousin.  My cousin, Karen [Karen Baxter], her father Roy Allen was like the first black director for CBS Television.  So, later in--after he retired he had this opportunity to go Nigeria, work with Nigerian television for a year, which he and his wife [Margaret Allen] did.  And, my cousin kept telling me, "You should go.  My parents won't let you starve.  You'll have a place to stay and to eat."  I'm like, "I don't have a job.  How can I go?"  And, my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] was saying, "You don't have a job.  How can you go?"  So, I didn't go and I regret not taking that opportunity to have done that.  But I would do the unemployment bit and you go into the office and they look at you and, you have a master's degree, they can't help you.  And, it was at a point in the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] recession when one out of five black people were unemployed.  And, that was the government's figure.  So, we, we knew it was worse than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the real figure was--had to be worse.
Speaker 2: The real figure was, was worse than that.  So, I still was living rather inexpensively in Oak Park, and had an old Volkswagen Beetle.  And, enjoyed my year of unemployment 'cause I still was able to, to do some work and things.
Story_ID: 483077
Speaker 1: And, I'm pretty sure it was from Rosary [Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois] that I saw the position open at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is 1982?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Northwestern University.  So, you've been there ever since, right, at Northwestern?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: So, okay.  Well, tell us what happened.  You went out there and--?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I went out to get a job description, a fuller job description than what was up there and did my application and went for the interview, and thought the interview went well.  And, it took them a long time to get back to me.  And, then they got back to me and they were like nitpicking about things, a grade in a class in undergraduate, you know.  I don't have to explain to you why I got a C back in whatever, whatever.  So, I, I wasn't aware of the landscape of what I've come to recognize the difficulty in sometimes moving in library world, that it's difficult to move from being a public librarian to an academic librarian.  It's easier to be an academic librarian and move to a public library.  That there is a bit of a hierarchy in library careers and positions.  So, I didn't have academic library experience and that's mostly what they would've wanted, but I had a special library's experience.  I had a broad experience and I think exposure at the Newberry [Newberry Library, Chicago, Illinois] would've helped.  So, I'm not sure who my competition was for the position, but I got it and I was only gonna stay a couple of years.  But, it just kept--I, I enjoyed the work immensely.  And have frequently said that librarianship enabled me to do black studies.  And, I wanted to do black studies but I didn't want to teach.  And as academic librarian you don't have to teach all, you don't have to teach a class in that kind of setting all the time, you know.  You can if you want to in some places but that wasn't what I was interested in.
Speaker 2: Why didn't you wanna teach?  Or--?
Speaker 1: I just didn't think I would be a good teacher.  It was like, I didn't like to be taught (laughter), or something.  You know, why would I be a teacher? Ugh. And, it was, you know, the beginning of, of women's liberation and what women could do, and when you think back of what African American women were able to do, there weren't many careers, you know.  Teaching was very respectable and all of that, but I didn't wanna teach.  And, I don't know if I didn't wanna teach 'cause my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] wanted me to be a teacher, or what it was exactly, but wasn't motivated for that; to teach.  I didn't think I would be a good teacher.  I couldn't understand that I could be but it wasn't anything I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 483078
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking about--and I don't know why this popped in my--I was thinking about Vivian Harsh [Vivian Gordon Harsh] for some reason and the, yeah, I guess I was trying to think of like the, the career history of black women in libraries.  Vivian Harsh, Dorothy Hudson [sic.] at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], I'm thinking, I don't know, if there are any--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: There others I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely.  Dorothy Porter [Dorothy Porter Wesley] at the--
Speaker 1: Dorothy Porter, right.  That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Moorland-Spor- Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jessie Carney Smith who is still at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Yes, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was admirable.  And, then at some point I recognized early on once I decided library school [Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois], how much I like libraries.  And, I had already admitted to myself that I like school and I like learning.  And, I was, I say, "You learn something new every day."  If I help you find an answer to your questions, I've learned something.  So, it wasn't routine of my--
Speaker 1: It's a two way.
Speaker 2: It's a two way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't like throwing mail where you could make a lot of money, but you're just throwing mail and your only excitement is if you get to work with postcards and if you wanted to read what other people said, and maybe not.  I just really wanna see the picture, a new place, or something like that, but I didn't, didn't want to do, do that.  So, this seemed to suit me and I was thinking about graduate school and from the time I had been at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] they had promised a graduate program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you took advantage of that as well, right?
Speaker 2: Well, they never got a graduate program in African American studies until recently, 'til the Ph.D.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --program over three years ago.  But, they had been talking about offering a graduate program in African American studies for a long time.  So, at some point in the '80s [1980s] maybe '85 [1985], I said, "Oh, well, let me apply here in the history department and do African history."  And, that's what I--my second master's [degree] is from Northwestern, history department in African history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I was able to work in English on a topic, so that was very helpful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now, I don't know if many people watching this know it, but in case they don't, we'll tell 'em that Northwestern has had an African studies department for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits came east from Columbia University [New York, New York] to start the anthropology department at Northwestern, and his area was looking at Africa and African descended people that, Africa does have a history.  And just built a fascinating collection and program there.  Northwestern University has the oldest, the oldest institute, the Program of African Studies is the oldest one in the country.  And--
Speaker 1: And, this is a program started by white people basically, or white Americans.
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: And, Melville J. Herskovits and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, but over the years, they've just had tremendous number of black scholars there.  From C.L.R. James, to the poet Dennis Brutus to Jan Carew.  It's been international.  When I first started there Mabel Smythe [Mabel Smythe-Haith], we were talking about people involved foreign service.  She and her husband [Hugh Heyne Smythe] had definitely been internationals, and just a whole cadre of folk have been through there.  So, yes.
Story_ID: 483079
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about the re- the--some of the resources that are hidden in plain sight at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] that most people don't understand, in African and African American studies.  One, one resource I find particularly interesting is the library of the University of Sankore at Timbuktu [Mali] that is being deciphered piece--book by, book by Dr. John Hunwick.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A British scholar--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Northwestern as we speak.
Speaker 2: John Hunwick, Professor Hunwick was my advisor for my master's thesis.  I look at black slave life and Tripoli [Libya] in the 19th century.  Primarily because I was able to work in English and work with John Hunwick.  And I actually think that it's ideal that Hunwick is the one that's worked with the material, because I believe that he was able to lend such credence to the project that the digitization and preservation of those materials is such a high priority and would not have happened, I don't think, in such a beneficial way for both institutions had someone else just come and taken them and sold them someplace else.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--he's working on a body of work that many had claimed at one time was mythological.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That it did not exist.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, indeed.  Indeed, his work with Arabic manuscripts and uncovering libraries and int- one of the interesting things my cousin, Karen Baxter, is now married to a guy from Mali so Timbuktu is really on my mind.  And you know, people think of Timbuktu as being easy to get to; it's not.  So somebody actually going there and being able to maneuver with the language enough around to ask the questions to locate manuscripts that were just in somebody's home.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right, I think the--
Speaker 2: It's just outstanding.
Speaker 1: Can you recount the story of how they were discovered?  I mean, I think I read it.  I've got a version of it, but, go--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  If I remember correctly that Professor Hunwick just stumbled across them really.  A young person [Abdel Kader Haidara] talked about knowing where the cache of manuscript materials are.  And, when Hunwick looked at them, he knew exactly what they were and exactly that they had been needed.  And had been talked about and rumored and here they were in actuality and in great shape.  So, just--
Speaker 1: I think they were discussing--
Speaker 2: --outstanding.
Speaker 1: And, the young man said, "Well, they're at my house," (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: "I know where they are.  They're not lost" (laughter).
Speaker 2: So incredible, and was able to get big money behind it for a foundation grant and now the catalog of that material has been made available online that anyone can get to now.  And now that more and more computers are using non-roaming characters that we're able to see what's what and see it in English and in Arabic.  Which is quite often what scholars like to do.  But, yes, that Herskovits collection, the Melville J. Herskovits collection [Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, Evanston, Illinois] is outstanding.  I was browsing in the stacks one day, and I don't recall what I was looking for, perhaps something with Zora Neale Hurston that I pulled a book of hers off the shelf that she had autographed to the university.  That--and, I was like, "Whoa."  And, I come to know that Zora Neale Hurston worked for Melville Herskovits measuring Negro heads in Harlem [New York, New York] for his book, 'The Anthropometry of the Negro' [sic. 'The Anthropometry of the American Negro'].  And, our library archives had correspondence, letters, between Herskovits and Hurston--
Speaker 1: I have to--
Speaker 2: That are so rich that it's just stunning.  She had considered coming to Northwestern as a student but opted to study with the noted anthropologist Franz Boas in New York [New York].  But, she and Herskovits had correspondence for years.  Herskovits corresponded with many, with Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and Hughes [Langston Hughes], and other authors, with Snowden you were mentioning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frank Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.], right.
Speaker 2: Frank Snowden, and Leo Hansberry [William Leo Hansberry] because he was editing volumes and it was--he was also contributing to Negro history journals and education and that kind of thing.  So, a tremendous effort.  People frequently think I work out of the Herskovits collection and don't understand that material dealing with the African American experience is interspersed throughout the library's collection and not separate like the Herskovits collection.  For which I have seen librarians from the continent come to tears because it's more in the collection in Evanston [Illinois] that they've seen in the home countries.  It's just an outstanding collection.  Wherever I've traveled on the continent, please know Northwestern and the Herskovits Library.  But, if I came downtown Chicago [Illinois] and asked a thousand people, if two of them knew, I would be surprised that I think it's a real hidden gem in Chicago.  So much so, that a recent Tribune [Chicago Tribune] article about ten library collections you should know, talked about--the Herskovits was on that list.  It's just outstanding, they have everything there.  Now their recent effort is trying to collect material reflecting Africa's response to Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign for president.  Much like the Mandela [Nelson Mandela] collection which has everything from dolls, and cloths, and buttons, and posters, and T-shirts, and flags, and silverware, you name it.
Speaker 1: Probably--and the ballots from the election.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the ballots from the election, which I contributed to some of that materials.  That I just sent a call out to friends at the Herskovits Libraries looking for that kind of material.

Speaker 1: Have you been to Nigeria?  I believe now, and correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that the library [sic.] at the University of Nigeria [University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nsukka, Nigeria] is named for William Leo Hansberry.
Speaker 2: I haven't been to West Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's been a goal, and I'm sure I'll get there.  At some point I had such a reputation for black studies, African American studies and all of that that nobody ever believed that I haven't been to Africa yet.  They're like, "What.  You haven't been?"  They just had assumed that I had gone.  And I was having this feeling in my life that if I didn't get to Africa I wasn't gonna be right 'cause there isn't but such much studying that you wanna do about something before you experience it.  And having studied and been enamored with African and all, many things African since childhood, I just kept having this feel if I didn't get to Africa I wouldn't be right.  And, I had an opportunity with Dr. Debbie Mack, Deborah Mack who did a Ph.D. in anthropology at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and worked with the Program of African Studies, and she had worked on the Sudan.  And she showed me that Sudan Studies Association is meeting in Khartoum [Sudan] in January, maybe it was January '89 [1989] or something like that.  And she said, "If you answer the call for papers and do presentation they'll have a place for you to stay and all you'll have to cover is airfare."  And, I was like, "I can do that."  So, I answered the call for an abstract to do a presentation about doing a research about women in the Sudan and was accepted to be on the panel.  And talked my good girlfriend, Harriet Byrd, she wasn't married then, Harriet Byrd, said, "Don't you wanna go?  You know, we'll go through Amsterdam [the Netherlands], and go through Egypt, and then go down to Khartoum."  So, my first visit to Africa was to Khartoum for which so many African Americans their first visit is West Africa, Goree Island [Dakar, Senegal], Nigeria, Ghana, that kind of thing.  But, I'm going to the Sudan, in the midst of civil war.  The day we get there it's a petrol strike so the government's called a holiday, and we were more or less stranded at an airport.  Oh and things we take for granted, being able to telephone someone and all of that.  And my friend Debbie Mack was there but unfortunately she was sick.  But, she did send somebody for us.  And it was an outstanding experience.  Harriet and I had a few days in Egypt and did the quick Egypt tour up the Nile [Nile River] to Luxor [Egypt].  As--we didn't go to Aswan [Egypt] we were at Cairo [Egypt], Luxor, and someplace else in between where it stops.  And so, it was just an incredible experience.
Speaker 1: Edfu [Egypt], maybe?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember.
Speaker 1: Or des- ? Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it was, it was wonderful.  And, my friend Harriet's family is from Alabama.  So, I'm just having this love affair of being in dusty Khartoum and Africa, and she says, "This is just like being down south.  You ain't been down south.  You, you happy because you're seeing chickens in the road.  You can see that down in Mississippi.  You don't have to come to Africa for this."  And, we ran into a guy in an elevator who, we were talking in English, so, he--of course they turn and immediately know you're American sisters and he was like, "I bet you're glad your ancestors got taken away from here."  And, I was like, I thought, "Oh, that's just kind of horrible."  If we don't understand what the slave trade did to the continent and the absences there, and I understood, because of my work with John Hunwick, what was happening with the trans-Saharan slave trade.  So much of what we study in the United States deals with the transatlantic slave trade.  I was looking in other directions.
Story_ID: 483081
Speaker 1: It was just, just an incredible experience from everything of being, you know, stopped by the military police late in the night and being happy you had a U.S. passport.  It was one of my first real experiences of feeling more American in many instances than I had African American, which was a new revelation for myself; to being invited to a wedding just simply 'cause we were passing by.  And, how opened Africa was in so many ways.  Seeing, in African, difficulties with dealing with skin color and/or religion and/or gender or that kind of thing.  And it was, it was something.  It was an awesome introduction, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How--how did you, speaking of gender, and what was your, how did the Sudanese women react to you?  Or, were they in a position to react to you?
Speaker 1: I did speak before a group of Sudanese women.  And Debbie Mack's [Deborah Mack] Arabic is flawless from what I understand.  She has a reputation for it.  And, I don't think though initially the women knew that she spoke Arabic because she was just with me on this trip.  She wasn't introducing me; that fell as someone else.  So, she was able to hear comments that the women were making about me, which she shared later.  And I have sense enough to know that you speak before a group of black women that you need to dress.  And so they liked my shoes and like how I looked, liked my attempted humor and the kind of information that I had pulled together.  That I generated a bibliography about women in the Sudan and they appreciated that.  So I was--I was pleased with that, that I was able to present myself well as an African American woman.  Which of course, is only the training that would come out of my family.  You don't not present yourself well.  So, it, it--I think that was one of also, one of my first recognition that I was able to do public speaking, because prior to that I don't recall having done much.  You know, we didn't have big pageants and orations in the church [St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.] growing up and outside of Girls State [American Legion Girls State] and I don't really remember of speaking.  I wasn't part of a debate team or anything like that.  But, that I was able to--nervous and all--do, do well there.  So, so, that was, that was good.  That was an excellent experience.
Story_ID: 483082
Speaker 1: And because of that work with Debbie Mack [Deborah Mack], Debbie Mack worked with a project you're familiar with, Teaching about Africa [ph.].  They work with area school teachers to help improve the curriculum about Africa.  And, they had applied for a Fulbright-Hays group study travel grant [Fulbright-Hays Group Projects Abroad].  And, where they were to take a group of teachers to Africa for six weeks.  Three weeks in Egypt and three weeks in Kenya.  At the last minute one of the teachers couldn't go for some reason or another.  I don't remember what it was, and Debbie Mack knew that I had had all my shots and paperwork and my passport was up and I'd already done the Egypt part of it.  And she asked if I wanted to join this group.  And so, yes.  So I spent a summer in Africa with this group which was really incredible.  So, while their bent was curriculum (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, this is in 19--was it '80 [1980]?
Speaker 1: This was in, I think it was '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989], okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989].  So, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. (Pause).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was great.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That does sound like a really wonderful experience.  Had you ever been to, you'd never been to Kenya though, right?
Speaker 1: No.  I hadn't.  So this was important because of in my life, my Aunt Sara Lee [Sara Lee Owens], Aunt Sarah Lee, had been stationed in Kenya and, and things.  So it was, it was quite meaningful.  It was meaningful.  And, I was fortunate enough when the Egypt part of when we were in Cairo that a Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] graduate student that I knew was finishing her graduate work there.  So she knew the city well, so we would go out all day with all whatever the history tour was, whatever the agenda was for this group.  And at night this graduate student, I'm trying to think of her name, it'll come to me 'cause I can see her clearly.  She would take me out and we would do the night life in Cairo, and party 'til like 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.  And, then try and get up and go to the pyramids at 8:00 was, was a bit of a challenge.  But, people were like, "Well, what's up with you?"  And, it was like, "Oh, I'm fine."  But, that was fun.  So, the, the party life and the reputation that African American women have internationally, partying it would be like, "Hm."  But that was good because in American culture, you know, a big light skinned black woman with a gap in her mouth is not gonna be on the cover of Vogue.  But, at night clubs in Kenya and Egypt, was very much what gentlemen were looking for.  So, I'm like, "I haven't had this much play since I can (laughter), since I can remember."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's why the popularity in Kenya and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't know that going (laughter).  But, afterward I was like, "Oh, okay.  Yeah."
Speaker 2: You more than likely have an audience here too, you just haven't--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you do.  I'm sure you do.
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm teasing.  I have--
Speaker 2: I know you, I know you--
Speaker 1: But, you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 483083
Speaker 1: So you've been at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] since 1985, and we're just trying--
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982], actually.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], okay, '82 [1982], right.  That's right.  That's right.  And, what's been the, I guess the highlight of your tenure at Northwestern?  (Cough).
Speaker 2: I think the highlight of my tenure at Northwestern has been to be a witness, as well as, perhaps a participant in the maturation of black studies.  Something that we saw programmatically develop in the '60s [1960s] to then grow into a finally fully recognized and appreciated academic discipline has really been something.  So to see that development has really been a high point for me.  It has afforded me many opportunities for travel and research.  The opportunity to get a second master's degree at a tremendous discount because of an educational assistance program was quite the treat.  I've been a head of fellowship to the Kaplan Center for the Humanities [Alice Berline Kaplan Center for the Humanities; Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities, Evanston, Illinois] on campus where I was able to take a year and research black museums.  Something I'm still working with now.  I'm actually gonna present as a paper and get published this year as the Association of African American Museums is meeting in Chicago [Illinois].  So, to combine my personal interest with things Northwestern with its reputation with theatre and my interest in theatre, particularly black theatre and arts and things.  It's just been a tremendous way to, to have a career meet your own personal interests and your sort of childhood desires for things.  So, I've had great opportunities there and I like to think the contributions have been strong as well that I've been able to contribute to both the profession of black studies and the profession of librarianship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that I've liked a lot.
Story_ID: 483084
Speaker 1: I see here you've published several summer reading lists going way back.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: To 2000, I guess, on various topics--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Even further back as long--
Speaker 1: --from reparations to black travel writings to the Gullah culture, hip hop, fiction, you know.  Do you enjoy pulling these?  I suppose you--
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: I know you do.  But--
Speaker 2: I do.  And, it began because people would ask me.  They would want recommendations, you know, "What are you reading?"  Or, they would want me to join a book club or that kind of thing.  And, so, I just thought, "Oh, let me just do a summer reading list."  And, part of it early on was this notion that we don't read and we don't write.  We aren't being published, and what's out there.  So, the first fiction list we just show the production of what was out there.  And, then the, the reading list part of it was just to show, show what's out there in a thematic way.  So, I've enjoyed those, doing those over the years.  And, I've gotten good response from them and people have enjoyed them as well, and used them in their own way.  So, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 483085
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for people who, you know, maybe considering to becoming a librarian at this juncture?  I mean, it seems to me that there's--did you expect to have as an exciting a life as a librarian as you had or, when you started?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I did think that if I decide to work in libraries, I could do this and be happy and do it for a long time.  It's not like social work for which a lot of my friends went into early on where I knew that you can't deal with social problems forever.  That I thought of all the problems and needs in our community that my dealing with librarianship I could have a long career.  And, my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] has frequently said that, unusual like my father [Frederick Bethel] in that, we like our jobs and that most people don't.  And, that never occurred to me that people would work at a job they didn't like.  I don't understand that.  I still don't understand that.  But, have begun to recognize that as my mother said, "There are only a small group of people who are actually working at what they want to, and what they like to do."  And, so, I've always enjoyed that and thought it was good.  What I try and tell young people is that, I can't think of anything that you might want to do in life where you can't do it in a library.  Whatever your interests are for all of that.  I heard someone the other day say, talking about the program was the endangered, black male librarian and felt, 'cause there's such a small number in the profession.  And, I've always felt that black men do very well when they come into libraries.  They come out heading up branches and departments and that kind of thing.  But, talked about encouraging young men who only wanna look at the National Football League [NFL].  They don't know the National Football League has a library, that libraries are everywhere.  There's school library.  There's public libraries.  There's special libraries.  There's corporate libraries.  I worked in the perhaps the finest black corporate library on the planet.  People don't even think that Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois], that a publishing company has a library.  Hospitals have libraries.  Museums have libraries.  Banks have libraries.  Law firms, you cannot think of where there isn't a need for information, isn't a support for it.  So, libraries are everywhere.  And if libraries are everywhere within them is an opportunity to do anything.  If you like technology and computers, librarian, librarians are now creating libraries in virtual worlds and second life.  The digitization project, the kind of work that you're involved in, is happening in libraries of doing oral histories.  At Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], they've done a tremendous oral history collection, at Radcliffe [Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Cambridge, Massachusetts], looking at women.  Just can't think of anything that you'd like to do whatever your personality is.  Of course, the flip side of that is that you're doing it for little money and for our profession to require a master's degree that pays little money, you know, this is something my uncle never understood.  How you could get a graduate degree to make no money.  And my coming of age, money was not a motivation for me.  And, it may be an old adage from my mother in my youth that I was never gonna have long hair and I was never gonna be rich.  And I haven't worried about it since, that I knew I would be rich in other things, friendships, and perhaps life experiences and all of that.  So, I wasn't under the pressure that I needed to get out here and make a lot of money.  'Cause librarianship isn't gonna facilitate that.  You know, unless I come up with a business plan to (laughter) sell a hula hoop or something, I don't know, that kind of thing.  But, I just think it's so wide open a profession that it's not as, as narrow as, as others.  So, that's what I try and encourage folks to look at with a library profession and doing things.
Story_ID: 483086
Speaker 1: Do you have any ambitions to be the director of a library or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I don't.  For me, it's much like, you take the best teacher out of the classroom and then you make 'em a principal or assistant principal and you think that's good for an education system when, where the person shines is in the classroom one on one with people.  So, I haven't had designs on that.  You know, I don't wanna be an administrator at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] which is the premier collection for African American history and culture 'cause that would take me away from the work.  And, I've enjoyed working with scholars, be they students, faculty, or the public.  I hear from a lot of people and the public.  Genealogists, or fifth graders, or whoever, who somehow run across my name and get in contact with me for some assistance.  And it's just been so rewarding in so many ways that I can't even think of, of wanting to do strictly administration, and write personnel reviews, and budgets, and annual reports, and all of that, it's--that doesn't entice me.  I used to say that I didn't, I wanted to be an administrator.  I couldn't do it.  But I know now that I can do whatever.  As my mother [Helen Roy Bethel] says, "You can do whatever you put your mind to, you work hard enough."  But now I know that it's not anything that I think I would enjoy.  And, this is just, my position is just involved--evolved in so many ways that have benefited me.  And I think, like to think, the library at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and the campus as well, so.  It's just been really rewarding for me.
Story_ID: 483087
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I have always found information empowering, and my concern that there seems to be a demonstrated lack of interest in learning.  I, I just--that troubles me.  That troubles me.  It's one thing if you're having difficulties in school but this deliberate looking at knowledge or being smart as a negative when for my generation that's what you wanted to do.  And, maybe I'm being naive and not remembering some of the responses to smart students when I was little so I'm sure it's the same kind of thing.  And don't want those horrible memories back.  But, yeah, there were occasions when people picked on you, 'cause you, "You think you smart.  You think you better," that kind of thing.  And, luckily my neighbor across the street was one of the roughest people in town and if she thought somebody was picking on me, they were gonna be in trouble, you know.  And, I always felt that I worked in whatever worlds, but.  So my concerned about people is this lack of education.  Education was so important for us.  It was going to transform our experience, our lives here in this land, coming out of enslavement.  And, coming out of whatever adversarial position we've been in.  The rural urban migration, the wars, the economic assault and all of that.  Education was always the answer.  And, it troubles me that it's not seen as a pathway, as an answer, that you can't educate yourself to have a better life.
Story_ID: 483097
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: I should have listened to my parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] and gone to a historically black college.  I think the social networking which is come to be--mean so much in this day and age, it can't be discounted for the importance in your lives.  And, I don't have a connection to my institutions that my parents always had to theirs that I have now.  I have more of a connection to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] than I do to these, to my undergraduate experience [at Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois].  I am serving on the alumni council for my graduate school [Rosary College; Dominican University, River Forest, Illinois] and feel much more connected to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] because I'm still there and know so many of the professors in a different way.  But, that HBCU experience might have led to a different life actually.  More of a life with family and opportunity for dating perhaps professional men or that kind of thing might have been, might have been different from my personal life and experiences.  And, I'm not sure what it would've meant professionally.  Even though I think one of the reasons my cousin is a doctor is because she went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The way I've seen them weed out folks in other places is something else.  But, yeah, that's the one thing I would've like to been a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] grad or a Spelmanite or something.
Story_ID: 483098
Speaker 1: Now, once again when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider is your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  When people call me, the African American studies librarian, that's just quite a compliment.  So, I think I do have a very good reputation for that.  And, I still so enjoy the work, and the production of what's being out there, and trying to anticipate research directions and needs of--for my constituents at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  I sensed early on and perhaps because I'm such a fan of popular culture that this generation behind me is gonna wanna research hip hop and rap music.  And, I need to build a collection that would enable them to do that.  And, not stay focused on just the civil rights era and the post-civil rights and that kind of thing, but to anticipate what's gonna happen.  And, if Northwestern is gonna build a Ph.D. program, you know, what kind of collection, what area am I gonna focus in?  So, I'm very glad that I always paid attention to black women's study.  Because when the premiere black women historian comes to campus to chair African American studies as Darlene Clark Hine has done in recent years, I knew this, hey the collection here is gonna be outstanding.  And, perhaps my own personal interest to be sure that our catalogs and materials were there.  You know, as well as the history and the other items in the social sciences.  But, yeah.  That I've been able to, to build a good collection supporting the curriculum.
Story_ID: 483099
Speaker 1: Are your parents [Helen Roy Bethel and Frederick Bethel] still living, are they--?
Speaker 2: My mother passed three years ago this month.  And, so, that's been difficult adjustment for the family.  She was such a central part of things and long distance elder care is a, can be a bit of a challenge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You still have brothers and sisters, and--?
Speaker 2: I have one brother.  My brother Geary Errington Bethel [Geary Bethel] is a year older than I am, and he lives in Washington, D.C., right down the street from Howard University of course.  And, he has--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: --three children [Ashley Bethel, Demetrius Gross, and Errington Bethel].  So, I'm very proud of my niece and nephews and the people they've grown to be.  Always enjoyed their summer excursions to come visit Aunt Kathy [HistoryMaker Kathleen E. Bethel].  So, good relations there.
Story_ID: 483100
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I was trying to think.  I did wanna talk a bit about my Southern African experience.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.  Yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: As an electoral observer--
Speaker 1: Fulbright--
Speaker 2: And, a Fulbright.
Speaker 1: Scholar.  Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  This is 1996?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-four [1994]--
Speaker 1: Four [1994].
Speaker 2: --was--I went as a non-governmental observer for the elections in South Africa.  A graduate student had asked me if I knew anyone going to work the elections, and I talked to some friends I knew who had been involved in anti-apartheid activities of which I been a supporter, a contributor, a participant over the years since I can remember.  I found an early college paper where I was comparing the ANC [African National Congress] and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] about something.  So, it had been part of my consciousness and awareness for a long time.  And, when I looked at it, they were looking for someone with political experience which I had.  I had worked at Harold Washington campaign, was political science major in college [Elmhurst College, Elmhurst, Illinois].  I could afford to send myself, which I did, and had worked in campaigns.  I'd been an election judge in Chicago [Illinois] and all of that.  So, I went to go, and it was just an incredible experience.  I'd just, I'd just can't almost describe what the air was like.  It was just electric of what was happening there.  That this was going to be a moment of such a radical change for the continent.  Not just for South Africa but definitely for the continent.  And, so, it was a quite an incredible experience.  We were stationed in the Eastern Cape at a place called George [South Africa], and had to get up in the dark and drive in the dark to be at a polling place at 6:00 in the morning and be there all day.  And, to see them, the voters, be they black, white, any of the major groups or minor groups of South African, they appreciated us being there.  I can remember a woman came out of the beauty shop 'cause she heard an American accent and she hadn't heard one in a long time.  So, she still got the collar on and stuff in her hair, and she was very happy.  So, that was a rewarding experience.  I wasn't able to be in the lecture hall, not the lecture hall, the ballroom when Mandela [Nelson Mandela] accepted the election results.  But was in there afterward, and was just touching the stage, knowing that this was where he had been, was just an incredible experience.  And, so, when an opportunity to apply for a Fulbright library experience at the University of Durban-Westville [University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa] in 1996 came up, I was real excited to apply and was very happy to have been selected.  So, I spent like eight months in the Durban [South Africa] area there; lectured at library school at Pietermaritzburg [South Africa].  I gave a Martin Luther King Day [Martin Luther King Jr. Day] address at city hall in Durban, published in a couple of newsletters over there, and just really had a wonderful time.  Went to the Zimbabwe International Book Fair, which also then had a librarian component to it.  And I became very interested in international work when recognized the importance of libraries and nation building.  Which was what I had wanted to go into the profession for, thinking of nation building very parochially here in the U.S. African American community.  But, to see what it actually does on a big scale.  So, just last year, I returned after twelve years away for the International Federation of Library Associations [International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions] met in Durban.  And, to see the growth of libraries and what was happening in South Africa has just really, really been an incredible experience for me.  So, that was a, a true highlight of my professional life.
Story_ID: 483101
Speaker 1: And I've been able to travel and look at libraries internationally.  And, I'm really interested in international work.  I went with a group out of Chicago [Illinois] loosely put together, has women of color looking at the Cuban revolution.  It was thirty years after the anniversary, so that was '89 [1989].  Dr. Margaret Burroughs [HistoryMaker Margaret Burroughs] and Clarice Durham [Clarice Davis Durham] and her sister Marguerite [Marguerite Davis] and Lisa Brock and Cheryl, what was her last name, Davis [sic.]?  She's married to the South African poet.  Went--we--so, I've been to Cuba.
Speaker 2: Cheryl Harris, and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Cheryl Harris.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Cheryl Harris.  So, a big nice group that went, so.  For a while I was concerned that my passport was looking a little suspect since I've been the Sudan, and Egypt, and Cuba, and Amsterdam--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, South African, and all of that.  I was happy to get a new passport 'cause you go places and they're looking, and they're looking at you, and they're looking, and--so, could've been an international spy for all they know.  So, the opportunity to travel and more recently I've been looking at Caribbean studies as a new area of selection responsibility for me.  And, so, the study of the Caribbean really had not been a part of my curriculum and of my interest.  So, I've been attending the Caribbean Studies Association conference.  And, they've been to Brazil and Belize and my goal in life is to hit all the Caribbean islands and I said that before I knew how may there are.  You know, you think of 'em as you see them on the map but, I tell you, the Caribbean is just littered with islands with populations that sometimes have libraries and sometimes not, so.

Speaker 1: Also, I served on the executive board of the American Library Association, sixty-five thousand member organization, and that was quite something.  And I felt honored because quite frequently executive board members are directors of their libraries or head of library school or that kind of thing.  And, I'm, I'm still pretty much a front-line librarian without supervisory responsibilities and not directing anything.  But, between that and I've been working part-time at the Wilmette Public Library [Wilmette, Illinois] for years.  Almost as long as I've been at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  And, it started out just to earn a little extra money on vacation.  But, I find I like being in this literate community and it still enables me to do some children's work that I can work with young people which I do enjoy.  You can find just that right book.  When a child comes and ask about a book about an elephant.  And, you know how many children's books there are about elephants (laughter).  And, you can find just the right one.  It's really quite rewarding because they're so grateful and it just kind of makes your day so, I still enjoy that.  I've had opportunity to serve about thirteen, fourteen years on the board of the DuSable Museum of African American History, Inc. in Chicago [Illinois].  So, some community service as well.  And, work with Alpha Gamma Phi [Alpha Gamma Phi Sorority], a sorority of black women, started in Chicago in the '60s [1960s].  And, what they do is give out scholarship to young black women.  So, really been able to do a number of things that I've enjoyed and like to think of as contributions.
Speaker 2: Now, is there a local chapter of the African American Caucus [sic. Black Caucus] of the American Library Association (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, there is a Chicago branch of the Black Caucus here that I've been active.  It was actually the Chicago branch was one of my first professional associations I joined.  Mary Biblow who was then librarian at the Lab School at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] was a part of that group.  And, she said, "We need you, we need you."  So, working with the Black Caucus of the American Library Association which hadn't been in existence very long.  Maybe five or six years before I joined the Chicago branch.  And, also have seen the development of the African American studies librarian section of the Association of College and Research Libraries that started out as a discussion group and is now a very big section.  So, seeing the professional associations have all now doing national conferences.  The National African American Librarian and Conference, I forget the--our exact acronym.  Also been involved with committee work, been a member of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.  I'm a life member of that.  I'm a life member of the Toni Morrison Society, worked on the project of the history of black writing, and so many things that I've been able to--add, library or information look at various projects and I think it's been helpful.

Speaker 1: One last question here, well, it's not the last questions, but I was considering your association with The HistoryMakers over the last eight or nine years, what do you consider to be the value of this collection going forward?
Speaker 2: When I was in school at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] doing this master's degree and I would talk about oral history.  A lot of the literature you would read would talk about oral tradition.  And, my bent in understanding has always been Africans that we're an oral people.  And, I always thought the orator doesn't get enough attention paid to it.  I mean, there were years, people ignored the WPA Slave Narratives [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], you know, and they don't think of oral histories.  But, I think of oral history as such a primary source.  For me it's much more primary sources than newspaper articles which are considered primary source material.  That I think of orator in so many ways and it's so important in our community that it's not necessary for us to be literate in letters to communicate or educate.  And, so, an oral history project, these eyewitness accounts, these biographies, I think are so important.  My mother [Helen Roy Bethel] had some concern when I was a child 'cause I liked reading the obituaries page in the newspaper.  And, she wondered why.  "What child wants to read the obituaries?"  But, there are many biographies and when you can hear these stories come to life and hear the inflection in the voice I think of how much it meant to me to hear George Washington Carver's voice.  And, there have been other occasions on the Internet now where you can actually hear Thomas Edison or Henry Ford or these kinds of things.  And, the inflection, the communication is much more than what happens on a two dimensional page.  And, the opportunity for an interaction with someone I just--oral histories, I've just always thought are underutilized resources.  And, I'm glad that technology has caught up to make them so accessible to people so that some of the earlier big collections that have been done, I mentioned the Radcliffe library [Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  One that done--black women [Black Women Oral History Project], the Schlesinger Library [Cambridge, Massachusetts] did.  Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] has done one, that I think it's enormous.  And, whatever students I have referred to The HistoryMakers for their project.  Two or one of them, they had come back and said how important what they were finding, just what you've made available on the Internet is.  And, we love stories and we love storytellers and why not have people tell their own stories, and make them available for not just educational purposes but I think inspirational a bit, and I think fun as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm always looking for the fun angle.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right.

Speaker 1: Now, our last question is similar to legacy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --but a little different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't mind being remembered as the African American studies librarian.  But I hadn't thought of that, how would I like to be remembered.  I'd like to be remembered as a, as a good person, as a fun person, and as somebody with their own sense of, of themselves and style in the planet, and just having enjoyed it would please me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
