Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family background, your family history.  I'm going to start with your mother's side of the family, but I'm going to ask about your father's [Gerard Christie] side later.  So, we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Ludria, L-U-D-R-I-A, Virgin, V-I-R-G-I-N, St. Amant, S-T, and then capital A-M-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean is that all?  When you pronounced it, it seemed like there was more to it.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What's the--
Speaker 2: Well, if you're in Louisiana, they might say, St. Amant or something like that.  But it's St. Amant, like A-M-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: St. Amant.  So, it's, A-M--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: --A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, I may not have it right.  What's the--can you spell it again, the whole thing?
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: The last name?
Speaker 2: It's like saint, like S-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then capital A-M-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: A-M-A-N-T.  Okay, I got.  All right, I'm sorry, my fault.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That information I don't know it offhand.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of guess when she was--about how old was she when you were born?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: My mother, I guess she--I guess she was in her thirties.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, that would put her--you were born in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my math's not great, but she passed away in '98 [1998]. She was sixty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she--okay.  Now, well, tell us the story behind her name now, Ludria Virgin St. Amant.  Now, that's, is she from--
Speaker 2: Well, in Louisiana, you know, most of the people in this town called New Roads, Louisiana, it's a small town--
Speaker 1: Is that where she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in New Roads, yes.
Speaker 1: New Roads? N-E-W--
Speaker 2: R-O-A-D-S.
Speaker 1: R-O-A-D-S, okay.
Speaker 2: And that town is, it's like--dirt roads, you know, like really like small town.  And most of those people--if you go to the cemetery, it's like down the street, it's a short walk.  I see all my family there because of the last names--the St. Amant, the Jean Pierres, the Duprees [ph.]--it's like a bunch of names with Creole names and Cajun names and things like that.  You know, most of the time we consider ourselves Creole on that side of the family.  And, you know, that's where I came from, those roots.
Story_ID: 227248
Speaker 1: So the family has a history of being in Louisiana for a long time then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  Her [Christie's mother, Ludria St. Amant Christie] grandmother's name was--it was--I think I'm pretty sure it was Jean Pierre [St. Amant].
Speaker 1: Is there any other, any--well, how far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I can only go back to my great-grandfather.  My great-grandmother died when my mother was very young.  And I'm going to do my own actual history and go and talk to my aunt because a lot of my aunts and uncles have passed away.  And there's one in particular that every time I go see her, we sit and we talk about different things.  And she talks about, mainly about her father.  Because the mother passed away, and she refused to let anybody take pictures of her.  So in a way, like, I never knew her.  I have a photograph of my great-grandfather, and I know like everybody respected him, and he was really an intelligent man, apparently.
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: He was more so like a farmer.  Like, he would actually do things but he would save his money, and he bought land, and he bought so much land in the area.  My aunt told me that at one time people came to him, mainly like white people in the community in New Roads [Louisiana], and they kept asking him to buy the land, and he refused to.  And he could have made a lot of money, but he kept the land because it was important for his great-grandchildren and grandchildren to have legacies.  So he kept this land, and even to this day, there's--there's a plot of land.  Each member of my family on that side, like the aunts and uncles, have a plot of land that he bought, you know.  And another thing I heard that happened, was that when she died, my great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: But I know that when she died that they wanted to break up the family because it was, it was mainly girls and then a boy.  And he refused. He raised the kids.  He actually taught them to raise each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Marshall St. Amant.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, is there any memory in your family of the slavery days, any of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or the Reconstruction days, or--
Speaker 2: It doesn't go to that level, to that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your great-grandfather, I guess he might go back to the turn of the century, I guess his time would have been?
Speaker 2: I would say so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I mean, the other thing, too, it's important.  You know, I have to--my aunt is getting up in age and I want to go talk to her because she has a lot of information as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, my family tends to be a bit--I don't really know a lot about them in some ways.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you're not unusual.  I mean, a lot of people don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --dnow a whole lot about their family history.  But you know, some of what you know is good.  You do have a good story about your great-grandfather.
Story_ID: 227249
Speaker 1: She [Christie's mother, Ludria St. Amant Christie] was in her, you know I guess late thirties when you were born.  Now, did your mother talk about growing up in, did she actually grow up in New Roads [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She talked about it.  She mainly--she was mainly talking about just how they were a family and they stuck together.  And also, you know, I mean, in different times and different ways we'd talk about the past.  But specifically, it was more so, it was all about how one family member watched the other and how Louisiana used to be.  She used to talk about how you'd actually go and farm and pick things like figs and make preserves.  And I mean, you know, she really talked about growing up on the farm, you know, like working on farms and providing for yourself and building a house for yourself and things like that.  So I mean, that was interesting to me, that she actually would--she grew up that way.  But then she actually said--at one point I found that she decided--she left Louisiana.  All her sisters and brothers stayed there, but she was one person that kind of felt like she wanted to be a maverick, I guess, and just go off and do her own thing.
Speaker 1: So, where did she go?
Speaker 2: She went up to this region, like, to this part of--like New Jersey, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did she have relatives here or friends that she knew already here?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.
Speaker 1: There's probably a story there somewhere about, you know, how she--
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is.
Speaker 1: --why she decided to come to New Jersey.
Speaker 2: I just found out recently some things.  I mean I didn't--like I said, I went to Louisiana some time ago and I talked to my aunt.  And I asked her some--because I'm curious about it.  You know, my parents didn't really talk about their past that much.  I'm in the dark about a lot of things, and I go to aunts and uncles and find out, find out about recipes too 'cause I grew up in New Jersey but I grew up on Louisiana food.  They actually used to take crabs and shrimp and ship them in boxes.  So, I ate gumbo in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, which is not a place where'd you find crabs in the river, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So, you know, that's important, like learning about--just learning about my family, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a dietician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she go to school in New Jersey or in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No, no she went to school--she went to nursing school.  And I'm not even sure, I believe it's in upstate New York.  You know, I don't think it was New Jersey.  I think she eventually ended up living in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she--when she left Louisiana, she didn't come to New Jersey necessarily, but--
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I'm not--
Speaker 1: --but to New York, okay.  And she went to nursing school and became a dietician?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 227250
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Gerard Adultous, A-D-U-L-T-O-U-S, Christie, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Harlem [New York, New York].  I don't know his specific date of birth.
Speaker 1: Is he older than your mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie]?
Speaker 2: A little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He might be about--
Speaker 1: So maybe about 1930 or so?
Speaker 2: I just would guess at that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so he was born in Harlem around 1930.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: That side of the family is even more elusive than my--one time my father told me about his history.  I didn't know. I grew up not even knowing that I have roots in Jamaica.  One night my father invited me to go out for dinner with him, and you know, we went out.  And I remember it was snowing.  And we were in a car, and I just remember he started just dropping, spilling the beans, talking about, yeah your grandfather's [Albert Christie] from Clarendon [Parish], Jamaica (laughter). And I'm like, really, I never knew it because my grandfather never had an accent.  And my grandmother [Florence Chrisite]--he started talking about his mother, which is my grandmother.  And he told me like she grew up in St. George's County, Maryland [sic. Prince George's County, Maryland].  And she had like a really terrible home situation, and she left.  She left and came up to this region and became like--she worked as maid--a maid for different people like in different places.  But she eventually ended up buying her own brownstone.  And you know, the same thing like--I guess this is a different generation, where they believe that you have to own something, you have to have something.  And my grandfather, I knew he was--when he was a boy he came from Jamaica.  I think he came when he was twelve years old.  And he ended up in this region, too, like in Harlem.  And I guess that's where they met, you know.  But what I do know about that side of the family. That side is pretty interesting to me because apparently my great-great-grandfather was really an alcoholic. He was really abusive.  And he was beating my great-great-grandmother one night that she actually ran out of the house naked during like a really bad time when it was snowing.  And he was--she was so scared she just actually went up a tree and just stood there all night because he closed the door on her.  She ended up catching pneumonia, and she died.  And the same thing--I think people in the community actually approached my great-grandfather and asked him, "What are you going to do with all these kids?"  And he said he didn't care, you know, he didn't care.  And my grand--my father told me that when my grandmother heard that, she packed up and left, left Baltimore [Maryland].  And as far as my grandfather, I was told by my father that he, he basically was--his father was pretty much a philanderer, you know he loved women, you know.  And my great-grandmother was a seamstress in Jamaica.  And she was so good at it that she made enough money to come to the United States.  A lot of the money ended up going to the Marcus Garvey movement.
Story_ID: 227251
Speaker 1: This is your great-grandmother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my great-grandmother on my father's [Gerard Christie] side.
Speaker 1: She was a Garveyite? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he told me that, you know, she made so much money that she came here and she opened up like a grocery store, and I believe it was in the Harlem [New York, New York] area.  And it turned out that my grandfather [Albert Christie], my father's father--no, my great-grandfather--my grandfather's father--actually put the place out of business because every time women would come in, he would say, "Oh, honey, you don't have to pay for that."  (Laughter) You know, it was like the place wasn't making any money because he was, you know, doing his--up to his tricks.  But he, apparently he was a really like gregarious man and, you know, with a golden tongue and all that.  You know, and he just really could talk to people and get them to do things.  But the place, like I said, went out of business and everything, and--
Speaker 1: Too much credit extended to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly (laughter).
Speaker 1: --pretty women.
Speaker 2: And my father told me his grandfather, his father, my grandfather, used to, when he was a little boy he said he remember going to pick up my great-grandfather's clothing at different women's homes because he was always getting thrown out.  He was like that kind of guy, you know.  And he passed away, my father said, when he was like--just like--such a guy with such a personality that he was hired, like after he retired and everything, just to be at a funeral home to just shake hands with people to make them feel better, you know, talk to them and seat them.  And he just had a heart attack or something going to one of the--he just kind of fell over.  But this is all like told to me one night.  Like I said, I had no idea about all this stuff.  And then I finally did, I talked to my grandfather and I'm like, "You're from Jamaica?"  (Laughter) He's like, "Yeah, I'm from Jamaica."  He said--and I, you know, this is when I'm like older, like I'm in my thirties, you know.  I didn't, I didn't really like--no, actually it was like late twenties, and we're having a conversation.  My grandfather was blind, and I really liked my grandfather a lot because he was--he had a little bit of charm.  He had that charm, too.  It fell off on him, because he was that kind of guy, too, just like, just a nice guy to me, you know.  And, I just remember always seeing him in a bathrobe when we'd go and visit him.  He'd be in his robe and, you know, he just would always have to touch you.  He'd have to like squeeze your arm.  And, and, you know, you're like eight years old, and he's saying "Oh, you're lifting weights now?"  You know, (laughter) he was putting on all that kind of stuff.  But always in that robe was Life Savers or Hershey's chocolate (laughter).  So, you know, I was really happy to go see grandpa all the time, you know.  And when he got older, you know, he was the kind of guy, he really--I just liked him.  He was a soft-spoken guy, and really interesting to talk to.
Story_ID: 227252
Speaker 1: Did your father [Gerard Christie] talk about growing up in Harlem [New York, New York]?  Is that where he grew up--Harlem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father talks a lot about his childhood.  But it's really like--I think he had a lot of--he had things going on because he was kind of like, in a way, the kind of way I felt. He was like an odd boy.  He went through life, you know, trying to do the right things, but the world around him was kind of, you know, in a way, he felt like, corrupt, you know.  And people kind of took advantage of him, you know, coming from his side of, his point of view.  But so, a lot of the stories he talks about when he was growing up are pretty, they're not really happy ones.  And I think he just did the best he could with the situation.  I mean, one thing I do know is that he always told me he never learned to swim.  And he said because in those days when you were a kid, there were two things to do in Harlem.  You either went to the public pool where there was a really long line, or you went to the movies, and he said they were a quarter.  And he said (laughter) he told me this thing about how these kids would always hustle the line.  Like, if they saw you in line, they knew you had a quarter.  And they'd come up to you and say, "Give me your quarter."  And if you said, "I don't have one," they'd say, "all I find, I keep." That was the saying.  So, he said I'm not getting beat up or hustled, you know, for my money, so he would go the movie theater.  And he's like an expert in--you know, you start talking to him about movies, he can start telling you about Errol Flynn and who was in this movie.  You know, he knows like a lot of the actors, and he knows a lot about that era of film.  But he also knows a lot about--if you listen to jazz and classical music, he can tell you like who was playing.  And he actually says a lot of times he was there.  Like, when people were playing different sets, he was there.  And, you know, that's one thing, that when I think about my father, I think about music.  And also, like I said, my family's big on food--eating and everything (laughter).  So if it's not from Louisiana, then it's, you know--the time I spent at my grandmother's [Florence Christie].
Speaker 1: Okay, did your father have a favorite musician, jazz musician?
Speaker 2: He talks about Bird [Charlie Parker].  He loves that, you know.
Speaker 1: Charlie Parker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he loves Charlie Parker.  And that's the thing, I mean, he always talks about him.
Speaker 1: Now, what did--did your father, was he able to go to college and--
Speaker 2: My father was a pharmacist during the time when there were no black pharmacists--no pharmacists of color.  So, and his life was like that. He did what he thought he needed to do.
Speaker 1: Now where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: St. John's [University, New York; St. John's University, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: St. John's?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 227253
Speaker 1: Is your father [Gerard Christie] Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie], too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, from the Creole thing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Louisiana.  So--
Speaker 2: I don't know why my grandmother's [Jean Pierre Amant]--I can understand like in Louisiana, my mother's connection to being Catholic.  But I don't know, I didn't know Baltimore [Maryland], you know, why there's Catholics there.  So my grandmother was--
Speaker 1: I think it was founded--Baltimore, I mean, Maryland was actually founded as a Catholic state.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They tried to do it.  I mean Lord Baltimore, who founded it, bought the land.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they tried to establish a Catholic state, territory there.  And they finally just said anybody could live there (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: He tried to establish, yeah--
Speaker 2: So, that's where the Catholic comes from, from my grandmother's side.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, well, that's at least I guess a logic for why Maryland--there's a lot of Catholics in Maryland because they actually did try to found it as a Catholic state.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm seeing the correlation, I didn't know.  Like, I recently just called my father to ask him some questions, and he told me about St. George [sic. Prince George's County, Maryland].  I didn't know Baltimore had counties, like Louisiana has parishes.  And so, there's a correlation right there.  They have St. George, and then my mother came from Pointe Coupee Parish [Louisiana], but there's other--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Prince George's County is a big--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Prince George is--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Prince George.  There's St. Anne's--I mean there's a Princess Anne [County, Maryland].  They're all named after royalty or--
Speaker 2: That's what it is, Prince George.
Speaker 1: People who are in a lot of counties are named after, you know, European royalty--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who were actually Catholics at the time when--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the place was founded, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is all information for kids' books (laughter). I'm always like--my mind ticks when I think about it.
Story_ID: 227254
Speaker 1: So, your father [Gerard Christie] went to St. John's [University, New York; St. John's University, New York, New York].  Now, did he--now he became a pharmacist, so he was good in science and math, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Yeah and his story about being a pharmacist, he told me that, he said the Korean War was going on.  And he said they really were trying to get anybody of color--black, Latin--if you weren't doing well in school, they'd come--and he told me that they actually came and checked--every month they'd come and check to see his grades.  And if his grades fell, they'd ship him off.  He said he knew people that that happened to, and so he was really...  But he has that kind of--my father is like that, and that's how--you know, he's very--like, I can understand how he is a pharmacist because he's very meticulous, and he goes through routines and patterns.  And I can imagine, too, like his mind--as far as like knowing different musicians and who played on the set, and also knowing about films and who, you know, who was in the film and all that--I can understand because for years, you have to remember, like dosages. You had to know different types of medications. You have to know like what they're used for.  And he told me that pharmacy's changed.  And I met, recently I met another pharmacist.  I met a--I used to have an agent a long time ago.  And I think her, either her father was, or someone that she knew was a pharmacist, and it was a Jewish guy.  So, it was interesting to talk to him and find out his experiences, but he said the same thing, that pharmacy completely changed from what it was then when he was working in the '60s [1960s], you know, '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], until now.  You know, and my father's retired, but you know, I don't think he--he always told me he didn't really like being a pharmacist.  It was something that I notice in a lot of generations, is that friends, a lot of friends that are older, and I find that when I talk to them--that generation--a couple of generations before me--it was about really like survival.  You didn't say I want to be a rap star.  You wanted to be a physician, you wanted to be a physicist, you wanted to be an engineer.  It was always like something that was practical.  So, I think in his generation and him growing up in the way he did, he was really like kind of pushed into doing something that's going to survive.
Speaker 1: A very respect--respectable, professional--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's something I tell my friends because a lot of times my friends, we all talk about the family and fathers and all that.  And if they have problems or issues with their fathers, they have to really think about, think about these things, you know.  You have to think about the--first of all, the racism in that time period.  And you also have to think about the social pressures of--I think every person, not only man, but every person might want to go and travel the world, or, you know--I want to be a writer.  I want to cultivate something creative in my spirit, but that in that generation, that was kind of looked at as hobbies.  You know, people tell you--you know, the illustrators I've met that were working in the '60s [1960s] told me they didn't know if their work was going to get shown.  They just worked because it was inside of them to do it.  So, I mean, that kind of thing, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's--
Speaker 2: That's a different world.
Story_ID: 227255
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Jerry Pinkney was a bus driver--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a long time.
Speaker 2: Tom Feelings, I talk to him--George Ford.  I talked to like a lot of these guys that--and I'm thankful to them.  You know, they paved the way.  But I mean, I can't even imagine that lifestyle.  I can't imagine, like, you know, I love like working to the point where I know it's going to get printed and it's going to be seen by people.  And I'm really kind of, you know, I'm developing this now to just paint, get back to painting for the love of painting, you know, whether--even if no one's going to see it or not.  So, you know, that's something commendable, to just work--to really have that kind of--tap into your creativity into that way where you're just working just to work.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Gerard Christie], or any of the other members of your family, were there any artistic members?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's the same like with--I think everybody paints and draws when they're kids.  It's a pastime to keep you from breaking the ceramics in the house, you know (laughter). So, my father, I remember seeing--he did, he used to do these little--I remember finding a notebook.  He had a notebook of World War II [WWII] planes, and he did little--they're almost like architectural diagrams.  And they were colored in colored pencil and really like, I mean great craftsmanship because he added the details to them.  And then underneath it, he put like the name of the particular plane and what it was you know, what it was used for, and that kind of thing.  And it was just like flipping through an old war book, you know, like an old war artifact book.  And he had, you know, everything written out.  My brothers [Gerard Thaddeus Christie and Corneilus Marshall Christie] used to draw, too.  I have two brothers, they drew, and they always did their thing.  But they, everyone stopped.  I drew because that's something--for me, it's like my world. I went into my own place.  And if things weren't right around me that was a place I could go to.  So, it didn't even matter if they drew or not.  I think the real impact for me was when I was in school, and I noticed that people would tell me, oh, you're really good at drawing.  You know, it's like somebody that walks down the street and everyone keeps saying, you should be a model (laughter). Eventually, one time you might do it and you might hit it big.  But I just wanted to draw, you know.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memory was my father [Gerard Christie] being upset about something and kicking a drawer--a dresser.  That's one of my earliest ones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up--did you grow up in several places, or one place basically?
Speaker 2: I grew up mainly in--between Louisiana and also New Jersey, just those two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd spend the summers in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, in New Jersey, I remember the sights were riding a bike and closing my eyes for a minute and the sun kind of like tickling through the leaves and brightening up my closed eyelids.  And I just remember that kind of happy feeling of just, like a street with trees, and just playing that way, like riding a bike, walking down to the brook.  Because I lived like kind of on a U-shaped street, but there was a little pathway through somebody's yard.  All the kids knew it, and they used to show each other. Each generation would show the other.  And you'd go through this yard, and you'd end up at a brook.  And when you're a kid, it was like an adventure, because the brook seemed to go on forever. You didn't know how far it went down.  And there you'd see turtles, you'd see fish, and you also had like dirt bombs.  And we'd go to my mother's [Ludria St. Amant Christie] garden and throw it on the roof, and pretend it's a war or something and watch things explode and go down into the gutter.  And Louisiana, I remember distinctly the smells of Louisiana.  Walking into my aunt's house had a different kind of smell. It just smelled good.  And other--I don't even know what the smell was.  It was just some kind of, just something that just hit you.  And other times, they would be cooking.  So, you'd go--after the flight you'd end up there, and there'd be like some kind of pot of gumbo cooking and that makes any house smell great, you know.  And, you know, that's the good stuff.  My childhood was balanced, you know.  I don't always focus on the bad stuff. There was a lot of good stuff that went down, too.
Story_ID: 227257
Speaker 1: Was there anything bad about growing up that you--
Speaker 2: Just feeling strange, you know, not really--like, from an early age.  The thing about growing up the way I did was, you know, Scotch Plains [New Jersey], if you look at it statistically, you know, you look at it--if you're taking--what do they call it, like a census--it's Irish and Catholic mainly.  But I grew up on a street that was filled with black people.  My neighbors were black. Most of the people--you know, it's like most towns down south, and also throughout the United States.  There's usually like a main street or some tracks that separate different cultures from each other or even different economic groups.  And in a way, it was great because I grew up around people that were going to work.  And it was the generation of the '60s [1960s], like men and women that were married--men and women of color--and they just were doing productive things, and there were different degrees of it.  Because I'm not sure, I believe I heard that where I grew up--it's called Jerseyland [Scotch Plains, New Jersey]--and they told me that was one of the first black country clubs [Shady Rest Golf and Country Club, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] in the United States.  And--
Speaker 1: So, that was nearby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was nearby.
Speaker 1: Jerseyland?
Speaker 2: Yeah, see, I used to, you know, to pass the time, I just would ride a bike most of the time.  But--
Speaker 1: Was it still popular when you were, I mean--
Speaker 2: What? The country--
Speaker 1: Did people still go?
Speaker 2: Well, people used to go party and dance there.  It wasn't, I don't know what they did when it was starting out.  So, my thing is like--you know, coming from a family that came from, you know, two Catholic parents, my mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] insisted I go to a Catholic school [St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].  So, you know, I was different in that sense.  I was, you know, having a different ethnicity than everyone else in the school. That was horrible.  That, that, the teasing and, you know, just people just saying things that were just, like, derisive.  You know, when you're a little kid you have to, like, you have to learn things in a way like that maybe adults deal with.  So, in a way, I've always been kind of, I've always had like a straight path because of that.  Now, some of the things I'm talking about that I didn't like about my childhood, it made me who I am today. It made me a bit fearless about things.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's the good side of it, and I wouldn't change anything.  I mean, it is what it is.
Story_ID: 227258
Speaker 1: Well can you tell us a story about how they, you know, about being taunted or teased?
Speaker 2: You know, like, I got a bunch (laughter).  But one in particular, I remember going--getting invited to a party.  And it was a group of kids, you know, I think it might have been fourth grade or something.  And it was around the time, like it was--some of the kids were wealthy, so we'd go to--like they had like a beach house or something, and we went out to this beach house.  And so they made, like, food and everything.  And you know, somebody wanted to make up some fried chicken.  So, you know, I remember one of the kids like saying to me, you know, just stupid things about ethnicity, you know, some things about stereotypes, like, "Oh, come on, don't resist this chicken, you know you want it."  Well, I'm a kid, you know, and I didn't even know about these things.  I learned about, you know, like these different kinds of, you know, stereotypes from the kids that I went to school with.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't really have a concept about the stereotype before you--
Speaker 2: No, because the thing is, I was, I'm in like in this kind of bridge between white society and black society in a way, because it even feels this way today sometimes.  Because what happened is that most of the kids that grew up in my neighborhood went to a public school. They knew each other.  I went to a Catholic school [St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].  That's just a pretty light story.  You know, I don't focus on these things as much anymore but it got worse.  It was stuff that--I never really got beat up and things like that, but it's just like I didn't know about--you know, I didn't know about Malcolm X.  I never saw James Baldwin interviewed.  I didn't know about Toussaint L'Ouverture.  I didn't know about all these historical people.  So, it was kind of put on me at a young age by other kids--all black people do is, you know, look at these rap stars.  You know, this is the time of the '80s [1980s] when rap was actually not that bad, you know.
Story_ID: 227259
Speaker 1: So you were like ten in 1980 or so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nine or ten.
Speaker 2: And another thing I didn't care for, too, were comedians.  Like, the Eddie Murphy had his "silly Negro" joke, you know, and I used to hear that all the time in school. And it's like, you know, you got to be careful, you know, if you're a comedian or whatever, and you make jokes and all that.  The need to be counterbalanced.  I don't, I'm not like a big--
Speaker 1: So, white kids would use that stuff against you in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sure.  They'd watch it, they'd watch it Saturday night, Monday morning and I'd have to hear every Eddie Murphy joke, you know, that came about.  And I loved Eddie Murphy in that time, but still it's hurtful when things are just misused, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't want to be Eddie Murphy at school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's what I'm saying.  And I don't know, it's like over time, like you get older, and you start to think about things, why people--you know.  And you also realize that--I feel like a lot of those parties I was invited to because it was just, you know, like the Christian thing to do.  It wasn't about people liking me, or you know, really wanting to build a friendship.  You know, so, over time, like you get older and you start to see the world, and you start to see human nature.  But the thing about it, I really, I stuck it out.  You know, and that's what I'm saying. It makes you strong, and--and, it also prepares you.  And I have other friends that grew up in neighboring towns, you know, that--all they know are white people, or all they know is white culture.  And then over time we became friends, and there was a bridge.  But the thing about it, I can see that they're almost afraid of black people--black people afraid of black people, you know.  Because in a way, sometimes it's great to grow up in a place where there's no crime, and there's no kind of, like, hassles or whatever, you know, and you can almost build your own thing.  But you have to know your own culture.  It's a way to really--you've got to take control of your own history and knowledge.
Story_ID: 227260
Speaker 1: Were your friends in your community--did you have good friendships in your community [Scotch Plains, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: No, it's just what I was--see, I--
Speaker 1: I mean on the street--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just as I was saying, like, I forgot about the bridge, that's one side.  The other side is that I was kind of weird to the black kids because they're like, oh, you went to Catholic school [St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey], you know, and you talk this way, and this and that.  And one good thing about Catholic school is that you learn about Constantinople [Istanbul, Turkey] and the Byzantine Empire. You learn a lot about history.  So, when I'm in school--you know, and I made a point to go to a public school because I didn't want to--no way I'm going to go through all that.
Speaker 1: You mean to college?
Speaker 2: No, high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: High school, okay, high school.
Speaker 2: Eight years and kindergarten of Catholic school, I had enough of it, so I went to a public school.  And there was everybody there--rich, poor, black, white, Asian, Filipino, everybody was there.  But I had a hard time in that sense because a lot of kids knew each other growing up.  And when I got into their--you know, I always wanted, no matter was what going on in my home or what was happening with my family--I always had like, I always had a desire to like learn and do the best I could in life, you know.  So, I didn't--you know, when I was in school I used to, like, know questions.  And the teacher asked something that made sense, I could answer it, you know, whatever.  It's like--I don't know.  Sometimes people don't want to, they want to pretend they're failing and not want to achieve, you know, and it's--I never had that kind of mindset.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a hard time, in that sense.
Story_ID: 227261
Speaker 1: Let me go back to when you were a kid growing up. I mean we're still in that.  But what--was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's one thing I remember.  My father [Gerard Christie] used to always--even I have a habit of it, too. I picked it up from him.  Music's always on, something's in the background.  And he listened to jazz and he listened to classical music.  Every morning before I went to school, there was always music on.  You know, he'd go to work.  My mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] would usually leave first, and my father would leave--or sometimes it would be my father, actually.  And--but he always had music on, and so I grew up with classical music and I grew up with the jazz.  He listened to jazz mainly when he came home or on the weekends, you know, if he wasn't watching TV or something.  But what I noticed about him was that, you know, he didn't fit in a box, you know.  If he liked [Jean] Sibelius or [Johann Sebastian] Bach or [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart he'd listen to it, you know.  And he always stuck to his guns and did what he liked.  If he saw something he thought was interesting, he'd go for it.  So it taught me to be that way, when I was a kid, I learned from that.  Just seeing him listen to whatever he wants, I was really like adventurous about different types of music.  I didn't only just--I liked hip-hop at that time. I loved house music, but also at that time I listened to things like The Cure or I was listening to classical music, Jimi Hendrix.  I would listen to anything, anything that sounded good.  If it didn't sound good, I didn't bother with it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were really subjective about--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And eclectic.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 227262
Speaker 1: --How many brothers--you have--
Speaker 2: Two brothers [Gerard Thaddeus Christie and Corneilus Marshall Christie].
Speaker 1: Two brothers?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: No sisters, right?
Speaker 2: I have some half-sisters, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My father [Gerard Christie] was married previously.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the same thing, I didn't--I always thought they were my cousins (laughter).  Then one day somebody said, "That's your sister."  And my brother told me that my father was married before, like when I was older.  I didn't know that, I had no idea. I didn't know that he was married before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: But in your household, was it just you and your brothers growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was my mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] that was home mainly and two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did your grandparents [Jean Pierre St. Amant and Marshall St. Amant] live with you or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They would come visit sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you'd go to see them in the summer, in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you ever go to, did you have any relatives in Baltimore [Maryland] in those days that you'd go see?
Speaker 2: No, when my grandmother [Florence Christie] came from Baltimore, she cut ties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had a sister, apparently, and I don't think I've ever met my aunt.  And, and, it's weird, but my family--it's not together in a way.  There's fractures in different parts of it, it's just a reality.
Speaker 1: You're not alone.
Speaker 2: I know I'm not (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of--we were talking about music.  Well, was church a big--did you actually go to Catholic church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to. Um-hm. But it wasn't--if you're talking about a Catholic church with Irish and Catholic people, it's not, not up in Harlem [New York, New York] and people with tambourines and all that.
Speaker 1: It's not the kind of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't feel the same kind of closeness?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And in a way, it pushed me away from the church.  I respect it for people need it--for what they need it for, but I just, it wasn't--it wasn't my place at the time.  You know, it taught me a lot about--it gave me a sense of values, but over time when I got older--and also the way I was seeing people act, it made me question the values.
Story_ID: 227263
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite television shows and movies growing up?
Speaker 2: I mainly--I mean, the things that kids do.   I loved watching--I loved watching cartoons when I got home--Bugs Bunny ['Looney Tunes'] (laughter) and all that stuff.  And then later on I started to listen to, you know, classical music myself, and realized that that was all--I really liked--I looked at it in a different way now.  I'm like, wow, this is on a high level.  They have all this classical music and all these double jokes, and all this stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bugs composing the--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). So, I mean I used to watch that.  And then I would watch shows they would show in the '70s [1970s], you know, like, I loved 'Good Times,' 'Sesame Street,' 'Gilligan's Island.'  Like I used to watch stuff that kids would watch.  I was mainly into video games, you know, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the video games--video games started I guess becoming popular in the '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: When you were just about nine or ten?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  These are memories of my childhood--mainly Atari video games, drawing, and also, you know, just mainly learning a lot of things from my mother, like cooking and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Gerard Christie] worked a lot, and even after work he was, sometimes he didn't come around until later.  So, my mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] pretty much raised me.  She taught me a lot about cooking and, you know, different recipes.  And, you know, I hung out with her most of the time.
Story_ID: 227264
Speaker 1: What was your subject matter when you drew, you know?  Were you inspired by stuff you saw on TV, or--
Speaker 2: No, I was mainly inspired, I'd say in the beginning by comic books: 'Conan the Barbarian,' 'Heavy Metal,' these kind of things.  So, I used to draw people with swords, make flipbooks where you actually would draw on the edge of a book and just kind of flip it on each page so that it starts to move.  You start from the end of the story, and then you build up to the beginning. And then at the end, you can flip it, like how they used to do all the cartoons.  So, I mean I used to work that way, mainly working with gory stuff, things you would expect a boy to draw, like sharks eating people, and war zones and guns and shooting and--
Speaker 1: I don't know, I'm not surprised that stuff was popular amongst--the youth today are doing the same thing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, I mean that's where it started.  And then after a while, like, getting into eighth grade [at St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] I had--teachers really start to single me out and, wow, you know, you're really good.  You've got to keep--you know, become an artist, and this and that.  And I remember one guy that was, his name was--I just remember his name because of the--his name was Ponce de Leon [ph.].  He was from Spain, and this guy was apparently like a college level teacher, but he was doing something that his daughter--her name was Jamina [ph.]--she went to school with me. She came a bit later. She was pretty cool, I mean like really nice and everything.  And her family came from Spain and all that, I think.  But he was like really exuberant, and he was really like going on about a painting I was doing because he had, he started like an afterschool type program.  Like, he actually wanted the kids to come in, you know, a little bit after, and do some painting courses.  And we did a still life, and I still have the still life.  But he really was saying how I really have a command of the materials, you know, and he really encouraged me.  Like, almost every art teacher really told me to pursue art.  So, I mean, that's where I spent a lot of my time. A lot of my time I spent painting.
Speaker 1: So, so did you--when did you actually start painting?  What age were you when you actually started using paint?
Speaker 2: Twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Using professional stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I was a kid, I always worked with color and markers, colored pencil.  See, I used to--I don't--people a lot of times tell me I'm lucky, you know.  And I tell them always the same thing that I'm lucky in the sense of knowing exactly what I want to do on this planet. From being--from birth, I knew what I wanted to do, like, at an early age.  And the point is, when I went to the art store, I went there so much that they gave me a job eventually.  They just--I mean when I came of age, "When do you want to start?"  So I started--you know, they saw my face so much getting different supplies.  And I tell every artist this: that no school teaches you to paint, you teach yourself to paint.  You have to sit at a table or sit in a room and just work with the materials and find out how it's going to react.  And if you can do that, then you can start to learn about theories and other people's solutions.  But find your own voice first.
Story_ID: 227265
Speaker 1: What grade school did you start at?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten and, you know, the first through eighth at this Catholic school called St. Bartholomew [Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: St. Bartholomew, okay.  And was your favorite subject always art?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: I remember there was a teacher named Miss Novy [ph.], and she was really a great art teacher.  I mean she always, she taught the kids.  Like, we're talking about grammar school kids, so she would teach you in a way where you would cut and paste something that she had already designed.  You know, like maybe you're doing a dog, and you cut two circles, and that makes like part of the muzzle and a triangle for the nose.  So, I remember doing projects like that.  And yeah, she had an impact on me, I would say.  And also this teacher, Ponce de Leon [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it made me feel, that made me feel great that they had, they had somebody that actually, apparently was with credentials.  And he like, he was really passionate.  He didn't just say, "Oh, this is good work."  He just started grabbing people and saying, "Look at this."  (Laughter) And you know, I was like feeling great.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a teacher in high school, or--
Speaker 2: He was--I believe he taught in a college back in Spain.
Speaker 1: Okay, you met him--
Speaker 2: But I met him in seventh grade, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was teaching like the upper, you know, in grammar school, like the older students.  Different --like, just coming in and doing kind of a workshop.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, where did you go--did you go to--you went from K through eighth at St. Bartholomew?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 227266
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Scotch Plains-Fanwood [High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Scotch Plains--what was the last part of it, what is it?
Speaker 2: Fanwood, F-A-N--
Speaker 1: Fan--
Speaker 2: W-O-O-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is Fanwood?  I don't--(laughter).  I'm trying to think of--
Speaker 2: Fanwood, it's a town.  It's two towns bordering each other.  It's Scotch Plains [New Jersey], Fanwood [New Jersey], then Westfield [New Jersey].  And next to Scotch Plains is pretty much Plainfield [New Jersey].  Now, see, that's the thing about how I grew up, too.  Plainfield is actually like a kind of rough area for that area.  And it's almost like Newark [New Jersey], there's a lot of Latino and black people.  But when I was growing up, it was mainly black people.  But anytime the news needed a story, that's when they focused on shootings and muggings and things like that.  So, Plainfield was kind of an area that was kind of considered to be rough.  But that's what I'm saying.  Like, I do like the way I grew up.  Aside from everything-- anything that went down, the idea of like being around people of color, I don't feel intimidated or afraid to go live in a rough place, you know.  I'm not foolhardy and walk around at night and I take care of myself, but I know like at the end of the day, people are people, and they usually want the same things in life.  And if they don't get it, there's different degrees of how people do try to get it.
Story_ID: 227267
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in other activities in high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] other than art?
Speaker 2: I was, I was pretty much focused on art, I loved art.  I tried to do sports, but I just have such a solitary nature.  I've always been like that, and it came about from my experiences of just finding the strength in myself, and finding ways to entertain myself.  So, I've always kind of done my own thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What sport were you trying to, did you--
Speaker 2: I went out for baseball, and I was accepted to the team.  I couldn't make the basketball team, believe it or not (laughter).  I just, you know, like things that I excelled--I mean when we were on the playground, I was pretty good.  I think if I had someone to teach me certain things, I probably could have been really good at sports.  Because I found that I have very good hand-eye coordination, you know, meaning that whenever I tried to do archery--because when I was a kid, the neighborhood kids, like the older ones--because that's the way my neighborhood was set up.  You had like kids that were my age, and I'm talking about, let's say, eight year olds--eight to thirteen, I remember these.  And then you had older kids that were in their twenties, and everyone hung out in kind of groups.  And actually, the kids in their twenties would kind of let the younger kids hang out with them in some cases, you know.  That's one thing, like, my street was--I loved my street.  My street was really set up in a good way, you know.  And I remember like one time one of the--one of the guys' name was Jason [AJ] Summers.  And he's a DJ, he's a really fabulous DJ.  And he told me when I was a kid, he was like, "Man, you're like Indiana Jones."  Because they always saw me with arrows, bows and arrows, and you know (laughter).  I used to, as a kid, they didn't have such regulations.  You could go and get Chinese stars, and I'd throw them in the, I'd throw them in the--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Those ninja stars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the ninja stars (laughter).  You live in a society where people are so afraid of everything now.  Because, you know, if I was a kid and showed up with a helmet on, people would be laughing.  Like, "Why you got that helmet on when you're riding your bike?"  You know, back then it's like you could go to the market and get some ninja stars and all kinds of knives, whatever you want, no regulations.  And I'm not dumb enough to go stab somebody or whatever, you know.  I was a kid, but I had a lot of sense.  I didn't, like, put anybody at risk, I never threw it at anybody (laughter).  But I had fun, you know.  And so, that's what he was saying, he said, "Man," you know, and I was really good at archery.  I actually could take--I bought arrows and I--
Speaker 1: So, you're in the neighborhood walking around with a bow and arrow (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would do that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Ninja stars.
Speaker 2: Well, I played in my front yard and I played in my backyard.  And then also I'd go to the park.  And if there was no one there--you know, sometimes I wanted to see how high an arrow could go.  And I was amazed by that, that you could actually have that kind of reaction.  You know, like, you know, you pull back an arrow and went it really far.  You know, for a kid, that's amazing.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, those are the days when the martial arts movies were really big.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They started to become real big in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Well, that's the thing.  I was raised by television too, like a lot of kids in that generation.  Part of my childhood was Saturday 'Kung Fu Theater,' you know, and that's how I got into ninja stars and kung fu.  You know, I just loved that stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know when I first heard the name of the group, Wu-Tang Clan--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, I remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm like, well, what is this about?  I figured that had something to do with the 'Kung Fu Theater.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it; that's got to be it.  So, and then, you know, coming from my brothers' [Gerard Thaddeus Christie and Corneilus Marshall Christie] generations, they grew up on Bruce Lee.  And you know, so when they were watching Bruce Lee, I was watching it, and I'm like wow.  And I loved 'Batman,' for the fighting, you know.  So, yeah.

Speaker 1: In high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] now did you--how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: They were, they were okay.  I mean I was dealing with more psychological things more than--I had a real avid desire.  I want to learn, and I like learning about people, and things like that.  And I know that I'm able to survive people well.  Freelance is not that easy, you know, and I'm always finding new ways to keep things moving.  So, I feel like I do have brains, in the sense of survival, and also I can remember things at times.  But the thing is that I was dealing with--because in grammar school [St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey], you know, I just felt kind of strange, and I felt really like hurt by different things going on.  I thought high school would be a lot better.  High school didn't change that much, because not do you have white kids acting out at you, you have black kids, too.  So, it's like I really like became my own person and just--you know, I remember one time I used to work at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim Museum [New York, New York].  And there was a guy from the [Caribbean] islands, and he told me something that always stuck in my mind.  He said--because he told me to watch out for the people there, you know.  And he said, "You got to be a united force of one," (laughter). And I started to say, that's going to be my mantra, I like that.  I like the idea of somebody saying, just find the strength in yourself, and be a united force of one, you know.  And that's the kind of mindset I took on, and I didn't--I didn't feel like I wanted to be bothered with things going on with kids.  And if they had issues and they didn't understand me, I knew there was going to be a day when I could call my own shots.
Story_ID: 227269
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher in high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey], or a mentor in high school?
Speaker 2: I had a friend that had an impact on me, probably my first--really, like I had a next door neighbor, a girl named Sandra Green [ph.].  She was like a, she was from Haiti actually.  And well, her family was from Haiti.  But she was a friend through most of my years.  And when I got to high school, I found like a male friend, you know, and I found somebody that was like--the guy was just crazy, you know, and he just liked me and I liked him.  And I think what we couldn't understand--his name was Darnell Lloyd [ph.]--we couldn't really, we're still friends to this day.  I was the best man at his wedding, and things like that.  But he dealt with a lot of issues when he was growing up, too, you know.  And the thing about it is that I found, like, he was so, he has such a personality, you know.  He can say something crazy and just, you know, say it in a way that people can deal with it, you know.  And he showed me--
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) we're talking about high school humor with--you know.  We were, you know, just joking about girls, or passing gas, you know, stuff that we would do.  But he just has a funny way of looking at the world.  And I always told him to be an author and write things, because he has the intelligence and the mindset, but he also had a way of just, like, commanding respect from people based on his presence and his voice, and also really like just crossing the line, just doing stuff, and people just kind of dealing with it.  And what I like is, he also is the kind of person that had a real issue with being alone, you know.  And I think I attract a lot of people like that.  They're very gregarious, and they're leaders in a way, like they actually--people flock to them, some of them--some people that have been, you know, recently friends and things like that, are people that are entertainers and they're doing things.  But they also have something that they don't show to the world or the people around them, you know.  And I think they also are kind of intrigued by me, because I'm the kind of person to just live and let live, and do my own thing, but I still excel in the world, and I don't do it by being ruthless or being loud.  It's like, I just really like looking at something, evaluating it, and figuring out how I need to work it out so I can survive, and I can live with myself afterwards, you know.  And I've had tons of people that are really like outgoing and things like that, and they tell me, "Oh, you've got to speak up," you've got to do this, you've got to do that."  But in a short time, like, I really feel like I've really excelled in a way, by just sticking to myself and being who I am, and keeping balanced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that means accepting the bad things about me along with the good, and doing what I can, you know.  It's not about putting on a face; it's just, like, you got to have like a balance in life.  And I think getting back to this friend in high school, the balance is that he was more outgoing, and I was kind of quiet.  But we also used to speak on kind of a normal level, and I tend to do that.  Like I tend to, like, if I'm sitting with somebody, I'll talk about history, I'll talk about current events.  I'm not really much into small talk that much, and it's not really a forte of mine, you know.  And I do the best I can, but I just, I usually attract people that like to think--philosophy and things.  They like to think about things--not necessarily like pundits or intellectuals--but just people that kind of will talk about things other than what's in the media, or some issue that really has nothing that's really going to impact them down the road.
Story_ID: 227270
Speaker 1: You grew up in an era when we had just had this black arts revolution, basically, the Black Arts Movement.  You know, a lot of black artists became--you know, the artists of the past were brought back, I mean, to the public eye.  People like Aaron Douglas, you know, and we had Charles [Wilbert] White and other people.  Did you, did you know about the black artists when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My exposure to that was watching 'The Cosby Show.'  And then later on, I knew the names.  When I started working at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York], the only person I knew was [Pablo] Picasso.  And at the time, the very first show that I worked at--I first started off in the bookshop, and it was Jane Holzer.  And she's known for doing these neon signs, and the Guggenheim had a huge retrospective of her work.  So, it opened up my eyes to what art can be.  And working in the bookshop I really started to read a lot and look at, I always looked at art books when I went to libraries as a kid, but I looked at more instructional books.  One other thing about me as a kid, like I said, I was--always felt strange around people my own age.  So, actually, like when I was in seventh grade [at St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] I joined this Scotch Plains Fanwood Art[s] Association, which are like women in their seventies and sixties--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you joined this when you were in the seventh grade?
Speaker 2: A kid, yeah.  And they just kind of--
Speaker 1: Joined the Scotch Plains--
Speaker 2: Scotch Plains Fanwood Art Association.
Speaker 1: --Fanwood Arts Association.
Speaker 2: And it was people that would sit around, and they'd have a guest speaker come in and talk about a technique.  And then we would all like sit around in a circle and just usually draw a model, or just draw.  And the women would help me, and give me like pointers.  And you know, it was kind of strange, you know, in a way.  But in another way, it felt right to me, because I wanted to learn, and I'll learn from anybody, and I still do today.  New York [New York] was a learning experience.
Speaker 1: Now, where did they meet?
Speaker 2: They met in the train station.  There's a historical train station in Fanwood, New Jersey.  And, and, it's a space that every--it was like once a month you'd meet.  And I don't even remember if they--I'm sure they had dues and things like that.  But I was so young, I think my mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] paid the dues.  And, you know, every month I'd go and do it, and I'd be part of the art exhibitions, too.  They'd have like art shows and things.
Story_ID: 227271
Speaker 1: When did you start working for the art store?
Speaker 2: I started in high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what store, what was it?
Speaker 2: It was called Commercial Art Supply, in Plainfield, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And you worked for the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York] in college [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as soon as I got to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the museum closed down for renovation for a couple of years, but then they hired me back, and I came back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were a senior in high school, you had some exhibitions, I guess?  Were there any high school exhibitions?
Speaker 2: They had me go to Governor's--like, be a Governor's School [sic. Governor's Awards in Arts Education] candidate.  It's like Governor's School is something, you know, the governor puts forth, where he takes kids that excel in different--students that excel in different types of fields.  And I was in art, and I applied for the art category.  So, I did that for a little bit.  And I didn't get into Governor's School, but I was part of the finalists, you know.  You had to be entered, and you actually went to a college.  I think it was Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], and then you had to be interviewed, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were a finalist, but do you know what happened to the person that won, that got first place?
Speaker 2: No, you keep going (laughter).  If something happens, you just--I mean I enjoyed the experience and then moved on.  I was more excited that I knew I was going to live in New York.  High school was the same.  Like, that time in high school I had some, I just had a really tough time.  Because I mean, there was one particular girl--there were groups of popular people, and there was one girl that just did not like me.  And she was very pretty, and she knew all the pretty girls in school, so she had like a whole--I was like blackballed or something, you know, (laughter) and so I didn't really--you know, so I just focused on my art.  Because what happened is I hung out with my friend, Darnell [Lloyd (ph.)], and everyone else was kind of just--I don't know, they just didn't understand where I was coming from, and I didn't understand where they were coming from.
Story_ID: 227272
Speaker 1: Well when you were a senior in high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] did--how did you choose a college?  You knew you were going to go to college, right, for art?
Speaker 2: I got a magazine called ARTnews and they have a college issue.  Or, at least at that time, almost in every issue they had like all the art schools in the country.  And I just looked, and I thought about different states.  And I said, "No, I'm going to school in New York."  And I saw like [The] Cooper Union [for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, New York], I saw Pratt [Institute, New York, New York], I saw Parsons [School of Design, New York, New York], and I saw the School of Visual Arts [(SVA), New York, New York].  And I just applied to the SVA and I applied to Cooper Union, and sent off my stuff.  And this is another thing.  I had no idea that, like, I knew I wanted to be an artist, but I had no idea about the career an artist can have in commercial art versus fine art, animation, being a tattoo artist.  I had no idea--I wasn't exposed to the vocational aspect of how you can survive.  But I always knew in my mind that I would do well as an artist, so I never had any fear about--you know, people say, "Oh, you never know.  You need to get something to fall back on."  I knew I wanted to go to an art school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were selected by--
Speaker 2: The School of Visual Arts, yeah.
Speaker 1: The School of Visual Arts?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, the School of Visual Arts.  This is the New York School of Visual Arts?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you graduated from high school in--
Speaker 2: Let's see, that would be, what is it, '84 [1984], I think.  I don't even like to think about these years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was it '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: I just remember--
Speaker 1: It was later than '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: No, no, it was '86 [1986], I believe.
Speaker 1: You were born in '71 [1971], so--yeah, '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: I graduated art school in '93 [1993].  That's when I feel like my life began, and I know facts about--a lot of things in childhood, I don't even care to even remember.
Speaker 1: Does that sound about right--
Speaker 2: My brother graduated in '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: --the class of '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine, [1989], actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The class of '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't even have a yearbook; I don't have a class ring; I never went to the prom.  I had, it's almost like, like I said, these memories make me who I am, but at the time, going through fire, you don't want to think about being burned like that.
Story_ID: 227273
Speaker 1: So did you stay in a dorm in New York [New York]?  How did you, how did you do it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first year [at School of Visual Arts (SVA), New York, New York] I stayed in a place called Greystone [ph.].  It was kind of like this, it seemed like a welfare hotel.  It was really bad, actually.  The School of Visual Arts put people in these really rough hotels, or, you know, retirement places, and there's all kinds of characters, you know.  One guy was always on the phone with a different company screaming (laughter).  And he'd come down with a neck brace that's dirty, like a brown neck brace, and he'd be on his cell phone or pay phone from like ten o'clock in the morning until about three, just like calling people and saying, "My heat is not on," whatever.  He was, he was actually just whacked out.  And there was always security at Greystone, and I met this kid named Matt Layden.  And he was like another person I just got--I liked people that kind of--I've always been like enamored by people that could speak well, like I talked about my great-grandfather.  So, that's why I think I would have loved to have met him.  And my grandfather [Albert Christie] spoke pretty well.  And Matt was this guy that just kind of opened me up to like the--almost like the destructive side of being an artist.  He liked me because I was straight at that time, a straight arrow.  I didn't drink, didn't do anything.  You know, and him, he was actually experimenting with heroin.  That's the first time I ever met anybody that actually decided to do something so stupid or destructive.  And this guy was like, he had a lot of like charisma, and he had a lot of--he was very intelligent.  But at that age and at that time, I learned how far people can go down, you know.  And we're talking about a kid, like twenty-something years old, not a--you know, he had his life ahead of him.  But like I said, it doesn't--to me it's not about the personality of a person, it's their character.  And at that time the drugs didn't get him to a point where I couldn't trust his character, you know.  Because I know all types of people.  Like, that's the one gift New York gave me, and that's what I knew.  I knew I had to get out of the town I was in, because I knew I had to call my own shots, and I knew I had to actually find some adventure in a way.  And I met all these different types of people.  And meeting this kid Matt, and I have a friend named Elvis [ph.] that I see a lot, and these are people that break social norms, you know.  They say things that in any other way would come across as crude, or offensive even.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) well, I'll clean it up (laughter).  My friend Elvis, I love hanging out with him, because he's just a character.  He talks--he's British.  He's a tall guy, he has like a voice of James Earl Jones.  And he walks into a room, and it's like people, you know, notice.  And he goes in--we go to, we'll go to an upscale party or we'll go to something like in the Bronx [New York, New York] or something, and people just kind of command respect physically.  But also like when he talks, he's just, you don't know what's coming out of his mouth.  And I have to be careful with him, actually.  If I have other--I have friends that just, they just don't get each other.  I'm always, like, with different types of people.  But for instance if you meet Elvis and you go out with him to a party or something--and you can meet like the head of like a school or something, or some socialite or something, and he's say, "Well, I'm an artist."  And they'll say, "Well, what do you paint?"  And he'll say, "I paint vaginas," and he'll go into like this whole thing about how he gets--and he actually gets people to come sit down and he paints everything.  But he'll tell somebody about these details, and he does it with such charm, you know, that it's actually kind of interesting to me, you know.  And it's like I've learned a lot.  The idea of like, artists like, artists break boundaries, you know, and they do--they sometimes lead the way and open the door for people to go on and do other things.  You know, they're the first to do something.  So, I'm very, like, open as far as like different things.  But I'm really like, you know, I have my line and stuff that, you know, I don't believe in like corrupting kids and things like that.  But I sometimes think that society is getting too, they have like thought police, and you can't say this and don't do that.  And I think there's room for everybody to say whatever they want, but you should have some kind of structure or form--that you know if you're going there, you're going to deal with that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's all I'm saying.  He's like that, Matt was crazy in a sense.  He used to like--just people that just--like, I always try to do what I need to do, because I don't have time to waste, you know.
Story_ID: 227274
Speaker 1: The outline says that you had your first work published in Newark [New Jersey] Star-Ledger in 1990.  What happened, what's the story?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York], and I started off in the bookstore.  And you know, like, but I knew--like, I took a summer internship at this--you know, let me think about it.  Because I think it was actually before I went to school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], or simultaneously when school was out.  It was a summer internship, and I worked with a woman named Bernadette Deshell [ph.].  She had recently moved to the Star-Ledger, I mean to The New York Times from the Star-Ledger.  But I learned in that time what happens with art, how it actually can be reproduced.  If you have a black and white drawing and it's very graphic, they shoot it and reproduce it one way.  Or, if you have something that's a wash, they do it dropout halftone.  You know, I learned a lot about what you paint is not exactly what's going to get printed when the final results come.  So I knew that would be the case, and I took that job specifically to see how things looks when it's printed, and to learn about the business of deadlines, because newspapers have some of the toughest deadlines.  You don't have, you know, any time to play around.  When they need it tomorrow at ten, the paper's going to get printed at 10:30, you know.  So, it taught me a lot.
Story_ID: 227275
Speaker 1: Working at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York], you said you started off in the gift shop? Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, initially I went in, because the School of Visual Arts [New York, New York], they have a job board, and there was something written down about the museum looking for someone.  I went in, and I had such a, I always had a good work ethic, I've always done that, any job I took.  And at a certain point, everybody was leaving the Guggenheim, because they were doing renovations and they didn't need all the departments.  Like, they were pretty much firing people every week, and it got to a point where either somebody quit or they got fired.  And it got to a point, being in the bookshop, that I had all the duties of the manager of the bookshop.  I would actually look at the inventory and order books, call up the company and say we need ten of these books, and I was doing all this stuff.  And working in the gift shop, it turned out eventually that it wasn't--like, sales is not really my thing so much.  It wasn't really like--at that time I didn't really--you know, I did it, but they found that I was better in the stock place.  And I was like--what you do when you have stock, you get a walkie-talkie, and you just go and you pretty much stock the shelves and all that, but there's a lot of freedom to it.  There were other people that abused it, meaning that, literally, if you wanted to, at that job, you could come in in the morning, get your walkie-talkie, put all the books on the shelf that need to be stocked, and then go down to another part where they're doing some construction and go to sleep, go to sleep for like eight hours and wake up, show your face and then leave, you know (laughter).  I didn't do that, you know.  I did, I was, sometimes I did, you know, I'd go out late, and I took a little nap, you know (laughter) because--but for the most part, I was really like very diligent.  And it came to the point where I just couldn't sit around.  So, I went and I would organize the stock for them.  I would actually take all the stuff and keep it really neat, so if somebody needs a certain book, I knew where it was.  And so what would happen is the people in the store would--like the manager would say, "Do you have that [Pablo] Picasso book?"  You know so-and-so, and someone else would say "No," you know, and I'd be like, "actually, I saw a copy of it."  And eventually they realized I knew where things were, and what was going on.  So I really, like, excelled in that job, because of just doing stuff, you know.  And eventually over time when the museum closed, one of the greatest things--like I feel really good that when they re-opened and I went back, the person--my interview was, "How have you been?"  And then they said, "When do you want to start?"  That's it, it wasn't--because they knew what I did before, how I worked before.  And I was going to go back into the gift shop, but the person, I think her name was Naomi Goldman, she said, "Well, security is paying eleven dollars an hour."  You know, and I'm like, "Oh, I'll do security."  So, and then it just went up from there, like it started there and it went up.
Speaker 1: Okay so, this is like 1993?
Speaker 2: That's about--
Speaker 1: --two [1992], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227276
Speaker 1: Now meanwhile, in terms of your schooling, now did you--who influenced you the most in school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: New York City [New York, New York] influenced me the most in school.  Because quite honestly, I was not a good art student.  I really just wanted to get out of the town, and I was excited.  And I went to the classes and I did my drawings and things like that, but I was not really good at the deadlines, and coming in each week with my work.  But--
Speaker 1: These are class assignments I think you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'd give me assignments.  And you know, it wasn't--looking at myself now and looking at myself then, I knew that I could have really like applied myself more, as far as like the structure of the school.  My education was more so like going out and learning the city and meeting people, and knowing New York, and learning different things about human nature, you know.  So I mean, that was really the best education, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said you weren't really a very good student as such?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew, I knew just--I've been painting since I was very young.  And like I said, about twelve, I started painting with professional materials.  A lot of the kids that came in the first year, they didn't even, they never painted before, they always drew.  And so, I was pretty advanced as a painter, you know, and I could go through the classes and do what I needed to do.  But you know what you can do, and you know what people look at and you think might be impressed by.  But you know in your heart what you can do; you can go a lot further.  But it wasn't the time for that.
Story_ID: 227277
Speaker 1: Now it says here that you started like freelancing I guess in 1993?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, as soon as I got out of school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you earned a B.F.A., right from--? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, at that point--because you got to understand, when I was a kid, very young, I thought I wanted to be an artist.  I had no idea, I didn't even know about illustration, or about what an illustrator is or about, you know, the other fields you can go into.  So, it's kind of at a crossroads there: do I go into a fine art career, or do I go into a career of commercial art?  And I knew I could paint quickly, and I knew I could get likenesses of people, so I decided to go into commercial work.  Because like I said, my friend Matt [Layden] was a fine art major, and I've seen him doing heroin and all this.  And I'm like, the fine art world seemed to me like it would just be kind of a horrible place if you're not there mentally, if you're not ready for it, because it sometimes comes into--more so like entertainment than art.  People are more interested in a crazy, destructive artist than they are about somebody trying to make a statement or trying to change something, or leave something for society to look back on a hundred years from now, you know.  I think most artists forget that, and most--and I'm not talking about painters; I'm talking about actors, everything.  It's like I think about my father [Gerard Christie], and he starts telling me about Errol Flynn and all them.  And I mean, Errol Flynn is the Brad Pitt of today.  If you ask somebody who Errol Flynn is now, you know, who--they don't care.  But it's just like that; it's always been like that, and it's going to be like that.  You have people in a certain time period, and they document a certain time, and that's why they're important, in a way.  And then later on as you get into, like, generations, people might come back and visit something in a nostalgic way, but you can't let your success go to your head while you're experiencing it, you know, because generations change.
Story_ID: 227278
Speaker 1: As to the point about the entertainment aspect of--now were you, do you remember--I remember hearing a lecture by [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] about [Jean-Michel] Basquiat; I guess I'm pronouncing it right.
Speaker 2: Basquiat.
Speaker 1: Basquiat, yeah, here in New York [New York].  And he was basically doing graffiti on refrigerators and appliances and things.  And it seems kind of--they even made a movie ['Basquiat']; there's been an independent film--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Julian Schnabel, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Is this what you mean in terms of the entertainment value of artists, rather than so much--
Speaker 2: Even beyond Basquiat--take Jackson Pollock getting invited to--by Peggy Guggenheim to like a really ritzy party, all the socialites in that time period.  It's his big moment, and he gets drunk and he goes and he pees in the fireplace.  The thing is, it's like, that's legend, you know, it's like this man is kind of like putting his middle finger up to everyone around him and being rebellious.  And sometimes people get to the point where they want to see somebody that's crazy or going to do, you know--like I told you about my friend Elvis [ph.], and I talk about Darnell [Lloyd (ph.)]--these are people that in some ways I'm just enamored.  I'm enamored by the way they kind of can break the rules of society--the social norms of how a person is supposed to act, but do it in a way that's very eloquent, you know, that it's not--that it keeps your attention in a way, and they're breaking boundaries.  But I consider myself, I've always been very serious about what I do.  And I keep a balance, where I do things that are interesting, but like, I like to travel, along with my painting and things like that.  And I like to just meet different people; I don't stay in some circle; I don't like align myself to any particular group or country or anything.  I just kind of go around and learn different things, you know.  But entertainment is more so like I'm saying, like, you're just doing something because somebody thinks it's--that you're, you know, you're interesting enough, and so I'm going to keep buying your work.  But it's not necessarily about--the work is really good or substantial, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The only way you can tell is when everyone is dead and it's just the work.  That's the only way you can really tell if something is great or it's not.
Speaker 1: I'm not so sure that's--
Speaker 2: I think it's true.  Because when you're around and you can sit and talk a game, and say, you know, I've done--look at the dog and pony show, and this pony has to trot this way, and you have a phone book catalog of all the different ideas and crazy things you can come up with--that's not going to matter to somebody that goes a hundred years later.  The art collectors are dead, and everyone is--you know, it's just the work is there, and somebody's looking at it.  And that's what matters; that's what's going to kind of relate to people or not, you know.  And it's not everybody, you know, everyone makes the artist, kind of. It's an individual thing, but it's a collective individual thing.

Speaker 1: I think we're at the point where we can talk about your first children's book ['The Palm of My Heart: Poetry by African American Children'].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, tell us about that.  How did that come about?  Now, you were working as a commercial artist--
Speaker 2: You could--no.
Speaker 1: --doing freelancing--
Speaker 2: This is a really, really, important aspect of what I've done career-wise.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I came to New York [New York], I saw the system set up.  I saw the way things are, and I realized that I have to go with my own approach.  Because the way--this, the way I'm saying, it's like, it's kind of like, what happened when I first got to New York, I didn't know anybody.  I got here from New Jersey, a small town called Scotch Plains, New Jersey.  I got to New York and, you know, it was like a culture shock in a way, because as a kid I didn't really, like, go out that much; I drew a lot.  The weekends were spent at home, I was with my mom [Ludria St. Amant Christie].  My brothers [Gerard Thaddeus Christie and Corneilus Marshall Christie] used to go out a lot, and I'd be home drawing and watching TV.  So, being social is something I had to learn; I had to learn, you know.  I would say fifteen years ago, I wouldn't even be able to talk to you and really get everything out the way I'm trying.  And I'm doing the best I can now, but I'm just saying, it's something I had to learn.  The same way that people have to learn to draw if they want to pursue it, I have to learn to communicate with words.  So, you know, it would be like we were doing this interview with just sketch pads, and you draw something and I answer it back from the sketch.  You can do that, then you understand how it is for me, you know.  So, the first thing that happened when I got to New York was I took the slides that I used to get into art school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], and I went to a nightclub called Nell's [New York, New York].  And I showed the manager, and he said, "Oh man, we could do slideshows, you know."  And I asked him about it, so I started showing my art each week while people were there, like Thursday nights when the place was packed.  I would show my work, and it became a hit.  People were so shocked to see art, in a nightclub, you know, but it was an upscale place with like Louis XVI furniture.  You'd have stockbrokers, and you'd have kids from the Bronx [New York, New York], you know, and it was really good.  It was two levels, one with live music and one down at the bottom.  And eventually, like, other people started to, you know, like it, and then they made me in charge of curating slideshows, you know.  And then I got be a part of a party called Funky Buddha, you know.  And you know, I actually had a guest list, you know, and I started to like incorporate the world I'm in with this nightlife world, that I'm, you know, learning about.  And I'd invite people like Thomas Krens, like, the director of the [Solomon R. Guggenheim] Museum [New York, New York].  I invited him to the parties, and I invited people I knew.  Like, you know, working in a museum, I'd got in contact with a lot of European people.  I worked in the checkrooms, so I met people, and I'd invite them.  If you don't have anywhere to go tonight, I'll put you on the guest list.  So, what happened is when people would come to the party, they'd be getting out of limousines, and you know.  And Thomas Krens would call.  One time he called and said, "Oh," you know, "what time is the party tonight?" And "I'm the director of, you know, the Guggenheim."  So the people, you know, these are kids throwing a party, and they're impressed.  They're like "How do you know Thomas Krens?"
Speaker 1: Now the Funky Buddha is a club?
Speaker 2: Funky Buddha was a party at Nell's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it went on for several years.  And everyone that was throwing the party--
Speaker 1: So, a certain night or something they would have Funky Buddha?
Speaker 2: Wednesday nights.  I think it was Tuesday, and it was probably Wednesday, if I remember.  I've got all the flyers and all that stuff; I've kept like a record of it.  But it's an important part of like how I do things.
Story_ID: 227280
Speaker 1: New York [New York] at that time--everything was down in SoHo [Manhattan, New York, New York], so I could go into any art gallery.  And people were so excited about art; they weren't the way they are now.  Like if I go to Chelsea [Manhattan, New York, New York] now, the difference between then and now is, like, back then I'd walk into an art gallery and somebody would be there.  They'd welcome you in, they'd find out about you, then they'd actually show your art, and they'd start talking to you about their artists, and they'd be really excited about it.  I go to Chelsea now--there's a desk, and it's really cold spaces.  Someone just keeps their head down, writing or typing, they don't even acknowledge you.  And it's just very, like, I don't know, it's just homogenous.  There's no mix of cultures in a lot of places I go.  And so, that's the change, you know.  And I feel like that's just a wall that I don't have the time to climb.  I'm going to find other ways, and other people who are interested, and find other doors to go through.  Because it's just like what we were speaking about before, you know, about sometimes people don't understand art right away, and that's the thing.  There's tons, I know there's tons of people that are painting and drawing somewhere, and they're not going to get discovered until a few generations later.  And it's not just going to be about money; it's going to be about something that this person has done that's kind of touched a certain--another person, because that's the whole process of art.  It's not just, it's not just like painting something and then just, you know, keeping it to yourself.  You can do it because you have a love of it, but the painting process is not complete until someone sees it, you know.  You paint it, you create it.  Someone listens to it, sees it, experiences it, and then there's kind of like a collaboration, or there's even like an emotional response, you know.  And doing kids books gives me an opportunity to put my work out to the masses, you know, and it helps to create cultural awareness to everybody.  And if I just went into fine art--you were talking about me doing whatever--a fifteen foot painting and giving it right to an institution that puts it in storage until they do a show--think how many people don't really feel the impact.  There are people that see paintings that cry, read books that cry, you know, and listen to music and decide I'm going to become this, I'm going to do that, you know.  So, I mean, if you just lock things away because it goes to somebody wealthy or someone with money--money corrupts a lot of things.  I went into commercial art in order to kind of build some kind of capital, you know, to have like some base that I can just do what I want, and keep my paintings pure.
Story_ID: 227281
Speaker 1: So, going into the nightclubs, getting back to that, it was a way to kind of deal with New York on another level.  I saw all types of people in New York [New York].  This is common--this is common knowledge, my first roommate in college was gay.  That was an issue I didn't want to deal with.  I never, I had a friend when I was in Scotch Plains [New Jersey] who was just a guy in the neighborhood.  Everyone knew he was gay, but he was cool, you know, no problems.  When I got to art school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], the idea of living with somebody in the same room--that made me think about things.  And I'm like, well, what kind of person--I know who I think I am, but am I the kind of person who would shut my back on someone because they're different than me?  I don't want, I grew up and I had people do that to me.  You know, I was different, and I realized I'm not going to be that person.  And I went down for that in art school, 'cause some people knew about it, and then they're questioning me.  And I've become very open, whatever.  People can do what they want, but like I said, they should have their own--I mean like you should just know--like, you know what I mean?  Like I was saying, there shouldn't be like censorship.  People should be who they want to be, do what they want to do, but I don't feel like, you know, everyone needs to be exposed to it.
Story_ID: 227282
Speaker 1: What would happen if Jackson Pollock, say, visited your mother's [Ludria St. Amant Christie] house and peed in the fireplace (laughter)?
Speaker 2: My house (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Right, right, I'm just, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Can we--on one level, you know, I don't know--what--do you get where I'm coming from?
Speaker 2: That's, that's, it's too, it's too--the question's too--in what context?  You mean like if there's an art opening and he comes--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the context that a guy does something--
Speaker 2: --or he just comes and pees in my--
Speaker 1: Like, he's doing something that's breaking the rules and stuff like that, but he's in a place where a lot of people are rich, and there's some level of expectation that the artist is going to do something wild, and he does it.  But if he came to visit your family and did that, I mean, would it be, would he be received--you'd say, oh, wow, I'll tell this story the rest of--you know.
Speaker 2: No, in my family, probably he'd have to hit the door, you know.  I'd put him out, you know.  But, but, the thing about it is I actually, I do the best I can to check people out before I invite them into my life.  That's what I'm saying, I have different types of friends.  I got friends that are very conservative, and then I got friends that, you know, are not conservative, you know, at the opposite end.  I couldn't have like a dinner party with these people, because it would just, they would not--the only link would be me.  But I don't think they'd really get along, based on just knowing who they are.  And so, I'm careful about bringing people together in different aspects, because I just don't, I don't like that conflict, you know.  And I don't know, it takes time for people to kind of understand where people are coming from, that's what I'm saying.  Like, having a gay roommate showed me like--New York [New York], there's a whole world in New York that people don't even know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the same thing happened, like, friends that are socialites.  That's a whole world, too, with social pressures.  I start to really, like--like when you just posed that question to me, I'm not going to react right away.  I'm going to beat his butt, you know, I'm going to kick him out, you know.  I have to know what--I try to think about why somebody--what's their motivation for doing the wrong thing, or what I consider to be the wrong thing, or the right thing, you know?  I try to figure out who a person is, and that's so I can actually--I bring that to my art.  I take that and try to create emotional impacts, you know, so people actually can look at something and kind of say, wow, that's a painting of my grandmother, my grandmother looked like that.  Or, she used to comb her hair like that, you know.  It's because I try to get to know people, you know.  And even sometimes just talking to them for a few minutes, I get a feeling--I can sometimes look at somebody and know if they have a lot of pain in their life, you know.  Because I had a friend, and at one time he was a street guy; he was in jail a lot.  And he told me, "Oh, thugs recognize thugs."  Well, somebody with pain recognizes someone else with pain.  And people recognize things in themselves and other people, you know.  And that's how like someone can look at a painting or listen to music and really relate to something.
Story_ID: 227283
Speaker 1: How did you develop your own particular style?  I mean it seems like a simple question, I mean, why not have your own particular style?  But, did you--when you started art school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], were you painting the way you paint now?  Or was it--
Speaker 2: You know what--
Speaker 1: How were you--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  We're getting back to the--oh, real quickly, the thing with the nightclub [Nell's, New York, New York] situation--that led me to a book.  Because, you know, I did my first kids books out of these nightclub experiences, because I did a record cover for a jazz funk group.  I would have never met this group if I didn't go to this party that a DJ invited me to.  You know, the DJ's name was DJ Swingsett.  He's, like most of my friends, it's good to see them excel.  Everyone, some of them excelled in ways I wouldn't do, and you know, a lot of acquaintances did well and all of that.  But the thing about him, he had told me, "Oh, your work is great.  You should come to a party tonight."  And it was for Zapp, and also like Justice System.
Speaker 1: Zapp, out of--
Speaker 2: Zapp. You know, the older--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're from my hometown [Hamilton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh, they are?  Yeah, that's cool.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Zapp, Roger Troutman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Roger Troutman, Zapp, yeah.  So, they were the opening act.  And when Justice System was coming down--Justice was the opening act for Zapp.  When they were coming down from the stage going to the dressing room, I stopped one of them, showed them a color copy of one of my paintings, and said, "Oh, you know, I just want to show you my work."  I told them it was a great show, and showed him my work.  The next thing I know, the guy pulled me, and he said, "Oh, you've got to come to the dressing room and meet the manager."  I met the manager and he said, "You know what, when we get signed, we're going to use you for the cover."  And it took some time, but they called me, and I was with my, one of my first jobs.  And I'm saying, the orthodox way is for me to go MCA Records, send in my postcard--someone might like it, might not--and they'll probably put me in a file.  And--that's what I'm saying, the system is set up in a way like art doesn't really get out to people the way it should.  So, I've decided to go in this backdoor, find a new way, find another way, you know, don't always think in the way of what's set up; find a way that's better for you.  So, to actually meet the band and get things set up that way--that helped me to get into this first album cover.  And it was a picture of a little boy on a fence with a saxophone, like he was just sitting down and kind of looking--and that painting has a lot to do with how I used to spend my childhood.  All that stuff I told you about, the archery, you notice I'm not saying I played soccer; I did solitary things.  I did things to keep my own mind stimulated.  And, you know, so that painting is more about my own kind of idea of like as a child having a love of something.  This child in this painting is looking at a saxophone, and he's like holding it like it's a lifeline.  But it's actually drawn in a way with lines and paint that actually makes it look like it's not really there.  So, he's aspiring to get this saxophone; he's aspiring to whatever is going to happen to him in the future.  And the background is like tenements, and like projects in the background.  So, that's where he comes from, and this is what he wants, and it's a different approach to what they had in mind.  They said--the album cover is called 'Summer in the City,' [Justice System] so they're thinking, Ernie [Eugene] Barnes [Jr.], you know: "We want you to put people in, you know, cityscape.  We want like people dancing, like a block party."  You know, that's summer to them.  But, to me, summer is that, you know.
Story_ID: 227284
Speaker 1: That [album] cover ['Summer in the City,' Justice System], like, had such an emotional pull, and had such an emotional kind of edge to it that Lee & Low Books [New York, New York] asked me to do a book of poetry written by children ['The Palm of My Heart: Poetry by African American Children'], to just interpret the poems in painting form.  So, I'm telling you it was a terror.  I got the job, and I was excited that it was a children's book.  I hadn't even planned to go into kids books; it just was thrown on my desk and I took it and I did it.  And the terror came about because I didn't know what I was--how I was going to paint a whole book.  And I just took it and didn't think about it, and just started to just paint.  And I came up with these kind of elongated necks.  Because at first I started going back to Renaissance painting, like I thought I would do something very realistic.  Because my heroes were the books that I had recently seen with Jerry Pinkney, you know, Tom Feelings.  I started to see, like, people that would do realism, and I thought, well, that's how you do a kids book.  But I decided to just do something different, just something interesting.  And one of the first paintings was this painting which I won't sell.  I actually took it down, but it's called 'Black Hands.'  And it's a woman with an elongated neck, and her hands are like almost grotesque.  And the thing is that that painting was the bridge for, it was the door that opened me up to doing kids books, because that painting like helped me do the rest of the book.  I didn't know what I was going to do.  And I figured if I could do something this weird-looking, like this woman with a skinny neck, and hands that are like about the size of a torso, then I went past the boundary, and I can do anything I want now.  And so, that's when I started to do the other paintings in the book.  And I sometimes forget, like, it's the same: life and my paintings are the same.  The same way I talk about friends that intrigue me, that kind of push boundaries, sometimes I forget that you can push boundaries with my paintings.  Sometimes I start to go back into being a realistic painter, and making things look exactly like it should look, you know, in life.  But then I realize when I look at someone like [Pablo] Picasso or [Willem] de Kooning, or Ben Shahn--and I see these people breaking boundaries, and I realize I don't have to do a hand to proportion, I can just do whatever I want; I can even do a symbol of a hand.  Because in the end, the art is about communication, and it doesn't matter what kind of language you use, as long as you kind of can use a language that can be a bit universal, because you're not going to get everybody.  Not everyone is going to understand what you paint, because I'm telling you, like people get passionate about--like we were talking a little bit earlier about [Jean-Michel] Basquiat.  Not everybody is going to get what he is doing, or what he did.  But then, you know, there's always kind of like a history, and no one just comes out completely with something innovative.  I mean his work is very innovative for the time, but there's other people like [Jean] Dubuffett and Cy Twombly.  There's people that like try things that, you know, there's usually something you can look back on, and there's usually somewhere you can go back.  And it's like rungs in a ladder, you know, people climb it, and one generation reacts to the next with art, you know.
Story_ID: 227285
Speaker 1: You said at a certain point you got a chance to meet Tom Feelings and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, I don't know if you met Jerry Pinkney or not, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These guys are all--see they're--not only am I like inspired by their accomplishments, but also the people they are, and Tom Feelings--the people they were.  Like I said, you know, there's too much out now that I see.  There's people I see and they're successful, and they realize, they feel like, oh, we've got to screw people over, you've got to be a thug.  You don't have to.  These guys, you know, they're excelling in life; you can see the happiness in them.  And, and, they'll take time for everybody.  They listen to people and they try to help people.  And I know everyone's got demons, you know, everyone's got maybe something they don't show to the world.  But at the end of the day, these guys actually like, they're a pleasure to be around.  And I feel like I've come across two types of artists--the ones that just are like--they might have an insecurity in them, and they get to the point where they just want to be difficult.  You know, you give them all--they're going to give you an event, and they start demanding only green M&Ms in the hotel room (laughter), you know, silk sheets, and whatever.  And then they start tearing up the hotel room, or they complain, or they're nasty to people, "I'm not signing any books until they give me my champagne."  Or you get people that are--like I met Jacob Lawrence one time at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York].  I checked Jacob Lawrence's coat.  So, I mean like in that time, that man was nice.  He actually sat there, he talked.  He said, "Thank you very much."  You know, I told him how much I loved his work.  And it's like, you know, you've got these artists that are selfish and have a lot of childish insecurity, you know, crazy issues.  Or, you've got people that are kind of, just almost like when they pass away, the church is filled where people can't even get in, because that person was so kind, and not just the celebrity of it, but just that they're kind.
Story_ID: 227286
Speaker 1: Your work reminds me of--somewhat of Jacob Lawrence.  It's not, it's not like it's a rip-off of Jacob Lawrence or anything like that, but it does have a Jacob Lawrence kind of quality.  Or--it reminds me of Sargent [Claude] Johnson, too, an artist I know, in ways.  It's folksy in a way; it's got another kind of sophistication to it.
Speaker 2: Well, at this point, like, as a commercial artist, I take bits and pieces of different people and I put my own spin on it.  But I have not even tapped into--the world hasn't even seen anything yet, I'm just getting started.  The problem now at this point--this is a pivotal time in my life, because it's almost like, it's almost like, like in a way like--it's like if there's a book and there's a new chapter starting.  I can talk to you from my childhood to becoming, like, going to New York [New York].  That was when that person almost died.  That person--the memories there, but the thing that the person I was, changed.  And from that time, from being like in art school [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York] until I started to become pretty--my mother [Ludria St. Amant Christie] passed away--that's another period of life where I just can say that's a chapter.  And then from that time of her passing--her passing away was actually the catalyst for me to be a freelancer.  Because at the time, I was doing dual things.  I was working at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim Museum [New York, New York], and I was illustrating.  And I've always learned to be humble.  Over the time of, like I said, these things that--when I was a kid, I learned not to really brag about stuff, and just be humble; just do what you've got to do and keep doing it, and keep going.  Just look up, enjoy it, and then put your head back down and start getting back to business, you know.  And so when I was at the museum, it would be like--something like the cover of the Village Voice would have a painting on it, and everyone knew it was me.  And sometimes people would get jealous at the museum, you know, and they made my job a bit harder.  But when--I drew the line when the Guggenheim wouldn't let me go see my deathbed mother, you know.  My mother was on her deathbed, and she had moved to Louisiana.  Because I found that rich, poor, black, white--everybody goes home when they're in trouble.  That's her home, she went home.  I had a lot of things to deal with at that time.
Story_ID: 227287
Speaker 1: --Was she [Christie's mother, Ludria St. Amant Christie] sick a long time?
Speaker 2: One year, she had cancer.  And it's like, you know, you get to the point where you have to like, you know, it just--you know, that was like, I loved working at that museum; I did love the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York].  You know, and--but I didn't, I didn't like the institution of the art world.  I didn't like, like seeing art openings and seeing two black people there, and that one black person walking around alone, and all the wealth and--you know, if I wasn't an artist, I'd be an anthropologist.  And in a way, I'm kind of like, I don't know, like an amateur one in a way.  I just kind of like to study people and look at social classes, and rich and poor, and this and that; I like to observe people.  And the museum was, that's really like terrible, but they played games when it was time.  And it got to the point I gave my ultimatum.  This woman, I was told straight up, "Well, I guess it's between your job and your mother."  What do you think I'm going to do?  You know, so I left, I left.  And then they called me back.  I guess somebody came to their senses and said, "Oh, you can come back," or "no, it's not like that."  So, I came back and I stayed there for one day.  I was in a gallery, you know. I wasn't working in the coat check, I was in a gallery, and I just couldn't even--I just was so angry, you know.  She didn't pass away yet, but I went to go see her, and I came back.  And then, you know, I just said, screw this--I left, I quit.  I went down--she passed away, and then a lot of other stuff happened, you know.  But when that happened, when she passed--you know, anytime you lose a parent, you realize your mortality, you know.  And so, that's when it came to the point where I said, you know, I'm going to go and do what I need to do in life.  And in a way, it's a strange thing to hear, but some people will understand that it's a freedom in a way, when you have somebody like that's that close to you, and she's gone.  You know, to be honest with you, in this world, that was the only person I ever felt I owed an obligation to, you know.  Other than that, it became about me; I owed an obligation to myself in order to help other people, you know.  But I think of myself first.  I'm not going to sit here and say I don't.  I think about my health, my mental health, and my physical health, you know.
Story_ID: 227288
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Ludria St. Amant Christie and Gerard Christie] have any trepidation about you becoming an artist at all?
Speaker 2: No, nobody could ever stop me from that.  It didn't matter what anybody would have told me.
Speaker 1: They didn't, they didn't think, well, why don't you try something else, or--
Speaker 2: No, because I'm telling you, it was such a strong thing as a child; all I did was draw.  When people were going out in high school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] and, you know, there was a party this weekend, I stayed home and drew, I drew and painted.  So, that's what I'm saying.  When I got to art school [School of Visual Art, New York, New York], it wasn't--I had teachers asking me, "How did you do that?" (Laughter) Because I experimented, like took paints and scratched it, and all this stuff, you know.  It wasn't just painting, it was like breaking the rules of painting, you know, because I didn't even know the rules.  I learned the rules later, actually, because I decided--I didn't pee away art school (laughter), you know, but I could have done, you know, learned more about other people's techniques.  So, recently it was about three years ago, I took a--this guy teaches out of his brownstone; he actually helps people learn about oil painting.  And that's where some of the paintings I've done recently, some of them are realistic.  They're like along the lines of like [Diego] Velazquez, or trying to do what Rembrandt's doing, you know.  But see, that's a lifelong pursuit.  Like, when you're painting and you say I want to be a realistic painter, it takes a long time to kind of really get it, you know.  But it's the same thing I have with illustrators and with realistic painters.  They create this parameter, and they break it in the way of maybe the subject matter, I feel.  But as far as like the technique, they're really bound to, like a procedure, and that's not what my painting's about.  I kind of paint the way people might decorate a room or something.  That's how my compositions come about.  I don't, I don't sketch everything out and decide.  I kind of paint something and then I have to paint something that's going to react to it, next to it.  So, I just start to build it kind of the same ways when I try to explain to people when they don't paint.  It's the same way you go into a room and--I'm going to put the couch here, and then the night stand goes there.  That's how I compose a painting.  I start with--I know the main thing has to be set, and that's usually the face, that's developed the most.  And then from there, I start to just go about it.  And then you deal with color theory.  You think about what's going to kind of relate.  And you don't have to stick to hard, steadfast rules, but you know if you have a green, you could maybe do like a pink or a red, because they complement each other.
Story_ID: 227289
Speaker 1: You've been painting in a number of different styles apparently, and have a--
Speaker 2: But see--
Speaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's the thing.  Like, it's all preparation for this July.  Why I was saying about--it's a pivotal time, because I'm really going to pursue a fine art career at this point.  And even if galleries don't get it, or don't accept me, I still have a base of doing the commercial art.  And that's the plan, it was a supplemental fine art career.  And the appeal about fine art is that I really--I really want to be in history books.  I want people to really value my work.  I don't want my work to end up like in somebody's attic or in some secondhand shop, and then down the road.  You know, the thing about the ugly side of art is that you do need money.  It's attached to it, because that's what people start to value.  They value it so much that they'll do anything for it.
Story_ID: 227290
Speaker 1: We were talking about the fine art world off-camera there--so the difference between being involved in fine arts.  And you were saying you've got to be strategic about how you--
Speaker 2: I can only be strategic up to a certain point, because it does come to, eventually comes to your collectors, you know.  But I'm taking my time to observe and kind of look at the world of art.  And I realize, too, that if you tell people, can you name five artists from the '50s [1950s]--they're going to tell you, you know, like we were speaking about before, like they might say Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, they'll go on.  If you say five illustrators, the best you can do is Norman Rockwell. And then most of the public doesn't know; that is--that appeals to me, the idea that you can be in history books and people can actually say this person documented this time, and it's important what they had to say, you know.  And to me, it's, I'm not saying that I'm trying to diminish my accomplishments, but it can be equated sometimes for me--like you have soap opera actors, or you have a theater actor, you know.  And it's very important what I'm doing, in the sense of like trying to promote cultural awareness.  That's why I really--I'm glad my career took a turnabout going in to do kids' books, because it's a way for me to actually put out stories about people that most people may not even know.  I really stick to historical books or books about culture, because I find that, like I was saying before, I like going to different places, and I like being around different people and having different ideas.
Story_ID: 227291
Speaker 1: In terms of the cultural and history books, what was your first, what was the first one you did, and how did you get involved in that project?
Speaker 2: Well, the first one was 'The Palm of my Heart[: Poetry by African American Children'].  It's a book of fourteen children from Minnesota.  It's poetry by African American children, but the forward is written by Lucille--the introduction is written by Lucille Clifton.
Speaker 1: Of Baltimore [Maryland], yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And she talks about the word black and the idea that when she was growing up, if you were called black, or you called someone black, it's fighting words, and how it relates, and what it means to these kids to write poems about black, and what black means to them, and black being themselves.  So, the first book right away kind of pushed the envelope a little bit.  Because people might say, "We want to teach kids that call themselves black that they're African American."  But these kids are defining themselves beyond just the word black.  Because the way--the editor [Davida Adedjouma] was a teacher of an afterschool program, and she'd tell me her process was to question them, to have them write five words and say, like, "Who are you?"  And usually somebody would say, "I'm," you know, a lot of times they would just put down different things.  Sometimes they wouldn't even put their name, she found.  But if they put down, "I'm Greg, I'm an artist, I'm Brooklyn [New York, New York]," she would start to write a poem, where she'd be like, "black is Greg, and Greg is an artist, and Brooklyn is an art," something like that, you know.  And these were, the poems were that simple, because that's how the process was--questions that turned into like elongated expansions of ideas of poems, simple poems.  So I got to actually paint based on each--each poem, and that was great for me.  Coming as a commercial artist that worked on magazine articles, it was, that was perfect for me for my first book.  It was a book to almost take each poem and consider it to be like an article, and just kind of really interpret whatever it was that I'd want to get the essence of that particular poem, and kind of paint that.  The next book was a bit harder.  It was 'Richard Wright and the Library Card' [William Miller].  Because I didn't know--like now, that's like the first time someone's given me a manuscript; it's Lee & Low Books [New York, New York].  And Lee & Low is saying, "Okay, why don't you do a book on Richard Wright?"  Richard Wright is a real person.
Story_ID: 227292
Speaker 1: So the book ['The Palm of My Heart: Poetry By African American Children'], the Lucille Clifton book, grew out of the [Justice System] album cover, right?
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: That--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, did they--did you have a chance to talk to Lucille Clifton and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --was she still around?
Speaker 2: That's one thing people should know about children's books; the collaboration is actually done in separate camps.  You don't really necessarily call up an author, and say, "What color is it going," it's not.  It's a collaboration, but it's based solely on the work.  It kind of keeps it pure, to me.  I think it's a good idea to kind of just focus in on the work, and not the stories and not the ideas that they have about how it should be.  Because everyone's an artist, everyone's on a certain level, and they should be able to do what they need to do, to a degree.  And the editor takes the chance and takes the, like, the administrative duty to kind of make sure everything lines up; that's why she's hired.  I'm hired to do the paintings, and they're hired to do the writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you wouldn't want necessarily to meet the author, and have the author come over every day (laughter).
Speaker 2: Would anyone (laughter)? I mean, I recently--like, the last few books have been--because, you know, you've got to survive, and I can't wait for them to call me to do a book.  So now, I'm coming up ideas and going to people that I know, and saying, why don't we pitch a book to Random House [New York, New York], or pitch a book to Penguin [Group; Penguin Random House]?  You know, because like I said, it's really, like art's not a field where you can definitely make money.  But if you really get, if you--anything you do, if you really push at it and the talent is there, you can have some kind of success.
Story_ID: 227293
Speaker 1: Now, did you have to get an agent?  You know, once you did the second book ['Richard Wright and the Library Card,' William Miller], now did you think, well, now I need an agent.
Speaker 2: Well, no. During that time I had an agent. I started out--because like I said, in that time I was a pretty shy person. And also, I fell in over my head.  So I had an agent in the beginning, but the kids' books came from me, you know like I said, doing that [Justice System] album cover. That album cover wasn't through an agent, but I really wanted an agent when I first started.  So, so, what ended up happening with the--I started to get this together. I got a job on my own, then I went to the, I went to the--sorry, I lost my train of thought. I went, I got a job on my own, and from there I went to the agent that I wanted to represent me and I said, "Look, I have,"  I pretty much knew how I could handle it.  But I actually said to her, "I really need your advice on this particular," and she started to see, "oh, this guy is making money. I should--," you know. Because sometimes people see stuff and they don't really know how to, if they can market your work or whatever. I suggest you go out and do it yourself, and then go back to the person that you want to do business with and say, "Look at what I've done. Can you give me any advice?" If they see you come back enough, eventually they're going to want to put some money in their pocket, too. So, that's how I got an agent. It turned out not to work out for me, because then I didn't like the fact that the checks went to them, and the checks came whenever they came and it wasn't like they were supposed to come, and things weren't right right now. And I didn't want to hear all that; I wanted to get paid, you know.  And I decided that I would get a different agent, but then I started off with doing kids' books and things like that, you know.  With my second agent, I decided that I did not want to like get caught into like a situation.
Story_ID: 227294
Speaker 1: You got to a point where you tried to make a new deal with an agent, and--
Speaker 2: Right.  When I went, when I went into my second agent, it was called Gerald & Cullen Rapp [Inc., New York, New York], I went to like the best I could go to.  But I had it in my mind, I don't want them to do the kids' books just yet, so they would just handle the editorial work, because I wanted to get magazine work and advertising.  So they started to do all that, and it went well.  But then when the kids' books started to come into play, I felt like they weren't even going out and getting magazine work anymore.  So, that abated so far down.  And the thing about the children's books is that--I'd done so many signings and had so many lunch meetings with publishers--that I had to contact it.  It's a matter of, today, if I wrote a manuscript, I could call up someone today and call up about fifteen different editors and then I can get a book published, you know.  And my agents don't have the contacts for that.  They only have contacts mainly for, they're not--and even it came to the point where they were asking me about the deal.  And I'm saying, "Oh, ask for twenty thousand and they'll give you eighteen."  I mean I just knew, I knew the business, you know.  So, it didn't make sense, you know.  And where I did have a mistake--early on in my career, I tried to do a job like with a clothing company, and it just went so awry, it went wrong.  And it was a popular one, but the problem was with that company is I felt like they tried to rip me off or something, and things just went sour.  But the problem was, there were two people, and I found that it's better if I just think for myself, or let somebody just completely handle something.  But it's not in my nature to let anybody just handle my business, you know.  So, I found that I'd do better just doing my own thing and promoting myself and doing--and it doesn't matter; I don't judge by how much money's coming in.  Success is that I'm actually healthy and I'm happy and I'm alive, and I'm doing what I want in life.  If I want to sleep all day, I can sleep all day.  If I want to go take a trip to Brazil, I can go do that.  I really feel like I'm in control of my life.  And if nothing else happens from this point on, I have success in the sense of like I'm feeling good about life, you know.  So, I mean it's always a balance, and that's why, you know, it's like this is something that's going to be documented.  I don't want to embarrass my family, I don't want to embarrass, you know, anyone in the past.  You know, every family has issues, but I learned not to even dwell on any.  You've got to look at the positive stuff to keep going forward, you know, and you just deal with life.  You know, life it's not--I don't think it's meant to just be full of good moments; you learn from the bad stuff that happens, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so, that's why these days I'm just, I'm really at this point representing myself, and I'm also really observant, and I'm looking at the whole system of the art world.  And I realize for myself, I realize I've got to get out of this country.
Story_ID: 227295
Speaker 1: You've illustrated like a book ['Only Passing Through: The Story of Sojourner Truth,' Anne Rockwell] on Sojourner Truth, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you collaborated I think with the same author on a book on the Haitian Revolution?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Open the Door to Liberty! [A Biography of Toussaint L'Ouverture'],' Houghton Mifflin [Harcourt] with Anne Rockwell. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, and, you know, in talking to you about these books, you really know the subject; you know a lot about the subject.  And you know--
Speaker 2: I could always learn more.  I know what I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was good, I just thought it was good.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: It made me feel good to hear you talk about it.
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you.  Like, this is a reaction to what I was talking about earlier.  You're young, and you don't even know about these historical people, and you're a person--you don't even know your own self.  You don't even know about--and it's not even just you.  You can't even just say this is American history without considering what was going on in Europe, or what was going on in--and you can't worry about what's going on in Europe if you don't know what's going on in Africa, you know.  I can't name all the countries in Africa, you know, but I know most of the countries in Europe.  It's like I didn't learn anything about Africa.  I didn't learn anything about any of those countries, and I didn't learn anything about the history.  And it's like--it's important.  People don't realize it now; they're not realizing that what you're doing is documenting the times.  And if it means it's a hip hop song and it's degrading yourself, that's being documented.  Or, if you're writing a scholarly paper, you're writing a paper on, you know, out of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] or something--and if you're writing a thesis on certain issues, that's being documented.  So, what's going on is important, you know.  And I'm really thinking, I don't think about just today.  I think about the long-term, you know.  I don't forget the past, but I don't dwell on it.  And I think about the future, but I live in the present, but this is what is happening.  If you want to have a summation of my life, I lived in my future all of my childhood.  I didn't even have a childhood, really.  I thought about--from grammar school [St. Bartholomew Academy, Scotch Plains, New Jersey], I thought about getting into high school.  High school [Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, Scotch Plains, New Jersey] was horrible--I thought about getting into art school [School of Visual Art, New York, New York].  Things started to really feel like they were normal, or like I was in my kind of place when I got here to New York [New York].  And the thing is that, you know, it's just like different things--I lived a lot in the future in the past when I was a kid.  These days I live, if I travel, I really feel like I live in the present.  If I'm in another country, every time I get up, I have no idea what the day is going to bring me.  So, I love that feeling of just getting up--enjoying each day as it comes.
Story_ID: 227296
Speaker 1: Now, what is the concept of live painting?  I guess it's--is this--
Speaker 2: That comes from my, the nightclub days I used do from slideshows.  Eventually somebody asked me to do some live paintings.  There's a record company called Giant Step [New York, New York] records, and they were known for being innovative and bringing European talent to New York's [New York, New York] nightlife.  And I was asked by, it was some friends of the DJs, they told me, "Oh, you should go and show your work to Giant Step."  You know, "They have live painters."  And I showed my work to a woman named Ruth Bernstein [ph.] who was the sister of Maurice Bernstein, and he's one of the co-owners of Giant Step.  So, I started doing live painting.  And it goes to show you, you never know where things are going to lead.  I mean, I told friends about this opportunity because I've always been, I've never been selfish about ideas.  I'll tell anybody, you know, whatever, you know.  And I told them and they took the high road, and were kind of like, "Oh, I'm an artist, I'm not going to do a spectacle.  I'm not going to get on the stage and entertain people."  But from painting--live paintings--I ended up meeting people in Malaysia, one of like the wealthiest families in Malaysia.  I've been to Sweden to paint for a Grammy-nominated musician.  I've been over to London [England] where I got to meet Afrika Bambaataa and Carl Cox.  I mean it's just like something--people saw what I was doing, and asked me to come to other parts of the world to do it.  And when I started, I did it because I thought of that.  I thought well, maybe it's a good way to promote myself, and it's also something different than what has been set up for me to do--something different and something a bit more innovative for me to promote and get my work sold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's kind of a breakthrough for you to be doing live painting in public, when you're such a private kind of person.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: I guess it's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: But, you know, some parts of it, it tends to be a bit of a spectacle, you're just doing something.  And you can't--painting is a lot about light, and in a nightclub it's dark.  But even a great musician can sit there and play around on a trumpet or piano.  And people that don't paint, you know, or don't play the instrument, will be very, like, impressed.  But another musician may look and say, "Oh, man, come on, I know what you can do.  You're just playing games."  When I was doing live painting, I just did enough that people could recognize what was going on, and they got to see part of the process.  But then I would take the paintings back to the studio and really hit on it, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --knock it, you know, right and do it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 227297
Speaker 1: You're trying to make a comp--are you trying to make a complete transition to fine arts now?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No, because I have an obligation to keep putting out--and unfortunately in an ideal world I would love to just paint, to do what I want to do.  But the way it is, it's like I have people's attention, at least in the children's book world, you know.  And I'm thinking, just imagine how many people run to my kids' books.  If I become like a famous artist, they're going to run back and say, "Man, maybe we can see some of his thinking process.  He did these books."  You know, because even like Andy Warhol, he was a commercial artist before he was a fine artist.  And now people go and run and look at his commercial art, and maybe see if they can solve the puzzle, "How did he get from that to this?"  And unfortunately, most people would be interested because of money.  You know, money--it's a shame that I feel like I have to be--make money and become rich for people to just really see the value of a painting.  But that's part of the art game.  You know, it's kind of like if money's like attached to something, then sometimes people value it.  But in a way, it's just a way of human nature, I found, that people just value that.  But if you can get their attention with that, then you might bring them to something more positive--learn to love something just for the sake of learning it, you know, just so you can better yourself.
Story_ID: 227298
Speaker 1: Is there a connection--it would seem to me--now, I don't know.  But it seems to me like there would be--like some of the very rich illustrations that are in children's books would have an easy transition to fine art.  I mean what happens, say, if you paint pictures for a children's book, are they like owned by the publishing company and you can't sell the original?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Or you can't--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Well, how do you--
Speaker 2: You own the work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's two different worlds.  It's two different worlds, you know.  Children's books, it's really like a place where, you know, you do what you do.  But it's not like I can go to, like, Saatchi & Saatchi Gallery [sic. Saatchi Gallery, London, England] and say, "Oh, I've done eighteen kids' books and won awards."  They'll just say, "Oh, that's nice," you know, and that's that.  It's like the people that are in the two worlds are different, and it's like it's, you really have to go on this--I'm planning to go on this kind of dual road.  You know, I want to actually--but I know if things really kick off with the painting I still want to do books, but maybe not at the volume of books that I'm doing now.  I'm saying like one every year or every two years, but to have complete freedom to just--because the process of kids' books is a lot of sketches, you can't just paint whatever you want.  But I would love to do a book like that, maybe a book that's a bit challenging or something.  But I think if you're really well-known as a fine artist, they're not really going to tell you what you can and can't do for a kids' book, you know.  But I'll tell you, this is the shame of the world.  Because I mean like even Romare Bearden, I have the book over there.  It's, when he was alive, he approached the publishers to do a kids' book--they didn't accept him.  That's crazy to me.  You know, it's crazy that you have a famous guy like that that really has an impact on people, and he wants to do a book based on sketches he's done.  It's called like '[Li'l Dan,] The Drummer Boy [A Civil War Story],' or something like that.  And some idiot said, "No, no, we don't think this is going to work."  And that's what I'm saying, you've got to get--there's other doors.  Because there's too many people that stand as guardians in front of doors, you know.  And in the long run, it's going to help more people.  I'm trying to help people, you know.  It's not just lining my pockets.  I'm not going to say I don't like traveling and all that, but I've learned that you don't even have to make a lot of money to live wealthy, you know.  And I'm not talking about--I'm talking about just like having like a good education, a neighborhood you can walk in and you don't have to worry about things, you don't have any kind of government lying to you, you know.  I mean I've been to a lot of countries where I've found people that are very free in that way, you know.  And I've also been here, and I've been into apartments on Park Avenue and Central Park West [New York, New York], and I've been to a friend's flat in Germany, and I realize it's the same, the same people built these structures, you know.  And I think a lot of cities are forgetting this, New York [New York] especially.  Like, if you make things too expensive to live, you're going to push out all the artists and all the creative people.  And that's why people really have come to New York.  They didn't come just for these skyscrapers and all that.  They know that so many creative writers, dancers, artists have been here and have been drawn to this place, and have enhanced it in some way.  A corporate person is going to come and tear down a building.  An artist is going to look around and kind of say, "Well, we don't have to tear the whole thing down, we can just knock this wall down, and I've got a friend that can do a mural."  And before you know it, the place is hooked up, you know.  And you can't push out artists by making the quality of life too expensive--out of their reach.  And that's what I feel like has been happening.  That's one of the reasons why I'm making a move.
Story_ID: 227299
Speaker 1: In your illustrations you use acrylics.  You said gouache, right?
Speaker 2: Gouache.
Speaker 1: Gouache, gouache, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you said recently, too, I mean well, you said that you picked up oil painting for fine art, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So is that, is that where's it's going to go?  The oil will be the fine art now?
Speaker 2: I'm not, I'm not big on plans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm big on directions.  I've been taking this time for a long time.  All my life I've been studying art, studying the business of it, and actually the process of creating it.  So I know how to paint in oils, I know how to paint in acrylics, I know how to make handmade books, and I have a love of culture and people.  So, I don't know, these are the foundations.  I'm going to go and see what I can do with that, you know.  And the reason I work in acrylic and gouache in children's books and commercial work is because it's very, it's a medium that I have a real control over, and I know what is going to happen pretty much.  And if I just lay stuff out, it's done in about eight hours.  Most of my books, almost every painting in the book is done in about eight hours or overnight, you know.  So, I work pretty quickly.  Oil paints, you have to--it's not about that.  And also--
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that one illustration, eight hours, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One illustration is about eight hours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If not even a couple.  You know, when I work with gouache, it's even quicker.  Because acrylic, you have to kind of let it dry, and you have to like build up on it a little bit, do layers, not many, but layers in my technique.  But in gouache, you can actually just lay down something graphic and then paint on top of it, like--almost draw with paint on top of a field, an area of paint, and you can create something very quick that's finished.  And that one part of the painting is finished, and you just finish the other parts.  So with gouache I work even more quickly than with oil, I mean, with acrylic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 227300
Speaker 1: Your exhibits, when is the last time you exhibited your work?
Speaker 2: Last exhibit was in Ketchum, Idaho a couple of weeks ago.  I went to Ketchum to the Sun Valley Arts Center [sic. Sun Valley Center for the Arts, Ketchum, Idaho], and I was commissioned to do a mural.  And I did the mural, and it was about a ten by ten foot wall, and I did it in about four days, and I used acrylic.  I had to prepare the wall beforehand.  I didn't go there with a sketch in mind, I just kind of looked at the wall, looked at the area, and then started to paint.  And in the beginning I was kind of lost, and then I just kind of hit one part of the painting and then just started to just kind of develop that.  And before you know it, the whole thing was complete.
Speaker 1: Okay, four days.
Speaker 2: That's pretty quick for a mural.
Speaker 1: That is, that is.
Speaker 2: But I did it.  With me, it's like if I have to stay up all night or whatever, I'll do what I have to do.  And once I, and when I get into a painting, that's that--I don't want to stop usually.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: The main thing is that they really, they find the value of reading.  And even if you don't want to read, get an audio book and listen to it in your car when you're driving.  Just--because you can't let your history just be erased.  You can't let people like not--you know, like I say, I have all kinds of friends.  And one time I went down to Miami [Florida].  And this friend of mine, she's from Israel, I met her at the [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York] like almost ten years ago, but we kept in contact through e-mail.  So I showed her one of my recent books called 'Dear Mr. Rosenwald' [Carole Boston Weatherford].  And that book is about the Rosenwald Schools, and it's dealing with Julius Rosenwald, but it's in the context of a little girl that's talking about her community getting a Rosenwald School.  So it talks about peonism, and it talks about, you know, basically, like sharecroppers and that kind of lifestyle, and you know, kind of like the Jim Crow life and all that stuff.  That's history.  And she was reading the book and there was one part, one of the poems talks about one of the women, her mother's about to have a baby.  And she said in the poem--it's something along the lines of, "Oh, another mouth to feed.  I don't know how we're going to make it this season."  You know, because her father went out and had picked the land and toiled the land, and he came back with hardly any money.  So this girl like looked up--she's from Israel, like I said.  And she looked at me, and she's like, "Oh, this is terrible.  You can't give this for little kids.  You know, it's going to make them sad, and I don't think they should make books like this."  And her mother was there, and she said, "Oh, no, hold on, Sharon [ph.],"   she said, because we were debating.  You know, I'm telling her why it's important for these kind of books, because it's reality, that's what it is.  History is not all what people have made it to be.  It's--there's some harshness to it.  And she told Sharon, she said, "Well, what about us?  Think about the kids, how all of our kids have to go to school and learn Hebrew and learn about all the great things that Jewish people have done."  She said, "Look how they poke their chest out and say, 'Wow, my people did that.  I'm proud,'" you know.  And so she kind of got it, to that degree.  But like I'm saying, it's like, a lot of cultures know--you have to keep that--pass it down.  And I'm seeing it break down a lot.  I'm seeing like a lot of civility break down, like people just talking to people and respecting people in a way that it's not just about money.  And I try not to like point my fingers, because I look at myself, mainly.  I try to keep myself in check.  So, I just hope people learn now a way to understand their history, and learn about it and value it.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: When I think about, sometimes I think about relationships, you know.  I was in a serious one at one time, and maybe in that way I got a--like I learned lessons after it ended.  But I wish I would have known these lessons before, because you have two things.  You have your art that you love, and you have your dreams and aspirations, and then you have a road of like maybe raising a family, or really getting settled with somebody and building a dream together with someone, you know.  But I can't say I would do it differently, because I only knew what I knew up to that point.  After I finished the relationship, after things ended, then I walked away with a lesson, but with a painful one.  So, I can't say, you know, I wished for one thing, but reality is whatever it is, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of family, now do you have any children right now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you're looking forward to, are you looking forward to having a family?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I thought you were going to say children.  Well, I'm looking forward--I'm really, like, excited about my career more so now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think the rules have changed.  And for me personally, I really, I just, I have it inside of me that I want to pursue an art career and do this fine art, and paint, and take some time to see the world a bit as a single person.

Speaker 1: So, your father's [Gerard Christie] still alive now, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he's in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: He recently moved to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Are your brothers [Gerard Thaddeus Christie and Corneilus Marshall Christie] in Atlanta, or are they--
Speaker 2: They're in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So your relatives are basically kind of scattered, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, this--people sometimes say to me, "Oh, you know, you're brave," and this and that.  But it's like I don't really have--I have a career here, but I have a career that I can go.  The family's not as strong as it could be, and everything else, like relationships, kids, you know, and mortgages, none of that stuff I've really thought about whether I really want to do that.  You know, I'll wait it out.  Do I want to see the world, or do I want this?  Do I want to go here, or do I want that?  You know, and I really feel like at this point in my life, at this age, I really want to go and do this now.  And I want to be a gypsy, and it sounds crazy to people, but for me it makes perfect sense.  I can't live my life based on what other people are trying to project from their life.  But I really don't have that.  I actually have so much support from people, because they've always known me to really just pick up and do my own thing.  But sometimes when people don't know me, they think it's really like a brave thing.  And I know there is some bravery involved, but you know, I didn't really let things get to a point where--the roots started to set in on certain things, but I just know I need to do this other stuff.
Story_ID: 227304
Speaker 1: This painting here is called 'Black Hands.'  And it was--the painting I was speaking about earlier about being the first painting I've--decided to do for a children's book, and it's one where I decided to really try to break some boundaries and get away from realism, just to make an interesting image.  And the poem is about black hands being beautiful, and how they wiggle at the wind, and also how this woman is saying she's a child of God.  And I decided I wanted to connect the two poems together by taking the focus from the figure and maybe putting it more so on the hands, you know, from the face and everything.  So, being that the poem is called 'Black Hands,' I really wanted to have this kind of over-the-top, large looking hands.  But I wanted a really rich, beautiful umber and sienna cast to the brown.  You know, I really wanted it to really look like a rich color of brown.  And I made a choice to make one hand a lot more--richer than the other one, because I really want you to focus on the face and the hands.  And that's basically it about this painting.  It's done in acrylic, and it's a very special painting to me because it was the one that opened up the door to children's books.
Speaker 2: So, this painting here--it's some of the more recent work that I've been doing.  I did this painting about a year ago, maybe a year and a half.  It's called 'Evelyn' [ph.] named after the model who I painted it after.  This painting, it's kind of like a study for me.  And it's not really a completed painting; there's some issues with me--with the drawing of her body, you know, maybe like her shoulder and everything.  But I really, true to what I always do, I really focused a lot on the face.  I really took a lot of care and took effort to make sure that the tones modeled out.  And in a lot of my paintings, you might find blotches of painting, almost like collage.  Like, I'll take paint and kind of put one layer of paint on top of another layer and work with shapes and shadows.  But in this particular style of painting I use oil, and I used it in a way where I could roll out the darks into the light, and have the light source coming from one direction and have the brightest intensity of light hitting the forehead and then kind of going down in waves.  And the other parts of her body, some parts are hitting the light, some parts are going into shadow.  I mean, this particular painting, I mean I would probably work on it a little bit more, but I decided to leave it at this point to kind of keep it like as a lesson and keep the memory of how to do this type of painting, starting with sienna and starting with the charcoal sketch and going over the charcoal sketch with paint, and then working with the dark shadows and then building up the paint layer upon layer until it gets a lot thicker, and keeping some areas very sharp, like maybe some areas right below where the ridge of the forehead is with a very sharp contrast, while taking the stuff in shadow and making it a lot more softer.  So, some of the edges are hard and some of them are soft, and some actually go back into the background and some pop forward.  But I was really happy with the painting.  I'm really happy with the face, mainly.  But the thing about this class I took, you only had a certain amount of time to do the model, and I really decided to really focus on building the background up and building the face.  But it's exciting to me, because I don't know where my oil painting is going to take me.  So, this painting is like a really pivotal painting, it's very important, because it's a good lesson for me.
Story_ID: 227305
Speaker 1: So, here we are have an important painting for me, called 'Interrogation.'  It's actually a reproduction of it.  It's important in two points.  One, this is the very first time I did a painting for The New Yorker that was used as a full-page image.  Most of the time, my work for The New Yorker was spot.  The work was really like spot illustrations, little small works that were printed.  But this is the first time I was actually asked to do an article.  And this ran in, I think it was, I don't remember exactly the specific date, but I think it was around like '99 [1999] or 2000, I'm not sure, but around that era, that time.  But this painting is about a guy that--two little children were accused of murdering a little girl, and they were interrogated by police without the parents.  So the whole article is called 'The Unprotected,' and it was all about the different things going on.  So, that's what that was about.
Speaker 2: Go ahead, go ahead.  Do you have to say about this one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to say the other point about this is that this is actually one of my prints.  And I started with doing reproductions of my work.  I was very selective about it, and I learned on the business side of things that you can actually take your work and you can reproduce it, but you don't have to have it like flood the market.  You don't have to take a ton of--you don't have to take a ton of images and get it to the point where people buy your prints rather than they buy your artwork.  So, I chose this painting because I really love it.  I love like the composition of it, and I love--I love the subject matter.  But I only made seventy-five of these.  Sometimes you can make seven prints, and sometimes you can make five.  So, I keep my editions very low, but I do sell them.
Speaker 2: So, anyway this painting is called 'Father's Day Jazz' and it was commissioned by a record company for Father's Day.  And these types of paintings are challenges for me, because I usually have--in the past and even now, like sometimes I have problems doing paintings of groups of people.  Usually in all my paintings, the majority of them are like single figures or, you know, maybe no more than two people or three.  This one, I had to do several, like there's about six people in this painting.  And it was difficult, but I really like the success of it, of the composition just coming together, and everything just kind of pushes you forward and pulls you back.  And it kind of all works as a nice composition.  And I kept the colors very simple.  I didn't use more than brown, orange, and that ocher, and a little bit of the blue, variations of blue.  And this painting is influenced by--like it is like a lot of my work--I love [Pablo] Picasso's work, and I like that painting 'Guernica.'  So sometimes I might take bits and pieces--like the light bulb at the top is, you know, I got that from that 'Guernica' painting.  And I like to break up my paintings with diagonals and curves.  See, like this piece, that black is like spotted throughout the whole painting, and that angle of the black part of the vase relates to the window at the top.  And you see the same thing with the orange; repeated and unify the whole painting that way.  So, this painting is about to go out these doors tomorrow, and it's going to end up in an exhibition in London [England].
Story_ID: 227306
Speaker 1: This is another print, I sold the original work.  This is probably the most--highest priced painting that I ever sold on my own to someone, because I was really connected to this painting.  The name of it is called 'Above the Flood Plain,' and it came about from a commission from The Philadelphia Inquirer.  And the painting is basically dealing with--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this particular reproduction of that original painting, it came to almost be a self-portrait for me, because as I like to state, I love to travel.  And you can't gain something without losing something, you know, and sometimes it's a good thing, like you're gaining knowledge by losing ignorance, you know.  But loss is just a part of life, and this painting deals with loss and also the hope of going forward.  No matter what kind of adversity and whatever's happening to you in life--that you go forward and try to rise above the things that try to pull you down in earth, on this earth.  And that painting, a lot of times people look at it and tell me, "You've got to send this to the people that are doing [Hurricane] Katrina relief, and it really looks like something that could be relevant for today."  But I know when I made this print, I made seventy-five of each of the images, and this is, I think I only have two more.  And one's damaged, the other one, and this one's in good condition, and the other one's in good condition.  So, there's only two prints that I have in my possession.  But when I made this print, it just related--so many people related to it, and it just sold immediately.  So, before I know it, it was really something that I'm aspiring to.  I really want to be able to create an image that has that--to me, it's a powerful piece.  And I'm just working and everything, and I hope to keep doing more work like this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so here we are with a more representational self-portrait.  The 'Above the Flood Plain' portrait was more of a symbolic type.  This one is literal, but I'm also still playing around with the proportion, and I'm playing around with a balance between realism and abstraction.  And this painting at this stage is a grisaille painting, meaning that it's just tones of gray and white.  And I first started the underpainting with acrylic, and then on top of the acrylic, I went on with a lighter glaze of different types of paint.  So I'm working with oil glazes on top of an acrylic base.  And I didn't sketch it out, I just--I like to sometimes just paint, I don't bother with the sketch.  And it's a work in progress, because part of the painting where there's light--the lighter, brighter side--the strokes are too bold right now, and I want to tone that down so it looks more like atmosphere rather than paint.  And the same thing with the tones, they get pulled together.  When you actually do an overpainting and you start doing other glazes, everything starts to be almost like windows--that you're looking through one window and looking through another and another and another.  And the different layers of paint all kind of almost like cross-hatch, and they build like a really beautiful intensity of light.  So, I'm just working with this particular painting, and it's still developing.  And I'll even correct the--one side of the neck; I want to kind of bring my shoulder down a bit, and also make the neck a bit more--thinner.  And, but I really feel like this painting is important, because it's the kind of work that I plan to do when I take this move.  When I go and travel, I'm going to use some of the techniques I learned in the painting class I was speaking about, and bring it to my own sense of breaking those rules, but in a way appealing to the rules of realism by kind of surrounding with abstraction.
