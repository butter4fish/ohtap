Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not--yeah, on my mother's side, I can go back to her parents and my grandmother's mother, and I don't remember her first name, I just remember we called her Grandma Haney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Haney was her last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I can't remember her first name.  I, I knew you were gonna ask me about that and I tried to remember and I couldn't remember.  I'm the last--in, in my family, I'm the last person; I'm, I'm the branch, I'm the last branch.  I have no children, I have no siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother had two sister--two sisters [Agnes Davenport and Iola Davenport Welch] and a brother [James Davenport], and they didn't have any children.  So I'm, I'm the last one of--on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any stories about the people--the ancestors on your mother's side?  What did they do for a living in--
Speaker 2: Well they were farmers; my mother--my grandmother [Blanche Haney Davenport] and grandfather [William Davenport] were farmers, they owned a farm in rural--Carlton is a rural area in Georgia, and they had a farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I used to go down there in the summer, not--I didn't spend the entire summer, like some of my friends would go and spend the whole summer in Georgia--I mean in their family home, but I only went maybe two weeks at the most--two or three weeks at the most.  My father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] worked for the railroad [Baltimore and Ohio Railroad].  I guess we'll get to that, but my father worked for the railroad and so we, we always had a free pass, so my mother would take me down there, usually in July or August.  They had a church that--I guess they called it the--the preacher was a traveling preacher, and he came to my mother's church only once a month, so we would always be there on the fourth Sunday in the month, either July or August.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was often done.
Speaker 2: Circuit, circuit preaching; yeah, that's what it was called.
Speaker 1: Circuit, right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did your grandparents own their own land?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting, okay.  And are there any stories that have passed down, you know, through the family, about your grandparents or your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: I remember my grandmother--my great-grandmother took her---would take her teeth out, and I always remembered that she would--you know I would say, "Grandma Haney, take your teeth out for me."  And she'd take them out; that's the only thing I can really remember about her because I think she passed--obviously, she passed away but I don't--I was a young child, but that's what I really can remember about her; I'd always say, "Grandma Haney, take your teeth out," and she would take 'em out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I don't know what her--you know I don't know what she did.
Story_ID: 633160
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the stories your mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] told about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, one story in particular, my grandfather [William Davenport] came in from outside, and they were all sitting around the fireplace; they had a fireplace and they were all sitting around the fireplace, and an animal, just a small animal, I don't know what it was, was in my grandfather's shirt, or coat or something, and he crawled out while they were sitting there talking around the, the fireplace, and he (gesture) (audio disturbance) did something to it and it fell over in my grandmother's [Blanche Haney Davenport] lap, and she just jumped up and started screaming and running around and, and the children they just laughed and laughed and laughed; so that's one of the stories that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was this a furry animal, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was.  I--I, I don't know what it was.  I guess it probably was a furry animal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did your mother have an opportunity to go to school in Carlton [Georgia], or did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my mother went to a one room schoolhouse.  She--in high school, she went to Athens [Georgia] to the Baptist institute [Union Baptist Institute], and then she went to, she went to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and graduated as president of her class.  And I always tell the story that, you know, don't put down one room schoolhouses because my mother, you know, was a one room schoolhouse student, and ended up being the president of her graduating class in college; she went to Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this was what, about 1924 or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  She graduated from Spelman in 1930.
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty [1930].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 633161
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is L-E-M-A-G-E, Lemage Samuel Fambro, Jr. [Lemage Fambro, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind the name Lemage?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  His father--he was named after his father of course; he's a junior, but they called his father (pronunciation) Lemage [Lemage Fambro, Sr.], but they called my father Lemage.  I think my father said he changed his name; he didn't like Lemage so he started calling himself Lemage.  And then there is a--I have a first cousin who's named Lamage, and her name is spelled L-A-M-A-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Lemage was my father's name.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering perhaps if it's French.  Fambro sounds like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's kind of--yes, I always thought Fambro was French.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories--
Speaker 2: There is a story that my, my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] told me about (unclear) obviously came from my father, that our names--that the name should be Philips [ph.] because there was a Philips way back when, and he--on a plantation, and the plantation owner's name was Philips, and his daughter got married and he gave, I guess my great-grandfather or great-great-grandfather to the family, and when--and they met--she married a, a, a Fambro, and so he changed--my great-great-grandfather changed his name to Fambro, but it was originally--my mother tells me this, that it was Philips, and I think she said that my [paternal] grandmother [Callie Reese Fambro] told her that story; it didn't come from her side of the family, it came from my father's side of the family but through me it came through my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the--well I guess a slave--a tradition during slavery would be to take the name of whoever your master is now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at the present time, rather than the one that used to own you.
Speaker 2: So we assumed that it was Fambro, and we've always known--we've always thought that whenever we looked up Fambros--when I go to different cities, I just look in the telephone book, that it could be spelled F-A-M-B-R-O, O-U-G-H, E-A-U-X, or E-A-U.
Story_ID: 633162
Speaker 1: Now what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February the 9th, 1906.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Madison, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Is that close by?
Speaker 2: It's near Atlanta [Georgia]; it's closer to Atlanta than anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Nothing; past my grandparents [Callie Reese Fambro and Lemage Fambro, Sr.], I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I wanna say that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, what do you--can you tell us about your grandparents?  What did they do for a living, and--
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was a printer, and he also owned some land on the West Side.  They, they came to Chicago [Illinois] when my, when my father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] was a kid; he was about eight or nine years old, and he went to Brown Elementary School [William H. Brown Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  They lived on Wood Street--Wood and Lake Street, and their--the school obviously was nearby, and my grandfather was a printer and he owned some land.  He owned the house they lived in and I think he owned a couple of lots someplace nearby.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've actually been to Brown School--
Speaker 2: Oh, have you?
Speaker 1: --that's one of the oldest schools in the City of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Oh, is it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what they say
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  Well that's where my dad went to grammar school.
Speaker 1: It's over there by the stadium [United Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, um-hm.  Because I know whenever my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] would take--as a kid, my mother would take me to the stadium [Chicago Stadium, Chicago, Illinois] to see the circus and whatever, and we would always go to my grandparent--we would just walk to my grandparents' house because the stadium was like two blocks, you know, from Madison [Street] to Lake Street.  We walked; they lived on the corner--near--they lived--I think Maypole was a street [Maypole Avenue], I think it was the cross street.  I know the address was--no, I don't know the address (laughter).  I just know it was Lake--they lived on Wood Street, 140--I think it was 140 North Wood Street.
Story_ID: 633163

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, he worked for Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He went to McKinley High School [Chicago, Illinois] for a while--I mean for--he graduated from McKinley High School and I think he went to--I don't know where he went but I think he went to Crane [Crane Junior College], I think; whatever Crane is--was then, I think he went there for a while.
Speaker 1: And Crane is now Malcolm X [Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Um-hm.  But he and my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro]--even though they're both from Georgia, they met in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was your father a Pullman Porter?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was a labor foreman in the yards--the Baltimore and Ohio yards [Barr Yard] out in Riverdale, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he also was a printer; he also had his own print shop--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --in the basement of our home when we lived in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: It seemed like that would be better than being a porter in the sense that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he didn't have to travel.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't travel at all, but I always wanted him to travel; I just wanted to say that my father was a por- that was a good job at that time, Pullman car porter, and I always wanted to say that my father was a Pullman car porter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't; he--he was a labor foreman, and he was--he ran--I mean he was a supervisor, so I, I kind of liked that, you know, that he was a supervisor.  He worked at nights, he worked from twelve to eight, nine--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all, all the time that I--that--of my, my lifetime, he worked at night.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was
Speaker 2: And he was--he--he would do printing during the day.  He had a, he had a print shop in the basement.  We lived in Woodlawn on Langley [Avenue], and he had a print shop in the basement, and I used to go down there and watch him print and set type--handset type.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was--he was busy.
Speaker 2: Oh, very busy and they owned some property also.
Story_ID: 633164
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Lois Davenport Fambro and Lemage Fambro, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: They met at--oh, what was the name of it?  Oh lord.  They met at--oh, I can't think of it.  It was a dance hall, they met at a dance hall on the South Side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not the--not the Grand Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no--way--long--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --way before that.  The Peps [Warwick Hall, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Peps (unclear).
Speaker 1: P-E-P-S?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories associated with it, meaning what they--how/why they were attracted to one another, or?
Speaker 2: No, no, they were both--I don't--no, I don't know.  They were both, they were both very outgoing people and so I don't know how, how they--what attracted 'em to each other, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 633165
Speaker 1: And you're the only child?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the only grandchild.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got a lot of attention (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  I, I hesit- I hesitate to say I was spoiled, but I did get a lot of attention.
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you think back at your parents' personalities and their talents and their--some of their other attributes, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro].  My mother was a--belonged to lots of organizations.  She was a joiner, my father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] used to call her a joiner, and I do that; I, I tend to join organizations.  My father didn't belong to organizations.  He went to church and--they both went to church.  My mother was, was much more active in the church than my father, my father was just a, a, a, a bench member but my mother was active in church, and that was Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] on 31st [Street] and King--South Park [South Parkway], King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that's the one where Joseph Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson], who was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --head of the National Baptist Convention--
Speaker 2: Yes, for USA, Inc.  And I say that because there was a National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There was a split sometime, and one was the National Baptist Convention and one was the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that the '61 [1961] split in Cincinnati [Ohio]?  Where they had the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember, I don't remember
Speaker 1: --civil rights split?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it--yeah, I know it was before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was before that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause--yeah, I think--
Speaker 2: I was in Kansas City, I think, during that; I remember being in Kansas City when, when--not the split--I don't know if there was a split, but I remember there was a lot of ruckus going on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there actually was a split in there on the--the faction that followed Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --became Progressive National Baptist church [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But I mean before that, there was the National Baptist Convention and then the National Baptist Convention, USA, and then there was the Progressive--I, I do know that.
Speaker 1: The National Baptist Convention, the largest black organization in the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --or in the world, probably.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 633166
Speaker 1: Now you grew up in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were--can you describe where, where you lived, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me just back--can I back up a little bit?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My parents lived--before I was born, they lived on South Parkway [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] in an area that was eventually torn down to build Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], so when they, when they--they had to move, and they moved to 433 East 45th Street, which is right across--around the corner from where we are right now, and they moved in a large brownstone that my aunt--my mother's older--oldest sister and her husband lived in, and so my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] and father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] moved with them, and before I was two, they bought a two flat in Woodlawn and then that's when we moved to, to Woodlawn.  But we lived right here in Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] when I was a kid--I mean when I was an infant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I lived a half a block from McCosh high school--I mean McCosh grammar school [James McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and I went to nursery school at a church around the corner from where we lived, and when it was time for me to go to kindergarten, my mother took me to McCosh kindergarten and they put me in first grade and said that--they were going to put me in first grade--and said that because I had gone to nursery school, that I, you know--they considered me a little advanced because I had gone to nursery school.  And then they were gonna put me--so my mother said--so--no, what did--how did that--.  Oh, then, then--no, they wanted me to--at that--let me back up.  At that time, they--you went to school either in January or June--I mean in September or, or January; they had A and B classes.  So they told my mother to bring me back in, in, in January, and she said no, she wanted me to go to school because she couldn't--there wasn't--there was--nursery school wouldn't take me anymore; that was gone.  So they--somebody said, "Well, take her to St. Anselm's Catholic School [St. Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois] on 61st [Street] and Indiana [Avenue], and they'll take her right away, but you have to tell them that her birthday is in, in, in, in January."  So my mother took me to St. Anselm's and they--okay.  Let me, let me just erase all of that because it--the first grade thing was part of St. Anselm's.  01:19:25:05When I came out of nursery school, my mother took me to McCosh.  They wouldn't take me; they told her to bring me back in January.  She did not want to do that, she wanted me--she felt she was--I was ready to go to school, so she sent me--she wanted me to go to school right away, so someone told her that if I went to St. Anselm's, they would take her right away, but she had to say that my birthday was in January.  So she took me to St. Anselm's and they took me in, and she told them that my birthday was January the 5th--my birthday was actually May 5th.  And then they put me in first grade because of the, of the--I had already been in nursery school.  And then, about a month after I had been in school, she went back up to the school and told 'em that she had made a mistake, that my birthday was May 5th, and she figured that they were not gonna put me out because she did not want me to get confused as to when my birthday was.  So I went to McCo- I went to St. Anselm's until I got to the fifth grade, and my mother said well, it was time for me now to go to public school.  And so I went to McCosh the day after Labor Day when school started, and they wanted to put me in sixth grade, and my mother said no.  She didn't want that because I was already--had already missed one grade at kindergarten; she didn't want me to be that far advanced.  So they--she took me back to St. Anselm's.  We were Baptist, and she did not want me to graduate from a Catholic grammar school, but when I got to eighth grade, and I had made so many good friends, and she allowed me to graduate from St. Anselm's and I went to--then I went to Parker High School [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 633167
Speaker 1: I had a very lovely childhood in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois].  Woodlawn then was, was almost like the suburbs because I was at the end of their bus line, you know, I lived 6627 Langley [Avenue], and that was kind of like the end of the bus line.  And it was just a very--two f- mostly two flats and, and single family dwellings, and I made a lot of good friends in, in Woodlawn that I still have now.
Speaker 2: So that was considered then like the far South Side [Chicago, Illinois], going to 66th [Street] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the far South Side.  And I can remember the little stores in the neighborhood; there was a--there were two little grocery stores--three grocery stores within walking distance of our house, you know, owned by the people that ran them--black people that were in them.  And then there was a shoe shop, and there was a fish store, but I can re- I mean I just can remember those so plainly that they--there wasn't any--that was before the market, you know, the A&Ps [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] and the Krogers [The Kroger Company] and the Jewels [Jewel-Osco] and all that.  But I had a great growing up time in, in Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: Okay, now the reason why they had the A and the B, was it because of the crowding of the schools in those days?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know--really know that.  I just know that some, some--and at that time, some people were graduating in, in, in June and some people were graduating in January, you know, the class of--they would say the class of 1952--the June class of '52 [1952], or the January class of '52 [1952] but I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I guess it was because of the ages, I don't know.  Maybe it was--I never thought about what that--I never thought about that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well I just wondered, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The--so--now, I had asked you about the sights and sounds and smells in growing up, and I think we got in a school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but we really didn't talk about the sights and sounds and smells--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I can remember very plainly.  I lived two blocks from Cottage Grove [Avenue], I lived two blocks west of Cottage Grove and we used to go to the beach, or walk to the beach, and you did not cross Cottage Grove until you got to 63rd Street, or you would go to 67th Street, because there was all white, and the white people would fight you or throw bricks or, you know, cans at you, so the only time we could cross Cottage Grove was at 65th--I mean at 63rd or 67th Street.  The Rayners--the Rayner funeral home [A.A. Rayner & Sons Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois]--the Rayner people that owned the funeral home, they lived in the block with us, and Johnny Rayner [John B. Rayner] and Sammy Rayner--Sammy Rayn- you--don't know if you--Sammy Rayner ran for alderman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A.A. "Sammy" Rayner--
Speaker 1: A.A. "Sammy" Rayner, Jr.
Speaker 2: --the last of the Republican politicians in--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes, A.A. "Sammy" Rayner, Jr.  And--he [A.A. Rayner, Sr.] used to take the kids in the block to the beach, and we would ride in the, in the flower car or the hearse, and we just thought that was delightful that we were driving this big black car.  It didn't bother us that it was--that it also carried caskets of dead people and flowers that were going to the cemetery; that didn't bother us one bit.  We were just so excited that we were able to go to the beach in the, in the back of a hearse or, or, or a flower car.  But when we went to the--when we got to the beach over at 63rd Street, the Jackson Park beach [63rd Street Beach, Chicago, Illinois], there was a snow fence that ran from the sidewalk to the--at water edge, and we blacks were only allowed on the north end of the beach.  Where the beach house is now was all white, and we were all--only could play in the water or play in the sand on the north end of the beach.  I remember that very well.

Speaker 2: --from, from that time, some--'37 [1937], you know, which--so I was two, but I'm just saying maybe it started--we started going to the beach [63rd Street Beach, Chicago, Illinois], I guess, in '40 [1940]--'41 [1941].
Speaker 1: That's segregation for a long time isn't it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear stories about the riot of 1919 on the beach?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  My father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] did not want me to go.  I remember wanting to go the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] one time, and--just with some children, some friends, and some--I think well maybe one parent was gonna go.  And he didn't want me to go because he talked about the riots back then, so I guess--he, he was here in Chicago [Illinois] at that point, so he knew about that.  But he wouldn't allow me to go and, you know, eventually, you know, that, that passed.  But I do remember him talking about that and not letting us go--not letting me go rather, to the Museum of Science and Industry.
Speaker 1: So, so black folks were not allowed in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know, cross Cottage Grove [Avenue]--where Hyde Park ended--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it was all right to cross--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and when it began it was--you know, before it began it was all right to cross.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Not after.
Speaker 2: After--because there was, there was a hotel over there called the--I don't even know why I said--started it 'cause I can't think of the name of it, but there was a hotel over there that eventually blacks lived in and had parties in, but it was the--it was over there (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: No, not the Sutherland, no, it was--I can't remember, but it was where [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr. did some of his performances eventually, in that church.  It was a church and a, and a hotel nearby, and I remember Oscar doing--
Speaker 1: Not the Windermere [Hotel Windermere, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't the Windermere, it was--the Windermere was on the Midway--near the Midway, near the Midway Plaisance [Chicago, Illinois].  This was like--maybe two or three blocks west of Stony [Stony Island Avenue], about 67th [Street], 63rd [Street].  Somewhere between 63rd and 67th, there was a hotel, very lovely hotel, and I remember eventually blacks were able to go in there and have parties, but that was--before that, we weren't even allowed in that area; we couldn't even go in that area.

Speaker 1: Oh, I remember the parade, yes.  I remember the parade going--coming to--coming over to South Park and watching the parade; yeah, I remember that.  Because my [maternal] aunt that--where I lived when I was an infant, which--right around the corner, we used to come to her house, and then go over to--just walk half a block over to South Parkway [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and watch the parade.  Yeah, that was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think now it's the largest--or it was the largest parade in the--

Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: You learned how to shoot photos too at some point.  So is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: No, I just picked up a camera and--I was always interested in--I used to always take pictures, you know, snapshots.  I remember my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] brought--bought me a Polaroid, and I think that's really what started me in taking pictures.  So I just take pictures.  I've, I've never taken a class, I've always--Ted, Ted Bell [Theodore Bell] and Tony Rhoden would kind of help me along, but I wasn't taking pictures back then, I mean for the Defender [Chicago Defender].  I just would watch them and they would--then if I'd get a camera, they would show me how to use it.  But I, I take pictures now mostly--I don't take news pictures, I take pictures socially, you know for the, for the stories that I write socially, and there's a feature that we call Seen on the Scene, and I take pictures for that, and then I take pictures that accompany my column [Teesee's Town].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

Speaker 1: What was the, the society world like when you started covering it--covering it?  Who was, who was who in Chicago [Illinois], and what did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been a pretty outgoing person, so it was not eas- it was not hard for me to get into that, but I would cover the parties, the fashion shows; the Ebony Fashion Fair was a big thing that we covered, The Links [The Links, Incorporated], cotillions, the big parties that the--the women's clubs, the men's clubs.  The Green Donkeys was one of the men's clubs, the women's clubs were the Royalites and the Winsomettes, there was--the Green Donkeys, I said that.  There's a lot of--two other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Green Donkeys?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Green, Green Donkeys.
Speaker 1: Now what was the significance of them?
Speaker 2: Nobody ever knew; I would ask people, "How did you get that name?"  "I don't know."
Speaker 1: Were they environmental friendly Democrats or what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no (laughter).  I don't know--the Green Donkeys, and they'd have a little green hat they'd wear, you know.  But they were one of the popular social organizations in this city; they had a--they would have a party every, every--it was a formal, always a formal party.  It was at the Parkway [Parkway Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois], which is right next door to us now, and around the Christmas holidays, or some kind of thing, but they might have one during the summer, but the Royalites, the Winsomettes, The Links--'cause The Links had been around for a while, and--big parties.
Speaker 1: Well Chicago is a highly organized city.  I know one of the treasures of Chicago that they hold over the Woodson Library [Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, Chicago, Illinois], in the Harsh Collection [Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection of Afro American History and Literature] is a book that was produced by Frederic Robb [Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb] during the fair of 1931 [sic. 1933], I guess the Century Progress Fair [Chicago World's Fair, A Century of Progress International Exposition, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where he tried to document every black organization in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they call the book the Wonder Book ['1927 Intercollegian Wonder Book'; 'The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1927'].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So then there are pictures of 'em (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 1: --Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] basketball team, every, every--all the different Mason groups and--.  He tried to document all of 'em, said--you know, he's got his pictures of 'em and stories about 'em in a--it was a red leather bound book--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I saw one of the originals at one time.  So, did you keep like a catalog of groups, or directory of?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately I didn't.  But I do wanna mention the Snakes--that was one of the clubs, the Snakes, and the 40 Club [Original 40 Club]; those were the, those were the two top ones on the, on the male side of the social spec- spectrum.
Speaker 1: So the Snakes and the--
Speaker 2: The Snakes, it was the Royal Coterie, C-O-T-E-R-I-E of Snakes [Royal Coterie of Snakes].  And then there was the 40 Club; and most of the men in the Snakes were also members of the 40 Club.  And the 40 Club started, of course, with forty men, but it has since grown to be much larger.
Speaker 1: I know in recent days, there was a group called the Rat Pack [Chicago Rat Pack]; are they a formal group or are they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they're--they're a formal group but they're a much younger group.  They just--in fact, they just--I was just at their Christmas party a couple of weeks ago.  But they were started by some friends of mine, Chuck Curry [Charles E. Curry] and Mel Hobson [HistoryMaker Mellody Hobson] and Ernie Jenkins, and they used to meet at a place called Brief Reflections [ph.], up on 14th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and they said, "Well we need to be about something, and so we're gonna call ourselves the Rat Pack," and it just came from the Rat Pack from the Vegas/Sinatra people.  They just called themselves the Rat Pack, but they're a pretty popular group too now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I know now.  So in--but in those days, they didn't exist, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're--they've been in the last maybe twenty years.

Speaker 1: How much benefit was it to have Ebony and Jet in Chicago [Illinois], Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was a big deal, yeah.  I mean people looked up to Ebony and, and Jet.  And--well, Jet--Mr. Sengstacke says that Jet is, is--was born from the Defender [Chicago Defender], that--.  No, I don't wanna, I don't, I don't wanna talk about that.
Speaker 1: You don't wanna tell that story?
Speaker 2: No, I don't wanna tell that story.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'll tell you afterwards, but I don't wanna tell--I don't wanna tell it on film.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So anybody wants to know has to find me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'll tell 'em what you said--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --unless you tell me not to, so, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  No, I won't tell you not to.
Speaker 1: But I just figure that with the number of celebrities that were being covered by Ebony and Jet every month, there should have been a lot of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well Jet was weekly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ebony monthly, Jet was weekly.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of people in town, you know, and doing things that you would see in the pages of Jet, and then the Defender, and it seems like all--most--a lot of the major black publications were coming out of Chicago at one point--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--
Speaker 1: --to the rest of us.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  There was the Courier [Chicago Courier] and then there was the Crusader [Chicago Crusader], of course.  The Bulletin [Chicago Bulletin]; I think those are the major ones.  Balm Leavell had the Bulletin--I mean had the Crusader, and his wife now runs it, Dorothy Leavell [HistoryMaker Dorothy R. Leavell].  But at the Courier, Fred Wall, the de- the late Fred Wall, Wall at one time was the publisher of the Courier.  But there were--great papers came out of Chicago.
Story_ID: 633174
Speaker 1: Is there any particular event that you enjoyed covering the most?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --most of 'em are annual events, right?  Most of 'em are annual (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  Well, I always enjoyed going to the Snakes [Royal Coterie of Snakes] and the 40 Club [Original 40 Club]; those were the two top ones.  And Mr. Sengstacke was--John Sengstacke [John H. Sengstacke] was a member of both, and he always would invite me, or make sure that I got an invitation to cover it for the Defender [Chicago Defender], and I always looked forward to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What made that event more exciting?
Speaker 2: Well there was the, it was the caliber of the members; they were all the professional men, the doctors and the lawyers and judges, and you know, it was just the caliber of men that--they were all very professional men.  And the--of course their ladies were all gorgeously dressed and wore the latest of fashions, and so that would--that always made it fun to watch them and to see what they were wearing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't--I wasn't taking pictures then, so we always had--like Tony Rhoden or somebody would be taking pictures for them, and we would run them in the paper the next week--usually the next week.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on your career, is there any (cough)--or what would--excuse me--what would be the biggest events that you covered?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest event is the most recent event, and that was the inauguration of [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama.  I didn't cover it for the Defender, I went on my own, but I went to several of the parties and took pictures.  They--but we had a photographer that took pictures for the Defender that ran in the paper, but that was the biggest thing; that was very exciting for me.  I had decided early on when it looked like--that he was gonna win, that I was gonna be there.  I say I've got--there's no way in the world that I cannot be there.  So I looked forward to that from the summer, I had made up my mind that I was going.  I had gone--I was in Washington [D.C.] for an anniversary party with some friends, and that's when they were talking about, "He's gonna win."  I said, "Well if he's gonna win, I'm gonna be there."  So that was the biggest thing I covered, but it really--I didn't cover it for the Defender. I covered it for my, for myself.  But that was the biggest thing that I've done--I've been involved in in my life.  I do believe I will treasure that moment forever (laughter).
Story_ID: 633175
Speaker 1: You probably know the social coordinator for the White House now, [HistoryMaker] Desiree Rogers, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I know Desiree, yes.
Speaker 1: And she's probably been a part of many of the events that you've covered I would guess.
Speaker 2: Well, she was not--she would--she would--as an attendee but, you know, when she was here in Chicago [Illinois], she wasn't part of any social organization, she was in the--with the social groups; I mean, you know, she attended, you know, you would see her at all the parties, but she wasn't--and there wasn't, I don't think there was a club or an organization that she belonged to that gave parties.  But we all knew who Desiree was, you know; she came from the lottery [Illinois State Lottery]--she'd been married to John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.], and then she went to the Lottery and then she went to Peoples Gas [People Gas Light and Coke Company, Chicago, Illinois] and Northern Illinois Gas [sic. North Shore Gas Company, Waukegan, Illinois].  But she wasn't part of a social group that gave parties, but she--you would see her, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, who are some of the--can you name some of the people that were prominent in terms of giving parties, for those of us who are not in the social world?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, I just don't know.  You know, they could probably walk up to me, I just wouldn't know who they are--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but--
Speaker 2: Well the--like I say, most of them are the professional guys and the professional women.  The Links [The Links, Incorporated] parties, the--like I say, the Snakes [Royal Coterie of Snakes] and the 40 Club, then they still give their parties every year; one is in January, one is in May, and that's a party that everybody looks forward to going to.  The newest kid on the block now is called the Chicago Assembly, and they're a much younger group; they're, they are, I mean they're still in their forties and fifties and sixties, but they're much younger than the Original 40 Club and the Snakes, but they have a party every Christmas, the day after Christmas, and it's an invitation only, as were the Snakes and the, and the 40 Club; they were all original--I mean they were all invitation only parties; they weren't tickets sold, you were in--you had to know a member, and you would get an invitation, but there was--they weren't fundraisers; they were strictly social parties and social people attended them, and that was, you know--you looked forward to that.  Then there's another group called the Chicagoans [ph.], and they travel a lot; they--every Labor Day weekend, it's about--I don't know how many members are in it, it's may be about fifteen or twenty members, and they go outta town every, every June or July--I mean every Memorial Day, and they invite friends to go with them, and they go to Florida, they go to Hawaii, they've gone to the islands; and then there's another club called the Midwesterners [ph.], and I think they just had their party last week, and they give--their, their parties are also invitation only, where you have to know somebody, I mean you have to be invited by a member; they're not fundraisers where you buy tickets, you know.
Story_ID: 633176
Speaker 1: Do you cover the, the fundraisers too--the big fundraisers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yes.  Um-hm.  Like the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and The Links [The Links, Incorporated], and--they have--they're u- their parties are usually fundraisers because they're, they're social--they're civic minded individuals and they give--they have programs--social programs, and so they raise funds for their, for the programs that they do in the communities, so their parties are usually ticketed parties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well sometimes when I think, you know--back when I worked for the Arts Alliance [African American Arts Alliance of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I came across a lot of invitations--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that come through, and I marveled that some names kept appearing over and over again, I wondered how people, you know, had the time to be a part of so many organizations like--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, most of the ladies, and men, you know, they, they thrive on, on those kinds of associations and, you know, they've always done it.  It's very interesting to watch the names--you are right, the names pop up--you see them all over, you know, in various organizations--the AKAs, you know the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.], the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.], the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.].
Speaker 1: I know we've interviewed a couple of people like [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Runner and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Juanita Passmore--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who are just amazing (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm, I'm in an organization with Juanita Passmore: the Chicago Carousels.  We, we're a national organization and Juanita is very much heavily involved in that.
Speaker 1: Yes, she has an interesting story being the makeup person for Lucille Ball I think.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?  Now I didn't know that--I hadn't heard that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was the makeup person for Lucille Ball in--
Speaker 2: Oh was she?  Matter of fact I just talked to Juanita last night.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The movie 'Long, Long Trailer' ['The Long, Long Trailer'] she was the makeup person.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she spent some time in Hollywood.  She's--but she'll come to--if she thinks it's worthy, she'll be there.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  She's in a wheelchair now, and it doesn't stop her, doesn't stop her one bit; Juanita is, is there.  You can look forward to seeing Juanita at the parties.
Speaker 1: So do you think--when you look at the whole social world of Chicago [Illinois], do you think that people do these things just for the parties?  Are they really trying to help?
Speaker 2: I really think that their, their hearts are in the right place and their souls are in the right place.  I think they're doing it to help people, but the, the means that they use to do it is, is a lot of fun for them, and--but I think, I think they're--you know, they, they do it for the right reason.  And there's the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]; I don't wanna leave them out; I'm not a member, but I don't wanna leave Jack and Jill out. I'm just trying to--and there's another organization called The Drifters [The Drifters, Incorporated], and--and most of them are social and service organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know one time, I think the Black McDonald's Operators Association's [National Black McDonald's Operators Association] wives had something going, that they were
Speaker 2: Now that, that, that, that's a new one on me; I haven't heard of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Maybe I'm (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I think a lot of them were members of The Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.] I know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.  So--
Speaker 2: And then there's a group called the Moles [Moles, Inc.], and that's a national organization of women; theirs, theirs mostly is, is social.  They just say they meet to have fun.
Story_ID: 633177
Speaker 1: Now what about cultural events?  Do you, you cover cultural events in the column [Teesee's Town]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now I know you do--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I'm just asking it rhetorically, but, but--I know theater is something that you cover.
Speaker 2: Yes, I--eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] for one, they do a gala every year in September, and I cover that; it's a big, it's a big--that's their big fundraiser, I cover that.  The Chicago--not the Chicago, the black theater ensemble [Black Ensemble Theater, Chicago, Illinois], they have a--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Jackie Taylor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm. they have a big gala every year, so I do cover those--and then there's the Chicago Sinfonietta, and so--and they have big galas.  So there, there, there are quite a few; there are quite a few, and I do try to cover--I try to cover them all, I can't cover them all, but I do try to cover them all.
Speaker 1: Does DuSable [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] still have the masked ball, or something?
Speaker 2: No, they don't.  I think it was the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois] that used to have the masked ball, and I think--they don't do that anymore.  But that was back in the day, and I don't--I think maybe I went to one or two of them, but that was a big--that was a big social event back in the day, South Side Community Art Center's masked ball.

Speaker 2: Associates [Theresa Fambro Hooks and Associates].
Speaker 1: Associates, Associates.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very--very creative thought (laughter).  Yeah, I did, I did PR [public relations].  I had--I, I decided I wanted to be on the other side of the PR business where I had been receiving, and I thought I wanted to give, so I worked mainly with nonprofits; I worked with eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], I worked with Abraham Lincoln Center [Chicago, Illinois], and I did PR for them; I did press releases and fundraisers, and events like that, yeah.  And I had a component--I had desktop publishing component where I did printing and programs and tickets and, and stationery.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: You ever thought about writing novels or plays or?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's--all--my writings are usually very brief and short.  I've never thought about--people say to me all the time, "You know where all the bodies are buried; you ought to write a book," you know.  But I, I--a book is not in me; I don't have a book in me.
Speaker 1: Are you sometimes surprised at what goes on in the social world (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, oh yes.  Yes; there are a lot of stories that I can't tell you (laughter).  Darn it (laughter).  But yeah, I'm surprised.
Speaker 1: I see, well, you know; are they--there's nothing you can tell us?  There's not one story
Speaker 2: Well, I--yeah, I, yeah, I can tell you stories, you know, without names.  I have done pictures--I have done like Seen on the Scene pictures, and I always say to people, especially the ones who I don't think know who I am, I will say, "I'm from the Chicago Defender, I'm taking pictures for the Chicago Defender."  And then sometimes oh, two or three days after I get back to the office, somebody will call me and ask me not to run the picture in the paper, you know, it might be a couple, you know, it might--.  And so I have to--you know, I, I, I, I do not do it if they ask me not to do it.  But that surprises me sometimes because--especially when I always let them know who I am and where I am, but I think it's because who they're with they may not want that person to know that they are in a situation that they don't want it to be publicized.  But I have had people to ask me not to run the--after I've taken the picture.  Now I've--people have said to me, "I don't want my picture taken," you know, and I, I appreciate that and, and do not take the picture.  But then after I take the picture, and then they call me and ask me not to run the picture; that surprises me and it, and it sometimes offends me.  Sometimes it offends me because I just think they have a--they have an opportunity for me not to do that because the person that's on the picture that's not--that should--does not show up in the paper, then they wanna know why did you take my picture and didn't run my picture in the paper?  So, you know, that, that offends me.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --picture was taken at a social event and they ran this big scandal--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing.  So that really happens (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, one in particular; I was at Mister Kelly's [Chicago, Illinois] and this guy introduced me to this lady as his wife, and I wasn't taking pictures then, I was just covering openings at Mister Kelly's and the LondonHouse [LondonHouse Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  You know what those are?  Okay.  And I would usually go to the openings, especially for the black artists; I would go, and then I would write about--among the first nighters, you know, and I ran this guy, Mr. and Mrs. So and So, and he called me and he said, "You gotta take that out of the paper," and I said, "Why?"  And he said, "That wasn't my wife."  I said (background noise), "You told me that was your wife."  He said, "Well can you--can you say you made a mistake?"  I said, "No, I will not say that I made a mistake," I say, "I will say that the woman that you introduced me to as your wife was not your wife; if you want me to do that, I can do that."  He say, "Oh no, no, no, can't do that."  So then the next thing I know, he had called Mr. Sengstacke and Mr. Sengstacke called me to his office and told me, you know, "What happened?"  And I told him.  He said, "Well then don't worry about it," you know.  But this guy had threatened Mr. Sengstacke about, you know, I had run this information in the paper.  He said, "But you told her that was your wife."  He said, "Well, I didn't think she was gonna put it in the paper."  Said, "Well you know what she does; you know her, you know what she does."  And I had a piece of paper (laughter) and I was writing the names down.  But I just guess--I don't know why he allowed me to take the picture--I mean I didn't take a picture--why he had gave me the woman's name, you know.  But, but that, that one was really the, the worst of all of them because they actually ran, and he wanted me to acknowledge that I had made an error.  I mean not to acknowledge, but to say I had made an error, and I refused to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think it might be drinking that makes them forget who you are?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, that could have been.  I didn't think--I didn't think about it that way, I just thought that he was just dumb, you know, that he would introduce her to me knowing who I am and what I do, you know.  It wasn't like he didn't know me; he knew exactly who I was, and he knew I wrote for the Defender [Chicago Defender], and I had a piece of paper and I was writing names down.  So he had every opportunity to even say, "Don't put her name in the paper, don't put my name in the paper," and I, I wouldn't have done it, absolutely wouldn't have done it.  'Cause I have seen people out in--that I know do not belong to each other, and I will purposefully make sure that I don't include them, you know.  But when people give me information, then I assume that it is correct and okay for me to use.
Story_ID: 633181
Speaker 1: Now, for instance, if you saw some people that are unattached who happen to be together, that look like they're enjoying each other's company, do you report that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I will ask them--I will tell them, you know, "I'm taking names for peop- for my column [Teesee's Town], you know, and I just wanna make sure I have your name spelled right."  So that gives them an opportunity at that point to--you know, I never say, "Do you want me not to put your name in the paper [Chicago Defender]?"  I don't do that, but I say, you know, "I wanna make sure I have your name spelled right."  And that's the opportunity they have to tell me they don't want--you know.  And people have said, "No, I'd prefer that you don't."  And I, I, I go along with that; I understand that.
Speaker 1: So you're not trying to have a gossip column or anything like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Oh, absolutely--no, no, I do not; I do not write a gossip column, and I don't--
Speaker 1: Do you know of any black gossip columns in any of the black papers, actually?
Speaker 2: Well, the Crusader [Chicago Crusader] has one called Tell It Like It Is.
Speaker 1: And that's really about gossip?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's gossip.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they wrote a disclaimer at the very end, saying that it's gossip column.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I just wondered 'cause--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I was wondering what--how the black papers view that.
Speaker 2: No, I don't write a gossip column.  And then when I say I write a gossip column, I say it's a good gossip (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you typify your news as the good news--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --actually.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And why do you call it the good news?
Speaker 2: Because it's not bad news.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's not like all the other, you know, tragedies and things--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I do put--I mean I do put like obituaries; I mean I use parts of an obituary, you know, if somebody passes, I do that.  That's not good news, but I mean I don't, I don't do gossip--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, to hurt people.
Story_ID: 633182
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't do that.
Speaker 2: So, you'll write a tribute to someone if they've passed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, yes.  And not necessarily a tribute.  If you just, if, you know, if I know you and I'll say, oh, I wanna, you know, acknowledge that Larry has lost his mom, and the funeral is so and so.  And I might say, if--you know, depending on the space, I might say who your mom was and, you know, what she did, you know, or elaborate on the person's life.  But I don't, I don't do a--I don't--I just--you know, people send me obituaries all the time, and I just, I try to pass 'em on to the newsroom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I don't have the kind of space [for her column, Teesee's Town].
Speaker 2: Okay, do they--I mean, so are there--can you pretty much decide what kind of thing you're gonna--
Speaker 1: Yes, pretty much.  I, lately, I've been restricted on some areas, but before I was pretty--I pretty much had free reign.  And--because my editors always felt that I was not going to do anything to embarrass myself or the newspaper [Chicago Defender].  So I pretty much had free rein.  When I came back, the last time I came back, [HistoryMaker] Colonel Eugene Scott was the editor--the publisher and the editor.  And I ask him--he asked me to come back, I said, "Do I have any restrictions?"  He said, "You can write about anything you want, and you don't have to go through me."  So I've never had a problem.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Here, of late, I've had some restrictions placed on me, but not, not much.
Story_ID: 633183
Speaker 1: So the period of time that you were absent from the Defender [Chicago Defender], what happened?  Was it a money thing or what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a money thing.  I just--
Speaker 1: And this is when the Defender was in some trouble in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --early--around about what, about 2002 or so?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--let's see.  I was, I twi- three times I left and came back.  The last time I came back was in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What happened the first time (laughter)?
Speaker 2: The first time, I just felt like I had pigeonholed myself.  And I had an opportunity to, to go to, and work for Philco Ford [Philco Ford Corporation] who ran a Job Corps center for girls on 15th [Place] and Indiana [Avenue].  And someone told me that--they were just opening, and somebody told me that they had a spot for a community relations person.  So I thought, I said, well, you know, I need to do something else.  And so I did.  I went and applied and got the job, and I was there maybe about four years.  And then I--Mr. Daryl Grisham, who was president of Parker House Sausage Company [Chicago, Illinois], and who I knew on a personal level, had asked me to come and work for him in charge of marketing and communications.  And I went with him, and then Mr. Sengstacke called, and said would I come back to the Defender.  And I said, well, you know, I'm at Parker House, and you've, you know, you all are friends.  So he said, "Well, I'm gonna call, I'm gonna call Mr. Sengstacke--," I mean, Mr. Sengstacke said, "I'm gonna call Daryl and ask him if he'd let you go."  And I said, 'cause I don't wanna leave, you know, on these circumstances to--you know, because he's been very good to me.  And so he called him, and they talked.  And he said, yes, that he would let me go, 'cause--because he was very supportive of the Chicago Defender, and obviously Mr. Sengstacke had told him that they needed me.  So I came back, and I was there--here. And I--then I also--that's when Mr. Sengstacke offered me the position of vice president for public relations, and I did that for a while.  And I was also president of Chicago Defender Charities with Mrs. Joyner [Marjorie Stewart Joyner].  She was the chairman of the charities, and I was the president.  And then I, then I, then I (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Did people call up the Defender and ask for you back?  Is that what--what he thought or what?
Speaker 2: Well, when the first time--the second time I came back, yeah.  Oh, yes, yes, people--when I left one time Mr. Sengstacke--Fred Sengstacke and I didn't see eye to eye on an issue, and I left.  And there was a lot of letters that were written on my behalf, asking me to come back.  And eventually, I came back.  Fred asked me to come back, so I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and the last time--?
Speaker 2: Well, the last time I came back, it was during the transitional period.  And Jerome Butler who at that--is an attorney and was holding the fort down to--while the paper was being negotiated to sell.  And I just happened to run into him and he told me that he was here.  And he said, "You ought to come back and write a column for the Defender," I was working for myself then, he said, "you ought to come back and do a column."  I said, "I don't--you know, deadlines; I don't wanna, that again.  I--you know, daily deadlines."  He said, "Well, just give it a try."  So I said, "Well, let me think about it."  So he called me back, and at that time, Johnnie Cochran was just opening an office here with Jim Montgomery [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery], and they were having a big party to celebrate him coming to Chicago [Illinois].  And Jerome asked me would I go to the party and cover it and write a column.  So I did, and that's when I met Colonel Scott [HistoryMaker Colonel Eugene Scott].  And he read the column [Teesee's Town].  He said, "Oh, you know, please come back.  This is--we need this, you know, there's been something missing."  So I came back, so that's how I came back the last time, and I've been here since--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) since 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't come back to stay that long, but I, I am still here.
Story_ID: 633184
Speaker 1: What do you think characterizes your, your column [Teesee's Town] and your, your writing style?
Speaker 2: Well, I try to write like I talk.  I mean I try to hold a conversation, you know, a one--a one--a dialogue, not a dialogue, but a monologue, with people that I write for.  And I try to be as candid and I just--well, I don't know.  I try to be candid and I try to write about things that I think people are interested in.  I try to write about people who get promotions and, because sometimes that goes by the wayside.  So I just try to write the good news.  That what I do.  I try to write the good news about people and things in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 633185
Speaker 1: As a black reporter, have you--did you ev- did you ever encounter racism out in the field trying to get a story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I haven't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I haven't.  I pride myself on that because I think I carried myself in a way that I'm not--I don't push my way into places.  And people, people have been--other reporters and other news entities have been very receptive to me and very pleasant.  And I've not had, not had, I've not had any troubles.  Nobody's ever offended me or talked to me any kind of way that I would be offended.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I was wondering too.  Do you th- do you cover--every year in Chicago [Illinois] there are new women in town that are related to or wives of or mothers of NFL [National Football League] stars and Major League Baseball stars.  For instance, Michael Jordan's mother [Deloris Jordan] is one example.  Do you cover the social events that they're involved in?
Speaker 2: Yes, I try to.  I, most of the--a lot of them are not socially people--socially active people, but those that are and that I know about and that I find out about, I do, I do cover them.  I try to give them as much opportunity and publicity as I can if they're doing good works in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and now, is there--do people, when people send you news of their events, I mean how do you judge what to cover and what not to, 'cause you only have so much space [for her column, Teesee's Town].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--yeah that's, that's very difficult, especially now that we have gone to be a weekly [Chicago Defender].  It is very, very difficult.  When I was--we were daily, I could pretty much get everything in that I wanted to get in.  But now, I really have to be very careful about, you know, what I can get in and what I can't.  And sometimes I have to eliminate altogether, and sometimes I have to cut so much altogether, you know, in order to get things in.  But that, it's very difficult.  I have written a column and think I'm through with it, and something comes in.  And before I could say, well, I can use this tomorrow, you know.  But now, I have to say, oh, I got to use this next week, and probably the event is over.  So sometimes I have to go back and pare stuff down that I've, you know, been kind of extensive with and have to pare it down, take out some names in order to make sure I can get something else in.  So it's very difficult, very difficult--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the last--well, we haven't been a daily, we haven't been a weekly a year yet.  But it's difficult.  It'll be a year, I guess, next February or something, February or March.
Story_ID: 633186
Speaker 1: Now, what did the campaign and the election of Harold Washington back in 1983 stir up in terms of the social scene here in Chicago [Illinois] for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it gave me an opportunity to--I wasn't a very political activist at that time.  So it gave me an opportunity to get into politics, get into the fundraising and the campaigning part of the politics, political scene rather.  And I knew Harold, you know, from before when he was in [U.S.] Congress.  And, in fact, I knew the girl that he was going with--can't call her name.
Speaker 1: Is that Mary Ella Smith?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Mary Ella Smith.  I've been knowing her since I was an infant.  Her mother and my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] were very good friends.  And so it, I had an immediate entree to him through knowing Mary Ella.  And then, of course, like I say, I knew him from, you now, being a congressman.  And so there were several groups that I was in that were doing fundraising for, for Harold, and being a member of the press, I was invited to a lot of other things, you know, that I wasn't particularly involved in.  But I was invited to cover them or just invited to be there.  And so it opened up a new door for me.  I had, like I say, I was not politically active, you know.  But that gave me an opportunity to kind of get on the inside of politics.  And I worked with Velma Wilson [Velma Brown Wilson]; at that time, she was his scheduler.  And she gave me a lot of information of what was going on.  So it was, it was fun.  It was a great time.  I remember the first, his first election, we were--when he won, I think it was when he won the primary.  We were all, we had a s- we had--some friends, we had rented a suite down at McCormick hotel [McCormick Inn, Chicago, Illinois].  And when he won, we were, everybody was getting ready to go out in the streets and just party.  And it rained, it began to rain.  And I thought, you know, we are so excited that we might do something that we might regret, you know (laughter).  And I was thinking that God had sent the rain to kind of calm us down, you know, because we were just jumping up and down.  And we were getting ready, where are we gonna go?  We were gonna go to The Other Place [Chicago, Illinois].  We were gonna go to The Swingers' Lounge [Chicago, Illinois].  We were just gonna go someplace, and it rained.  And I just think that kind of calmed all of us down.  But it was, it was just a great time.  It was great--I remember, and I can so remember, you know, when it was finally announced that he had won the primary, and it was just wonderful.
Story_ID: 633187
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any, anything that you would have done differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, I probably would have gotten, I probably would have honed my craft a little better, honed it as far as education.  I think that that--my mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] always wanted me to finish and get a degree.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't get a degree.  But I think that was--she kind of wanted me to do that, and I didn't.  But she didn't force me.  I mean she didn't pressure me because I was working, and I was, and I loved what I was doing.  And she loved what I was doing.  She was very proud of me, you know.  People would stop her or meet her and they would hear the name Fambro, and they'd say, "Are you kin to Teesee [HistoryMaker Theresa Fambro Hooks]?"  And like I say, that's what everybody calls me.  "Are you kin to--?"  "Yes, yes, I'm her mother."  So she was always very, very proud of me.  But I think that I would have--but I, I, I've never wanted to move out of the realm that I'm in.  I like, you know, the column part and the women's editor part, you know, that I was in.  I never wanted to go to the newsroom [of the Chicago Defender].  I was offered a couple of times to go--do you wanna move over into the newsroom, and, you know, write hard--what we called at that time hard news.  But I never did.  But I'm pretty much satisfied with where I am and what I've done.  And people seem to honor me and respect, and I think that's good for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so again, if you look back, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, now, I think that I have enlightened and elevated the community.  I think that I have given them the good news of this city [Chicago, Illinois], the good news of people who are part of the city.  I think that I have highlighted people who need to be highlighted, the unsung heroes.  I think I've done that for people who do good works and don't get the credit for it.  And I think I've done that.
Story_ID: 633188
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Lois Davenport Fambro] was very proud of you.  Did your father [Lemage Fambro, Jr.] get a chance to see you become successful as a columnist?
Speaker 2: No, my father passed in 1963, and he did not get a--well, I was working at the Defender [Chicago Defender] then, you know.  But he did not get to see me elevate myself.  But he was, he loved me.  I was a daddy's child.  I was a daddy's girl, but I mean, not that he shouldn't have loved me, but I mean he, he, he was--I was an only child, like I say.  And I was the only grandchild, and he was very, very, very supportive of me, whatever I did.  But he never saw me at--to get to the point where I am now.  My mother did.  My mother just passed in '99 [1999]--'97 [1997].  So she saw my--she saw what I had come to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who, today, would you consider your family to be, your close friends, and, or, or--
Speaker 2: I have a very small family, especially on my mother's side.  I have friends who I have been friends with for twenty and thirty years.  I have very few new friends.  I mean I--you know, they're friends, but I mean that I consider my sisters, you know.  So I have been fortunate that I have kept the old friends, while I've made new friends.  But I have lots of friends that I've known from grammar school [St. Anselm's School, Chicago, Illinois] and high school [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] and early adulthood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And who I consider my family.  I consider my church my family too.  I go to Trinity United Church of Christ [Chicago, Illinois] where Dr. Otis Moss [Otis Moss, III] is the pastor and Jeremiah Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] is the pastor emeritus.  And I have a, I have family there.  I sing in the choir, in the women's chorus.  And I'm very, very active in my church.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that you thought about that you'll wake up tomorrow and say, "I wish he would've asked me that" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) No, I really can't think of anything.  I've been thinking that all through this interview, you know, what, what--is he missing anything?  And then you get to it, when I think, I say, oh, this would be something good.  And you get to it.  So I don't think--I hope that I wake up--don't wake up in the morning and regret that you didn't ask me something.  I think you've pretty much covered it.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you, and I think that anybody watching this interview right now should stick around for the photos, and--because the photos are really gonna tell another story, a bigger story than we generally tell with photos because--
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: --there's so many good photos here--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --from the Defender [Chicago Defender] that we're gonna look at.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, great.
Speaker 1: So, so my last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I was at a funeral about a month ago, and--a friend of mine, and she was remembered with so many wonderful stories.  And a friend of--another girlfriend of mine that I've known since grammar school, we were, as we were leaving the funeral, we both said, we both agreed that the rest of our life was, hopefully, would be spent--that the same kind of love and admiration that we had just heard, that we could enjoy that, you know, in a later life.  I just hope that I'm loved and respected and honored, and that there is nothing untoward that people can say about me.  I really hope that my legacy is, is my love of life and my love of people and the love that I receive from people.
Speaker 1: All right, well, thank you.  You can't ask for more than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you (laughter).  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
Story_ID: 633190
Speaker 1: The most memorable moment in my life at the Chicago Defender was the night that Dr.--was the afternoon that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  I was down in the, in the new- in the composing room.  At that time, we were in the basement of the 2400 South Michigan [Avenue].  And I was down there.  It was a Thursday, and the paper came out that Friday.  And I was down there overseeing the women's pages.  And I heard someone from upstairs hollering, saying, "Dr. King has been shot, Dr. King has been shot."  And I ran up the steps and the teletype machines were just going.  They were just ding, ding, dinging.  And I said, "What is, what is going on?"  And they said, "Dr. King has been shot."  So immediately, I mean the people were just--phone calls were coming into the Defender, you know, "Is it true?  Dr. King's been shot?"  And we were saying yes.  So we knew that our night ahead of us was gonna be long and tirome--tiring.  So we decided, the newsroom, Sam Washington, Dave Potter and I think Betty Washington and I, we decided we better go get something to eat because we were gonna be there for quite a while.  So we went down to the--there was a restaurant on 22nd Street/Cermak Road, called Batt's [Chicago, Illinois], and we went down there to eat.  And I guess it was about, at that time it was about four o'clock, and we were sitting there, not saying much of anything.  And the waitress came over and said, "He's dead."  And, of course, we all just dropped, you know, our hearts just dropped.  So the owners of Batt's [Nathan Batt] came over to the table.  He knew us, and knew who we were.  And he came over, and he said, "It's on me."  And we were, you know, getting ready to pay.  We're trying to get out of there and get ready to pay.  And he said, "It's on me.  You don't have to pay."  So we came back to the Defender.  And we started giving out assignments, who was gonna do what and cover--I was gonna try to get, call people and get some reaction on the phone, and somebody else was gonna go in the library and pull out photographs.  Somebody else was gonna pull out some of his, his quotations and we were gonna have to just almost redo the front part of the paper all over again.  And we started, and we went on and, and people who had gone home for the day, like Audrey Weaver and Lloyd General, they came back, I mean without--it amazed me because this was the first time I had ever seen a newsroom really at work and had come together.  And people just start coming in, you know, without anybody calling them; they just knew that they needed to be there.  And they all came in, and we sat there, and we worked.  We cried, we worked, we cried.  Eventually, John Sengstacke [John H. Sengstacke] who had been in Detroit [Michigan] called and said, you know, "What's going on?"  And, "How's the city?"  And we're saying it's, you know; it's upheaval.  You know, there're fires all over the place.  So he said, "I'll be right there."  So, he jumped on a plane and came home, and he said when he was in the air, and they were circling Midway [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois], he could see the fires down on the ground.  And it just bothered him so much 'cause he loved Chicago [Illinois] so much.  And he came back to the Defender, and we worked again.  And Tom Picou [Thomas Maurice Sengstacke Picou], who was our managing editor at that time, he was there.  He came in.  And we all sat around, and we finally put the paper together.  And then we sat there, and then we cried.  We just all cried.  We tried to--we had done what we could.  We knew we had put a paper together that we could be proud of, that Dr. King could be proud of if he could see it.  We had done the best we could.  And the king was dead and all we could say was, "Long live the king."  And we had done a job that nobody thought--nobody ever reckoned that we would have to do.  But we did a good job, and we were very proud of ourselves.  And it was the moment that I will never--I never will forget at the Chicago Defender; how we all came together and produced, without anybody hollering at anybody, anybody getting angry with anybody, anybody upset with anybody else.  We were all, we just were there, we were there for Dr. King.  And we had done a job, and the king was dead.  And long live the king.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.

Speaker 1: Okay, that was taken--I was in a group called The Dozen.  It was twelve of us, twelve young ladies, and we used to do the opening night--that should have been in part of the other story.
