Speaker 1: Sounds like a tougher billy goat than the regular ones, I (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, Rocky Mountain goat, whatever that was.

Speaker 2: One of the most beautiful things that I remember, is a Chinaberry tree in bloom.  And we had two in the front yard, they were beautiful.  And of course we had a peach tree in the back and I remember, course, going to school there, which was of course a segregated school.  And what else can I remember; I remember we had a horse and buggy at one time.  And at one time we had a cow and a calf.  And we named the calf Beauty [ph.].  My brother [Frank C. Matticx] and I used to play with the calf and the calf got loose one time and followed us to school--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so we had to turn around and take him back (laughter).
Speaker 1: So the calf would play with you just like a dog or something or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, we'd play with him and of course as he grew older, you know, we couldn't play with him after he grew older 'cause you know, he was getting to be a young bull.  But he still followed us--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --to school and we had to turn around and take him back to scho- back home, that I remember.  And, what else do I remember?  My mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] taught Sunday school in Meridian [Mississippi], in St. Paul A.M.E Church [sic. St. Paul United Methodist Church, Meridian, Mississippi].  She taught Sunday school; she sang in the choir, she had a beautiful soprano voice.  She sang in the choir and they--my parents went to the Epworth League, I can't pronounce that to--word.  Well, but it's a junior group of the Methodist church.  They would come home after church and have dinner then go back.  They'd leave us there at home.  My father [Frank H. Matticx] was president of the group and they would go back to that and they'd also go back at night.  And they'd leave us at home and I guess that would be child, child cruelty now wouldn't it (laughter)?

Speaker 1: Now what did Meridian [Mississippi] look like in those days were there--try to give us some kind of description of what it looked like, I mean, what, what were the streets like in the town or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the streets were not paved.  I don't think there were any sidewalks, I can't remember a sidewalk.  And, our lot sha- shaped back to the next street which was behind us.  There were, there were no houses back there, the streetcar ran back there.  We were on 28th Avenue and this was 29th Street car, uh-huh.  And that I remember and we had a garden and my father [Frank H. Matticx] always planted flowers at the end of the garden, at the end of each row because the toilet was back in the, privy back at the end of the garden.  And of course along this path going back there through the garden he'd have these flowers on each side that you would go through.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so that made it, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sounds pretty, you know, like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So did you have a car in Meridian?

Story_ID: 372646
Speaker 1: Now you said--now you went to school at a--did, did the college have a grade school attached to it, or, or did you, was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did--
Speaker 1: --a separate school--
Speaker 2: --have a--it did have, Meridian Academy [Meridian, Mississippi] had a school and I, we went there, but, I was in second grade and my brother [Frank C. Matticx] was in what they called primer, which is kindergarten now.  And the teacher there used to discipline the children with a buggy whip.
Speaker 1: Hm, now that seems a little hard these days.
Speaker 2: Very much so, and--
Speaker 1: Was that considered unusual then, for--
Speaker 2: I think so.  'Cause teachers used a strap, they'd whip you in school some teachers had you hold out your hand and some teachers.  And some teachers would have you hold out your hand and some teachers would whip you in the back.  But any way--
Speaker 1: With a strap or a, a ruler or something, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, with a strap.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this teacher had this buggy whip and she decided--some little girl across the way passed a note she asked me to pass this note to somebody on the other side of me and that which I did.  The teacher saw me with the note and thought I had it and I told her I didn't have it she told--said I was calling her a lie and so on so she took this buggy whip and she whipped me and she whipped me and I was so stubborn I wouldn't, I wouldn't cry, I didn't say a word until she stopped and then I started screaming and I screamed so loud that the principal came downstairs to see what was happening.  I was on my way out the door then, I was going home.  And (laughter), my brother came right behind him, "Where are you going young man?"  "Going with my sister, she--."  "You can't leave without permission."  "She didn't get no mission." (Laughter) So, but anyway, this teacher for some reason she and the principal came to the house because our money was--you had to pay to go to Meridian Academy and our money was there on the first of the month every month, you know, that's the way my father [Frank H. Matticx] was.  So they came and (laughter), I was hiding under the porch and mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] was talking to this teacher.  So she finally told me, "Come out from under the porch Zonia [HistoryMaker Zonia T. Way]."  So I did and she took my--dresses opened in the back then, she said, "I want you to look at my child's back, this is what you did to her and she is not going back to that school."  So that's when I started going to public school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the public school, do you remember?
Speaker 2: God, just a black school, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well sometimes they call 'em a colored school, Meridian colored school or the--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --county, they, they name them after the county or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No well I, I don't know 'cause I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't there that long.
Speaker 1: And, how old were you when, when this happened, when this buggy whipping happened?
Speaker 2: Well I was in second grade so I don't know what--
Speaker 1: Seven, seven years old something like, yeah.
Speaker 2: About like that. Uh-huh--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --somewhere along there.
Speaker 1: So you went to the public school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, they usually have 'em, have some kind of name that has to do with it being a colored school in the county, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All I know--
Speaker 1: --county was that in Meridian [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Lauderdale County [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Lauderdale County, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 372647
Speaker 1: So your mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] was still teaching at Meridian Academy [Meridian, Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: She wasn't?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, she had to stop, that's right because she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When she got married--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --she had to stop--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right
Speaker 2: --and she was a dressmaker.

Speaker 2: Taught me how to sew.
Speaker 1: So I, I guess you probably liked public school better than--
Speaker 2: I guess so, I probably did, I don't know.
Speaker 1: The teacher didn't have a buggy whip did she, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well my teacher (laughter) was a good friend of mother's, Alice Wilson [ph.], I'll never forget her name.  And I was acting up, shaking my hair and all this other stuff so she told me, "Sit up Zonia [HistoryMaker Zonia T. Way], you're not the only little girl with long hair." And I just kept up, so she (claps hands), you know, disciplined me.  And I went home, told my mother, "Miss Alice Wilson whipped me."  "She did?"  (Laughter) "Come here."  "Whap, whap, whap," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: She got the hair brush, "If Alice Wilson whipped you she had a reason."  I thought she was gone get mad like she did (laughter)--defend me.  I was something else; I was a trip (laughter).

Story_ID: 372648
Speaker 1: I guess now, now you're going to public school now.  Did you have a favorite subject in school, when you went to school?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't have a favorite subject.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was good in all of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I had to be, my dad [Frank H. Matticx] was quite a scholar and he insisted on my getting my homework and all of that sort of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, how did you father get in trouble, now what, tell, tell, tell us that story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He fought the boss' son.  For some reason he was a--my father worked in a compress and--cotton compress, and somehow or other, well as I said, he had a quick temper, somehow or other he fought the boss' son.  So, of course you know that was a no-no, for a black man to put his hand on a white man's--you know.  So he had to leave.  We left Meridian [Mississippi], he left, but we had to leave our house.  I remember we left the food on the table, we went to a friend's house and stayed there in hiding, Mama [Virginia Shields Matticx] sent me back to get something out of the house and I climbed in the window and I remember seeing food on the table and a syrup jar open and a little mouse in there, that made me remember that, you know.  And, but from there we went to Mobile [Alabama], which was my father's home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course he went there too, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's how we left Meridian.
Speaker 1: So was your father born in Mobile?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 372649
Speaker 1: How did you like Mobile [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I loved Mobile, I loved Mobile 'cause we had cousins and, you know, people to play with and everything.  I liked Mobile, I still like Mobile.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what--do you remember the name of the school you attended in Mobile?
Speaker 2: Broad Street [Broad Street Academy, Mobile, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, Broad Street.  Are, are there any stories about Mobile that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I remember going, going crabbing one time.  And the way we did that we sat on the wharf, tied a piece of meat on a string, let it down into the bay and pulled it up slowly and as it got almost to the surface you grab--put a net under it because when a crab got to the surface he'd drop off, you know, if you didn't.  So we did that and we got a whole bag full of crabs.  My dad [Frank H. Matticx] and I, and I went with my, my brother [Frank C. Matticx] didn't do anything.  He played around, he was younger than I and when we got home somehow or other those crabs got out of the (laughter) outta, outta the bag, my mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] got up on the table (laughter), was standing up there on the table 'til we got all those crabs.  And my dad showed me how to pick up a crab, you put a, a, just stepped on him and picked him up by the back, you know, 'cause otherwise those claws get a hold of you that's it.
Speaker 1: Are they pretty strong?
Speaker 2: Very, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we caught all those cla- crabs and course we had crab gumbo and everything else (laughter) that we--you could think of with crabs.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay--
Speaker 2: But, he was working, what did he make?  A dollar a day and a stalk of bananas, they gave you a stalk, he was unloading banana boats.  They'd give you a stalk of bananas when you started working, which we hung behind the stove so they would ripen.  And when he got out of work, I remember, all we had to eat was a jar of mustard, a loaf of bread and those bananas.  This was in Meridian [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: My mother dared us to tell my auntie, she would go up to my auntie's house we went up there every day and she would dare us to tell her we were hungry.  That was pride, foolish pride really.  But it was pride and that's all we had to eat for, oh, few days, you know, so (unclear) she would--mama put this mustard on the bread and told us it was good and we believed her (laughter), uh-huh.  And that was something.  And after we left Meridian, where did we go?
Speaker 1: Well, Mobile?
Speaker 2: No, no, after we left Mobile--
Speaker 1: Mobile, yeah.
Speaker 2: --after we left Mobile we went to Grenada [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: How, how long did you live in Mobile, do you think, about--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Was it short period of time?
Speaker 2: It must've been about a year or so at least--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I remember going to school there, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 372650
Speaker 1: And you went to Grenada [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You went to Grenada, after?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah, Grenada after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is Grenada, Mississippi or--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He [Way's father, Frank H. Matticx] got a job in the saw mill there and that's when my mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] became ill.  That was a tough time; that was a tough time.  We, had a house across from the mill and my moth- my father would come home about an hour before time and get things--cook, but on a pot of soup and stuff and she would try to work, you know, cook and everything.  And they would--it was right across from the saw mill and they would come over, men would come over and eat after that and, interesting, you know it was segregation so the white men ate in the dining room and the black men ate out on the porch which was a screened in porch.  But in the summertime that was a fine thing (laughter) 'cause that dining room was hot.  But, that I remember, and I remember one time I guess we were bothering mama 'cause she was sick then, and my dad took us in a boat, a boat ride on the river, Pearl River, believe it or not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pearl River, right, yeah, I've heard of that, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was Pearl River.  Uh-huh, yeah.  And, we came to an island and we got off and got on this island, there was a fruit tree there.  I don't remember what kind of fruit but I remember I had a little apron on and I got some fruit and had it in this little apron I brought home, and riding there, that I remember that.  And I remember going out in the country to see some friends of his, friends of his was making syrup and he wanted us to see how this syrup was made, sugarcane, and they horse--you know about that?  The horse, they had a horse, some kind of way the horse walked around in a circle grinding this sugarcane and then, of course they put it in these troughs and cook it.  That I remember seeing, and mama's--when mama got sick, that was in Grenada, my dad left to try to find work, went to Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  We were rooming, we were rooming and I guess the person thought--lady thought she had something contagious because she had a house in the back, she put us out here.  We had to stay out there, but she would cook for us and we'd have to go and get the food and she would sometimes bring it and set it--she wouldn't come in the house where Mama was but she'd set it on the floor and we'd take it over there to her.  But she couldn't eat (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, w--
Story_ID: 372651
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Virginia Shields Matticx] have, what was, what was wrong?
Speaker 2: I don't know what her problem was; I really don't know what her problem was.  But I know--
Speaker 1: Did you suspect, I mean did, did this woman suspect that she had tu- TB [tuberculosis] or something, or what, what--
Speaker 2: I--they thought, I guess they thought that, but she didn't.  I think, I'm not too sure, but I think it was a botched abortion.  I have a feeling that was what it was, uh-huh.  And when we got ready to leave there my dad [Frank H. Matticx] had started a men's club there and they--couple of the men got a wagon and put Mama in a cot in this wagon, took us to the train station and we--'cause we were going to, to Hattiesburg [Mississippi] where he was.  And when we got there, no we had to change trains I think it was--anyway, yeah, we had to change trains in Jackson [Mississippi], and she had to be in the boxcar, in the boxcar, you know, in the, where they had the trunks, a baggage car.  But this guy who had charge of that use--had the door, kept the door open and we sat with our little legs hanging over (laughter) on the side, you know.  And he would bring Mama water.  He was very good old man.  But then we got to Merid- got to Hattiesburg--no we got to Jackson, we had to change trains there and my father met us at Jackson and we went from there to Hattiesburg.  And we were there in a boarding house, that's where my mother died (crying).
Speaker 1: Take your time.
Speaker 2: I remember I woke up in the middle of the night and the light was on, lamp, and, and the landlady was there with this lamp, holding the lamp.  And I remember my mother saying, "Frank, I don't wanna leave my children." That's when she died (crying).
Story_ID: 372652
Speaker 1: You go ahead now.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, after mama [Virginia Shields Matticx] died we moved we moved up, up on the hill in, in--this is still in Hattiesburg [Mississippi], and we moved right across--there were three brothers in Mississippi who were doctors, the name was Howard [ph.], one of them moved back to--moved to Chicago [Illinois], one was in Meridian [Mississippi], one was in Hattiesburg and one was someplace else, but anyway, they left, Dr. Howard's home was right across the street from where we were rooming and Miss Howard used to have me come over and play with her daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, they, there were three, three brothers that all, they were all doctors?
Speaker 2: The Howard brothers, yeah.
Speaker 1: They were all doctors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well one was a phys- one was a, a pharmacist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And two were brothers.
Speaker 1: Doctors, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, one moved to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We knew them afterwards, uh-huh.  And, anyway, Miss Howard was, she was very kind to me, she would have me to come over and play with her daughter and all, you know, and I don't remember what happened to my brother [Frank C. Matticx], where he played or anything of this sort, I just remember what I did.  And then later my father [Frank H. Matticx] bought, didn't buy but rented I guess a hotel there in, in the, it was right across the street from the pharmacy, drugstore.  And he ran this hotel for a while, then, he left there, came to Chicago and he left my brother and I there with his friend.  She was very good to us, but she turned the hotel into a cathouse.  And that's where, you know, we were there.
Speaker 1: So you were there while this was going on?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The hotel becomes a cathouse?
Speaker 2: --yes, yes, and there was--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --an old man had a shoe shop, shoe repair shop across the street and he wrote to my father and told him what was going on and he should send for us that we should not stay there.  And which he, he sent money to his sister in Mobile [Alabama] to come and get us and, because he was single, you know, here in Chicago and auntie came and I remember (laughter) she said when she got off the train and she asked the guy, they called them hacks then, it was taxi now but, you know, horse and buggy.  He asked--she asked him to take her to the Grenada hotel [sic.], he said, "Missy you don't wanna go there, I can tell you another nice place you can stay."  She said, "No, I'm going to get those chil- my children, my brother's children."  He said, "Oh thank God," you know.  So anyway, she came and got us and unfortunately, Miss Burnside [ph.], decided not to give us my mother's trunk, which had a lot of her things in it.
Speaker 1: So Miss Burnside was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the lady's that we were staying, well, my father's girlfriend when they had, when he was there.  She ran this place, trunk was upstairs and then they had little, little bit of a trunk that she put our things in and told auntie that was our trunk and I didn't dispute her, so all of Mama's paraphernalia and stuff was left there.  I don't know why she wanted it but anyway, she did.  Well, her silverware, everything was in there, uh-huh.  So I guess that's what she wanted, but anyway, that's how we went to Mobile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we stayed in Mobile with my auntie.
Story_ID: 372653
Speaker 1: So you moved back to Mobile [Alabama], I guess with your aunt then, right?  And you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and, okay.

Speaker 2: Yeah when I came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay in Mobile the second time?  Were you there a long time?
Speaker 2: This I don't remember.

Speaker 2: I know, I, I think it might have been two years.
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: Might've been one year.

Story_ID: 372654
Speaker 1: I guess Chicago [Illinois] was quite a change from Mobile [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely a change, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, what was different or how--what were your impressions of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well the first place, going to school, going to a school that was mixed school because there was whites and blacks in Doolittle [James R. Doolittle Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because on the other side of cat- of Cottage Grove [Avenue] there was all white people lived there.  And, this was a, you know, and that was a, that was an experience.
Speaker 1: Okay so the, the, east side of Cottage Grove towards the lake [Lake Michigan] was all white?
Speaker 2: All white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All white.
Speaker 1: It's a, it's black now, but in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was white--
Speaker 2: It was all white then.
Speaker 1: --and Cottage Grove divided--
Speaker 2: That was the dividing line.
Speaker 1: --the black and white community--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the way it does now in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] I guess, when you get to Hyde Park now, Cottage Grove (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --is, is a dividing line sort of.
Speaker 2: --that would have been Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois], you know, all the way to 35th Street, from 35th Street south.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did it look like then, 'cause did--nowadays (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, to me--
Speaker 1: --you know, there's nothing--
Speaker 2: --it looked like paradise (laughter).
Speaker 1: --it's flattened out, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had a house that, you know, was two story, three story house and all this sort of stuff.  And I had never, you know, experienced anything, indoor toilets and all this sort of stuff, telephone.  I had never experienced anything like that, so that was interesting, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, excuse me, and that area across Cottage Grove, that was, that was--was that mostly a Jewish community then, across from Cottage Grove (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I think, I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was--I, I know at some point it was but I don't if--
Speaker 2: It was further south I know it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know whether it was Jewish there.  But I know that--
Speaker 1: Where the--was, was the Oakland Theater [Oakland Square Theater, Chicago, Illinois] there then?
Speaker 2: I suppose so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't--where we went was the Pickford Theater [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the States Theater [Chicago, Illinois] over on State Street.  We used to go to see, it was, oh, William, I've forgotten now, but anyway, it was a serial, we'd--
Speaker 1: Oh, the cowboy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: William S. Hart?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We'd go (laughter) every Sunday afternoon, we'd go and my dad [Frank H. Matticx] would give us a quarter a piece and we would go and I think it cost a dime to go to the show and we always, coming back, we would buy these little faded flowers, the guy was on the side of the road--street, at 35th Street selling flowers.  We'd buy out of this quarter, we'd save--quarter, we'd save enough money to buy flowers and bring them home to my stepmother [Grace Garnett Matticx].  Always brought (unclear), I don't think they lasted (laughter) the whole day but that's what we would do.
Story_ID: 372655
Speaker 1: So did you like your stepmother pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yes I liked her, she was very good.  My dad [Frank H. Matticx] at that time was still (slaps hands) whipping you, but she told him one time, she said, "If you whip that girl one more time, I'll leave you, you're not gonna do it."  So he didn't, but she took over and she could punish, tell me she knew--could think of punishments that you'd never thought about in your life (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Like for instance?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, she would go downtown every Saturday to buy, to Hillman's [Chicago, Illinois] to buy butter and stuff like that.  And, I was supposed to scrub the kitchen floor, only chore I had, I would take a room--I always read a lot, I'd take my book, get in the bed, which was a sofa that folded out and get in this bed and read 'til about time for her to come back.  Then I'd jump up put the--make the bed up and I'd be in the kitchen scrubbing, well now she knew darn well I wasn't scrubbing the kitchen floor all that time.  So, one day she doubled back and I told her well I was tired so that's why I got in the bed.  So she didn't say anything, but the next Saturday she said, "Okay," after I washed the dishes she said, "Okay Zonia [HistoryMaker Zonia T. Way], you make your bed, now you're still tired."  I'm tired.  So I got in the bed, that was all right, kids were--this was an English basement house, you know, this was an English basement and the kids--my brother [Frank C. Matticx] told everybody I was in the bed, you know, and they'd come to the window and holler and tease me and everything, that was all right.  Dinner time came, "Okay Zonia, make up your bed and come on and have dinner."  I washed the dishes, she said, "Okay, get back in the bed."  That's what killed me, that really killed me, but I wasn't tired any more after that (laughter).  But that's, that's an example of the kind of punishments she would think of things that she knew would hurt you, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What, what was your stepmother's name?
Speaker 2: Grace, Grace Abney Matticx [Grace Garnett Matticx].
Speaker 1: Abney, that's A-B-N-E-Y?

Speaker 2: (Laughter) Why do you say that?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He was, he was very eccentric.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very eccentric and I remember my husband [Walker V. Thomas], this was after I was married, my husband was--he became infected, something happened, he stuck an infected needle in his hand and he was all swollen up, you know (laughter).  He woke up that morning and turned over and looked at me and his face was as flat as my hand, scared me to death.  So we called Lawless, he said, "Bring him in."  So we came, you know he lived right down the street there and we went in there all these people waiting, you know, he--you--cars lined up, you know, to see him because he was really very good at infections and so on, skin disease.  But anyway (laughter), he looked out there and saw my husband, he said, "You come on in here, you're a hell of a doctor, out there looking like this."  And he--but he said, "You--I got to--you sent me to the books.  You been down to Sunset Hills [Missouri] recently?"  He said, "Yes, I was down."  "Were you out on the riverfront?"  He said--we cleaned off the lot down there that we had, so he looked and he had--there's one time of the year that whatever this weed is, it's poisonous and that, of course, was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what happened--
Speaker 1: --time that he did it and that's what he--but he had him sit there, "I got to go back to the books for you." You know, and he looked it up and gave him something which, of course, brought the swelling down and everything.  But Dr. Lawless was very good, but as I said, he was very eccentric.  Never married and his sister [Gertrude Martin] inherited his home, his property, his home, had a beautiful home.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know whether that was a year after--
Speaker 1: It was 1919.
Speaker 2: Was it 1919?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was a year after, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know we were--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --still living on Vernon Avenue.  Because at that time, as I said, there was a streetcar strike too and that helped a lot because the 35th Street and on 31st Street too, and all the other streetcars, you know, went west and West Side [Chicago, Illinois] was all white too, all over in there.  So had they gone--been on those streetcars--cause when they first started they would pull the blacks off the streetcars and beat 'em and they'd have to run back over on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  So my dad [Frank H. Matticx] didn't get into that, he worked over in the stockyards where they didn't get into that, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So he didn't have any trouble during the riots?
Speaker 2: No, he stayed home.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: It didn't--no.
Speaker 1: They didn't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was--he sat out there on the, on the steps and so did I, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't--it didn't affect us.  It was more State Street and to the north of us, we were 36th [Street] and Vernon and it was little bit more State Street and Wabash [Avenue] and around 31st or 33rd [Street] somewhere around in there, more or less.  That's where most of it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, so--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --it didn't affect us at all.
Speaker 1: All right so you really didn't see anything associated with it?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did, did people talk about it a lot after it happened?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes they talked about it but I don't remember, I don't--I was a kid, I wouldn't pay any attention to that.

Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I know I was in the library; I was looking through old Chicago Defenders and I was just--some of the coverage of the lynchings in the Defender were just--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Were really gut-wrenching, I mean--
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: --and, and this was every week--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --pretty much, they'd have a story like that.
Speaker 2: I remember my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] said that when Abbott [Robert Sengstacke Abbott] first started the Defender he would, would sell 'em too.  He'd, they'd print 'em and then he'd sell 'em.  And he was standing just off the sidewalk selling and mother came along, she and her brother were together and mother spoke to him and bought a Defender and (laughter) she said her brother said (laughter), "Why," he was a, he was a dentist, "why do you wanna speak to that old guy standing there in the, in the gutter?"  She said, "He was a man wasn't he?"  You know, that was the attitude of some of the people in Chicago [Illinois].  People as, as someone said one time, somebody who was somebody (background noise)--
Story_ID: 372665
Speaker 1: We were talking about the Defender [Chicago Defender].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--the Defender, he [Robert Sengstacke Abbott] would have the Defender printed and then he would distribute it and sell it himself, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that, that's remarkable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I don't think people realize that it was that intense.  He had to actually sell it--
Speaker 2: He had to do--
Speaker 1: --on the street himself
Speaker 2: --that, uh-huh.  And, stand on the side of the sidewalk and, as I said, Uncle Bud [ph.] wanna know, "Why you wanna (laughter) (unclear) stand down there in the, in the gutter?"
Speaker 1: So he wasn't considered a big shot then?
Speaker 2: Not--he wasn't, he got, became a big shot later, uh-huh (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: What about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, everybody belonged to that.

Speaker 1: You went to Doolittle School [James R. Doolittle Jr. Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Doolittle.
Speaker 1: All right, and then to--
Speaker 2: Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, Hyde Park High School, and--now how did you like--Hyde Park High School in those days was--
Speaker 2: Hyde Park High School was practically all white.  There were about, I understand, there were five hundred black kids there, but there were two thousand students, so you know, you--I know there was, I was always the only black person in my class when I went to class.  Except one class, one class I don't remember now what class it was but Selden Yerby was in that class, the Yerbys were in Chicago [Illinois] so called society (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay was the writer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was, he, no his, his uncle was a, an ambassador to something, I can't remember now, 'cause, you know, I was in high school, wasn't paying that much attention to that.  But the Yerbys were, they were somebody.
Speaker 1: Was the writer Frank Yerby, related to those Yerbys?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, well how did you like--Hy- Hyde Park High School?
Speaker 2: I liked Hyde Park, I liked Hyde Park.  We had quite a few friends, you know, and everything and I liked it.  I had to give a false address to go there, but--
Speaker 1: Well, why did you go--I mean, was it because--
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna go to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause most of the black went to Phillips, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that was, that was the black high school, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: In those days?
Speaker 2: There was, in--I just didn't wanna go there, so I had to give another address.  Where did he tell me to have these glasses, uh-huh?
Speaker 1: Now did you think you'd get a better education in Hyde Park than Phillips?
Speaker 2: I think so, I probably did.  I know it was my decision to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, so, what--did you take like a college course or what?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] decided that I should take the two-year course; they used to give two-year courses there.  Two-year course in domestic something or other I don't remember what it was but I know it was kind of a dummy course although I got very good grades in all the, the--everything that I took.  But that was her decision, not mine.
Speaker 1: So you went two years in high school instead of four?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And you didn't graduate, you didn't get a diploma, you got a certificate, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, so, that was her decision but you didn't--did you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: There's nothing you could --
Speaker 2: --that's what she told me to do, so that's what I did, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, you got outta school in, what, 1921, was that it?
Speaker 2: It was around that time, yes.
Speaker 1: You were, you would have been, about, about sixteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I was--
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You were, when you were fifteen?
Speaker 2: When I got out of there I was, no, I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I married when I was nineteen.
Story_ID: 372668
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that you really liked or, or that really showed an interest (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was one teacher that I really liked and she was a, I think she was a science teacher, I'm not too sure.  But anyway, Miss Roth [ph.], her name was.  I liked her very much, but the rest of them, you know, it was all right.  Oh and, and my English teacher, I loved him.  He was such a nice--and he was a very, very good teacher too, very excellent teacher.  And, when he later transferred to Crane Junior High [Richard T. Crane Junior High School, Chicago, Illinois], my sister-in-law was going there then and I suggested that she get him, you know, you could pick your teachers--class teachers and all so I said, "Be sure to get Mr. Smith [ph.] for your teacher because he's a very good teacher."  And I tell this too, at board of education they decided that so many kids had come up from the South, who knew nothing about grammar, that instead of teaching grammar they would teach you--you would write compositions and all of this sort of stuff.  I was in that group so I never had a grammar class, didn't know anything and that--Mr. Smith was so disgusted when I told him that until after that they changed it.  He must have done something, said something to somebody.  But I know that my brother [Frank C. Matticx]--they taught grammar again in the grammar schools.  But at that time they would just have you write compositions and you'd read it and all that sort of stuff but no grammar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know gramm- much grammar now (laughter).
Story_ID: 372669
Speaker 1: Did you have an idea of what you wanted to do after school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I mean after you got outta school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I thought that I wanted to go back south and teach school down there.
Speaker 1: So you wanted to be a school teacher in the South?
Speaker 2: And you didn't have to--you could just finish high school, you, you could go on down there and teach.  It--what they did, I know for Mobile [Alabama], you'd teach out in the country for a couple of years and then they'd bring you into the city to teach. And that's what I wanted to do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, so, so what did you do once you did graduate?  I mean--
Speaker 2: What did I do?
Speaker 1: --I mean once--
Speaker 2: I didn't graduate.
Speaker 1: --you finished, yeah, once, once you got your certificate--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --what did you do?
Speaker 2: I worked in a hat shop on 35th Street, made hats.
Speaker 1: Okay, had, had you ever--did you have any sewing skills before that or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I always--I took sewing in school too.  That was part of the program.  But also my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] had taught me how to sew too when I was little, little bit of a girl, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were ready for that I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, so, so how, how long did you work in a hat shop and did you--
Speaker 2: About, about a year.
Story_ID: 372670
Speaker 1: And in the meantime I had met my husband, he--my father [Frank H. Matticx] ran on the road for a short while and he--Walker [Walker V. Thomas], ran on the road while he was in school, you know, in the summertime.  And my dad was quite a braggart and he had told him, you know, we had this big house and come to see him when he was in Chicago [Illinois] and blah, blah, and I have a Marmon car sitting out in the front, Marmon car belonged to the roomer (laughter).  But anyway, the first time Walker came we were sitting, we were in the back in the dining room--that was when you could leave your front door open, not locked or anything, just open to get some fresh air.  We were back there eating some watermelon and he came to the door, "Like to speak to Mr. Matticx please."  And, he--we were, we all got up, "Come on we're gonna go out and sit on the porch."  That house that we had had a big front porch, only one in that block had this big porch and we went out and I went and sat where I thought he was gonna sit and I had just seen him (laughter) and I think I was about sixteen or seventeen then.  And--no I was sixteen 'cause I was still in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I sat where I thought he was gonna sit, but my father sat there (laughter).  But anyway, "Show Dr. Thomas your report card, show Dr. Thomas--."  I didn't wanna show him my report card.  I didn't wanna say I was in high school; I wanted to be as old as he was.  That was, I guess love at first sight, huh?
Speaker 2: Okay, I guess--
Speaker 1: Must've been.
Speaker 2: So, so, your, your, husband was already, already finished with school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: He was, he was practicing--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, he had just come--
Speaker 2: --dentistry.
Speaker 1: --to Chicago to practice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He had decided he would come.  Well I--and then--but at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where--
Speaker 1: --he was still in school I think he had one more year or something 'cause he was running on the road too, with my husband--with my father.  But anyway, I had asked my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] about him and she said, "Well he said he's gonna practice in St. Louis [Missouri]."  And that's where he was going--so I went on and got married to somebody else.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, and I never will forget he called one day, "Like to speak to Mr. Matticx please," and Jack [ph.] was in the kitchen, telephone was in a little hallway just off the kitchen and I said, talked to him, "He's not here, who's speaking?'  "This is Dr. Thomas speaking."  And Jack was looking so I said, "You know I'm married now?"  And he didn't say anything, I repeated it and then he said, "Is that so?  Well tell Mr. Matticx I called."  I looked at Jack, I said, "I know I don't want you." (Laughter) So I got rid of him.
Story_ID: 372671
Speaker 1: Now how did you meet Jack [ph.], now, who, who is he?
Speaker 2: Oh he was one of the, he was one of the guys who used to dress up on Sunday and stand in front of the Vendome Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You remember anything about that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Okay, at that Vendome Theater, Erskine Tate was an orchestra leader down there and he always played and the guys used to dress all up in this one suit they had and stand outside and watch the girls go in.  Jack was one of those, but somehow, I don't remember how I met him, but I met him through somebody else and we got together and decided we'd get married, which was the wrong thing to do.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, we did anyway and he told me--I packed his trunk, at that time people had trunks, packed his trunk for him.  He said, "Okay," he said, "I guess the next time I see you you'll be married to some little doctor or something?"  I said, "No Jack, I just want somebody who will take care of me."  You know, 'cause he didn't have much of a job or anything you know, he was right.
Story_ID: 372672
Speaker 1: Well, so you just told Jack [ph.] he had to go?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  I think he was as willing to go (laughter) as I, I was to--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --get rid of him.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), it wasn't a good idea, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not, no--
Speaker 1: The marriage was not a good idea.
Speaker 2: --we just didn't hit it off period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So how, how long had you been married when--
Speaker 2: I think, let's see, I think it was about four or five months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, we just didn't--it didn't get along at all.
Story_ID: 372673
Speaker 1: So what happened then, after Jack [ph.] left did you, did you call the doctor up and (laughter) let him know (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  No I didn't.  I worked for a while and--in the hat shop and then I got a divorce from Jack but in the meantime I think I had--I know I had gotten--somehow or another we had gotten together, you know, he and I, Walker [Walker V. Thomas] and I had.  Because he had been gone, we had been going together and when I got my divorce papers I went by the office, showed them to him.  He said, "Let's get married."  So we did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had set up an office here in Chicago [Illinois] and was ready (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes he had--and--35th [Street] and State Street, 35--
Speaker 1: So, you got married in 1925 I think, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is that it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, 1925, okay.  Now, let's see, I think there was something else that happened that year too, I believe that--trying to, hold on for a second. Oh that's not it. Well, well what happened after you got married? Did--
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you have to quit working again or--
Speaker 2: No, I was working in a, in a, a hat shop there on 35th Street and you know at that time men didn't like for their wives to work so he finally persuaded me to stop working.  He didn't have to do much persuading, persuasion.
Story_ID: 372674
Speaker 1: But you got involved in a lot of civic activities in the city right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Around that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, through--my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] influenced me to join the League of Women Voters and I worked with them.  At that time they had a separate league for the black women on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  It was the Douglass League of Women Voters.
Speaker 1: Was it named after--
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Douglass League of Women Voters anyway, and I later became president of that league.  I also was on the Cook County board of the, of the county board, League of Women Voters and as a result I had to go to the meetings downtown.  It was on Michigan Avenue, we were on Michigan Avenue at that time.  Had to go to meetings and I remember there was a young woman from the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], she and I both had daughters.  Our daughters were in college, away in, away in school.  Virginia [Virginia Thomas] was at Virgin- at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and her daughter was at the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona] and we used to talk about our daughters being in school and all.  And we broke--one day we were there at a meeting and she--we broke to go to lunch and she said, "Come on we'll go to such-and-such, a place."  I said, "I can't go there."  No, I said, "No," I said, "We'll go to a dime store."  She said, "Oh, who wants to go to the dime store?"  I said, "Well that's where I have to go.  They wouldn't feed me there where you were," which they didn't at that time, so.  She said, "I didn't know that."  I said, "Well that's what it is, that's the way it is."
Speaker 1: And, wha- about what year is this, this is--
Speaker 2: Now what year would it be?  It was about a year before; it was about a year before they started making people accept you in all the restaurants and everything.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was this in the '50s [1950s] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifties [1950s] (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Yeah, and you said your daughter was away in school, in college?
Speaker 2: She was in, at Hampton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh
Speaker 1: Well it seems like we skipped over a lot of time here (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: We got you from, from getting married to, she's in college so, so what, what happened in between, what happened in between time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, what happened in between?

And, it was--what else can I tell you about it?  Grand Boulevard [Chicago, Illinois], which of course started at 35th Street and went south to 51st Street, and on this side of the street where Paul G.

Speaker 1: Tryin' to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know he was at 355, was the north side 'cause he moved across the street to the south side because there was a, an apartment, you know back of the office, office had an apartment.  Nobody had lived there for many years because it was a fur shop down below and they used to use that for storage and for a long time after I moved for about a month I wouldn't cook in the kitchen because it, it needed to be cleaned and a man came along, this is during the Depression, and I was cooking on a stove, you know, little electric stove in the office.  And he smelled the food and he came up and asked us if he could give him some food.  Which we did and Walker [Walker V. Thomas] says, "Well," he said, "anything I can do?"  He said, "Yes you can wash the kitchen walls for my wife 'cause she won't ci- cook back there."  Which he did so we fed him that day, that's how things were in those, in, in the '30s [1930s], 1933.

Speaker 1: In those days there's no medic- no, no dental insurance or any of that kind of thing so--
Speaker 2: When it came up later they told the physicians how much they should charge and told the dentists how much they should charge and he said, "I'll be darned if I'm gonna work for that little bit of money."  So he was a rebel (laughter), but he had a hard time getting his money though.  Easter time I remember people would come in with all they hat boxes and all this sort of stuff, "I can't pay you today Doc, I had to buy the old lady this and I had to buy this and so on."  And I'm sitting up there waiting for him to make at least a dollar so I could go downstairs and buy some food for my children [Virginia Thomas and Walker D. Thomas].
Speaker 1: Things were really tight.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: The dentist family has to, has to struggle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See now the, the, physician--
Speaker 1: --and wait for--
Speaker 2: --can, didn't have to worry because he didn't have to have an office.  His office was in his bag, but for a dentist, he had to have all this set up, start with all this money to start out even, you know, and he, he had it kind of tight.

Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So was, was it very tough after he died, I mean for you, I--did you--
Speaker 2: Yes it was tough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I had that, oh I forgot I have to (laughter), I forgot these.  It was very tough 'cause we had--my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] had turned the house over to us and she moved to California and it was tough, it was tough for me because I didn't work, I didn't have a job.  Had not had a job; didn't know anything about working.  And at that time they were beginning to buy houses in that area for Lake Meadows [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], we had fought it, we founded an organization down there, and we had fought it very hard.  I remember Lillian O'Neal [ph.] and a number of others of us who got a group together trying to save our homes.  But they didn't do it, they didn't do it, no way, uh-huh.  And so I had to move out, I had to sell my house to the city and I remember after I sold my house they--I was moved out south and I was on the bus going home, going downtown past my house and there was a hole where my house would be and I just sat there on that bus and cried all the way downtown.  Our house, there were ten houses in that block and our house was the one that the builder decided to build for himself, remodel for himself.  The, the dining room woodwork was maple, the floors were quarter sawn oak with parquet going around the edge all the way upstairs, it was a beautiful home, a beautiful place, and they took it.
Story_ID: 372685
Speaker 1: When was it that, that they took your house, your home, for?  The, the city claimed--
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941] was it, '41 [1941] I think.
Speaker 1: Was that before your husband [Walker V. Thomas] died they did that?
Speaker 2: No, he had died.
Speaker 1: Yeah so '50 [1950], maybe '51 [1951]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, it could've been '50 [1950], 1950 something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I, think they started building it in the, '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s], I, I should know but I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now he died in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, how, how long did you live in the house after he passed away?
Speaker 2: Just one, one year after that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so '51 [1951], that's when they did it.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: We interviewed Fred Ford [HistoryMaker Frederick C. Ford], who worked for Draper and Kramer [Draper and Kramer, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh. I know.
Speaker 1: --who, I guess, they were the guys who--
Speaker 2: I know, tell me about it.
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I know.
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that didn't sit too well when this--
Speaker 2: No, I was at a League of Women Voters [Douglass League of Women Voters] meeting and one of the, housing chairman I think it was, had a book that spoke about taking the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] back and they said from 35th Street north and from State Street to the lake [Lake Michigan].  That's--and they had a plaque and everything right where my house was sitting they had a, gonna have a theater.  I got all upset, I bought the book, came back and told our friends, you know, you know, alerted everybody and that's when we tried to--fought hard to save our homes but what can you do.  They took them by eminent domain which means that we didn't get anything for our houses.
Speaker 1: You didn't get the value--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My father [Frank H. Matticx] paid $7,500 for that house; that was a lot of money at that time.  They gave me, it was valued at $20,000 in those days, they gave me $6,000.
Speaker 1: Less than your father paid for it.
Speaker 2: Less than he paid for it, $6,000, they were buying--"No, this is land value now."  I remember having a meeting, Arch Carey [Archibald Carey, Jr.] was there, they lived right back of us on Vernon [Avenue] and he was saying, "Well Zonia [HistoryMaker Zonia T. Way], I'm sorry but this is the best--I did what I could, but this--couldn't do anything else, this was it."
Speaker 1: Well that's just like robbery, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was, well they said they only paying for land value.  They don't care what kind of house you had, just land value (shrugs shoulders), what are you gonna do?
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: You can't fight it, no way in the world you can fight it.  But, I found out later when they were building other places, you know, they were paying them more money than we got.  We were the guinea pigs, you see, we got very little money.
Speaker 1: I think that in a city like Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They took it by eminent domain, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you think that maybe because it was a, it was in a black community that they could do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It could've been--
Speaker 1: --it a lot, a lot easier--
Speaker 2: --it could've been, I'm sure it was.  And you see that lan- land from 35th Street north was valuable.  That was valuable land at that time and (shrugs shoulders) they wanted it, so they took it.
Speaker 1: That's a real rough period of time. Your husband dies and you lose your home.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Story_ID: 372686
Speaker 1: Well what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No job had not--had never worked, well not--oh I went to California, my mother [Way's stepmother, Grace Garnett Matticx] was in California and I went out to California thought maybe--she suggested that I come out there.  So I took my little money and went out there and found out that the only jobs for black people were social workers or school teachers and I was trained for neither.
Speaker 1: Now were your children grown then?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were grown children then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my son [Walker D. Thomas] was at (Unclear), in Iowa, you know, (Unclear) College in Iowa, it's one of our congregational schools and my daughter [Virginia Thomas] was, well she didn't go back, she came home from, she was at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], she came home and saw the situation, she wouldn't go back.  I said, "Yes, your tuition is paid for the end of the year, you go back and finish out that, you know, and then you can come home."  Which she did, and, of course, she got married so (laughter) that ended that.  She met her husband at Hampton so they--she was no longer at home, I didn't have to worry about her, but I did have to worry about my son, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay now where was he?  He was in town?
Speaker 2: He was in (Unclear) at--
Speaker 1: Oh (Unclear), oh yeah--

But he's doing all right now, he's, works for the Red Cross [American Red Cross] and lives in Elg- in Bartlett [Illinois], they were in Elgin [Illinois], but they live in Bartlett now, he works for the Red Cross.

Story_ID: 372687
Speaker 1: Well, you went out to California did you stay out there long?
Speaker 2: No, I stayed out there and I put some money on a house and came back to Chicago [Illinois] and decided I didn't wanna go out there 'cause as I said there was no jobs really.  And I, a friend of mine had worked with draperies and she worked on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], so she got a job for me in this drapery shop on Lawrence Avenue and that's where I worked for quite a while.
