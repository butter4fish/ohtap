Evan Faulkenbury: Today is November 14, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury. I&#8217;m here interviewing Dr. Rosemary Fernandez Stein, here in her doctor&#8217;s office in Burlington, North Carolina, for the Southern Oral History Program. First, Dr. Stein, thanks for being here. I appreciate the time. If you wouldn&#8217;t mind beginning by telling me about growing up.
Rosemary Fernandez Stein: Great, thank you. My parents are from the Dominican Republic and they were both born in the Dominican Republic in the mid to late 1930s, and life in the Dominican Republic when they were growing up was very difficult. They grew up under a dictator. His name was Trujillo.
EF: Rafael Trujillo?
RFS: That&#8217;s right. Life during that time was very difficult. He was a dictator that was very cruel and liked to have his people subjugated under him, and you didn&#8217;t want to cross any of his rules. It seemed to be a rather safe place to live in during that time except if you got caught in Trujillo&#8217;s gaze, and then it was not very safe to be in the country. Of course everything was very oppressed. Only the industries that he wanted to go forward would go and do well, but if he didn&#8217;t want your family or your industry to do well then it would not. So he had a totalitarian dictatorship during the time that they grew up so the country was obviously very depressed during that time, and he was actually dictator I believe for about thirty years.
EF: Yeah, a long time.
RFS: And it was at the end of his dictatorship and during the time that J.F.K. was president and L.B.J. was president that the country finally broke free of this terrible state of totalitarian dictatorship. America actually helped with that, intervened, because of what had happened in Cuba, and the fear was that communists were going to take over, and that that was a very true concern. The US started to look to allow some of the refugees to come in, but also people in the Dominican Republic started to look at the US and other places abroad for them to come. Before that, the borders were pretty much closed and people who were born in the Dominican Republic would stay in the Dominican Republic unless they were the elite.
EF: Right.
RFS: So right around the 1960s I had an aunt&#8211;. Families were very big, as they were everywhere, and I had an aunt who, I guess it was late 1950s, had a husband who was cheating on her. She was very young, she was twenty-three, and she decided that she was not going to put up with that anymore and went back to her mom and said, &#8220;Mom, I can&#8217;t live with a husband who&#8217;s unfaithful to me, so I&#8217;m going to get a divorce.&#8221; The rules were very strict back then and the way things were done was you had to follow certain rules, and her grandmother became very angry at her and couldn&#8217;t understand why she couldn&#8217;t submit herself to a husband if he was supporting her, even if he was cheating on her. So my grandma decided that she would not allow her daughter to live under her roof if she was going to be a divorcee, so she had a difficult choice to make which was either you stay together with this man or you find yourself something else to do and go somewhere else, because you&#8217;re not going to be under my roof.   My aunt, her name was Pilagia &#8211; she was nicknamed Peggy &#8211; decided that she couldn&#8217;t stay in the Dominican Republic. She was going to be the first person in her family, or that she knew, to come to the United States. So she set herself up that she was going to come to the United States, and she needed a certain amount of money, so she saved up five hundred dollars from that time. Her mother awarded her a grace period so she saved up money. I don&#8217;t remember where she got this money from, but she saved up about five hundred dollars and got a visa. She was able-minded, she was a seamstress, she could do many different things. So she did get herself a visa to travel, and possibly it was an open visa at that time, so that she could pursue becoming a resident in the United States.   So she came over, all by herself, in a plane. [She] didn&#8217;t know where she was going, she didn&#8217;t have an address, but she got herself on a plane and she knew that she had enough money to figure something out. She was in the plane and was sitting together with another girl from the Dominican Republic who had a very similar thought, except that this young lady said that she was a lady of the night, and so she already had her idea on what she was going to do. She didn&#8217;t come with the five hundred dollars because she knew how to make some money. So, &#8220;If you share some of your money with me,&#8221; says the other gal, &#8220;maybe we can do better together, and you don&#8217;t have to do the things that I do but we can give each other cover and take care of each other.&#8221; So my aunt, who was a very kind person &#8211; and she has remained a very kind person &#8211; decided that she was going to take her on, and they decided together that they were going to share her money. So they were on the plane, they talk together, they get back here, and as she looks at her in the airport the other lady walks away and leaves my aunt with now two hundred and fifty dollars and alone. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s John F. Kennedy. I guess it wasn&#8217;t because he was still alive. Whatever the airport was.
EF: In New York?
RFS: In New York, what is now John F. Kennedy Airport, and she sees her friend walking away and she&#8217;s by herself and she starts to cry. A young man approaches her. She says, &#8220;Oh, no. Here&#8217;s one of these men who&#8217;s looking for the lady of the night,&#8221; and he is very kind to her and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. I&#8217;m from Cuba, we have a worse dictator than you had, and I can help you. I can see that you&#8217;re very young and you&#8217;re by yourself and I promise I won&#8217;t do you any harm.&#8221; So my aunt thought to herself, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that I can do at this point. I only have this much money, I don&#8217;t know anybody, I really didn&#8217;t think this through, and it&#8217;s getting late.&#8221;
EF: Do you know what year this was, approximately?
RFS: It was seven years before I was born, that&#8217;s 1955, 1956.
EF: Okay. So this is towards the end of Trujillo&#8217;s rule.
RFS: Yes.
EF: He ruled up until about 1960 &#8211; early 1960s?
RFS: Yes, 1961, I believe it was.
EF: Okay. Just for a little context.
RFS: Yeah, so she was one of the first people who actually got that visa to come over here. I don&#8217;t know. It was sort of a miracle.
EF: It&#8217;s incredible.
RFS: Yeah. So she came over. Long story short, the man wound up being her husband. They were in love. He fell madly in love with my aunt. She had a very difficult time getting her visa, had to go into Canada by herself, travel over there to get her green card, became a citizen within a few years of coming to New York City, and then asked for the rest of her family, even her mother, so she was a very forgiving woman.
EF: Wow.
RFS: And her three-year-old son. When she left the Dominican Republic she had a three-year-old son that she left behind with my grandmother.
EF: Oh, that must have been difficult.
RFS: So did not see him for three years so the next time she saw him he was six.
EF: Wow.
RFS: So, she starts asking for her family. Remember, she&#8217;s shown herself to work well, she&#8217;s getting towards getting her own place, she&#8217;s married now, she has a job at a factory but she&#8217;s well respected in her community. So she&#8217;s making all the right steps to be able to legally bring in her family members. So the first one she asks for is her mom, and then my father, because my father was the eldest male.
EF: Okay. Was he your aunt&#8217;s little brother?
RFS: Yes.
EF: Okay.
RFS: Just by a year or two.
EF: Okay, gotcha.
RFS: So he was dating my mom at the time and they were already talking about marriage, so they talked about whether to go out to New York and make a new life for themselves, and my mom said, &#8220;Yeah, why not.&#8221;
EF: Just go on a whim?
RFS: I guess. She didn&#8217;t have a great family life, to say the least. So this is the home my dad came from, and they were very religious. They were evangelical Christians so everything was around going to church, for my father. They were Methodists, Dominican Methodists, and so they had to go to church, the girls had to wear skirts all the time. My dad didn&#8217;t really agree with that. He was a bit of a drinker, the kind of guy Peggy wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to marry, and very good-looking, tall, guy with a bit of light eyes. So my mom came from a completely different background. My mom came from an educator&#8217;s background. My grandfather on my mother&#8217;s side was a regional superintendent and inspector for schools so he was very well thought of. His brother was actually the general superintendent for the Dominican Republic for education, so he was the whatever, the secretary of education of the Dominican Republic under Trujillo.
EF: Wow. That is high up, in the hierarchy.
RFS: Yeah. My grandmother was an assistant superintendent of schools and had her own school out of her own home for years and years and years. My grandmother and her sister, my great-aunt, developed a curriculum that went all the way up to twelfth grade, which was at that time, and for years and years, nationally known and used in public schools in the Dominican Republic. So this is the background that my mother grew up in. They were all educators, they were all encouraged to be educators, so when my mom went to school I think that she began as an accountant, because she wanted to break away from that education background, but with the view that she would go back and maybe do a master&#8217;s in education or something like that.   So she was in this very regressive environment where she wasn&#8217;t allowed to look at boys, see boys. My grandmother was a very negative person and she picked on my mother more than the other girls and boys &#8211; there were seven &#8211; in the family, so my mother felt ostracized. There was a guy who wanted to date her who was a doctor and that was discouraged because &#8211; whatever it was that was going through my grandmother&#8217;s head. So my mother saw my dad and his desire to come here as an opportunity. I&#8217;ve asked her a lot about that, I mean, &#8220;How did you do that?&#8221;
EF: Yeah.
RFS: [She said], &#8220;It was more an opportunity. I&#8217;m not sure that I was really that enamored of him.&#8221;
EF: But it was a good chance.
RFS: But he sure did look better after he was going to go to the United States.
EF: Oh, wow. That&#8217;s so funny.
RFS: That&#8217;s an interesting way to see that. So they embarked on a plane. I think my father actually came first and then they corresponded back and forth and he asked her to marry him and she said yes. So, the next thing you know, she&#8217;s on the plane to come to New York, he meets her at the airport, and this was in 1963.
EF: Wow, okay.
RFS: They get married, and who&#8217;s there to give her away but my Aunt Peggy. So there are many pictures of my Aunt Peggy and my uncle at that point, the guy who met my aunt.
EF: Oh, at the airport.
RFS: At the airport.
EF: The Cuban guy.
RFS: Yeah, at the airport there together, they&#8217;re the ones who took the pictures of my mom and my dad getting married a day or two after my mom arrived in the airport. They had nothing so they started from scratch. I don&#8217;t even know where they lived. I forgot to ask my mother all of that. But they had absolutely nothing. I think they lived with Peggy for a few months until they got on their feet and they got a job, but my mom got pregnant very quickly.
EF: Right.
RFS: So they got married in July and found out by September that she was pregnant with me and that I was going to be born in June. Once you started showing, I don&#8217;t think that women really worked much back then. So she worked at some menial job, even though she was college educated, and my dad was a factory worker. He&#8217;s never going to be more than a factory worker. He didn&#8217;t have more than an eighth grade education. So here&#8217;s the dichotomy of my mother from this grand educational background with all of these people &#8211; if she didn&#8217;t see that, I don&#8217;t know &#8211; marrying a guy who barely had an eighth grade education and could barely write. That was already setting up the challenge of how are we going to make this work. We really don&#8217;t see eye to eye and everything that I&#8217;m about is nothing that you&#8217;re about. But my mom had this dream of, &#8220;I need to get out of my house,&#8221; and so then they&#8217;re trying to make things work. I&#8217;ve seen pictures of them together. They looked like they were madly in love at that time.   So, I came along in June of 1964 and was born in Flushing, New Jersey, I believe a couple of years before the world fair in Flushing.
EF: Okay, right.
RFS: And they made that big ball. So for a couple years we lived in Flushing. Then, I think I was three, we moved to another part of New York, which was Long Island City. That&#8217;s just a little strip, I think in the Hudson River, and there&#8217;s a little island. You have to get there via bridge and it&#8217;s right next to one of  their state or their national penitentiaries.
EF: Oh, okay.
RFS: Yeah. So that&#8217;s where I grew up until I was five. I was actually in one of the first pre-k programs in the United States in Long Island City and it was very mixed racially. There were about thirty [students]. I mean this is thinking back and looking back at the pictures.
EF: Right.
RFS: When I look back at my pre-k class, but it looked like there were about thirty percent African American, maybe a couple of Hispanics or maybe Native Americans, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of Chinese, and all the rest were white. This was really my first exposure, outside of the home, to being with other children, and I looked at these other kids and [thought], &#8220;Wow, they&#8217;re all types of colors and sizes and shapes of children. This is interesting, and I wonder if I touch a little guy with a really dark brown hand--.&#8221; Even though mine is a lighter brown, my theory was that it rubs off on each one of us, and I said, &#8220;I wonder if that works,&#8221; and it was like, &#8220;Oh. His color stays on him and my color stays on me.&#8221;
EF: Right.
RFS: It&#8217;s strange that way. But I remember growing up and nobody was explaining anything. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;This is interesting,&#8221; and I go home and I speak Spanish, and I go into this other world and I speak English, and this is interesting. So I was taking it all in and being this little bilingual kid. My first exposure to English was really through Speed Racer, whom I loved.
EF: Oh, the cartoon.
RFS: Yes.
EF: That&#8217;s funny.
RFS: So I would mimic what Speed Racer and whatever his girlfriend, I forgot her name, Tina or something&#8211;
EF: Right.
RFS: &#8211;would say, and I would mimic their words and that&#8217;s how I started learning English before I went into pre-k.
EF: Oh, wow. You were born in New Jersey then moved&#8211;
RFS: In New York.
EF: &#8211;to Long Island City. Oh, right.
RFS: In Flushing, and moved to Long Island City, which is not Long Island. It&#8217;s not what you think, beautiful Long Island.
EF: Gotcha.
RFS: It&#8217;s still pretty inner city kind of thing.
EF: Well, were you moving&#8211;? Did that have to do with your father&#8217;s job? You said he was a factory worker. Where did he work?
RFS: It was just a step up. They both worked in Manhattan for the longest time. My mom actually had her first job when I was probably about six to nine months of age. She thought that it was that she had given me enough time to show that I was a healthy child, so she decided that she was going to get work. Where we lived in Long Island City, right across the street, there was an apartment building and my father&#8217;s sister lived there with her family, and they had three children while I was growing up. So my mom and her sister-in-law, my Aunt Carmen, found a job at the same factory. My mom is a college educated lady but obviously she doesn&#8217;t speak English yet.
EF: Right.
RFS: So she got herself a job at a factory. It was a toy factory. It was called Emenee. My mother repeated this a lot to me. So they went to this Emenee factory and they used to make like toy guitars. I&#8217;ve actually Googled it and it looks like&#8211;. They have a lot of collectors&#8217; items now that you can find, but they closed down, maybe in the 1980s or something. So there was this factory and somebody offered them a job and said, &#8220;We have had a lot of luck with Hispanic girls, they&#8217;re hard workers, so we&#8217;d like to offer you a job,&#8221; so both of them got hired on the same day. When they went back home, because they lived right across from each other, my mom and my Aunt Carmen talked and my Aunt Carmen told my mom that she wasn&#8217;t going back to work the next day, that L.B.J. had started a social welfare program that was aimed at women like her who had several children to promote that she would stay at home, and that these were great programs for the welfare of people so that was going to help her to be able to stay home, and she should look into it herself so that she could stay home with me. [My aunt said] it was too hard of a day. She was trying it out to see what she thought but that was too much of a difficult day so she wasn&#8217;t going to stick with it. She was going to go and apply for this thing.   I don&#8217;t know what happened when my mom went home. She probably took a look at me, and I was just a little kid, and there&#8217;s my dad and she could tell that my dad was probably not going to get ahead in life. He was just one of those guys, like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and he was not going to get forward in life. I don&#8217;t know what went on in my mom&#8217;s head, if they talked and if my dad maybe told her, &#8220;No, we came here, you&#8217;re going to work.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what happened, but my mom set out for work, now by herself, the second day, and in that first week she decided that she&#8217;s going to do something different to make the future different, and what she did is she signed up for the community college program on her way back from work, took an extra hour to sign up for business English at the local community college. I think it was two or three days a week. She made my dad agree that he was going to be the one to take care of me after work so she could go on and further her education and use her degree maybe in some capacity in the United States.   So that was a difficult decision that she had made, and I can only imagine what it was like, looking across the street &#8211; my aunt is raising her kids and she looks like she&#8217;s having a little bit of an easier life, she&#8217;s not juggling a job and college together and then coming home and it&#8217;s 7:00 or 8:00 at night to spend an hour only with me, only to start the whole process in the morning.
EF: Right.
RFS: So I wonder what went through her head while she was doing that, because it wasn&#8217;t that short of a period of time. It probably took her a year to eighteen months to get that business English degree.
EF: Wow. That&#8217;s a lot of work.
RFS: Yeah, so it was a lot of work, and it paid off. She did well at that job, at the Emenee job, and got a better job soon after that but it was still a laborer&#8217;s job. Then by the time I was about four years old, approximately the time that I started pre-k, she started going on interviews for accounting or business and she finally landed a job at Lord &amp; Taylor&#8217;s on 5th Avenue in the payroll department, being in charge of a certain area in payroll. I still remember that. She came home, she was ecstatic, &#8220;I love Lord &amp; Taylor&#8217;s,&#8221; I heard her say, and, &#8220;I can dress my daughter in those clothes.&#8221; So she started bringing home a whole bunch of interesting outfits, I mean I could bring you some pictures.
EF: Yeah.
RFS: I&#8217;m dressed like a go-go girl, leather outfit head to toe.
EF: That&#8217;s so funny.
RFS: And some go-go boots that were embroidered. It was like, &#8220;Wow. Okay, Ma.&#8221;
EF: She was proud.
RFS: Yeah, she was proud of her job and she was proud to be able to put those beautiful clothes that only belonged on rich people on her daughter. So from there she started saving all her money away and saying that now the next step was to be able to own their own home. And here&#8217;s my dad, he&#8217;s still straggling along. He&#8217;s not the kind that would change jobs or look to better himself, and he was still quite a bit of a drinker, and his philosophy was, &#8220;You work hard five days a week so that you can go out and have some fun with the boys on that last day of work, and that&#8217;s the way you celebrated. That&#8217;s the way you got through a week of work, man.&#8221; He&#8217;s just like Johnny &#8211; I think it was Johnny &#8211; in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and I would always see myself as Johnny&#8217;s daughter. I&#8217;ve forgotten her name.
EF: I can&#8217;t remember now.
RFS: But you know who I&#8217;m talking about.
EF: I do, yeah.
RFS: Yeah, and it&#8217;s funny because Betty Smith grew up in New York and then she came to North Carolina and her work was mostly written in Chapel Hill, sitting on Rosemary Street.
EF: I didn&#8217;t know that.
RFS: I didn&#8217;t know that until years and years and years later and it almost brought tears to my eyes, thinking, I grew up thinking I was that little girl &#8211; I forgot her name &#8211; and here I followed her steps.
EF: Right. That&#8217;s so interesting. I&#8217;ll have to look her up. I didn&#8217;t know that at all.
RFS: Yeah, so her name was Betty Smith. Anyway, so I grew up in that same kind of home. My dad is like that and he couldn&#8217;t be pushed. [I mean,] my mom was always trying to push him, and nagged and nagged, and I would hear this all the time.
EF: Right.
RFS: But finally she says, &#8220;So I&#8217;ve saved enough money,&#8221; and she would require my dad to give her all of the salary, and he would cut back whatever portion he thought that he needed for himself and whatever it was that he was doing and gave her the rest, and she would diligently put it away, put it away, put it away. So with my mom&#8217;s salary and my dad&#8217;s salary after, bless her heart, like two or three years of working at Lord &amp; Taylor, she says, &#8220;I have enough money,&#8221; for a substantial down payment on an apartment building in New York.
EF: In Manhattan?
RFS: No, they actually moved out and went to Queens.
EF: Okay.
RFS: So they decided we&#8217;re going to go to Queens.
EF: Get a little more space.
RFS: A little more space, real estate is a little bit lower, so they looked at apartment buildings. I remember that phase of my life, looking at buildings and what to purchase and what would give her the most income. So she decided on I think it was a three-family-unit apartment building in Richmond Hill, New York. And they had a nice teeny-weeny little garden with rose bushes, and that&#8217;s where they were going to make their lives now. She had risen herself from lower middle class to middle-middle class, [and] now she&#8217;s the owner of these apartment buildings and now she&#8217;s working at Lord &amp; Taylor. She&#8217;s been there for a few years so she&#8217;s midlevel now. She has a little bit more respect and people in her family would ask her questions &#8211; her name was Christiana &#8211; &#8220;Christiana, what do you think that we should do about this?&#8221; because she&#8217;s starting to gain a little bit more respect.   So now this is where I start kindergarten, so we moved in the middle of my kindergarten year to this place in Richmond Hill, New York, which back then were the suburbs of New York. It was Queens but it was out there, there were plush, beautiful trees, not the major roads. I mean to me those were beautiful trees because we didn&#8217;t have any in Long Island City. So this is different. My school, which I still remember was PS 55 in Queens, was a very nice little elementary school. It was smallish. We all knew each other. There were very few little brown kids like me, even less African American kids, one or two Asian kids, but for the most part they were Irish American, they were Italian American. We were all from the same middle class, parents really wanted us to do well. And the one thing that really struck me is that we had a principal, his name was Mr. Wiseman, [and] you could tell, it was written all over him, he was probably a World War II vet. He would come in and he would open the door and everybody, in unison, because nobody could do it differently, had to all stand up and say, &#8220;Good morning, Mr. Wiseman,&#8221; and he would go like this and that meant we could sit down.
EF: Okay.
RFS: And that&#8217;s how I grew up.
EF: Every day.
RFS: Yes, every day, and I don&#8217;t know what happened. They probably didn&#8217;t think of our school when, whatever her name was, said that we couldn&#8217;t say a prayer and we couldn&#8217;t say grace before, but we would always say grace. I guess I had very religious teachers in public school, but we always said grace, we always said the Pledge of Allegiance and a quick prayer before we started school. Because of my mom, my mom was Catholic, and so my dad was this sort of evangelical Christian Methodist that didn&#8217;t practice anything, so religion was a tense little subject at home.
EF: Sure. Yeah, that was going to be my next question, about&#8211;.
RFS: Yeah.
EF: I wasn&#8217;t sure. I was assuming that your mom&#8217;s family was maybe Catholic.
RFS: Yes.
EF: Since maybe they had worked so closely under Trujillo&#8217;s government.
RFS: That&#8217;s right. So they were devout Catholics,&#8211;  EF: Right.  RFS: &#8211;very devout Catholics, and my&#8211;.
EF: So then for yourself growing up&#8211;.
RFS: Yeah. Evangelical Christians were poor people in the Dominican Republic so my mother looked down her nose at all this evangelical stuff and &#8220;Praise the Lord&#8221; kind of stuff.
EF: Right.
RFS: That&#8217;s like, wow; that&#8217;s out there.
EF: Right.
RFS: So anyway, that&#8217;s the background, and then I started seeing this in school. One of the most interesting days in school was in second grade they offered my mom to sign me up for religious instructions programs and I said, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; It means that I get to leave from school, at 2:00 instead of 3:00, on Wednesdays. That was I guess the conciliation that New York did with the public schools so that they could take religion out of school, but they ceded an hour of school to those families that wanted to teach their children religion.
EF: I got you.
RFS: The parents would have to agree that they wanted x religion to be taught to their children but it would not be under the roof of the school, so we had to go somewhere else. Here&#8217;s my mom, looking at the list of the different places that she could send me, and it was the Catholic church &#8211; and there were two Catholic churches, one was a mile away and one was two miles away from my house &#8211; and then there was the Lutheran church, and I grew up right next to the Lutheran church, where that little apartment building was, and it was right across the street. I&#8217;d cross the street and right there was tiny little St. Paul&#8217;s Lutheran Church. Looking down the list, I said, &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s that church right across the street. We&#8217;ve never been there, Mommy. Maybe we can go there and you can send me there on Wednesdays,&#8221; and all I was looking for was an extra hour off of school.
EF: Yeah, right.
RFS: I didn&#8217;t want to sit with the nerds that were staying because they didn&#8217;t have no religion. I told my ma, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be an atheist, so you probably should choose this one, if you don&#8217;t want me to go really far away,&#8221; and there was no bus system to get me back.
EF: Walking distance then to get home afterwards?
RFS: Yes, and then there wasn&#8217;t any way to get me from the church back to my home.
EF: Gotcha. Wow. Very practical.
RFS: Yes. So I said, &#8220;Well, since you&#8217;re not going to let me go to this school or this school,&#8221; and I must have been seven or eight so I was trying to negotiate really hard.
EF: Of course.
RFS: &#8220;Then I can go to St. Paul&#8217;s and I&#8217;ll be fine and I&#8217;ll make sure I come right back home and I&#8217;ll be okay.&#8221; Or, I don&#8217;t remember if I went to a babysitter. So she agreed to that. She agreed that I could go to St. Paul&#8217;s Church, and that was my first religious instruction. So I went to St. Paul&#8217;s Church and from second grade until sixth grade they instructed me in religious studies, so I got to learn the Lord&#8217;s Prayer and I&#8217;d come home [and say], &#8220;We don&#8217;t do this stuff. How come we don&#8217;t do this stuff?&#8221; And it was my mother&#8217;s awakening that she did grow up a devout Catholic, but since there was this dichotomy of religions in my home then she had forgotten about that and put it on the back burner. But here&#8217;s me at seven, now soon to be eight, saying, &#8220;So we don&#8217;t have any of this. This is missing in our home. I want to learn about this stuff too.&#8221;   So she bought me, I think that was my seventh Christmas, she bought me a Bible for children and it had a hard cover, it was a beautiful book, and she bought me that for my seventh year Christmas present. She said, &#8220;So read this, every day read three pages,&#8221; or something like that, so that&#8217;s where I started reading, and I&#8217;d go back to my religious instructions teachers and ask them questions, and they made me memorize verses and all that kind of stuff. So that was my first exposure to religion.   So second through, I think it was seventh grade, I grew up in New York City under the same routine, except for every fourth weekend. Oh, I have to go back. Every week my dad would continue going out, right after working, never come back home, and I remember Fridays was the night that we had the Partridge Family and the Brady Bunch, and that&#8217;s when I got to spend time with my mom because my dad would never come home because he was out drinking, just like Johnny. So I got to be the caretaker, you know, I&#8217;d feel sorry for my mom, but that would make us a little bit closer. I was a little bit of her caretaker in all those years and our lives had this routine. I was a good student. I said when I was in third grade that I wanted to be a doctor, and I wanted to be a children&#8217;s doctor because I wanted to work with children, and that made my mother very enthusiastic and I guess she figured, &#8220;Okay, all this hard work is paying off. My daughter wants to be a doctor.&#8221;   So our lives went with this routine, not much changed, it wasn&#8217;t much of anything very exciting going on in our home, except for every fourth weekend. I had a very well-to-do uncle who was an anesthesiologist who lived in Montclair, New Jersey. This was my mom&#8217;s uncle, so he was my second uncle, I guess, and she was his favorite niece, so he invited her every weekend to go out there and, whether my dad was a drunk or not, my Uncle Caesar, the anesthesiologist, liked to hang out with my dad because my dad was very nice to him. &#8220;You want to smoke a cigar? Let&#8217;s smoke a cigar. Do you want to go outside? We&#8217;ll go outside.&#8221; So it was that kind of thing, so every fourth week I got scooted away from New York City to Montclair, New Jersey to a four-story mansion. It was this beautiful Victorian mansion with, I don&#8217;t know, probably five, six thousand square feet.
EF: Wow.
RFS: It was, in my eyes, my very humble eyes, beautiful. It was a mansion.
EF: Right.
RFS: He had four children. Three of them were older than me and they couldn&#8217;t relate to me and I was the very poor cousin, and then I had one cousin who was two years [younger] than me who thought that I was the world because I was two years older than him. Nobody could give him the time of day but, here comes me, and because I&#8217;m poor I will give you the time of day, and his name was Rafael but I always called him Raffie. So every fourth weekend we would hang out, we&#8217;d have a great time together. He would think that I was the cat&#8217;s meow and I would think, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s my only way to really get into and understand this part of the family,&#8221; and it was fun. So every fourth week we&#8217;d go there.   So we went back to the Dominican Republic a couple of times, for Christmas when I was eight then shortly after that when I was ten, not for Christmas, and then my mom got pregnant.
EF: Would you go back to the DR primarily to see your mom&#8217;s side of the family?
RFS: That&#8217;s right, because all of my dad&#8217;s side of the family lived here.
EF: Right.
RFS: Or, my Aunt Peggy had brought everybody. So, yes, we would go back to see my mom&#8217;s side of the family. Since they were pretty much well-to-do they had no impetus to come here.
EF: Sure.
RFS: Some of them did, like a couple of younger uncles who didn&#8217;t want to study anymore. So, some good things happened in breaking apart from Trujillo, but some bad things happened which was doors opened to an easy future, so the kids that would have stayed in school because they would have had no future otherwise, they decided, &#8220;Oh, I can start working if I go to New York City.&#8221; So two of my mom&#8217;s younger siblings almost right away decided to come and they followed her. She gave them a place to stay for a couple months and then they made their own way. Apart from that everybody&#8217;s in the Dominican Republic. My aunt&#8217;s in the Dominican Republic; has a pretty large school, probably about a thousand kids, and she&#8217;s doing that curriculum, that I told you about that was a national curriculum, in her school.
EF: Right.
RFS: So we would go and visit them, and my Aunt Cecelia got along very well so she&#8217;d send me back to the Dominican Republic sometimes in the summers. And then that would be a different life too, because my Aunt Cecelia&#8217;s very well-to-do in the Dominican Republic, has what I considered back then a beautiful home, acres of land around their school. They are chauffeured back and forth by their chauffeur, they have a few housekeepers &#8211; but everybody does in the Dominican Republic &#8211; but it&#8217;s a very different life. One of the more dramatic moments in my early childhood was when I went to the Catholic church, and I wasn&#8217;t very familiar with Catholicism but I did go, like I said, to St. Paul&#8217;s Lutheran Church. So I went back to the Dominican Republic and my aunt is sort of my guardian while I&#8217;m there and she said &#8211; in Spanish you say Romeri, not Rosemary &#8211; &#8220;Romeri, you need to come to church with us,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t go to that kind of church. Will they take me?&#8221; and she said, &#8220;No, God takes everybody,&#8221; and so I said, &#8220;Yeah, but this is a church. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; So I figured, okay, so I dressed myself, but I didn&#8217;t know how to dress for Dominican church so my skirt was a little too short, and my sleeves were a little bit too short, and my back was exposed a little bit. Everybody got up and they started going towards the front and I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing. So I get in the line and I&#8217;m starting to go towards the front and people are talking to me as I&#8217;m going to the front. I speak mostly English at this point. I speak some Spanish. They have a little bit of an accent that I don&#8217;t understand. So they&#8217;re telling me things, &#8220;Mira! Mira!&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re saying. Maybe it&#8217;s for me, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;  So I kept on going, I kept on going, towards the front, and people are trying to get my attention. So I get to the front and I go in front of this guy who has this garb on that I&#8217;ve never seen before, and he&#8217;s got these &#8211; what are they called? They&#8217;re scarf things. I go right in front of him and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, what have you got for me?&#8221;
EF: Oh my goodness.
RFS: And he goes&#8211;.
EF: He shook his head?
RFS: Yeah, he shook his head at me and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, what?&#8221; and he says, &#8220;Twenty Hail Marys and thirty Lord&#8217;s Prayers,&#8221; and something else, and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; and I said this in Spanish, and he said, &#8220;Fifty Hail Marys,&#8221; he upped it by double, and I said, &#8220;Oh, my goodness. I&#8217;m going to die in hell, I guess.&#8221; So he motioned to me to go over to the confessionary &#8211; and I go there, and I figure, well, there&#8217;s a little place to kneel, so I guess I&#8217;m kneeling there. So I&#8217;m kneeling in front of it and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m doing. I don&#8217;t know. I know the Lord&#8217;s Prayer. Should I start saying it?&#8221; So this other person, I can&#8217;t remember. Oh, it was the housekeeper. My aunt&#8217;s housekeeper comes over, she puts her arm around me, and she says, &#8220;Your clothes are not church clothes,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Oh. What was that he said? What&#8217;s a Hail Mary?&#8221; and she told me what the Hail Mary was and I said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not supposed to pray to other people that&#8217;s not God.&#8221; So, I don&#8217;t understand.
EF: So your education from &#8211; St. Luke&#8217;s?
RFS: St. Paul&#8217;s.
EF: St. Paul&#8217;s.
RFS: Is clashing with what they&#8217;re telling me.
EF: Right.
RFS: So I said, &#8220;Well, I guess God will forgive me, so maybe God will forgive me for my indiscretion of wearing the wrong clothes if I say a prayer, &#8216;Please forgive me for wearing my wrong clothes,&#8217; and maybe I don&#8217;t have to say those Hail Mary things.&#8221;   So we&#8217;re walking together and they&#8217;re taking me home. My aunt, who didn&#8217;t actually take me to the church, she stayed home and supervised that I should be going, and then she got very, very, very upset because I&#8217;d embarrassed the family by being there with the wrong clothes. So, it was very interesting.
EF: Oh my.
RFS: I didn&#8217;t know what I was supposed to be feeling, am I supposed to be mortified, or what&#8217;s going on here. So I asked her for special permission. Long distance phone calls were very, very expensive, so I asked my aunt for special permission to talk to my mom because I did not understand what was going on. So finally my mom and I talk and she tells me, &#8220;No, nothing bad happened. I think you&#8217;re forgiven. Just don&#8217;t go to church with those kinds of clothes. You can go to church, make sure you stay in the pew. You haven&#8217;t done anything like a first communion,&#8221; [and I said,] &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
EF: Right.
RFS: &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, we&#8217;ll figure it out when we have to get there, if we do have to get there.&#8221; That freaked me out. I was like, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m not doing this church thing again.&#8221;
EF: That&#8217;s so interesting. St. Paul&#8217;s, as a Lutheran church, was it also evangelical and those were the teachings that it was giving you?
RFS: I guess it was evangelical because they didn&#8217;t do their first communion until they were older. There was something at thirteen or fourteen that we were starting to get prepared for.
EF: Right.
RFS: It wasn&#8217;t confession. I forgot what it was called but it was learning all of certain things and being able to cite them. And then that&#8217;s when you don&#8217;t necessarily do your first communion but you get introduced to the church, and I forgot what that was called but it&#8217;s something like introduction to the church or something like that.
EF: Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re talking about.
RFS: Okay. So St. Paul&#8217;s did that, but we didn&#8217;t have a formal first communion like that, and they baptize as adults also. So all of it was very, very different from what I passively learned, not through my parents, but because I continued to attend this church on Wednesdays and most Sundays because I could walk myself to church.
EF: Right. Gotcha.
RFS: Anyway, so it was one of those things. I had to add it in there because it was so freaky.
EF: Yeah. I&#8217;m glad that you did. Well I wanted to &#8211; and this might be skipping too far ahead and if you need to bring me up to speed, but I saw looking up online that you attended school in the Dominican Republic, and I don&#8217;t know if that was for undergraduate or for medical school&#8211;  RFS: Yes.  EF: &#8211;or for everything, but I wonder if you can give me the story about higher education.
RFS: How that happened.
EF: Yes.
RFS: Okay. So we stayed in New York for a few more years. My dad became more and more that he was not showing up at home on Fridays and would extend it to Saturdays now. My mom was getting freaked out about this. She&#8217;s trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on with the future. I&#8217;m starting junior high school at a local school. I have to go in a public school. I got involved in a little fight where somebody was teasing one of my friends. I was still a very, very good student but somebody was bullying her, and she was very nice and she was very meek. And this was a big of a bully girl and she thought that because she hung out with the wrong kids that she could push my friend around, and my friend, Marianne &#8211; she was also my piano teacher&#8217;s daughter &#8211; would not stand up for herself. So I turned around to this Hispanic bully-ish, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m better than you,&#8221; kind of girl and I said, &#8220;You will not talk to us that way. We deserve more respect than that.&#8221; She punched me or scratched me, I can&#8217;t remember, but she had very long hair. So, I wrapped my hand around her hair and I pulled.
EF: Oh!
RFS: And I got her down to the school bus floor. So we started kicking and all that.
EF: Right.
RFS: So my mom thought that that was a bad trend, and I was standing up for myself and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not putting up with this. I don&#8217;t agree with somebody being a bully over us, and I&#8217;ve met with bullies before and they only respond to strength.&#8221; So my mom thought that because that had happened that I was on a bad path, and no explaining to my mom would have her understand. &#8220;You&#8217;re misunderstanding this whole thing.&#8221; I was standing up for my friends but also, for us, we&#8217;re the goody-goodies, we study a lot, we do good stuff, and this girl thought that she could push us around, and I was trying to show her that she couldn&#8217;t.   Anyway, my mom was seeing all these things, and the way that things were going with my dad, and she put all that together and she said, &#8220;Well, we have to go back to the motherland.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, no. That&#8217;s not what I meant.&#8221; But life was routine and strange at that point in New York, so I said, &#8220;Well maybe it&#8217;s a better start to go back to the Dominican Republic, and what are you going to do, Mom?&#8221; [She said,] &#8220;I plan to open up a school in the Dominican Republic.&#8221; It&#8217;s always been my dream to be the daughter of somebody who owns a business, so that&#8217;s what we did.   [Brief interruption; break in recording; transcript resumes at 00:46:50]
EF: I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re being so detailed. It&#8217;s offering some really great memories.
RFS: Yeah, and we might we might never get to here. But you&#8217;re getting to see a life in New York City quite a bit.
EF: Yeah, absolutely.
RFS: Here&#8217;s something about growing up in New York. I grew up in New York and between nine and twelve or thirteen I had all these little classes. I went to piano classes, I went to religious instructions, I did Girl Scouts. I did everything on my own. My mom was working and my dad was working. I was a key latch kid and I was expected to be this place or that place or that place. This is in New York.
EF: Right.
RFS: And I would go to the library once a week with my friend, Marianne, and pick up books together, and we&#8217;d take a great big shopping bag and go over there and get ten books and come back home and revel in our books. So it was very different from growing up today where they go from one activity that mom takes them around to, to another activity that mom and dad take them around to. And so I learned to wander and be respectful and understand you don&#8217;t get in the face of adults. You don&#8217;t address them. You&#8217;re unseen, but that&#8217;s okay. They&#8217;ll ignore you as long as you&#8217;re respectful and you don&#8217;t get in their way. So we learned this and if you had an extra quarter you would very politely go into the grocery store and say, &#8220;Can I have a Hostess cupcake, please?&#8221; or go get it and bring it and put your quarter down and step away a little bit.
EF: Right.
RFS: But these are all the childhood memories that I remember growing up in New York where I had my routine, every day I was supposed to be somewhere. So somewhere when I was in third grade or fourth grade, a darling lady moved in a few blocks away, and she was of Russian descent and her husband was of Italian descent. She was Mrs. [00:48:54] and she brought with her what was to be one of my best friends, and she became a good friend through years and years and years, and that was Marianne. And she became my piano teacher and taught me some of the greatest life lessons, among them &#8220;garbage in, garbage out.&#8221; So she saw me reading some novels &#8211; I became very interested in novels, horror stories, when I was ten or eleven &#8211; and she very lovingly looked at what I was reading and she said, &#8220;You will always want to put good things into your mind because that will reflect on your soul.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s interesting. My mom never tells me that. She just thinks well, I&#8217;m reading, that&#8217;s good.&#8221; So, I took that, and she said, &#8220;So read books about Mother Theresa, or read books about Benjamin Franklin, or George Washington, or Albert Schweitzer. You should be reading books like this and that will elevate you to think about the people that you want to be most like.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; and I was getting into this whole phase, right, when I was about ten or eleven where I liked the thrill of the horror book or the thrill of a scary movie. This was right around The Omen and Jaws and things like that.
EF: Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.
RFS: So I saw myself getting more and more interested in that and I said, &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s a little addictive and maybe that&#8217;s not so good for me, so I&#8217;m going to listen to what she&#8217;s saying. And my mom didn&#8217;t give me that advice but my mom&#8217;s got a lot of things going on, so maybe this woman is offering me some good advice and I&#8217;m going to take it.&#8221; I&#8217;m adding those things in there to show that sometimes those relationships that we&#8217;ve made with people, and kind words at appropriate times, will stay with that person, and she really directed my thought to picking books that exemplify where I want to go and lift up instead of bringing down.
EF: Right.
RFS: So I kept on carrying that through my life. I always talk about Mrs. [  ] and my good friend Marianne and how they were very positive influences in my life during that time, but also that she and I would wander through the streets of New York, in Queens, and we would do our stuff and stay out of people&#8217;s way, and it&#8217;s a very different way of growing up. It was very interesting because we would wander into Lebanese stores, or the five and tens, and it was like seeing little worlds, and as long as we didn&#8217;t touch and we stayed out of the way and we didn&#8217;t giggle, we didn&#8217;t get thrown out of anywhere.
EF: Right.
RFS: So, it was interesting. So the story of New York comes to an end when my mom decides that she can&#8217;t take New York anymore because she&#8217;s very anxious. My dad is increasingly getting drunk, coming home late, fell down a subway, stairs and stairs, cut open part of his arm and had a gash on his head. We had to stop Easter to be able to take him to the hospital. It really is Johnny. [Laughs] So she said to put an end to that maybe a new life, a new change, will bring about something different in his future and all of our futures. So she decides that she&#8217;s going back to the Dominican Republic and she&#8217;s going to start a business of her own, and she&#8217;s undecided whether she&#8217;s going to start a school or she&#8217;s going to start a grocery store, but because she&#8217;s a small business woman and she has a degree in business now, that she would be able to do either one of the two.   So this is 1977. This is two years after my brother was born. He was born in 1975, so I was ten when I had my brother and that was probable the last culminating thing that made me love children. I was his caretaker. I spent his second summer being the one. I asked my mom for permission. I was twelve and I said, &#8220;I can take care of him.&#8221;
EF: Wow.
RFS: And, &#8220;You know you&#8217;re going to pay the babysitter a lot of money. Tell you what, you only have to pay me a dollar a day.&#8221;
EF: Wow. That&#8217;s a deal.
RFS: &#8220;And I will take care of him. You can trust me. The only thing is if I have summer activities, then we probably need some sort of backup.&#8221; So we figured it out. Somebody who was going to take care of him for a couple of days a week and I would take care of him for a buck a day on the other days, and I was responsible for changing his diaper, feeding him, and doing everything. So for a good portion of that summer it was my brother and I. They decided to name him after my dad, Diogenes, the guy with the lantern. Oh, my goodness, can we not find a nickname for this kid?
EF: That&#8217;s so interesting.
RFS: You named me Rosemary and then you call him Diogenes? [Laughs]
EF: [Laughs] Wow.
RFS: So they said, &#8220;So what do you suggest?&#8221; I said, &#8220;How about something with a D,&#8221; and my mom said, &#8220;I know, Denny.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. Fine.&#8221;
EF: And Denny stuck?
RFS: It stuck, Denny stuck, yes, so you can see I was making a lot of the decisions for my family.
EF: Yeah. Right.
RFS: So anyway, he&#8217;s two and a half, I&#8217;m thirteen, and my mom decides that we&#8217;re going back to the Dominican Republic.
EF: Right.
RFS: I was born in Spanish; became very quickly fluent in English and now English is my main language. I can read a little bit of Spanish, I can probably write it, but I don&#8217;t know accents and stuff like that, so now I&#8217;m going back to the Dominican Republic to be completely immersed in Spanish again.  EF: Right.  RFS: So, I didn&#8217;t really think this through, that this was going to be a great idea. I thought, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t know about this,&#8221; but when I got there it&#8217;s really sunk. There&#8217;s no public transportation in the Dominican Republic that I can partake in. My family now, from being upper middle class &#8211; we&#8217;ve pushed ourselves up, owning apartments and all this &#8211; we&#8217;re back to being the poor people because, well, my mom&#8217;s just starting to own a business.
EF: Right.
RFS: We&#8217;re the poor family. My uncle was the engineer to the president. He was the major contractor/engineer to the president, Pres. Balaguer, during that time when we moved back, so he has like five or six servants and it&#8217;s all very cultured. My aunt owns this super big school, I mean she&#8217;s wealthy, and here&#8217;s us. So I got all the crumbs thrown at me, which is nice, getting those crumbs, but I got pushed back from being one of the, the kid who was&#8211;. It was okay, other family members &#8211; unless I&#8217;m in Montclair &#8211; are looking up to me, but now I&#8217;m the really poor family member, and I&#8217;m thirteen, and it&#8217;s not going well for me, because I&#8217;m in ninth grade at that point.
EF: Right.
RFS: And I have to learn Spanish again, and I have to go to the school that my aunt is the owner of, and everybody&#8217;s looking at me and thinks that I should be the best one in the school, and I can&#8217;t be the best because I&#8217;m relearning Spanish. What a disaster. So, it was a tough readjustment. I really got depressed over there and I had identity problems, trying to figure my way out, and my dad&#8217;s still drinking. That didn&#8217;t stop. And, &#8220;I could have told you that, Mom.&#8221; He has more access and more drunkards in the Dominican Republic, because those men, they can really drink, and they got a lot of access to rum over there.
EF: Sure.
RFS: So it was not a great combination, but my mom did start a school. She started a preschool from nothing. We outfitted it ourselves. We used every bit of our savings to buy a house in the Dominican Republic. To me this home was a mansion, and I thought we probably couldn&#8217;t afford it. It seemed like we couldn&#8217;t. It was a beautiful, like a thirty-five-hundred-square-foot house, it looked like these Spanish Miami homes. Beautiful flowers all around it, we had a nice backyard, stuff that I was not accustomed to, but we lived a very meager life because we had to see where the business was going, and our savings were only this small. And my dad couldn&#8217;t do anything in the Dominican Republic because only educated people get ahead in the Dominican Republic, not my dad, and now he&#8217;s drinking more. So, it was interesting.   My mom started that school, so there was again the education background. There were lots of kids. I offered my mom to be home schooled, whatever curriculum that they could give me, so that I could help her and she didn&#8217;t have to hire any teachers, or maybe one teacher, so that would cut down her bills, but my aunt disagreed and said, &#8220;She needs the exposure. She needs to be able to go to school.&#8221; So my aunt got in the way, and I thought it would be interesting to be around these kids all the time and learn to teach them how to read. So I got relegated to, okay, I got the afterschool program. So I got the afterschool program and I taught children how to read &#8211; phonics was a big thing in learning how to read in Spanish &#8211; and to teach them basic math skills, so I had my own little afterschool program from the time I was thirteen until I was sixteen.   I guess life went its own way until I was fifteen when we had the worst hurricane in the history of probably the Dominican Republic, and maybe even anywhere. It was called Hurricane David, and Hurricane David wiped out the island of the Dominican Republic. We had no electricity for I believe it was two months. So, here I go from being a New York girl to being a girl in the Dominican Republic and, to go back to that, that didn&#8217;t go so well because all of my memories were in New York, so if anyone would ask me anything I&#8217;d say, &#8220;In New York&#8211;,&#8221; so my nickname became &#8220;New York.&#8221;
EF: Of course.
RFS: Uh huh. They said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t you talk about anything else?&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. I guess I won&#8217;t talk. I have no memories of any. There&#8217;s nothing but New York.&#8221;
EF: Right, right, and you were missing what you considered to be home as well.
RFS: Yes, that&#8217;s right. That was everything I knew.
EF: Sure.
RFS: So I would count the days until I would get to go back to New York, because I was promised a yearly trip back to the US, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m American. I don&#8217;t understand all this. They drive crazy, they act crazy. Nobody stands in line. Everybody honks their horns. The traffic lights, everybody goes through them. I don&#8217;t understand this place.&#8221;
EF: Right.
RFS: So, it was total anarchy for me. Anyway, so then the hurricane comes through, and it devastates the Dominican Republic. The hurricane hits the middle of our home, it breaks down. Everything is glass windows, beautiful glass windows that you could get the sunlight in your home and the reflection, the refraction, the whole thing.
EF: Right.
RFS: Well, glass windows aren&#8217;t so wonderful in hurricanes, so it broke through our windows. The hurricane is in our home. My dad has these nine-month-a-year trips where he goes back to work at a factory in New York City, because he can&#8217;t do anything in the Dominican Republic, so my dad was not there to protect us or do whatever men do during times when there&#8217;s a major hurricane. So it&#8217;s my little brother, he&#8217;s three or four, and myself, and my mom, and me trying to protect them from all the harms and trying to figure it out, trying to act older than my age, and meanwhile there&#8217;s a hurricane in the middle of our house.   So we wake up to find that the island is completely devastated. Everything stops. There&#8217;s no school, there&#8217;s no nothing. It&#8217;s in the middle of the summer, but there&#8217;s no nothing for that year, and it&#8217;s either my tenth or eleventh grade. I think it was my eleventh grade of high school, and it&#8217;s set back by at least a month because there&#8217;s no power just about anywhere. It took about a month and a half to two months for things to start building up, and I remember the Americans came, through UNESCO or something, to give us food, and it&#8217;s not supposed to be for me but it&#8217;s supposed to be for the truly poor people who had nothing to live on. So, here&#8217;s this guy, and he&#8217;s selling a chunk of cheese, one of those big American cheeses that are like this, and he&#8217;s going down the road.
EF: Like two feet long or something.
RFS: Yeah, you know what I&#8217;m talking about, those big, long cheeses, and you can still buy them like at Sam&#8217;s. So he&#8217;s going down the road and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, you there, where are you selling that cheese from?&#8221; And he tells me where he got it from. He got it from UNESCO. They&#8217;re supposed to be giving it to poor people. I said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you give it to the poor people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Because I bought it. I bought it from the ship before it was unloaded and they gave me this big amount and I have it in my ice box so that I can sell it. Do you want it?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;They&#8217;re selling the cheese that the American people have paid the taxpayer money for. Yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll take it. Here&#8217;s the five bucks.&#8221;   We have no cheese, but then we didn&#8217;t have anywhere to put it because we had no ice box.
EF: And it&#8217;s too much cheese.
RFS: Yeah, so that&#8217;s just a funny story.
EF: That is funny.
RFS: But it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, this is crazy here, Mom. When are we leaving?&#8221; But she has the school already so there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re leaving.
EF: Right.
RFS: So, funny memories of growing up.
EF: Yeah, that&#8217;s great.
RFS: I just didn&#8217;t fit in.
EF: And you stayed there through high school and graduated high school there?
RFS: Well, here&#8217;s what was interesting. So my aunt kept on thinking that I was meant for more things and she took on an exchange program student from France, and she was involved and was a board member for something called ESF, something like that. I can&#8217;t remember. ESF?
EF: I don&#8217;t know.
RFS: It was an exchange program. American Field Service, AFS.
EF: Oh, okay.
RFS: Okay, so AFS back then was an exchange program student project, and it was in all the world, and the family would pay a certain amount for the visa fees and the program and the travel fees, healthcare, but your receiving family wouldn&#8217;t necessarily get any money. They could get money if they qualified for the money. So my aunt took on a student from Marseilles, France, and I was attending a little bit of French classes so I would try to speak French with her a little bit, and I got to meet the different AFS students that were in the Dominican Republic. There were some from the United States, there were some from Belgium. So they said, &#8220;Hey, Rose, do you want to be part of that?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to go to Switzerland and learn French.&#8221; So my aunt says, &#8220;Okay, so let&#8217;s fill out an application and see if they take you and then see where you go.&#8221;   So in February of that year &#8211; it&#8217;s the year after the whole hurricane thing so I&#8217;m about to turn sixteen &#8211; I got the great news. I was taken. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my goodness. Wait till I get home. I will find out if it&#8217;s France, if it&#8217;s Belgium, if it&#8217;s Switzerland,&#8221; because it&#8217;s supposed to be a French place, and then they tell me it&#8217;s Quebec. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not Europe!&#8221;
EF: Oh, my goodness. That&#8217;s too funny. But it&#8217;s French.
RFS: But it&#8217;s French. I wanted something much more exotic than that.
EF: Right.
RFS: So I was like, I don&#8217;t know whether to say, &#8220;Yay! I get to leave here!&#8221; or, &#8220;I get to go to Quebec. It&#8217;s still the same continent.&#8221;
EF: Right. Oh my goodness. Did you go?
RFS: I did.
EF: Okay. And how was it?
RFS: It was excellent.
EF: Yeah?
RFS: It was transformative.
EF: Was it Montreal or somewhere else?
RFS: I got to be right around Montreal, and my family was the best.
EF: Really?
RFS: So, it was a husband and wife, and he was much older than she was. It was actually a twenty-eight-year-old lady with a forty-year-old husband, so there&#8217;s a big age difference, and they have a girl from his first marriage and she is fourteen. So I get to live with them for a year and he&#8217;s a geographer &#8211; or cartographer, he makes maps &#8211; and she is like an executive secretary for a big firm. So I said, &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m leaving,&#8221; and my mom was&#8211;. She saw big things in the future for me, so she got teary-eyed and crashed the car on the day of my trip.
EF: Because of her teary eyes?
RFS: Because of her teary eyes, I guess,&#8211;
EF: Oh, no.
RFS: &#8211;and because she was so traumatized&#8211;  EF: That&#8217;s terrible.  RFS: And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, bye, Mom.&#8221;
EF: Oh my goodness.
RFS: I embarked on my trip for year &#8211; a year &#8211; to go to Quebec, Canada, in a little town called Brossard, Quebec, which was a suburb of Montreal.
EF: Okay.
RFS: And I was supposed to learn French. That was the primary goal, to finish my last year of high school, because I, somewhere between seventh and eighth grade, had skipped a year
EF: Oh, okay.
RFS: There was a program in New York where they accelerated me and they said, &#8220;You know enough to skip a year of school,&#8221; so I skipped a year between seventh and eighth so when I go to the Dominican Republic I was put into ninth grade. Anyway, so now I&#8217;m sixteen and I&#8217;m in my last year of high school. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so young in my last year of high school.   So, here I am, I&#8217;m enrolled in the last year of high school. Not only am I younger, I don&#8217;t know the language. I really don&#8217;t know the language. This is my third time of not knowing the language.
EF: Oh, wow. You&#8217;re used to it by now.
RFS: Yeah. So, here I am, I&#8217;m doing biology in French. &#8220;Biochemistry&#8221; becomes &#8220;biochimie,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, wow, and when I&#8217;m getting French it&#8217;s not French as a second or third language; I&#8217;m doing French literature together with the French kids.
EF: Right. So it&#8217;s really sink or swim.
RFS: Yeah, that&#8217;s right.
EF: Get the language fast.
RFS: That&#8217;s right, and my fourteen-year-old new sister is a bit of a twit. She is pampered by her first mom, her dad is trying to raise her up to not be such a spoiled brat, and it&#8217;s not working because there&#8217;s a dichotomy in these two families, and one is expecting her to work hard and the other one wants to coddle her. So I was the person who was the nice girl who did everything right who was making her look bad, so that was not a great relationship. We did get along but it was a little stilted there.
EF: Yeah, I see.
RFS: But it was a really good year because I spent a lot of time with my new mom and dad, and occasionally I would get teary-eyed and I would get homesick and I would try to call home and my mom would put up a big front and say, &#8220;What are you calling me for? Don&#8217;t you know that these phone calls are expensive? Don&#8217;t call me unless you&#8217;re dying,&#8221; and she would hang up, and this is the woman who crashed the car.
EF: Right.
RFS: I couldn&#8217;t figure this out.
EF: Right.
RFS: So, anyway.
EF: She&#8217;s trying to, like you said, put on a strong face.
RFS: A strong face. So, then my mom and my brother got to be very strong. My brother is at that point six years old, so my mom and he became very close while I&#8217;m in Canada. And I&#8217;m growing up, I have all these new experiences, I&#8217;m going to school in Canada. Guys start to try to date me and my new dad fends them off, &#8220;She&#8217;s not here to learn about relationships. She&#8217;s here to learn French.&#8221;
EF: Right. That&#8217;s funny.
RFS: So, it was very nice. It was a wonderful year. They taught me how to be part of a family that I didn&#8217;t actually belong to at first. They made me speak French when they both knew English. They were very strict about that, in their walls I had to speak French, so I&#8217;m fluent in French.
EF: So it worked.
RFS: So it was funny when you were talking about your wife and all that immersing in different&#8211;. So here I am, I&#8217;m sixteen, I&#8217;ve been fully immersed in American culture, in Dominican culture, and now in French-Canadian culture.
EF: Right.
RFS: It was a wonderful experience, one of the nicest years of my life. I enjoyed it. I loved getting to know what the French culture was like. It opened my eyes. It was a great year. So, at the end of the year I actually did well. I got all Bs, maybe an A. I think I got an A in French. I was the second best student.
EF: That&#8217;s pretty good for figuring out your lay in the language and maintaining high grades.  RFS: That&#8217;s right, and it was difficult. I thought I was going to fail that first quarter.  EF: Yeah, I bet.  RFS: Oh, my goodness.  EF: That was probably scary.  RFS: I was up until 2:00 in the morning, and my adopted mom&#8211;. We&#8217;re still friends, very, very close friends and we see each other two to three times a year, and she tells me&#8211;. She likes to repeat the story that she came and she saw light under the&#8211;. She went to the bathroom late at night and saw light under the door and opened the door and, here I am, I&#8217;m still doing my biochemistry, like this, falling asleep. And she comes in, &#8220;But, Rosemary, you have to go to bed,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, no. I&#8217;m going to fail,&#8221; [and she says,] &#8220;But you&#8217;re really going to fail if you don&#8217;t sleep.&#8221; And she says she put me to bed, and when I realized I was in bed I got up, and I said, &#8220;No, no. I have to do it.&#8221; So, anyway, she likes to tell the story that my work ethic &#8211; I don&#8217;t agree with her &#8211; had no boundaries, but I really don&#8217;t agree. It was not as good as she remembers it being. It really wasn&#8217;t.  EF: Right.   RFS: It really, really, really, really wasn&#8217;t. But anyway, so I had a great year, went back to the Dominican Republic, had some identity things: What am I? Am I American now? Am I Canadian? I love this new land.  EF: And were you now a senior when you went back to the&#8211;?  RFS: No, I&#8211;.  EF: Oh, you had finished.  RFS: Yes.   EF: Oh, gotcha.  RFS: I had finished. My high school degree is from French Canada.  EF: Okay.  RFS: I did my twelfth year of high school.  EF: I see. So then you returned back and you were trying to figure out next steps in life.  RFS: That&#8217;s right.  EF: Okay.  RFS: So I&#8217;m trying to figure out&#8211;. At that point I was like, &#8220;Well, do I stay in Canada &#8211; but I&#8217;m not a citizen &#8211; and trying to figure out if I go to college there, do I want to go back to the US?&#8221; I&#8217;m pretty independent at this point so to live under the roof of my mom does not sound like a lot of fun to me.  EF: Yeah.   RFS: I&#8217;ve broken the umbilical cord. I&#8217;ve gotten to live on my own, I&#8217;ve done all of these things, I&#8217;ve opened up my eyes. I didn&#8217;t have a boyfriend because at the end of the year I didn&#8217;t want to. I wanted to experience this family, figure things out, think for my own, and figure out what I wanted to be in the future. So, when I get to the Dominican Republic it&#8217;s a shock, it&#8217;s culture shock, because I&#8217;m not close to my mom anymore. She&#8217;d moved away, I&#8217;d moved away, we&#8217;re different people. My mom starts crying, right away, because she realizes there&#8217;s a distance, but it&#8217;s natural, it&#8217;s a normal distance. She figured I&#8217;d get there, I&#8217;d start hugging, I&#8217;d become her little kid again, but I was a very different person at that point.  EF: Right.  RFS: So she was shocked, but she had already signed me up for a pre-med program in the Dominican Republic. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ma!&#8221; [and she said,] &#8220;You said when you were in third grade that you wanted to be a doctor. You&#8217;re telling me you don&#8217;t want to be a doctor?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to disappoint her anymore. So she signed me up for pre-med and I said, &#8220;You know what? She sent me to Canada, she&#8217;s done all these things for me, I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s what I want to be but I guess I&#8217;ll figure it out.&#8221;  EF: Yeah. Wow.  RFS: So that&#8217;s how I got signed up to go to medical school, because I said that when I was in third grade. It kept on going, she signed me up for pre-med, I passed the test.  EF: And you were in.  RFS: And I was in, and I got on the bike and I kept on peddling. So that&#8217;s how I got into &#8211; was in medical school in the Dominican Republic.  EF: What was the name of the school?  RFS: It&#8217;s called Universidad Nacional &#8211; National University &#8211; Pedro Henr&#237;quez Ure&#241;a, they call it UNPHU, which at the time was the premier medical school in the Dominican Republic. It was a private medical school. My mother paid a fair amount of money but compared to what she would have paid here it was very, very minor. I actually asked to come to the States and she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re on your own if you go to the States,&#8221; and I looked up what it would have cost back then and it would have been something like fifteen thousand dollars a year. Fifteen thousand dollars is a lot of money, so I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take free.&#8221;   EF: Yeah.  RFS: Yeah, and I&#8217;ll figure my way of going back to the States, but all this was knowing I was going to go back to the States.  EF: Right. Gotcha.  RFS: So, I got through medical school, and their program, together with pre-med, was seven years in the Dominican Republic.  EF: And it was all in the same university?  RFS: All in the same university.  EF: So pre-med for four years, I guess?  RFS: Pre-med over there was two years so they do a shortened-  EF: Oh! And then on into med school.  RFS: Right in.  EF: Gotcha.  RFS: If you survive pre-med, which was very, very difficult, they weed you out. And so if you don&#8217;t have a GPA of x amount then you get weeded out to go to pharmacy or to go to vet school or to go to something else, nursing, something else that&#8217;s not medicine. So that was the process. It&#8217;s strange, for me it&#8217;s very foreign, but they weed you out but they make it shorter. So, on top of the fact that I graduated high school at seventeen, instead of most people graduate at eighteen, then medical school is shorter, so here I am, I&#8217;m a full-fledged doctor at I think it was twenty-two-and-a-half to twenty-three years, where most people are twenty-six.   EF: Yeah, that&#8217;s much younger.  RFS: I&#8217;m not sure it was good because I was very immature. Those three years are really good.  EF: How many women were in this program?  RFS: Oh, a lot.  EF: Were there really?  RFS: Yeah. Give me a moment.  EF: Sure. Let me pause this. [Break in recording] Okay, we&#8217;re back. So you were talking about university.  RFS: Yes, so I completed my medical school in the Dominican Republic.  EF: Right.  RFS: And that was 1988, and I was with all of these kids, or young adults, who were mostly all Dominican, and we had all these dreams and aspirations of what we wanted to become. Most of them wanted to come back here for their postgraduate training, become gastroenterologists, we all had ideas on what we wanted to be. I heard that our class was one of the most successful years for that university, for whatever reason. We had some really great teachers. We also had some really tough teachers. Some of them were really, really tough, and they pushed us and thought that we could do better, and I guess it paid off. We made a good group of doctors.  EF: And did you specialize at that time in pediatrics?  RFS: No. That was just medical school.  EF: I see.  RFS: So I did a lot of pediatric training in the Dominican Republic. I got to see things that I wouldn&#8217;t see here. I saw cases of kids with leprosy. I got to see a lot more tuberculosis than you would see here. I got to see kids that were born with tetanus.  EF: Oh, wow.  RFS: I got to be exposed to measles and mumps and rubella, catch all three in medical school &#8211; that was fun &#8211; and the chicken pox, yes, and I caught whooping cough.  EF: Oh, my goodness!  RFS: Yes.  EF: You&#8217;re getting all of the major&#8211;.  RFS: I had them all.  EF: The vaccinations that children get here, that you really don&#8217;t see a whole lot,&#8211;   RFS: That&#8217;s right.  EF: &#8211;you got those in medical school.  RFS: I got them all, either in medical school or later in my residency, when I came back for my postgraduate training.   EF: Where did you do your residency?  RFS: I did my residency in Overlook Hospital in New Jersey, so that was three years of my residency program. My step to get there was serendipitous. My neighbor across the street was a very nice friend of ours, so that&#8217;s where I started my contact back with the faith-based community and religion. They were looking for some faith spark at the same time that my mom and I were. I was probably in my second year of pre-med, I was about nineteen, and I had not been in contact with the religious community at all and going through medical school, which was very difficult, found that I needed something of faith, something more than just the day to day thing to help me understand why I was doing this.   So, this neighbor from across the street and my mom were very close friends and they were on a similar journey. And we started being closer friends and they invited us to their church, and from what I was reading I had a very clear understanding that this is what God wanted me to do. Christ had died for me, on a cross, and he had died for all human beings but he had died inclusively for me, and then you either accept that or you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s your choice. I decided that that was the right choice for me personally and I told my mom, who was a Catholic, that I was going down that road, whatever that road was, and that didn&#8217;t mean that I wanted to go necessarily to that church but this was a move of faith, because I thought that that was the choice that was being offered to me and I was willing to accept that choice. My mom was surprised and like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? I don&#8217;t understand? The Catholic faith&#8211;.&#8221; Somehow, I don&#8217;t know what happened, my mom, within two months, decided that she too was going to make a commitment of faith as an evangelical Christian, and she did.  EF: And this was mostly through the influence of&#8211;  RFS: This neighbor from across the street.  EF: &#8211;the neighbor, right.  RFS: Yeah, in the Dominican Republic.  EF: Right.  RFS: So through most of medical school, so from the time I&#8217;m nineteen until I&#8217;m twenty-three, I go through medical school being a Christian instead of being a Catholic, so I got teased a lot because most people are Catholics in the Dominican Republic and most people, at least back then, most people of money or influence in the Dominican Republic. And my mom had built up her school. She now had a couple hundred kids, she was well known in the community, she has Sammy Sosa&#8217;s kids.  EF: Oh!   RFS: She had a whole bunch of famous people.  EF: Right.  RFS: We actually have baseballs that are signed by Sammy Sosa. But she&#8217;s grown up in the community. Now we&#8217;re an upper middle class, I would say, not rich but upper middle class family.  EF: So she&#8217;s raised herself up from poverty to upper middle class in now two societies, essentially.  RFS: Yes, in two societies. That&#8217;s right.  EF: In New Jersey/New York and then the Dominican Republic.  RFS: And there&#8217;s my dad, still doing his thing. [Laughs]  EF: So that&#8217;s an amazing story of your mom though, it really is.  RFS: That&#8217;s right, it really is.   EF: Anyway, I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt.  RFS: No, absolutely. It&#8217;s great that you put that all together. Anyway, so as you&#8217;re sort of upper middle class, it&#8217;s not seen well for you to be an evangelical Christian, so I would get teased a lot in medical school for being an evangelical Christian, or whatever I was, and not doing things the way that they did them, whether in the small or the big. I remember one day, it was one of the hardest tests, it&#8217;s supposed to be through complete medical school and it was physiopathology or something like that. It&#8217;s supposed to be the most difficult test and it was the make it or break it. If you failed this test or you failed this course, you&#8217;re not going to make it as a doctor.   So, I thought I had studied sufficiently, and there was a church program that I really, really wanted to attend. And I had a very peaceful idea that I could attend and that the information that I knew was going to be sufficient for me to get a good grade, and that I had to be faithful in that I wanted to attend this, with a friend and, by faith, do that. I remember doing that and my friends were like, &#8220;You are crazy. You know how nuts you get when you don&#8217;t get a good grade.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Yeah, but I really believe that I can do this by faith and that I will do well,&#8221; so I did that, and I remember either the highest grade in the class or the second highest, and I wasn&#8217;t that great of a student. I was okay. I wasn&#8217;t fantastic. I&#8217;d study and I&#8217;d do well, I wouldn&#8217;t fail, but I wasn&#8217;t the best, so this set me up apart a little bit from the rest. Everybody&#8217;s a good student but that was unusual for me. I remember being stupid in that when I was looking at my test it was like there was an answer that was getting a little closer to me and I went&#8211; [Looking up] Is that you?&#8221; [Laughs]  EF: Up to the sky, or the ceiling.  RFS: I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hmm. I don&#8217;t know, but that looks like the right answer. I&#8217;m going to circle it. Let&#8217;s see if it happens with the next question,&#8221; and the next question I can see something coming up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Well, the thing was I was rather indiscreet, and they said, &#8220;How&#8217;d you do that, Rose? How&#8217;d you pull a ninety-three?&#8221; Everybody had sixties, and I was stupid enough to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I saw the questions. They were coming up off the&#8211;.&#8221; [Laughs] So, discretion was not my forte.  EF: Right. Well, you were being honest.  RFS: I was being honest and stupid, yes. But anyway, so that was a funny story.  EF: Yeah, that is funny.  RFS: They didn&#8217;t hate me. We were good friends.  EF: The teasing was mild, is what you mean.  RFS: Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t terrible. It was okay.  EF: Right, right.  RFS: But they really razzed me for the letters coming off the page. I said, &#8220;Yeah, maybe I was stupid in saying that. I&#8217;m not going to repeat that. If it ever happens again.&#8221; It never did. If the good Lord was looking down and helping me he was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re beyond help for exams.&#8221;   EF: Wow.  RFS: &#8220;You&#8217;re just too indiscreet.&#8221;   EF: So once you turned over this new leaf and became more dedicated to your faith, how did that continue to influence you in medical school and beyond?  RFS:  I started seeing things through a different prism, started understanding that my medical career and my faith had to be joined. I started to ponder on it. I don&#8217;t think that I did anything that was too out of the norm. I did look for opportunities to be kind to people, people in the Dominican Republic. We were sent out to places that were very remote, and these are kids that were raised in really nice homes and really nice families in the Dominican Republic, and we weren&#8217;t generally&#8211;. We did what we had to do, we were very perfunctory, but we weren&#8217;t necessarily kind, most of us weren&#8217;t. So I looked for opportunities to be kind and to give them nice words, or maybe to pray with them if they were very sick, because I thought that that was part of what should be a Christian doctor&#8217;s ministry. But I don&#8217;t know that I put that all together, and through even residency I found myself being a very selfish kind of person and, knowing what the right things were to do, I was more of a perfunctory Christian where I knew that my life had been changed. I knew that there was an element that I had seen, something I had seen that had changed the way that I saw things, but I wasn&#8217;t practicing anything really. I would go to church, I read the Bible, but it wasn&#8217;t changing my day-to-day activity. It was a matter of the head and not of what I was doing. There weren&#8217;t any deeds to differentiate me apart from going to church from any other person in the world.   So, I lived like that. I would say the three years of my residency program I would sometimes get in trouble because I&#8217;d bend the truth a little bit about certain things, to not get in trouble in residency, and I had a Christian residency program&#8211;. She was a neonatologist, and she was so funny because I was going to this singles thing for a Christian church. It was nice. I spent some time. This was in residency already. So now I&#8217;m in a little&#8211;.  EF: Here in New Jersey.  RFS: Right, in New Jersey, and this neonatologist is a Christian and she happens to go the same church that I happen to attend, so I know that she&#8217;s there and I try to do my little skirting. And most of us skirt or do whatever we can to get the most things done, but we&#8217;re working every third night and then spending the rest of the day so we&#8217;re thinking that we&#8217;re justified in trying. We&#8217;re never justified but we&#8217;re giving it, you know, &#8220;Goodness gracious, I spent a hundred and twenty hours in this stupid hospital.&#8221; So you try to justify what you&#8217;re doing and, &#8220;Maybe I didn&#8217;t get that lab, but I&#8217;m not sure that I did. Did I write it down?&#8221; And then you&#8217;d start looking through pages. It&#8217;s little things but they&#8217;re still not right.   So my pastor, the youth pastor, is very kind to me. I&#8217;m going through a difficult time, I don&#8217;t know why. I can&#8217;t even remember. I think I broke up with a boyfriend or something like that so he&#8217;s helping me. Oh, I remember now. I had gotten myself into&#8211;. Part of the selfish thing is I had bought an expensive car back then, the turbo Mitsubishi Eclipse, which I couldn&#8217;t afford.  EF: Oh, really?   RFS: Yeah.   EF: While you&#8217;re in residency.   RFS: While I&#8217;m in residency. Good time to do that. So I bought myself a turbo Mitsubishi Eclipse but I found myself not being able to pay the bill for the turbo Mitsubishi Eclipse.  EF: Yeah, right.  RFS: So I asked my pastor for counseling. &#8220;Got myself into this problem; what do I do?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t realize that doctors were so stupid.&#8221; He said it right like that, and he was right. He was right. &#8220;I thought that doctors were a little smarter than that. So your smartness doesn&#8217;t carry on to the rest of your life,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I guess not.&#8221; So he&#8217;s trying to help me, he and his wife are trying to help me, and he comes over maybe about once a month to have lunch with me to help get me back on my feet and figuring out, &#8220;Okay, do I have to sell this Eclipse? What am I going to do to lead a little bit of a better life?&#8221;  EF: Right.  RFS: So I&#8217;m having lunch with him and all of a sudden Dr. Mall, M-a-l-l, that&#8217;s the neonatologist, she walks down there and she says, &#8220;You know what? I got to tell you something, Rose. I knew that you were going to be here with Pastor Rob and I needed to speak with you.&#8221; And she&#8217;s this little teeny weenie woman, she&#8217;s the sweetest thing, and she says, &#8220;You&#8217;re not as honest as you could be. You have a lot of growing to do. You&#8217;re not as mature as you could be. You have a lot of maturing to do, and I would think long and fast about what you&#8217;re doing with your life before you set out to become a full-fledged pediatrician.&#8221; And, oh my goodness, in front of my pastor. That was so embarrassing to me, but also such an eye-opener that people could actually see that I was putting up a front but I was not an honest and selfless person. And here I am, trying to show myself off to be a very nominal Christian, but she had seen through all this, and obviously everybody else had too. And here she is taking the mask away and telling me, &#8220;You&#8217;re not mature, you lack honesty, and you have a lot of growing up to do.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what came over her that she wanted to tell me that, but I went home and I was devastated. I was not angry at her, I was just devastated. But I figured out that that was such a huge thing, that she really had to stop what she was doing in the neonatology ward to come downstairs and, in front of the pastor that was her pastor also, tell me this, sort of ruin her day, and go back upstairs. So I understood, wow, that woman really went all out for me to turn my life around, and that really, really, really did, because it really&#8211;.  EF: It made an impact.  RFS: It really made an impact. It really made me think, &#8220;So, what am I doing?&#8221; I mean I&#8217;d been given so many great chances. I went to Quebec, and everybody tried to get me going in the right direction, and obviously people can see that I have some pretty substantial flaws in being selfish and thinking cars instead of substance. And I really have to get back to being the kind of person that I was meant to be and that I have the possibility of being.   Okay, so I start analyzing things, and it was funny because here I am at the end&#8211;. This is probably at the end of my third year of residency and I&#8217;m supposed to be getting a job, and I&#8217;ve already passed all my exams to be able to do that and I&#8217;m done with my residency, but my program director didn&#8217;t send in the recommendation letter to the certification of New Jersey place. So, here&#8217;s my whole package for me to become licensed in the state of New Jersey, but my program director, because I challenged him several times, didn&#8217;t want to send in my letter to the New Jersey&#8211;.  EF: That&#8217;s very passive aggressive.  RFS: Yeah, he was. He was very passive aggressive. So that was the time at the end of Dr. Mall talking to me that I had to sit there and think about where I was going with all of my career and everything that I had invested, and at that point I&#8217;m almost destitute. I don&#8217;t know how to do anything except for being a doctor. So it was a very interesting few months where in the [01:33:58] I finished residency, and I have nothing to do and I don&#8217;t have really anywhere to be. So then I had like a six- to seven-month lapse between actually doing something that had to do with medicine and graduating from medical school.  EF: Wow.  RFS: I nannied, I delivered newspapers at 4:00 in the morning.  EF: Oh my goodness.  RFS: Yeah.  EF: Not exactly the vision you may have had after finishing medical school and residency.  RFS: And I made one phone call every day to my program director, &#8220;Can you please send that letter of recommendation?&#8221;
EF: So why was he&#8211;? Was it a personal thing against you? Was that the&#8211;?  RFS: It was. I call it something serendipitous because if everything wouldn&#8217;t have gone the way that it happened, then certain other things wouldn&#8217;t have happened. But, yeah, he was very passive aggressive, and it was a personal thing, and he didn&#8217;t want to send that letter because I had challenged him a couple of times.  EF: Oh, you mentioned that.  RFS: Yeah. So I had said, &#8220;These things are not right about this program and we can do these things better.&#8221; Things that perhaps, I find now, that I probably didn&#8217;t bring them up in the correct way, and I don&#8217;t know if there was a correct way, but it wasn&#8217;t very respectful, maybe, in some of the ways that I approached it. And so, as retaliation, I&#8217;m sure that he took his sweet time. So it took him I think at least six months from the time that I finished residency for him to send that letter. So he finally sent it, and when I called the gal who was his secretary &#8211; that I had a very, very, very good relationship with at that point &#8211; she said, &#8220;Guess what, Rosemary? He just sent it. I&#8217;m putting the stamp on right now.&#8221;   So he sent the letter of recommendation, and because he took that long the certifying board in New Jersey wanted to have a face to face interview with me, and it wasn&#8217;t a bad letter of recommendation, it wasn&#8217;t the best. He did say the same things that Dr. Mall had talked about &#8211; that I lacked complete honesty, that sometimes I was late and he couldn&#8217;t figure out why a doctor would be that way, and it&#8217;s true. It was absolutely true what he had written. I mean it would have been nicer if he would have done it when he was supposed to. Then I would have gotten over that whole thing and the whole interview process. They were happy, they were satisfied at the interview that I had met all the requirements to be a board certified doctor in the state of New Jersey. And, here they were, they were going to give me my license, and it was going to arrive in the mail.   But that whole process from the beginning to the end took almost a year so, here I am, I&#8217;m waiting for my license, which has to arrive for me to be able to get a job, but I call different places and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in New Jersey anymore. That&#8217;s it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what happened. I just decided I don&#8217;t want to be in New Jersey. I had just broken up with a boyfriend and realized that that wasn&#8217;t going in the right direction so I didn&#8217;t want to be in New Jersey. So I said, &#8220;So where should I go?&#8221; Well, who takes New Jersey licenses anywhere? The government. So I signed on to be a reservation doctor in Oklahoma, but the person who&#8211;. Somebody took the job out from under me. I was packing my bags to go to Oklahoma and somebody took the job from under me because they had had a job there and loved that job. It was a nice cushy job, I heard afterwards. I wasn&#8217;t trying to get it to be cushy. I thought that would be nice, surrounded by little Native American Indians and be able to help those little kids out. But, as I was packing my bags and getting everything ready to go to this job, they told me, &#8220;Sorry, Rose. You&#8217;re not going.&#8221;   So I start looking again and a job comes up at Fort Campbell, Kentucky to work at the military base there and to be their pediatrician. I do a phone interview, it went very, very nicely. He offers me the job on the spot. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow, okay. You don&#8217;t know me or anything. This is very exciting.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Okay, so when are you ready to start?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, I guess in two weeks.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You got it.&#8221; So I was packing up my bags and instead of going to Oklahoma to the reservation, or wherever that was, now I&#8217;m going to Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  EF: Right, okay.  RFS: So, all by myself, nobody with me, packed my bags, leave New Jersey behind, go to Kentucky. [I] live in an apartment for a few months, until I realize I really like this so I got my own apartment.  EF: You wanted to stay.  RFS: I decided that I wanted to stay, and this is Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  EF: Right.  RFS: Are you familiar with it?  EF: Yeah, my wife used to live there.  RFS: Oh! That&#8217;s too funny.  EF: She&#8217;s a military brat.   RFS: Okay. That&#8217;s funny, so you&#8217;re very familiar with Clarksville and Hopkinsville.  EF: Yeah, near the Tennessee border?  RFS: Yes, that&#8217;s right, and Hopkinsville. So I get assigned to a clinic, it&#8217;s called the White Clinic. Dave&#8217;s there, my husband.  EF: Oh, okay.  RFS: That&#8217;s how we met. My first job, and there&#8217;s this guy, and he&#8217;s good-looking, but he&#8217;s married so it&#8217;s like, okay. So I didn&#8217;t know that he was getting divorced at the end of that year that I was there, so he looks interested and he&#8217;s talking to me and [01:39:27]. So he let&#8217;s me know that he has gotten a divorce, because his wife had cheated on him, and that he was interested in me and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow! Okay, that&#8217;s a lot to disembark on me at one time.&#8221;   EF: Yeah. To say the least.  RFS: Yeah. So one year later we were married and, from Kentucky&#8211;. They did not have a spot to renew my contract the second year. I would have been happy to stay a second year there. This was before I knew that there was anybody interested in me there, but I wanted to stay on because I had already made a home, I had friends, I had a church group there. I liked what I was doing. So I felt very at home in this little town of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, but they didn&#8217;t have an extension for my contract there so I had to go somewhere else. I interviewed everywhere and the school of Emory, in Atlanta, Egleston, offered me a contract as a pediatrician, and I said, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go there.&#8221; People warned me, they said that that was not maybe a good fit for me because I didn&#8217;t seem to like big cities anymore, I liked smaller places, and that maybe as a younger Christian girl that wouldn&#8217;t be a good fit. I said, &#8220;No, I really feel like that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m supposed to go.&#8221; So during that transition is when Dave tells me that he would like to marry me, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hmm, that&#8217;s interesting. I think I kind of dig him too.&#8221; So he&#8217;s at Fort Campbell and I&#8217;m moving to Atlanta, so he let&#8217;s them know that he&#8217;d like to move to Atlanta within a year and he proposes and we get married. So we live at Fort McPherson for three years.  EF: Okay.  RFS: I get married in Atlanta and we&#8217;re there for four years, from 1995 until 1999. He completes his time for the military and he is discharged, obviously honorably, and a few of his friends from his military base say, &#8220;This is a great place to go,&#8221; North Carolina, and then Burlington, at the Kernodle Clinic. So at the time that he&#8217;s looking for these different jobs I had just gotten pregnant and so I realize, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to go out and make a family now.&#8221; So we look at all these different places in Tennessee, and in Georgia, and Smithfield, North Carolina, and here, and we thought that this was the place most suitable.  EF: Burlington.  RFS: Burlington, and they had lots and lots and lots of little Hispanic kids. And so we decided that we were going to start a clinic for mostly underserved Hispanic children because that had always been my dream. By the time that Dave came along I had reconciled myself that I was going to be single, and a doctor, and that I was going to go and be a little bit like Mother Theresa and start little places and help children, probably Dr. Mall talking to me in my head that I had to do what I had to do for other people.   EF: Right.  RFS: So, with that missionary idea, we come to Burlington, North Carolina and said we&#8217;re going to put all of our savings together. We lived, very, very, very, very frugally for those first three-and-a-half years of marriage.  EF: In Atlanta.  RFS: We saved everything away. We lived in apartments, we never went out to eat. We put everything away. We didn&#8217;t live like doctors who were up-and-coming at all. Mice, was more like it.   EF: Right.   RFS: Very poor church mice. So anyway, we came with all of our savings and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to invest into a practice so that nobody can tell us how to run a practice, and we can give care to whom we want to give care, and we can take insurance if we want to but nobody has to dictate to us how we&#8217;re going to give the care in the best way that we see fit. We can help the community, we can do great things.&#8221; And that&#8217;s where the idea of the practice was born.  EF: Which is, I guess, where I&#8217;m sitting right now, we&#8217;re sitting right now.  RFS: Well, actually we started&#8211;. If you investigate Burlington, Dr. Vaught had an ENT, ear, nose, and throat, office in the other side of town, and I started in a teeny little office, it was about one thousand square feet, maybe twelve hundred, with three rooms, and it was with just my mom. I brought my mom over. I knew that I was going to deliver middle of October and I was supposed to start the practice in December.  EF: Wow.  RFS: So I needed somebody to help me with this new granddaughter and my mom said, &#8220;Me!&#8221;  EF: Right.  RFS: So she decided she&#8217;s going to leave the whole school thing behind for my brother, who&#8217;s ten years younger. And so she&#8217;s going to leave that behind for him and she&#8217;s going to come and help me to start the [practice] and raise our kid. So she comes from the Dominican Republic, we put her up in an apartment, and she&#8217;s my front desk person, and that was a hoot. She picks up the phone but then she doesn&#8217;t really want to talk. She was like, [Imitating her mother] &#8220;Hello? Romeri, come here.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my goodness, Mom. You can speak English. How come now you can&#8217;t speak English?&#8221;   EF: That&#8217;s so funny.  RFS: [She says,] &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to make appointment.&#8221; [I say,] &#8220;You&#8217;re a professional. You&#8217;ve led a school for the last twenty years, and now you can&#8217;t speak English? I don&#8217;t understand this.&#8221; So, anyway, that was a hoot. So my mom, needless to say, that front desk job for my mom did not last long. So I tried to get that to change as quickly as possible. It took me a few months to be able to have enough money so that I could get a receptionist, a fulltime receptionist, [and] that was much better. My mom would come in but to look over and to take care of Hannah, and to pull charts. Much less stressful that way.  EF: Right. Gotcha.  RFS: So we were over at that building. We started at the end of 1999, so we were over at that building until 2002, so we were there in 9-11 and that was a very dramatic time for everybody. So we moved here maybe &#8211; I think it was June or July of 2002.  EF: This building we&#8217;re in right now.  RFS: This building.  EF: Okay.  RFS: An optometrist was selling it. I always forget his name. It was Dr. Spaeth. [He] had this building and the building next door. We own this whole little compound, this whole little area. He had his optometry building in here and then moved it away and left it as a daycare, but they took really bad care of it. So he gave it to us at a very reasonable price, and we bought it and fixed it up. Everything that you see Dave put where it is, so we would spend all of our weekends and all of our time fixing it up so that it would be a little place that the patients would call home. That was twelve years ago. So, at that time, no other doctors. Now we have four other doctors. My husband left his job with the Kernodle Clinic because we were here until 9:00 or 10:00, with Hannah. She didn&#8217;t see Christmas until she was three because there was no time to get any gifts, wrap any gifts, or to put a Christmas tree up because we were so busy. We&#8217;d go home and we&#8217;d fall asleep exhausted.  EF: Yeah, okay.  RFS: In my office there&#8217;s a trundle bed because we would sleep here many nights on end, and she was home schooled until the fourth grade because we didn&#8217;t want to put her in E. M. Holt. We live in Snow Camp and so we didn&#8217;t want to put her in a school in the southern part of Alamance, and she would be far away from here and we couldn&#8217;t even go and get her. So we home schooled her until she was in fourth grade. I did a lot of investigation for what was the better education. It wasn&#8217;t for religious purposes. It was more for who had the best quality education, in our view, and the best value in the county that we could access, and that happened to be, in our assessment, Burlington Christian Academy, which happens to be about two miles away.   EF: Okay.   RFS: So that&#8217;s where we put her in school and she&#8217;s happily been there since the fourth grade.   EF: Okay.  RFS: And she&#8217;s in tenth grade now.   EF: Great.  RFS: And she speaks some Spanish; she&#8217;s a bit bilingual.
EF: Okay, great.
RFS: Because I speak to her in Spanish, she answers back in English, but I think that she understands everything we&#8217;re saying.
EF: That&#8217;s excellent.
RFS: And we all have the spirit of giving back. I think that we have to be very un-stingy, very generous in how we look at the community because there are all of these opportunities that people have taken to give to us. And we need to be looking for the opportunities to give back to them so that we can change their lives and make their lives a better one.
EF: Well that&#8217;s a great lead-in to the next question I wanted to ask [which is] how you became involved in politics, how you became conservative and involved with the Republic women in Alamance County, which I&#8217;m guessing is a longer story.
RFS: Well actually no, because all of these things&#8211;. As you can see the flow of doing things for others and having some conservative philosophies is a thread that you&#8217;ll see through the whole thing, so I followed that through. It wasn&#8217;t a political thing. When Reagan first came into office I guess I was sixteen, I was in Canada, and I saw a lot of differences. It was the first political awakening. I saw the differences between how the country was with Jimmy Carter, even from far away, from Canada, to how things changed under Ronald Reagan. By the time Ronald Reagan left office I was twenty-four. Things were going much better for the US as a whole and so that influenced me, from afar, in a political stand.   But, I grew up under that Reagan time from sixteen to twenty-four, very formative years, but none of them was I in the United States. I was overseas almost that whole time until I was twenty-three and came back from the Dominican Republic to pursue my residency. But I did see the difference that the country was led in, from a moral perspective but from a financial perspective, and so I pondered that but from far away and never really got very involved in politics. I did know that if I were to consider myself one of the two I would be more kindred to Republicanism than I was to [the Democrats], although I could see that the Democratic had some things that I thought that I could agree with, but mostly I would say I would divide it seventy-thirty. I wasn&#8217;t a rabid Republican.   As a pediatrician and an evangelical Christian I am very much pro anybody&#8217;s life. So I don&#8217;t like the thought of discarding children, but that is, in the end, a more personal decision, that a mom is the one who has to live with that decision, and it&#8217;s a very painful one, so that I don&#8217;t want to condemn those ladies that do that. At the same time I do have my trepidation about people who would profit from something like that because I know it to be very painful for the baby. And as a pediatrician who really feels for her patients, any pain in a human being, but especially in an unborn, such an innocent, na&#239;ve one, I find that to be very unsatisfying to me. But I truly try to find every way possible to try to minister to the moms because it&#8217;s a very, very tough time, a very tough decision that they&#8217;re making. They&#8217;re the spiritual takers of that situation.   So in many, many different ways, many different avenues of Republicanism or conservatism, I found that it was more either an evangelical Christian or a person who cares about her neighbor, that I was more kindred to Republicanism than I was to some of the more Democratic philosophies. And I did get to see that the country generally did better under more Republican leadership, overall, not just the president but maybe in the Senate or the Congress, but when the balance was more balanced then the country seems to do better. When that balance is more towards one or more towards the other, to the extremes, then the country seems to not do as well, from a financial standpoint, many times. So I observe all this and observe what does well in my families and what policies lead to them overall doing well, so I&#8217;ll finish off a little bit in what did. So, you remember Carmen from the factory who decided to take L.B.J.&#8217;s &#8211; yes. Well, she had three kids and she grew up under the guise of welfare. She never worked for a paycheck after that first day, in her life. They were very enthralled with easy money, and her husband decided that he didn&#8217;t want to work fulltime, so he was involved with the Spanish mafia in New York and would make counterfeit money and was involved with maybe some drugs. But they all had the easy street, welfare and food coupons and all that kind of stuff, which is part of what they did to continue that bent in their life of everything should come to us very easily.   So I grew up with them across the street, and when we went back to the Dominican Republic, strangely enough, my aunt and her husband, Frank, went back to the Dominican Republic together with us, so that we were once again reunited. I was reunited with my older cousin, Jackie &#8211; she was older than me by two years &#8211; my cousin, Frankie, who was the same age as I, and my younger cousin, Nelson, who was younger by two years. So we were reunited so I got to see them again, and they didn&#8217;t like to work, they liked the easy life. And they were going to the very highbrow school in the Dominican Republic that was way out of reach for my mom and my dad to be able to pay, and my cousin never worked a day of her life. She came back to [New York], because she obviously didn&#8217;t want to work so she wasn&#8217;t going to make her way in the Dominican Republic, so she came back to New York, and the easiest way to make a way for herself in New York was once again to take advantage of the whole L.B.J. process.   So, she got pregnant at eighteen or nineteen, came back to the States, had her kid, and subsequently had another kid every one or two years. And she wound up having, I think it was seven or eight children. Every couple of years she would have a child, and those increased her government subsidies and her checks and all of that, easy living, but also not having anything to do leaves people open for a lot of not so good things. She became involved in drugs and became involved in a lifestyle that was not good for herself or for her children, and she, from the drug use, I guess she damaged her heart because she found herself with a degenerative heart condition where she needed a heart transplant before she turned forty. After having a heart transplant she succumbed to an infection of the heart and died by the time she was forty, left seven children behind.   My second cousin, Frankie, didn&#8217;t like difficulty in his life either but saw his dad growing up as the mafia king. They had a bit of a lavish, at that point when we went back to the Dominican Republic, lifestyle. He got chased out of New York City with a whole bunch of counterfeit money, and so they had to leave because he was going to get killed. People still had a bounty on his head. So, it was very dramatic, very interesting, and we saw this from afar. So my cousin, Frankie, got to see all this and liked the easy life and obviously was drawn to having easy money. [He] didn&#8217;t have an education, never strived very hard for anything, so got involved in grand theft auto, was in a federal penitentiary, but was a generally nice guy. He really was, he was very pleasant and everything. So, was allowed out of prison after having served his time there, and got caught being with the wrong crowd and doing the wrong stuff while he was still on probation and he went back and he died in prison. That&#8217;s my second cousin from my Aunt Carmen.   My third cousin has probably worked maybe less than a year of his life. He&#8217;s in his forties, and he has some sort of degenerative disease, might be lupus, might be multiple sclerosis, I&#8217;m not sure what he has, but he doesn&#8217;t work because he claims a disability check every day of his life. My Aunt Carmen still has not worked, she&#8217;s in her seventies, and has not worked but she&#8217;s had all of those seven grandchildren at one time or the other pass through her house, each one of them has been on government checks. They&#8217;re out in the world and, poor kids, they haven&#8217;t maximized their potential at all because there hasn&#8217;t been anybody to help them to maximize that potential. And they don&#8217;t know a different life, so when I reach out to them there hasn&#8217;t been an interest because you have to work in my house. So, long story short, you can see the two divergent paths. My aunt, you can say that she&#8217;s very Democratic, and ourselves, we have always never been very Democratic. My mom went out and wanted to vote in this last election, did vote for Thom Tillis, because, &#8220;I think that the things that they stand for are the good things,&#8221; and my aunt still thinks that the government should continue to take care of her, and the government has taken care of her since she was twenty-seven years old.   My Aunt Peggy is now &#8211; to form the full circle of the beginning of the story &#8211; she is now almost eighty-two years old. She lives on a big, it used to be a farm, but she couldn&#8217;t take care of her animals anymore, so years and years ago she sold the animals one by one. But she lives on this land, lives off of her retirement. She put things together very well. Her husband died ten years ago, the one that she met at the airport, [and] she&#8217;s been alone but she&#8217;s a happy, very lovely, generous, laughing so hard that your ears feel they&#8217;re going to break lady. She loves America. She thinks that America is the best country on earth, would never go back to anywhere else. [She] loves to travel, but finding it increasingly difficult to travel so we go visit her once a year, my daughter and I, and she came to spend a week with us a couple weeks ago. So we went and showed her the mountains of North Carolina and she was enthralled. She loves spending time with us and telling us all the old stories again of what America was like fifty years ago and why she loves this country. So, all of that adds up, and it adds up to the values that my aunt taught me, she had a voice, but then my other aunt, she had a lot to teach me as well but the opposite way, and that my mom taught me, and that all adds up to why I&#8217;m a conservative.
EF: And you&#8217;ve been involved with the Republican Party for a while.
RFS: No, not really.
EF: Oh, that&#8217;s right. You said that earlier. It&#8217;s more recent.
RFS: Yeah, it&#8217;s been more recent. It&#8217;s only been maybe really actively for the past year or two.
EF: Oh, I see. Okay.
RFS: It expresses where I think the country would do the best. It expresses where I think that children will do the best. Seeing the two paths that my aunt took and that my mom took, the path of hard work, not counting on the government, educating yourself, versus the path of government intervention and not thinking that you can do it for yourself. And those are two very divergent paths, and I think that America is better off following a path where if you live off of government subsidies for a short time, it&#8217;s to give you a hand up during a certain amount of time so that we better ourselves as human beings.   I think as human beings we weren&#8217;t meant to live off of somebody for the rest of our lives because it&#8217;s a sub-quality existence. We don&#8217;t feel that we&#8217;re utilizing, we&#8217;re not fulfilling what we were meant to be, so we get to be depressed and anxious. If you were to do studies on people who are on welfare, or get a lot of subsidies, or are on chronic disability, not just because of their mental disabilities or anything, you&#8217;d find that they have more anxiety, they have more depression. [It&#8217;s] because they&#8217;re not fulfilling their call in life, whether that&#8217;s putting zippers on a boot or you&#8217;re a doctor, but you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re fulfilling a call, you&#8217;re being a part of the society, you&#8217;re working together. It&#8217;s individuals but then the individuals work together to create a better society for people.   So I feel that our country will do better under more Republicanism than Democratic philosophies, but I think that there&#8217;s still a mix. I&#8217;m not an extremist. I believe that our Constitution is a very, very important document. That&#8217;s why my aunt came here. She didn&#8217;t know tha,t but it&#8217;s our Constitution that allows this country to be what it is and to form that structure that gives us the opportunity, and a poor immigrant girl the opportunity, to have a clinic, and be able to help five to six thousand kids. That&#8217;s from being a first generation Dominican to now, but it&#8217;s the structure of America that&#8217;s able to offer that opportunity where no other country has that structure already set up, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. I realize that what we call conservatism really boils down to really believing in what our founding fathers said about our Constitution and about each one of us having our individual rights and being able to exert those rights and being able to decide for ourselves, &#8220;How far do I want to go? Not far at all? That&#8217;s up to you. Very far? That&#8217;s up to me.&#8221;
EF: Well I appreciate the detailed family and philosophical explanation.  RFS: I didn&#8217;t know where I was going.   EF: It really did. I thought that was tremendous. Well that&#8217;s all the questions that I had, but before I stop the recording is there anything else that you wanted to add or say that you feel is important?  RFS: I do it for the children. I do everything that I do because I want to offer the kids that I come in contact with as great opportunities as was afforded to me. And now [with] my good education and where I am in life, I&#8217;m able to easily offer that to my daughter, so I want to give them as many of the opportunities to be able to do what was given to me in their own lives. So I do it for them, individually to the patients here, but also I&#8217;d like to see other kids do better, and that something that&#8217;s very important to us in this clinic is to have the parents understand that and that we have to parent in that sense, that we&#8217;re bringing up citizens. We&#8217;re not bringing them up to be happy people; we&#8217;re bringing them up to be good citizens that are happy and content because they have a place in society. And that&#8217;s how you really accomplish and get to being happy, or content, is because you have a place in life that you feel fulfilled in.   So that&#8217;s what I try to teach through the Republican meetings and all that. That&#8217;s what I try to teach the people that attend, that we have to pass our heritage and our history on to our children because if we don&#8217;t take care of it within a generation or two it&#8217;s going to be gone, and people are not going to understand what&#8211;. Like Greece. Like Rome. They&#8217;re not going to understand what that actually meant. They stood for as grand things as we did but they&#8217;re just a page or two in history books now. We don&#8217;t want to be that. We want to understand why our founding fathers did what they did two hundred and forty years ago, and if that to me means conservatism or Republicanism, you can call it whatever you want, but that&#8217;s what I want to pass on.  EF: Well, thank you, Dr. Stein, for all of your time. I will go ahead and turn the recording off.  RFS: Thank you.
