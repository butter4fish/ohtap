Speaker 2: Right then I say Tuesday (laugh), I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Well--
Story_ID: 101524
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions they make me ask everyone--they have no relevance whatsoever.  But the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, macaroni and cheese.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Autumn
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, that's interesting, no.
Story_ID: 101525
Speaker 1: Okay, well now I want to ask you about your ancestors.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's side.  We're going to start with your mother's side of the family and just ask you what you know about that side of the family.  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side first of all?
Speaker 2: We can't go back very far at least we can go back systematically.  I know about my mother's parents both who came from Georgia and came to Detroit [Michigan] in the 19-teens [1910s] and -twenties [1920s].  Like many African Americans they came up--my grandfather [Grant Foster] came up to work for Henry Ford [Ford Motor Company] when he was soliciting blacks really to break the unions--the potential new unions in the automotive industry and I know a little bit about my grandmother's folks who are also from Georgia and from Alabama.  But it's very splotchy so we skip a couple of generations and we know kind of the person who supposedly was, you know, Cherokee Indian or Choctaw, you know those things at least a part of our mythology.  But we really don't have a good system of going back very far.  I think only until about up to 1870s and '80s [1880s].
Speaker 1: Is there any tradition about what your people were doing in those days?  Were they slaves or were they free or what condition they were-who they were serving?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. So, the one story that I think everyone keeps telling and retelling is in Alabama my mother's people were slaves in Alabama and they were slaves somewhere near Montgomery, Alabama and during the Civil War they were involved in actually helping when all of the pillaging was going on helping their slave master believe it or not to stay on his property without being killed or injured by the northern troops.  And for that reason he gave them several parcels of land which they still own.  So he gave this land after he died as a kind of repayment for their good graces.  But that's about the only thing that we know.  We've actually visited that property near downtown Montgomery, actually.  It was very interesting to see land that goes back that far in our family.  But most of my people were farmers that's what I know, very few professionals until really my parents' generation and my generation.
Speaker 1: Okay that's interesting information to have that scenario where they helped him hide out from the Union and then was rewarded.
Speaker 2: Ironically.
Speaker 1: There are so many stories that go into a rich collection of stories from that period that have passed down.  Not everybody has a story they can pass down or know about one so that's something to be, to hold on to.
Speaker 2: It's a very interesting story and reminds us of how complicated slavery was.  So it's not a simple thing to understand that part of our past.  But my parents--my mother [Lovetta Foster Andrews] was very, very interested in coming South to see that land and what's really interesting about that is, you know, when my grandfather left the South.  He only came back to bring people out of the South.  He brought his cousins, nephews, nieces but he never came back to stay.  The idea of coming back to the south for him was just not something that he would have valued.  So he always felt himself to be someone who was bringing people to a land of opportunity and promise and that's basically what happened.  His house was the way station for everyone coming up from the South.  He would get the men on at Ford's and the women would try to get jobs as domestics and that's how my people came into the middle class really through the automotive industry.
Story_ID: 101526
Speaker 1: Tell me can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Lovetta, L-O-V-E-T-T-A, Foster, F-O-S-T-E-R and she was born in Detroit [Michigan] but her father, Grant Foster was from, I think was from Georgia or Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you know--do you have any stories about your mother growing up or how she grew up in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well she was the youngest child of nine and so I don't have a lot of stories.  The thing that I recall is that her older siblings many of whom were alive when I was growing up thought that she had the benefit of being the youngest child.  So my understanding is that grandfather who was also a minister and pretty strict was probably the most lenient with my mother because she was the youngest child of nine.
Speaker 1: What's her birth date?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh she was born in the 1920s, she's deceased now but she died when I turned forty so she died fifteen years ago at sixty.  So that tells you something, I just have to do my math.
Speaker 1: So she was born in Detroit, raised in Detroit.  What side of town did she grow up on?
Speaker 2: On the northwest side of town.  I don't know if it was called the black bottom but around the near northwest side and around Hazlett and Warren--some of these streets I've forgotten now it's been so long since I've been back.
Speaker 1: Okay did she have a chance to pursue higher education herself?
Speaker 2: She did actually.  Because she was the youngest of nine by the time she got ready to go to college her older sisters and brothers could help and actually her older sisters because the other brothers--her older brothers I think were all deceased.  But she and the next youngest son both went to college.  So the last two of the nine both went to college.  She didn't finish, she went to it was called Cleary College then in Michigan near Ypsilanti and it's now part of Eastern Michigan University.  But she went there for clerical or secretarial school and then she, I think she had hopes actually to go further but family came and so she didn't finish.  But her younger brother did finish and he had a very, very good education went to Cass [Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan] then went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and finished in engineering.  So as the generations progressed our people got a chance to take more advantage of the education opportunities and frankly the stigma I think of getting a great education rather than going to Ford's [Ford Motor Company], I think was lifted as people moved into the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  The idea of a good job was paramount for many blacks coming out of the south.  So people really weren't thinking of colleges much in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], not poor people.  But by the 1940s, I think and '50s [1950s] especially the sense that there was a way to get into school and finish and pay for it was really a possibility for those in my mother's generation.
Story_ID: 101527
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandfather [Grant Foster] was a pastor, what denomination?
Speaker 2: He was Baptist; he worked at Ford's [Ford Motor Company] like many a minister--black ministers in those days.  He was really an itinerant preacher and had several small congregations up and down Michigan Avenue going out toward Romulus, Michigan and so I don't know very much about it because I was very young but it just meant that my family would get up very early-my parents, my mother would get up very early on Sunday and then be with my grandfather all day as he went to one or two churches.  Have lunch at one church, drop off the kids with some family from that church and then go on to another church.  So in those days you kind of pieced together a ministry with several churches some you wouldn't even visit every week, you kind of ping pong.  Because of that I think my mother [Lovetta Foster Andrews] had her fill of kind of Sunday full days at church.  So when we grew up, we had a much more lenient upbringing with regard to that.  But he was just a Baptist, not trained--he went to bible college in Detroit [Michigan] and took some correspondent courses as a way of getting more education but college really was not in the cards for him as a provider of his family, great patriarch though.
Story_ID: 101528
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was James, J-A-M-E-S Wildrex, W-I-L-D-R-E-X Andrews, A-N-D-R-E-W-S.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind Wildrex?
Speaker 2: If it is, we have never it.  I've always asked because it's such a peculiar name but I have never found anyone to tell me where it came from.  My dad would just say that's what his parents named him but it doesn't seem to be a family name or a kind of collision of two names, we just don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born October 25 I think or 27 right around 1921.  He's also deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay and was he born in Detroit [Michigan] too?
Speaker 2: Yes he was.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well my father's father I never knew because he died when my father was a child and so I know very little of my fraternal [sic, paternal] grandfather.  My grandmother, however--my dad's mother was a musician.  She was actually a classically-trained musician who had grown up in the South actually not too far from here in and around Grantville, Georgia, a small town and she came to Detroit early on and then studied classically music in Detroit and also in Chicago [Illinois].  So in a very interesting way in those days because she was a woman, she ended up being a minister of music at various churches.  But she also had her own women's choir or chorus and so it was really unusual in the 1920s and '30s [1930s] to have a kind of classically kind of based ensemble of women.  We have some wonderful pictures of her as a young pianist and choral person.  But it was really through her example that I got not so much interested in music but she introduced me to many black composers and conductors because the seeing of black classical musicians when I was small was pretty small.  But I remember meeting Jimmy DePriest [James DePriest], the conductor and [HM] Paul Freeman and all of those guys because they were all a part of the National Association of Negro Musicians which was the Negro musicians' professional union and she was very active in that.  So that's the side of the family and certainly her support in a very quiet way of my own musical efforts was very, very important to me.
Speaker 1: Now what's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Estelle, E-S-T-E-L-L-E Andrews and she's also deceased and she was a well known and very active piano teacher and vocal coach in Detroit working with the classical singers.  The interesting thing about folks that had come up from the South that had received the kind of conservatory training that she had was that she was very, very specific about what music was acceptable for her and for those that she wanted to bring up.  So for example, the idea of gospel music and improvising in jazz was not the music that she would have directed her children or even her grandson like me to do because she really wanted you to get the rudiments in a formal way.
Speaker 1: So she wouldn't have liked the music of Thomas Dorsey say?
Speaker 2: No that's right--that's exactly right and certainly would not have liked the kind of jumping and shouting that many people that associated with more kind of evangelical traditions.  She came from what we would call a High Baptist kind of background and so the hymnal and the arranged spirituals of [Harry T.] Burleigh and [William L.] Dawson that would be the repertoire that she, you know, would want to promote.
Story_ID: 101529
Speaker 1: Tell us a little about, now, what did your father [James Wildrex Andrews] do for a living and did he get a chance to go to school too or?
Speaker 2: He did for a time, like my mother [Lovetta Foster Andrews] he didn't finish.  Everyone tells me that he had a very, very good mind for numbers and for math.  I think he wanted to be an accountant but he never did finish.  He went to one of the technical schools in Detroit called--I think it was called Detroit Technical College but he only went for I think for a couple of years.  He ended up being a civil servant working for the City of Detroit [Michigan] and he worked in the sidewalks and permits division which meant that he worked in City Hall and one of the great memories that we have is that to be a black man and working in City Hall with all the shiny glass was really a big deal because at 4th of July you could go into City Hall which is right on the river in Detroit and you could see Windsor. [Ontario] Canada and you could see the fireworks.  It was always he took great pride in taking us down to City Hall to sit up in his very shiny office and watch the fireworks.  But in those days those were prime jobs if you weren't working in the automotive industry to have a civil servant job where you had to do permits and things like that for building contractors.  It was really pretty extraordinary.  So that's what he did for his entire career.
Speaker 1: You're right I know that some cities struggle for years to try to get blacks as white-collar employees with the city.
Speaker 2: That's right he was one of like only--well he was the only one in his division when I was a small child it certainly changed in my lifetime.  But I can remember because as they gave him a city car that had the city of Detroit emblem on it.  Man that was like--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh he was really--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: We were thought we were made in the shade.  But yeah that was a good experience for us.  He was an achiever who like many, like many of his generation, he did as much as he could with what he had to work with and those opportunities were much harder then.
Story_ID: 101530
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how your parents [James Wildrex Andrews and Lovetta Foster Andrews] met?
Speaker 2: I think they were introduced by some mutual friends.  I don't recall all of the details but my parents had great friends.  I mean they did a lot of socializing.  This is in the days of the late '40s [1940s] early '50s [1950s] you know.  They would go to clubs and they had a club called the Six Deuces and it was like six couples and so they did a lot of socializing.  My dad, I guess was a very kind of flashy, kind of smooth guy so I think he really kind of swept my mom off her feet in terms of that because he was very kind of smooth and also he liked to go out and have a good time and stuff.  So that's how they met, I think through one of these social clubs and through friends and so they had--they were married their entire lives long certainly with ups and downs but I think that's what brought them together.  My mother was a beautiful woman from looking at the pictures when she was young.  So I think they were both, you know like all young people you're attracted by--you know physical attraction.  By the grace of God they were able to hang for a very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah I have a younger brother his name is Michael Eric Andrews and he still lives in Detroit [Michigan].  He's a videographer and camera person and so he works--he does a lot of commercial production and has run his own shop and he also went to Cass [Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan] and just very talented guy and he has two children and a wife and they live in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay is that it then just you and your brother?
Speaker 2: Just me and my brother but because of my mother's large family, we have a really large extended family.  Many, many cousins and we're all pretty close given our distance in traveling.
Story_ID: 101531
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a first childhood memory, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think the first--well I remember getting our cowboy boots and cowboy hats.  This had to be, I guess early '50s [1950s] and I remember Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and what's the guy with the horse-the Lone Ranger and that first Christmas when we got our Lone Ranger stuff.  So that's probably my fondest, early memory when we were five or six or something like that.
Speaker 1: Those cowboys were a big deal in those days, I notice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did you all watch a lot of television?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if we watched a lot by today's standards but certainly when we were finally able to have our-my family by the time they were able to get their own TV because I don't think they had their own TV when we were very, very young.  So we would enjoy going over to our aunts and uncles that were older that were more established that had a television.  But yeah we watched the favorite shows, "Gunsmoke" and all the things in the '50s [1950s] because my dad [James Wildrex Andrews] was a TV nut.  He loved nothing more than to sit in front of the TV and watch his favorite TV shows in the '50s [1950s].  And so--so we watched a fair amount especially in the evening.
Story_ID: 101532
Speaker 1: Okay now, who do you think you take after the most, your mother [Lovetta Foster Andrews] or your father [James Wildrex Andrews]?
Speaker 2: Well I think I'd like to say I take after my mother who I think was a very, a very, very welcoming and warm person.  So I think I'd like to think that but I think that in some ways I'm probably more like my father than I would want to admit.  We had a very difficult relationship growing up as a child because he was an alcoholic and because of his alcoholism as a young child it was just very difficult to deal with him because some alcoholics become very kind of placid and lovable when they are intoxicated.  My dad would go from being a very quiet and gentle guy to being really not a very nice man when he was drunk.  So he was a regular weekend drinker.  So from Friday night to Sunday night he would be drunk that was my memory and that was very difficult for all of us because right at the time most kids would be out playing with their dad or going to the park or being on a team, we were busy trying to make sure that our dad didn't embarrass us by coming into the house drunk and stuff like that.  So because of that we had a very difficult time with one another really throughout my entire growing up and now that I look back on it with kind of 20/20 hindsight, I'm probably like him in some ways even though I don't--I'm not a drinker.  But I think some of things that drove him to drink probably are in my personality as well.  I think that he really wanted to please people and didn't realize that he was pleasing people and so that was a kind of an ointment if you will.  I don't think he was ever really satisfied with himself and his solution was drinking, mine is probably working too much.
Story_ID: 101533
Speaker 1: What were some of the--can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in or neighborhoods--may be more than one?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We had a great growing up in Detroit [Michigan].  We were-we lived in what's called northwest Detroit and it was a newly integrated neighborhood.  I think we moved to our house on Fullerton Street around 1955, '56 [1956] and it was just a middle class, working class neighborhood in the 1950s middle class way.  So these were separate homes with nice backyards and nice lawns and it was a great growing up.  Kids played outside until it was dark and everybody took care of everybody else's kids and the most problem you would have would be a fight with a kid after school and there were no guns or explosives involved.  So it was a great growing up.  It's hard to describe for people what I thought was a wonderful experience in Detroit because if you see Detroit now it really is a shell of what it was forty or fifty years ago.  It's very hard to say no this was really beautiful, quite beautiful and Detroit had so many opportunities, culturally and socially that we had a great time.  Yeah the sights and smells were being able to go to the park; we had a playground right at the corner.  We could stand at the corner and decide which car we were going to buy when we grew up and it was fantastic.  Still integrated, the neighborhood really did not completely become black; it took almost a decade or so, a decade to twelve years.  It was really about the riots of 1967/'68 [1968] but it was very slow and gradual so there were a lot of older white folks in our neighborhood who were very, very much mentored us.  We didn't think our relationships were founded on race at the time I think as a child.  So it was really 1967/'68 [1968] that really from my understanding of our neighborhood and myself really changed and Detroit really changed; it never came back from the way in which the riots of I think '68 [1968] just caused a hemorrhage and the fault line between black and white just seemed to be irreparable.
Speaker 1: Right it's much the same now.
Speaker 2: That's right it never recovered.  You're seeing 1968 still being lived in Detroit; it's a tragedy of the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah the city is kind of surrounded by white people in the suburbs and the inner city's blacks and the rest of the state is trying to get resources out of Detroit without giving anything back.
Speaker 2: It's a heartbreak because it's a city that has so much potential and so now it is difficult to go back because I try to go back to my old haunts to kind of look at the sights, look at the public library, look at the playgrounds it's not there.  But it's part of a much larger picture.  But I think in some ways my frustration and sadness about Detroit is intensified because I live in Atlanta [Georgia] which for all of its challenges has a great sense of optimism and promise and so the same things that have locked Detroit down just have not paralyzed the city.  So even with its faults, it's proof that there are other ways to find solutions to those kinds of divisions.
Story_ID: 101534
Speaker 1: Okay how would you describe yourself growing up?  What were you interested in doing and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: I think I was--I think I discovered early on that I could make people laugh and could kind of diffuse problems by keeping people entertained and I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing but I think I found early on that people would like you if you could make them laugh.  So even as a small child in school--in elementary school I think I was really the class clown.  I was the one always showing out and acting--doing something stupid.  But invariably even the teacher would laugh because I did something so absurd.  I think I enjoyed being likeable in that way.  I probably wasn't a very good student in the early years.  I think I was pretty smart and because I was pretty smart I don't think I worked very hard at school and I certainly wasn't very disciplined.  I think I kind of coasted and I think I kept coasting for a very long time until I got to Cass [Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan] and then it was hard to coast because everyone was so good at everything.  But I think I was a kid who just enjoyed fun and discovered music very early on and that helped to bring some focus and a kind of way out to some of the problems at home with my dad's alcoholism.
Story_ID: 101535
Speaker 1: So mus--so you got interested in music at an early age?
Speaker 2: It was very simple, in those days in 19, I guess '50s [1950s] in Detroit [Michigan] like most public schools, public education in Detroit was actually quite good and every student had to take a certain number of music classes.  Everybody sang in the chorus, everybody had to play a band instrument and the instruments were free because the whole idea was that music and art and drama, these were all things to help you become a great citizen.  And so originally I took up the drums because the drum pad and the sticks were the cheapest of all the things that you could get into and my parents [James Wildrex Andrews and Lovetta Foster Andrews] knew that if I--the only thing I ever had to buy was some drum sticks, we were cool.  So I took up the drums but then when we went to music class you never got a chance to play on a drum, you played on a drum pad and everybody else had a real instrument, a real clarinet, a real violin.  So I was frustrated with the drum sticks thing and then what happened was my oldest aunt-my mother's oldest sister had--Aunt Jesse had an old clarinet that her kids had in public school that she had actually purchased and they were off being athletes.  So she brought the clarinet over and said, "Why don't you take the clarinet to school.  If you can fix it up, you can have it and play it in the band" and so that's what I did.  I still have it, it's one of those old metal clarinets which you could kill somebody with this instrument.  So if you couldn't play, you had a weapon there.  And so that's how I switched, I switched to clarinet around the fourth grade and then I loved music and it was one of those--it was just one of things that just seemed to come for me. So I really did get into it.  I had great teachers in the band program and it just became a way for me to kind of lose myself in something outside of the family.  And so I got involved in music very early on the clarinet and kept playing in the bands and the, you know, orchestras and things like that and there were such good teachers that they were always pushing for you to go to the state level competitions and all these kinds of things.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Well I went to Longfellow Elementary School and then I went to Durfee Junior High School and there I had a--actually a black music teacher and his name was Anderson White.  Andy White was the local Pied Piper in Detroit because he was just a hundred and ten percent devoted to children having a musical experience.  So he not only taught people in school, he had a community orchestra and as soon as you were ready, he would get you involved in these community orchestras and gigs.  And really Andy was the turning point for me.  He was a demanding teacher but he saw talent and he was absolutely relentless at making sure you had a great musical experience.  So, for example, when I first heard jazz it was because Andy thought we should have a little junior high jazz band and it was a terrible band but we learned [HM] Ramsey Lewis' "The In Crowd" and we thought we were cool and then he would take us to the clubs where we were underage to go hear his friends. So I used to go hear Yusef Lateef on Sundays.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the great (unclear)
Speaker 2: So hearing Yusef play the oboe and the bassoon and the flute and playing jazz, I mean these were turning points because I didn't know people played jazz on oboe and I didn't know people played more than one instrument at a time.  And so those were seminal experiences.  You know getting a chance to hear those guys and Andy knew a lot of these musicians because they were part of his generation.  So when he brought them to Detroit even before I got to Cass [Technical High School], I felt like I had a really rich musical upbringing.
Speaker 1: Yusef Lateef yeah, you don't hear a lot about him these days.
Speaker 2: Well he's living in Massachusetts.  One of the great joys for me was when I was the artistic director of the National Black Arts Festival in '98 [1998] and since I was the producer of the festival, Yusef had just come back from Europe with a large orchestra piece.  So now that I was a producer at the festival, I was able to write him and say, "Mr. Lateef would you come and play with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, we're going to produce you here in America."  And he's every bit as gracious now as he was when I was eight or ten years old.  It was a great experience because I told him--I got a chance to tell him while he was still alive that "Yusef I became a oboe and a bassoonist--I got my master's degree in woodwind instruments," and I said "you made an impression on me when I was just a adolescent that stuck with me all the way through college."  He was just the most gentle, gracious guy and it was good to be able to tell him that while he was still alive and he's still playing, he's still active.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, he's one of the greats.
Speaker 2: One of the greats.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 101536
Speaker 1: Anybody else that you heard in those days that really inspired you?
Speaker 2: Well, Yusef [Lateef] probably the most but also Joe Sample and those guys had a band called The Jazz Crusaders and whenever they would come through, all those musicians would play at the Drone Lounge on Livernois [Detroit, Michigan].  We would all stand at the rear door and just listen to these guys play.  So we heard [HM] Ramsey Lewis and Monty Alexander and The Jazz Crusaders, Ahmad Jamal and all the folks that would come through Detroit.  Donald Byrd, Freddie Hubbard all those cats would come and I'd just listen to them as an adolescent and as a teenager and when we could, Andy [Anderson White] would have them come to the school and just make a presentation.  So that was pretty extraordinary and the early '60s [1960s] for me and those were the people that made a great impression.
Story_ID: 101537
Speaker 1: So would you say that music was your primary interest in grade school?
Speaker 2: It--well it became it, it became it, I think it didn't really get clear for me until junior high school.  Our parents [James Wildrex Andrews and Lovetta Foster Andrews] were in their interest to have us be very kind of broadly educated and prepared.  They literally got us involved in everything they thought might help us be well rounded human beings.  So for a time we went to the international center for dance and we had to learn Gaelic dance and all these other things.  Then for another few years we spent at the Detroit Institute of Arts.  So I studied classes and took visual art pretty seriously really up until about the seventh or eighth grade and I spent a lot of time at the museum.  So I was really pretty familiar because of the great teachers I had and my parents pushing us.  I really, I think, was pretty far along in visual arts actually as a young person and music just took over, I think, when I found that it was easier, literally.  But I studied the great murals and could literally tell you about [Piet] Mondrian and [Pablo] Picasso.  I would know their work because we had studied their work at the museum.  I would know El Greco, know Rembrandt [van Rijn], know the techniques of [Vincent] van Gogh and as a young kid I kind of knew a lot about visual art because we literally lived in the museum every Saturday.
Speaker 1: And you had that huge Diego Rivera mural.
Speaker 2: That's right and you know the one, that's right.  I used to sit in front of it every Saturday.  So music took over, I think when it just seemed to me and this is once again one of the issues about discipline, I think I was able to be more successful with less effort with music than visual art.  I think I loved art, but I don't think I was an artist.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so as you--at junior high school did you do things like play in the marching band and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Luckily not they didn't have a marching band at Durfee [Junior High School in Detroit, Michigan], thank God, because I hated marching band and because Andy White [Anderson White] was so interested in us all becoming classical musicians, he thought marching band even though it was demanding, he thought it really wasn't the creme de la creme for classical musicians.  So I played, you know, in the band and in the orchestra and in the jazz band but not in the marching band in those days.  I don't know if there were a lot of public junior high school marching bands in Detroit at that time.  But we certainly excelled in terms of the orchestras and the bands and won all of these different championships and things like that.  But marching band didn't come to me until much later when I got to college because at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] my music scholarship depended on me being in the marching band.  I didn't read the fine print and man that was a disastrous experience.  These guys marching around and these charts that tell you where to go and you had to play and read the chart and not get killed by a tuba player running into you.  I thought it was the most absurd experience and for awhile I tried my damndest to figure out how can I get out of the marching band because it was hot, it was hard physical work.  I had my great musical instrument out there with all these knuckle heads with these little cheap clarinets, everything about this was bad, I thought.  It took me a while to really appreciate marching band for what it was and I think it was as I got the school spirit around the great football team that we had, it was a little bit easier a cheerleader in the marching band.  But that's how my marching band experience--and we went to two Rose Bowls during the time I was there in the early '70s [1970s] so it did pay off, I did get a chance to see some of the world.
Story_ID: 101539
Speaker 1: Okay, let me, we'll get back to that, but Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan], now, tell us about Cass Tech.  It's a special high school in Detroit, right?
Speaker 2: It is, it's a technical high school, I think it goes back to the 19 teens or '20s [1920s].  In those days you had to actually apply to the school and you actually had to have a major so some people would be in the chem/bio program.  My brother [Michael Eric Andrews] was in engineering, some people would be in pre-med and so biology.  They had a strong music major, they had a strong theater major and you had to actually audition so that you would be far enough along.  So it was very competitive and people came from the entire Detroit metropolitan area to be at that school.  So what it meant was you would be in an orchestra with some of the finest players of your age bracket in the entire metro area, I mean excellent players; players who would go on to have successful symphony careers and do a lot of great work.  So Cass was truly the turning point because it was downtown in Detroit so all the students came from all around so it broaden my experience in terms of who I encountered.  It was a totally integrated situation, of course and there weren't that many black students and music majors in those days.  I mean they were very talented but it was hardly the majority in those days.  So it was a great experience for me both musically and socially and then when you had a chance to interact with drama students and very sophisticated theatrical productions, I think that background really helped me later on in life to have that kind of experience at Cass.  I wasn't very good at frankly some of the other academic areas because I wasn't terribly disciplined at the other required classes but the music part was unbelievable because you just had such an immersion in repertoire and in theory.  I skated my first two years of college because of the great music education I had at Cass, I just knew all that stuff already, twice, so.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers that were like a mentor you at Cass Tech?
Speaker 2: Well there were several, the band director who is, I think now deceased his name is Harold Arnoldi.  He went on to be the band director at Wayne [Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan] but Mr. Arnoldi certainly made a tremendous impression because he had such a driven existence with the band and the symphonic band and because he was such a sophisticated musician.  The repertoire we learned as high schoolers really was replicated when I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Also there was a woman at Cass who taught me music theory, her name was Marilyn Jones and she's still living and she was such an extraordinary theoretician and she really helped me to understand the importance of good ear training and theory is the kind of stuff that most students hate.  So it was really her aural skills and training that helped me to understand why the ear is so important to perfect.  Those two teachers, I think primarily made a great impression and certainly helped me in good stead in college and onward.
Story_ID: 101540
Speaker 1: Okay. When you were--how was your social life at Cass [Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan] as a musician?  Was it better that most people's? Or--
Speaker 2: Well I don't know, I think our social life was enhanced because my best friend and I had a rock 'n' roll band and so every Friday and Saturday night we were gigging as young high schoolers.  So the girls that did like us, they liked us because we had a band called The Seven Sounds and we would play all the local clubs--local dance clubs that is and dance halls.  We were pretty sophisticated little rock 'n' roll band, kind of R&B with horns in the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s].  At one time, I think we even tried to--well we did we auditioned for Motown thinking that we might really break out.  But that's kind of was the basis of my social life.  Being a rock 'n' roll musician gave me an independent income which allowed me to have even further independence from my house and so we had a great growing up as teenagers because of that.  I wasn't into some of the clubs and some of the little pre fraternities as much as I was just playing all these gigs getting a chance to hang out with the adults.
Speaker 1: But you know just to clear it up, today when people say rock n roll, they're talking about white guys with long hair and that kind of stuff.  You're talking about rock n roll--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm talking about rock n roll like R&B.  Obviously we played a lot of the stuff that was coming out of Motown but everything from James Brown to [Jimi] Hendrix.  I mean all of that was a part of our world in the mid/late '60s [1960s] and so we would play stuff from the Temptations but we'd also play Hendrix and so we played a little bit of everything and so we were kind of like Sly [Stone].  I think Sly was a model for us--Sly and the Family Stone so it was really that sound and George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic because we used to open for them, believe it or not, as teenagers.
Speaker 1: For awhile I thought they were from Detroit.
Speaker 2: They were, I mean some of them were from Detroit--
Speaker 1: Okay, some of them are.
Speaker 2: --and they were still playing--they were playing at the time 1968/1969--they were still playing around Detroit.  So they would do these big like a New Year's party at the Local 876 and we would open for them and man they were unbelievable and from another planet even then.
Speaker 1: That's when they were Parliament pretty much--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was Parliament, right.
Speaker 1: --they were supposed to be the singing group.
Speaker 2: Right, right. But they were wild.  So that was how my social life was kind of helped along because I was getting ready to go open for some of these hip bands and then all of the Motown bands were working and playing around so you did get a chance to see some of the musicians.
Speaker 1: So you met the guys that they now call The Funk Brothers.
Speaker 2: Yeah but I knew the horn players actually better; many of the horn players that were on all those Motown sessions, Marcus Belgrave and Teddy Harris because the Funk Brothers really stayed in the studio.  You didn't see them as much on the live dates at The 20 Grand [Detroit, Michigan].  The bands that they rolled out to back up all of those people many of them were former Ray Charles band members and things like that and they were great jazz as well as R&B players.  So were the guys I knew much better as a teenager/young adult.
Speaker 1: I can't help but ask you what was--do you have any impressions of George Clinton, any stories about him?
Speaker 2: Well I just remember George Clinton as--being a young kid I just couldn't take him seriously.  I thought, "This will never last" but I'm such not a good judge of talent, you know, because everyone that I thought would never make it, all of those guys are sitting and they're counting their money right about now and I was wrong.  But even then I thought George Clinton had another--was coming from another place that I completely did not understand and didn't appreciate until many, many years later.  I just thought they were wild for the sake of being wild at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay later they produced that album "Maggot Brain" it was the first and it was real strange.
Speaker 2: Yeah, their stuff was really out there and I'm still trying to figure it out (laugh).
Story_ID: 101541
Speaker 1: Okay. So when you were on the verge of graduating from Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan] where did you'd go to school?  I mean, did you have choices of where you were going to go?  You end up at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] which is--University of Michigan is expensive and it's harder to get into than Michigan State [University in East Lansing, Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: It's expensive and very hard to get into, yeah.  I was actually recruited.  I applied only to two places.  I applied to Michigan State and to Michigan.  They both had excellent music programs and I got into the University of Michigan by auditioning.  I went up to audition and they actually--it was right at the beginning of--it hadn't begun affirmative action but there was an African American dean at the school of music who himself had graduated from the University of Michigan.  His name was Willis Patterson and Willis actually came to Detroit [Michigan] to Cass to recruit potential student who might be able to be competitive at-- in Ann Arbor and so he arranged for my audition.  I went and played [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart Clarinet Concerto.  I remember because my mother [Lovetta Foster Andrews] drove me there and what Willis did was he kind of got the door open for a few of us to go up to Michigan and I auditioned and that's how I made it into the school program.  Once we were accepted, we couldn't afford it but once I got accepted into this school then my mother was just hell bent on figuring out a way to make it happen.  So, you know, aunts and uncles and friends and--we just scraped every penny, borrowed our brains out because it was that important for her that we get a good education and it happened.  It was a first rate education and a first rate school of music.  So the way I look at it, I was lucky to have a great public school education that prepared me for the University of Michigan, I was a competitive student and because Michigan was beginning to admit minority students at the School of Music not many but a few, we were prepared for the opportunities that opened up.  So I went up there in 1969 and there were not very many African American classically trained clarinet players.  In fact, I think I was the only one in my class and my roommate had also come from Cass and he was a great trumpet player, and-- Marcellus Brown and so we basically were breaking new ground in those days and it was pre affirmative action.  Michigan was trying to address the lack of any minority presence in those days. And then, quite ironically, because we had come from Cass and Cass was so well regarded, I think that helped to kind of put you over the hump.  People always doubt the competence of African Americans institutionally but by coming from Cass, I think that helped the admissions officer feel well anybody can make it maybe these kids can and so that's what I think gave us the opportunity to try to succeed.  And we worked our brains out to make sure that the investment paid off.  The irony though for us is I went to Michigan in 1969 and it was that fall that they had the Black Action Movement--the black students strike.  I hadn't hardly unpacked my bags before all of the black students said "We need to strike and Michigan needs to be more responsive to black students."  And when I got out on the strike line, my parents [Lovetta Foster Andrews and James Wildrex Andrews] thought I had lost my mind because they had sweated bullets to get us up there and then we were now on the picket line and demanding more black students (laugh).  So it was a really vexing, complicated time because if you were the product of an opportunity, you wanted to make good on it at the same time you felt an obligation to be a voice for those that had not yet arrived.  So it was a complicated time for me as an undergraduate.
Story_ID: 101542
Speaker 1: I almost forgot this story, when I was about nineteen, I guess--'69 [1969]--it was fall of '69 [1969], I was at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] with a theater group from Dayton [Ohio] and we performed for the University of Michigan television series.  Rachel Washington at that time was the director; she's now at Chicago State University in Chicago [Illinois] but that weekend one of the young ladies who was with Fred Hampton in the apartment when he was attacked spoke to the students about that experience.  Do you remember that, or were you around then?
Speaker 2: I only remember the specifics of walking through some of these campus buildings banging on cans; I'd never done anything like that.  The idea of civil disobedience for most of us, I think was a completely not just new experience; it was really a foreign experience.  I think most of us had never ever kind of crossed the barrier--the line a bit that kind of behavior but there was an intensity of being at Michigan in those days with the war [Vietnam War].  Everybody had to find their own way and it was a real testing of your metal because at the School of Music most of our friends were white musicians and that had never been a problem for us.  No one ever called us on our blackness because of our white friends until I got to the University of Michigan then everyone was kind of saying here is the litmus test you have to hang; you have to not be--why are you into classical music, that's not African.  So it really caused you to kind of struggle with all of these things that you never even questioned before.  You only question trying to--how to do it better not whether it was the right thing to do.  And so it was a watershed period, I think in all of our lives and a few years ago Dateline NBC did a television show and selected several minority students who had been at Michigan, it just before the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action.  By the grace of God I was one of the people that Tom Brokaw brought to New York [New York City, New York] to interview to ask you about that time and I think we had all forgotten just how difficult those days were for all of those reasons.  But how we really stuck to our guns to try to literally change the culture of Michigan and also achieve.  But those were difficult moments in Michigan's history.
Speaker 1: Do you remember [HM] Charles Moody [Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: We interviewed him in Las Vegas [Nevada]-
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he had lots of stories of--his son has a construction company here in Atlanta [Georgia]. (unclear)
Speaker 2: That's right a very big construction company, absolutely.
Speaker 1: He and his wife, I think were there.
Speaker 2: That's interesting; I didn't realize that the Moody construction was related to--.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's the son of Charles Moody, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.  But that gives you some sense of your trying to develop your skills at the very same time that the university campus was hemorrhaging around race and admissions policies and cultural activities and black studies was just beginning.  So there was a lot on the table.
Story_ID: 101543
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you were, you said, you were telling us something about the marching band and how (laugh) you learned to love it because of the games or at least deal with it better.
Speaker 2: I think I learned to appreciate it.  I think I never thought about it before.  Over time and it was a very difficult and long time, the first couple of years of being an undergraduate I learned to appreciate marching band for what it is that is for what a great marching band and that tradition is.  But I didn't come in with the kind of awe about marching bands that many of my, you know, colleagues had.  I'll tell you a funny story; I was so intent on getting out of the marching band that I thought myself to be somewhat of an athlete.  I would play a little ball in high school and so I thought that since I was on scholarship, I had to be on scholarship some kind of way.  I was so adamant about getting out of the marching band that I auditioned not auditioned but I tried out as a walk on for the Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] football team.  I was 140 pounds which meant I was basically not big enough to even wear a helmet in that group.  But for about three weeks in the second fall--second year of my sophomore year, I skipped marching band camp and I was going to the early fall training with the Michigan band--I mean with the football team to be a walk on.  And I actually lasted for I'd say almost two and a half weeks until they started to do contact.  About three days of contact practice with these white guys from Ohio that were like 400 pounds.  I've never seen human beings this big.  It was so brutal and I couldn't play my clarinet lesson because my lips were so all beat up and my hands were all bruised.  I finally came to my senses but as you can see I had a very, very kind of defiant attitude toward being in the band.  But I came to my senses after being slammed by one of these 250 pound guys from Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Wow and, you know, the big game of the year is against Ohio State [The Ohio State University in Cleveland, Ohio]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Either in Michigan or Columbus; do you have any memories about those?
Speaker 2: They were great games.  Nothing like that sound of 100,000 people roaring to the top of their lungs and--yeah there is no word to describe it.  It's just that kind of fever intensity around Michigan and Ohio State football and football in general at Michigan.  It's in the blood so you begin to develop an appreciation for a culture that lives by that game.  I certainly was swept up in it but it took a little while.
Story_ID: 101676
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking off camera about the rigors of marching band practice; we both have stories about that.  Yes, it's hot out there; they really drill you out there don't they?
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's hot, it's physically demanding and, you know, they pace the football players during the week scrimmage and work because they've got to get ready for our game but when you are learning a new show every week, it's pretty intense--four days of every week physically and mentally to learn those new shows and memorize the show and execute on Saturday for the television is hard work.  So I have a new appreciation for marching bands.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember who the football players were from Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] in those days. (unclear)
Speaker 2: Billy Taylor--
Speaker 1: Billy Taylor, right.
Speaker 2: --Ed Shuttlesworth, oh gosh it's been thirty years so it's been a little bit too long.  But Ed and those guys 'cause we knew some of them personally seem to stick in my mind.  Oh God I can't remember the--it's been too long, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of them had real success in the pros.
Speaker 2: Many went pro and had very, very good careers.
Speaker 1: The Bo Schembechler team.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right Bo was the coach and guy by the name of Mr. [William] Revelli was the band director.   So these were like icons in marching bands and Bo was there for such a long time, like God.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, he sure was.
Story_ID: 101677
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to get involved in other student activities?  Did you pledge a fraternity or something?
Speaker 2: I didn't actually and I think I was just too much of a rebel to become a part of the fraternity scene.  I did pledge once at the behest of my roommate who was an Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] but it was so physically brutal that it was hard to be a thinking person and then to let anybody beat you for that long and so I eventually quit from pledging and I pledged late on in my undergraduate career.  So I think I was just too old to put up with the kind of real physical hazing that went on and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did it seem trifling I mean in a way in those days with all the issues and the Black Action Movement and the Vietnam War and all that?
Speaker 2: Well yeah it just wasn't resonant with, you know,--that kind of physical violence just didn't seem to resonate with me right at the time when I was trying to get my own head around black power and the rest of it.  This just seemed to be stupid.  So I eventually came offline right at the time when I was starting to take some black culture courses and black history courses and I frankly had a history teacher--a black history teacher at the University of Michigan by the name of Richard Thomas.  He was a labor historian and he now teaches, I think at Michigan State [University in East Lansing, Michigan] but I took a course from him right around the same time that I was pledging.  It just seem to make pledging a fraternity absolutely the least progressive thing I could do because he taught labor history in Michigan and we talked about the rise of the labor unions.  It just framed a different world for me that I never thought of.  It made me think about Detroit [Michigan] in a different way and so there was no going back to the fraternity.  I also took some courses with a guy by the name of Harold Cruse and Harold was so intense that the kind of rigorous critical thinking that he asked you to do; you couldn't compartmentalize it, you know, so you had to reexamine kind of everything that you were doing.  So at the time it wasn't really--being in a fraternity was not resonant with the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: Yeah Cruse is famous as the author of "Crisis of the Negro Intellectual," a real intense person.  Yeah you're right, he's very intense.
Speaker 2: That's right and those were kind of--you know for a person who is a music person to be up close with guys that asking you to think about larger questions.  Those were really Seminole moments for me as well because even Harold wanting to put music and culture in a larger framework that I never frankly thought about.  And so my other activities on campus had to do with being involved in the black house and some of the cultural events with black studies and things like that.  But really music was still primarily the source for most of everything I did.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of good speakers on campus in those days?
Speaker 2: We did but I probably didn't go to very many of them unless it was [HM] Angela Davis or something like that.  Yeah I think I probably self insulated my own activities so I didn't take advantage of many of the speakers that probably came.
Story_ID: 101678
Speaker 1: Okay. So any other things significant about University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] that you want to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well I think for most students when you get away from home, you get a chance to really turn a corner in terms of growing up and certainly Michigan represented that for me.  But the best thing about the University of Michigan was it was so incredibly competitive and unforgiving that it just really forced you to kind of make some good hard choices as a young person in terms of if you wanted to succeed.  In this particular arena there was really only one way to do it and so it was the right place for me to be.  I wasn't thinking about bigger issues but I was thinking about being a competent musician and beginning my own intellectual foment on these larger issues.  They really didn't fully come into bloom, I think until I left Michigan actually.
Story_ID: 101679
Speaker 1: Now were you thinking at all about religion in those days?  What were your--how was your disposition in terms of religion?
Speaker 2: Well I really wasn't thinking about religion per se, I was thinking about the movement.  I was thinking about the Civil Rights Movement and the black power movement and how I saw myself in that and because my best friend in my rock 'n' roll band, Nick Hood because his dad was a minister in Detroit [Michigan] and I had seen him being such a very, very kind of a quiet but effective activist.  I think he helped me to kind of think about civil rights in a different way but it was really in the back of my head.  [Nicholas] Nick Hood, Sr. was a minister who had come to Detroit [Michigan] from New Orleans [Louisiana] and he had actually mentored Andy Young because he was Andy Young's [HM Andrew Young] pastor a generation and a half before he came to Detroit.
Speaker 1: That's right because Andy Young is from New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Right and so big Nick was Andy's pastor and when he came to Detroit by that time in the '60s [1960s] Andy was then working with [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and so we would hear about the marches and the strategy sessions and things like that through my friend's dad who was a minister.  His dad kind of brought all of that home for me in ways I had never thought about it.  But I had never saw myself as being a minister and I never started going back to church and being active, any of those things until really at the end of my Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] career.  When I had to decide do I become a musician and go to New York [New York City, New York] or do I try to have a teaching job at a good school or what do you do and what I decided to do was to go to seminary because I wasn't sure what I should do.  So that was really my choice after I finished my Master's degree in music at Michigan rather than going on to try to play or begin a career.  I wasn't sure what my role was and for the first time I thought that being a musician was a very selfish thing to do given the fact that people were dying in the streets, there were riots and there was Vietnam [War].  So I needed to answer some questions so I then went to the Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut] right from Michigan and I went to seminary.
Speaker 1: Was Nick Hood, Sr. like--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He was like a second father to me and still is and his son who had been in my rock 'n' roll band also had already started to go to divinity school.  He was already at the Yale Divinity School--Big Nick had gone to the Yale Divinity School so it was the natural place for me to go really to find myself because I had a kind of support structure.  And then it was Yale, the Yale experience really, I think really kind of changed and kind of opened me up in all ways.  Both around religion and around thinking and it was just a life altering experience.  So I went to seminary there, kept playing music in New York to work my way through seminary.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you what year did you graduate from the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: I graduated from the University of Michigan in 1974 and that fall I enrolled in Yale Divinity School.
Speaker 1: Okay so you graduated with a master's degree in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Right I got my bachelor's in music in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I stayed on for another year and a half to finish the master's degree.
Story_ID: 101680
Speaker 1: Okay, so Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut] in 1974.
Speaker 2: Yep started in the fall of '74 [1974].  My friend Nick [Nicholas Hood, Jr.] was already there and he was a year ahead of me and at that time the divinity school was really a haven for lot of people who hadn't decided necessarily to become ministers but they were searching.  So it was a great--it was a very rich environment of a lot of competing ideas and ideologies and especially for the black students.  Some wanted to be preachers, some wanted to avoid the draft, some wanted to be lawyers, some wanted to have a Yale degree on their resume and there were people like me who-we were steadfastly trying to find out what all of this about.  So it was a great experience to in a sense have time now to read books and think about ideas in a very different way that I had ever done in my life and that's what the divinity school represented a kind of intellectual awakening, if you will.
Story_ID: 101681
Speaker 1: Okay. Who were some of the teachers there [Yale Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut] then who were instrumental in your development?
Speaker 2: Well probably, probably the most significant professors were some of the African American professors.  There were only a few but there is a theologian--a New Testament theologian by the name of Leon Watts and a historian who is actually a [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] historian by the name of James Washington.  Both of those professors, I think had a tremendously kind of life changing impact on me as professors and then I studied with a lot of the professors who were there just a part of the staff who were brilliant.  I mean Brevard Childs who was an Old Testament theologian.  These are some of the premier scholars in these areas and that certainly had a tremendous impact to study with great minds and to pushed in that way.  But Watts and Washington probably were those professors and a guy by the name of [William R.] Bill Jones who most people don't know but he wrote a book--a very important book.  He was a philosopher.  He wrote an important book called "Is God a White Racist" and he basically raised the question: "Why would any black person want to be a Christian given what they know about race and the God of white people."  By putting that question on the table was like a hand grenade and he really pushed you, pushed you to ask what your basic assumptions were.  Courses like that with him really helped challenge the basic frameworks that all of us have and they were good--they were rich that kind of got you out of the log jam.
Speaker 1: Was Bill Jones black?
Speaker 2: Yes he was black;
Speaker 1: Black, okay.
Speaker 2: He was black. Very important book.
Speaker 1: I remember the book.  He came to Wright State [University in Dayton, Ohio], I didn't hear his lecture but I developed a flyer for it.  Ku Klux Klan God throwing a thunderbolt down (laugh).
Speaker 2: Raises some good questions, you know.
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: And that's what the Yale Divinity School represented in those days.  In other words, there were professors there who took the black students on and said, "Wait a minute now if you're going to be so revolutionary let's look at this Jesus that you keep talking about.  And is the Jesus of your home church the Jesus that's going to bring revolution to the streets of New Haven and where's Jesus in relationship to the Black Panthers?"  I mean they really pushed in a way that was very, very useful to not let you take any shortcuts, you have to really find your way and you had to fashion a faith that made sense to your head and your heart.  So that was groundbreaking for me, life changing and I do feel now that I look back in middle age that my life has been charmed because of my educational experiences.  I mean, at each one of these threshold moments I just was very fortunate to have a very, very rich experience that in some ways you couldn't pay for it, you know what I mean, it was deeper than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah you feel fortunate to have these--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah there's no reason that I elected to get my doctorate.  In part because I feel in some ways I was so fortunate that I had people who took the time at important times in my life to kind to give me ways to rethink everything and I loved the university community as a place to keep thinking about things.  So for me it made sense after divinity school in continuing to work things out in ministry.  It made sense to try to figure out how to I keep my ministry ideas fertile but also how do I marry that to an academic career that would allow me to continue to think and to write and to explore and so that's the basic career that I have fashioned.  Because what you have to know is that my religious tradition and the congregational tradition, most black congregational preachers have all been teacher or civil servants.  They don't drive big flashy cars, they don't have big salaries.  Congregationalists are very frugal, very plain and very staid kind of worshippers and it's true in the black church experience too.  Most of the great congregational preachers supplemented their income until quite recently with some other kind of career.  So I elected very early on to be an academic because I didn't know if every church would be welcoming of a jazz, saxophone playing preacher who was at the local pub on Saturday night.  I didn't know how that would work out.  But I knew that the academic career would be useful.

Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in the doctorate divinity degree--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I actually earned my doctorate in music theory and that's what brought me full circle to the music theory.  After I finished divinity school in 1977, I had been teaching as a graduate student--teaching assistant down on Yale College [Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut] and actually discovered that I loved teaching not instrumental music but teaching music theory and music history.  So I had a part--time appointment in the black studies program at Yale and the head of the department, Charles Davis said, "You know you are a very good teacher, you should think about preparing for a career in teaching" and I said, "I want to be a minister" and he said, "You can still be a minister and have a good teaching career."  So he encouraged me to, you know, consider applying to graduate school which I eventually did and then I stayed at Yale and enrolled in the graduate school in music theory; the first African American in music theory by the way from Yale.
Speaker 1: Okay what was your Ph.D. dissertation on?
Speaker 2: I wrote on--it was called "An Analytical Model of Pitch and Rhythm in the Music of Igor Stravinsky" and it was really a dissertation that dealt Stravinsky's early works just after leaving Russia and leaving Switzerland and in France right around the time of "The Rite of Spring" and "L'Histoire du soldat" ["The Soldier's Tale"].  I was trying to kind of ask the question why did Stravinsky's music always sound like Stravinsky even in his later life and I actually prepared a mathematical model to look at how his pitch and rhythmic organization is literally what makes him sound like Stravinsky whether he's writing in a different system or not.  He kind of obeys a certain kind of language vocabulary that I could mathematically represent and so that's what it was about music by numbers in a kind of very sophisticated way.
Story_ID: 101683
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you have a--philosophically do you have a--can you compare and contrast classical music with jazz?  Do you have any observations about how they are similar or different?
Speaker 2: I think they are similar in the sense that they really do require the listener to be fully engaged and that's why a lot of people that dig classical music also like jazz.  I think they both require an evolved ear and a willingness to kind of be able to encounter the same piece from many different perspectives.  So I think that there's a lot of, there's a lot of similarity in classical and jazz because they are both highly evolved forms.  I really haven't thought of contrasting the two because in some ways jazz is grown out of a different cultural milieu but in some ways for me I think I love them both and can move between the two so easily because I don't think of them as really being that different.  It's kind of like the difference between French and Spanish, you know, you can't say I hate Spanish but I love French.  They are different languages but if you love language then you can find what's beautiful about Spanish or Portuguese and what's beautiful in French and it's just another language.  But I think that the power of the language is the same, they both speak.
Story_ID: 101684
Speaker 1: Okay. There's a-- so what did you do next?  You're teaching at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], how long did you stay?
Speaker 2: I stayed a long time because getting my doctorate was very hard and it was the hardest thing that I ever did and so it took me a very long time to complete it because I was still working and working with the student ministry on campus and playing in New York [New York City, New York] with many of the artists on the avant-garde scene.  So because I was once again not completely disciplined but struggling with the demands and the rigors of graduate school.  I stayed in New Haven almost fourteen years and it took me nine years to finish my doctorate.  I didn't finish it until I actually left New Haven and came South.  But between traveling to Europe to study the [Igor] Stravinsky sketches then traveling in Europe with Anthony Braxton and other artists and trying to make a living to stay in graduate school it took me a much longer time than the average student to complete the work.  So basically what I did is I stayed in New Haven for several years continuing to teach part-time, be a student-graduate student and then running to New York to try to hear and to play music and by the time I was working on my doctorate, August Wilson had come to New Haven to have his first play produced "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" and because of our relationship that evolved, I wrote the music for the first of several plays because we were collaborators.  That was also part of what kept me in New Haven.  [HM] Lloyd Richards the wonderful director who really mentored August's career had hired me to be the artistic director--the music director of the Yale Repertory Theatre.  So I was always in place when August came as a nobody from St. Paul [Minnesota] and because of that wonderful encounter and partnership, I got a chance to then stay in New Haven and continue to teach to try to finish my degree and then write music for August Wilson's plays because he was turning out a play about every eighteen months.  So I got a chance to work on "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" with Charles Dutton and then "The Piano Lesson" with Charles and [S.] Epatha Merkerson, "Fences" with James Earl Jones and Mary Alice, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" with Delroy Lindo and [Angela] Angie Bassett and Courtney Vance.  These were all my classmates and so this just an unbelievably rich time to be at Yale to be in the midst of these great actors and artist like August and then Yale had a wonderful African American studies program in which so many of the important writers and thinkers of the time were routinely scholars in residence.  So right at the time when I was thinking about all of these big ideas and about blackness, I got a chance to see--to meet and spend time with Toni Morrison and June Jordan and Amiri Baraka and Romare Bearden and these people that were in our midst.  Sterling Brown it was just--it was the icing on the cake.
Speaker 1: John W. [Wesley] Blassingame--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Blassingame, Blassingame was my boss; he kept me working and teaching.  Those became my intellectual scholarship heroes if you will and so it was right at that time that [HM] Henry Lewis Gates [Jr.] was finishing up his doctorate and so we were all teaching at Yale and we were having all of these scholars and getting a chance to be grown ups in their midst and then Cornell West came to teach.  So we were all within throwing distance from one another and it was just the richest cultural experience that you could imagine.  It was really a spiritual experience for my money because that was my Yale time getting a chance to be shaped by people who, to my way of thinking, forever kind of altered my course.  You can't not be different after you've spent time with Toni Morrison or Baraka; you just can't because they force you to think and not to take anything for granted, Derek Wolcott and the poet Michael Harper, Ted Joans who would come over and [James] Jimmy Baldwin.
Speaker 1: Ted Joans was out there.
Speaker 2: Absolutely and to have them--Ted Joans used to come over my house and party so you can imagine the parties with Ted Joans.  But that was my Yale time and so I couldn't have had, had I not been basically--technically prepared by Michigan but then the preparation that Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] technically allowed me to then put it all to good new use in New Haven with creating all of this new music for these wonderful plays and expressions.
Speaker 1: That's quite a rich experience, you can't---that's hard for anybody to imagine that now with all those minds there at one time coming in and out.
Speaker 2: It's mind blowing.
Speaker 1: Yes that was something.  There are some people I cannot--[HM Reverend] Eugene Rivers, I think was--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yep Gene Rivers was in New Haven during those years, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that must have really been something.
Story_ID: 101685
Speaker 1: So you were there for a while and to do the August Wilson plays, I mean gee.  Did you have any stories about August Wilson?
Speaker 2: I have many (laugh) but the ones that I can share are really--there are fewer stories.  I think because he hasn't been gone for very long, it's still difficult to talk about, about him and maybe I'm not prepared yet.  When we last spoke last fall, last fall, our last conversation was August calling me to say that he was dying.  And, yeah, so it's kind of still, I think, raw but he called he said, you know, "I want you to--"he said, "you know I don't go to church very often so you're going to have to be my minister."  I said "What do you need?" and he said, "Well, I'm dying and I need you to do my funeral" so we talked about is service and that was the last time we really talked at great length and then within a matter of weeks, he was dead.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that surprised a lot of people; they thought that maybe he had longer.  When he made the announcement, he really knew he was--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah he was very far along by that time.  So I--in typical August fashion we had a wonderful homegoing in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and after I gave my eulogy Wynton Marsalis drove all the way down from New York to play "Danny Boy."  So right after I got a chance to say what I could say then to have Wynton come at his casket and just to play these sounds that would forever just ring in my ear.  It was completely what August should have had to go down so it was wonderful.  He was a great mind and he was too soon, sixty is too soon.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right
Story_ID: 101686
Speaker 1: Now what about [HM] Lloyd Richards, he's also a legend.
Speaker 2: Lloyd is--if I had a third dad it would be Lloyd because my whole theater career was made possible in large measures to Lloyd elevating me to this role of director of music at the Yale Rep [Reparatory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut] which had never been occupied by a black musician or person before.  Lloyd taught me the most important lesson of all which is to allow people the trust so that they can do their work.  In other words he was not a micro manager what he did was he trusted you to do your work and you knew as long as you did your work, he would be there.  And he also knew that if he said well I need that moment to not be that but this, he knew that he didn't have to say anything more that the people around him would design it or shape it to make it happen.  I didn't figure this out till very late by the way but I would ask myself, "Why am I up all night trying to fix this one sound cue in [August Wilson's] 'The Piano Lesson.'" and it's because Lloyd would say, "Well, you know, I'm not sure if I understand what she feels" and that's all he would say.  But he knew that I would go and answer the question that he kind of posited and the next day I would come and say, "Lloyd, I think I have a different sound cue for that.  I think if this happens maybe that explains it" and then he would sit there and he would say "August" and August would come and then he'd say--I'd play it again and August would never say much and August would say (shakes his head yes).  Lloyd said, "I think that has possibilities."  So what Lloyd taught me was that you surround yourself with people who you can trust will do their work and then you won't have to tell them what to do, they'll do it.
Story_ID: 101687
Speaker 1: I think if there were one story that I would share about August Wilson in my time with him, it would be when he first told me about the "Piano Lesson" the play when he was first writing it.  He had that yellow pad that he would always write his plays long hand on and we were already in New Haven [Connecticut] working on another play, I can't remember which one but August took out this little postcard and it was a postcard of Romare Bearden's "The Piano Lesson," it has two people--two women and the piano kind of collage and August said "Well what do you see" and I said, "I see a girl and a woman at the piano" and I'm thinking and he said, "No that's not--" he said "But what is she trying to learn, what's the lesson" and I said, "The lesson is she's trying to teach her to play the piano."  He said "No it's not that," he said "This is my new play; this is 'The Piano Lesson.'"  I said, "Well tell me what it's about?"  And August starts by saying "There's a ghost in that piano," and I said "A ghost," and he said, "There's a ghost in that piano, I don't know how that ghost got in there but there's a ghost and the ghost of the yellow dog are in the house," and he gave me in fragments-almost like a collage.  He started to describe in fragments that the piano had carvings on it from Africa and he said "I need to know how that piano got in the house" and he started asking questions of that character in the post card and he started to explain where they're coming from.  And he said-- when you think about the play now; it's fascinating to think about the fragments that he shared with me.  He said, he said, "Well you've got a minister, a minister who is looking for a wife so he can start his church" and then he said, "And Boy Willie had some watermelons" and so he gave me all this and I said, "August, I'm confused, I don't know what--" but he said, he said, but it's in my head, he said, "I keep asking the characters what the lesson is" he said, and then every few days he would read a little bit of a scene and it was the most magnificent unfolding of what I think now is one of the great plays of his body work, "The Piano Lesson."  To ask those fundamental questions of where is the value of our heritage, is it in a piano, is it in the land so that we can raise some crops.  It's all there and it was all in his head.  So it was an inspiration to me to see the way in which a work of Bearden who I also knew could inspire this other work which has changed lives, 'The Piano Lesson' is a great family story.
Speaker 2: Yeah is that your favorite of his plays--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: It is only because not only do I love the play but it's a play that has most of my original music and it's also the play where the cast members were so close, we were all close in generations and age so we were all very close friends already before we started that play, so--
Story_ID: 101688
Speaker 1: There's a song in that play that--it was interesting that--it's the one where they're sitting, drinking and they do the railroad song at the kitchen table.
Speaker 2: At the kitchen table, they do "Berta, Berta."
Speaker 1: Yeah "Berta, Berta," some people--I know a group in Dayton [Ohio] tried to do it and they didn't have the music in front of them so they tried to make up a song, nothing like it.  I saw the play and what they did was fine until they got to that part and I said what in the world--they did it like a song and dance thing.  But that's a powerful song.
Speaker 2: It's a powerful moment.  It's one of--I think one of the pieces or one of the theatrical moments I'm most proud of.  I spent months studying the prison work songs and the field songs.   The songs from Parchman Farm [Mississippi State Penitentiary] and so it had to be real when they went back in memory time to what it means to work on the chain gang and sing that song.  It's something that had to be done just right in order for it not to degenerate into a musical moment.  It wasn't a number, it was really a shared experience that these men had that was both bitter and sweet and so we worked to refine--capturing something essential of that black work song.  It took us months and so much preparation to try to get it to be true and I'm very proud that we took that prison work song and kind of drew a lot of traditions in together to make it what it ultimately came out to be in the production with the glass the feet and--yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a powerful piece and I think Wynton Marsalis on one of his albums--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah Branford [Marsalis] did it, in fact Branford--this is great and to show you how it works, I got a call on a Saturday morning and right out of the blue the caller said, "Hey Dwight, this is Branford" and I said, "Branford who," "Branford Marsalis, hey man I saw 'The Piano Lesson' last week, it was great and when they did that work song that was great, I want to do that song on my next record can you come to New York and get me Roc [Roscoe "Rocky" Carroll] and the other actors because I want to do it."  I said "Come on this is a put on" and he said, "No my agent will call you next week and we'll hook up all the details but it was a great song."  And sure enough we re-recorded it for his album that got a Grammy called "I Heard You Twice the First Time."
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: So that's how I got a chance to first know Branford, we spent a lot of time together getting for that record.
Speaker 1: There's a thing about--I mean it's something really confirming about our history and culture when these artists reach back and get these things even the title, "I Heard You Twice the First Time," (unclear) something old people tell you.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right but you're absolutely right the kind of reclaiming these pieces of ourselves which was so much a part of August Wilson's work which was trying to help us to understand what our past means to our present and our future.  I mean that's--if there's any question that August has put to us it's that.
Speaker 1: I know that long speech and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" by the stranger that, you know, that's powerful about where we come from and what all of this has meant.  You know, just is really powerful. So it's, it's really-I mean, we owe you a great deal, music from those plays.
Speaker 2: A magnificent opportunity, I guess is the word.  That seems too small to describe it when we're in the trenches trying to get it together but I do feel that I have a charmed existence in the sense that these people that I've been around have created these wonderful moments and have let me be a part of it.  Yeah and I don't take it for granted, yeah I'm grateful. Yeah.
Story_ID: 101689
Speaker 1: So what else happened at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: What else happened (laugh), a lot.
Speaker 1: That seems like a funny question to ask now after all this.
Speaker 2: Well essentially I think my commitment to trying to do both, do ministry and music, I think was really forged there because the work with August [Wilson] and the work with these musicians was just too important to my understanding of myself to give up.  So I had to continually just keep reaffirming that somehow or other I would fashion a life that would allow me to continue to create art and teach and preach.  And so that's essentially--that kind of set the seed for what I've been doing now for the last thirty years and I'm very grateful that my university as well as my church and my colleagues in the arts appreciate the fact that I have my feet in this sometimes competing worlds and they still let me join them on occasion, so yeah it's good.
Story_ID: 101690
Speaker 1: Now you're a musician who plays with the likes of--you were talking about the avant-garde black musicians and you, I know haven't lived in Chicago [Illinois] a long time but AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] musicians, the guys in New York like David Murray, and people like that Arthur Blythe that play some-
Speaker 2: Pretty out-there music.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) cutting edge, the musicians that make most of their money in Europe.  Who can't-- Americans here sometimes can't handle what they are doing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: For me learning and discovering the new music scene in New York [New York City, New York] and the avant-garde in New York really just pushed me in a good way because coming from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] which is really a pretty conservative conservatory, I really didn't know what Roscoe Mitchell and the Art Ensemble [Art Ensemble of Chicago]--what they were doing and when I first got these opportunities to sit in and be involved with these musicians, I had no idea how to participate.  I would literally-- I didn't understand the language, I didn't understand the techniques and they were so patient with me because I had an understanding of the instrument and all of the doubles but I had no idea about this musical language and its own traditions.  So it was really opening me up because the musicians on the avant-garde scene were also hanging out with the writers.  It was really David Murray and Ntozake Shange and Jessica Hagedorn, Thulani Davis that was part of the scene, Sam Rivers.  I mean everyone was on that one scene so if you were on the new music scene that also meant you were on the new prose scene because the theater and all of that they all kind of reinforced one another.  So I got a chance to spend time with Zake and Thulani because of David Murray and those musicians because they were all in one seamless environment.  The writers were looking for inspiration from the musicians and vice versa.  So it was once again yet another kind of great tableau for me to get a chance to just be involved in and certainly opened me up aesthetically and that's what I needed, that was the final piece because I don't think I knew where to put new art in my understanding of a black aesthetic and [Amiri] Baraka had tried to explain it to me in a way that I could understand but we were fussing too much for me to fully understand it.  By playing with David and David got me on some of my first gigs in New York because he had just come from California and [HM] Stanley Crouch had just come from California.  They really helped me to try and understand "Okay how does our tradition speak to the future and how does it speak to black freedom and black liberation."  And so just being with those musicians and kind of stretching the envelope and saying "It's good because I say it's good as an artist not because it sounds like somebody else--it sounds like it's suppose to sound because I say it."  That kind of understanding and independence really liberated me I think as an artist. And I really needed that piece to be able to make peace with the way in which the blues and the avant-garde are part of the same universe because they are both expressing our struggle for freedom and personal value.  So that has been kind of the ground on which I kind of understand all of black art and aesthetics and it's been useful to try to say yes hip hop and James Brown and Anthony Braxton are part of the same universe.  And if you have a, if you have a willingness to listen to what holds them together, you will hear it but only if you think of black culture in the small way do you see these discreet little expressions unrelated.
Story_ID: 101691
Speaker 1: Okay. I can't help but think I was sitting here looking at you, you're conservatively dressed basically, I'm trying to imagine you on the stage with Joseph Jarman and Malachi Favors--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: You should see the pictures, I have leather boots up to here, I have a kind of tie dyed thing here, I've got my weird hat and my boots; I mean I'm out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's my other identity which I think I need to go back to.  So I might be getting out there in a different way because in some ways I think by me having this suit on and my tie on when I want to press my students they presume where I'm coming from because of what they see not because of what they hear.  I've got to open that up so you might see a new me.
Speaker 1: I'd like to have you see the picture of the drummer, [HM Famoudou] Don Moye.
Speaker 2: The paint.
Speaker 1: We interviewed him--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --but he didn't do it in the paint but he had the hat and the outfit, you know.
Speaker 2: Well that's, you know, what was-- that was what was so interesting.  When I first the met guys from The Art Ensemble [of Chicago], Moye and Douglas Ewart and those guys.  The first thing I thought about was George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic because the theatrical part of their music was so much the Art Ensemble and [Lester] Bowie and Joseph Jarman with the medical coats and everything.  I said, "Where have I seen this, I saw it in the Funk in Detroit."  So that's what helped me to understand that the funk and the future are all kind of tied together.
Speaker 1: Did you ever see Sun Ra?
Speaker 2: I did see Sun Ra; I knew Sun Ra and that helped also explain we are a complicated people (laugh).  I met Sun Ra with James Newton when we were in Italy maybe in the early '80s [1980s].  Yeah, I had a chance to speak with him in his tent.  He tried to explain his galactic dissent and I was trying to, I was trying to understand is Sun Ra for real that's what I couldn't--I wasn't sure.  His musicians all knew that he was for real but I wasn't sure so I needed to spend some time with him.  Then I decided no he is for real, this is who Sun Ra is.  So I'm sure not sure, I'm still not sure how he got here but he is certainly from someplace else.
Speaker 1: I think he appeared in Chicago in the '50s [1950s] but they don't know where-Saturn, I think is where he's from (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He said he was from Saturn right, right.
Speaker 1: But--
Story_ID: 101692
Speaker 1: Okay, now is your approach to theology as eclectic as your musical taste?
Speaker 2: Probably not in the sense that I probably am, in terms of Protestant theologians, to the left of center and that is probably rooted in my sense of the potential of faith as a vehicle for liberation.  But also the requirement of a kind of intellectual discipline as well as a spiritual one and it's eclectic in the sense that I do read a lot of different people and I've studied--look at a lot of different religions, I'm not very sectarian in that sense.  But yeah I'm probably much more to the left of center because the people like William Sloane Coffin had a tremendous impact on me when I was at Yale [Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut] and afterwards.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was a radical theologian to my reading.  Yeah. So I have an eclectic sources but I think it's because they all resonate with the same idea of God's potential to transform the world through love and peace which is a radical idea and it does cause me to be much more intentional about my understanding of social systems, much more critical of our economic and penal system and educational system and that's a faith issue for me.  The disparity of wealth in the world is a faith issue for me.  And so that's because it's influenced by several people but also because I find that to be heart and center in the bible.  Jesus was not preaching prosperity--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Wait a minute now all these preachers today at these megachurches--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's why I'm saying this, Jesus was not saying that, that's not what he said and when you look at his own career no matter what your theological bent is, I mean he was basically an itinerant guy.  He went from house to house with a few guys who are also as ragtag as he was.  So the idea that he's preaching this kind of "Believe in me and you'll get a new car or get a new house or let's build a new church," they didn't have new churches.  So I'm really trying to radicalize my faith community to refocus, if you will, what's already there and prosperity is not a part of it.  The learning how to love struggle and to find joy even in the midst of struggle is, I think, possible and purposeful.
Story_ID: 101693
Speaker 1: Did you have--what did you think of Reverend the former Albert Cleage's congregation in Detroit [Michigan]? The Black Christian Nationalists.
Speaker 2: Yeah Black Christian Nationalist [Shrine of the Black Madonna Church]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: They are here in Detroit--in Atlanta--simultaneous)(unclear)?
Speaker 2: In Atlanta [Georgia] as well.  For a time I was very, very much attracted to it and I think the best way for me to say it is that when I really tried to immerse myself in it, I found that it was not deep enough.  The valley of what undergirded it was not deep enough.  I'm certainly am very affirmative of an African peoples but it had a very limited notion of race that I thought stilted the sense of possibility and human potential.  So I think I grew past it or grew through it, I guess is a better way early on.  But I was very, very much in my radical early days of trying to resolve black power and being a Christian that was my resolution.  But as I got to deeper questions of who the human is, the nature of humanity, the nature of human beings then I found that the Black Christian Nationalist movement did not address some of my other struggles.
Speaker 1: What about the Nation of Islam and particularly like I guess the two different--you've got Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad.  They came out of Detroit initially.
Speaker 2: I'm very influenced by Malcolm who I think had a very sound understanding of where some of the disparity comes from and his push--his rather prophetic push against the status quo, I think is why he got killed.  I think we kill prophets and I think [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] as he became more radical in his notion toward love and peace that was the most threatening position that he took and that's why he got killed.  I'm against dogma and sometimes for me at least in my limited experience with the Nation of Islam the way it gets acted out and people could say the same thing about Christian churches too.  Is that it seems a little bit too dogmatic for me in a way that doesn't allow you to understand the beauty of Islam and the breadth of Islam.  But I certainly think that same thing happened in Christian churches so I'm just not a dogmatic kind of person.
Speaker 1: Something you wouldn't push in your church.
Speaker 2: Exactly but there is a sense of discipline in Islam that is personal discipline that I think is very, very important.
Story_ID: 101694
Speaker 1: Okay. Now just one more question about religion.  It doesn't have to be the last one but I just, what about African religions.  Have you--in your journey through school have you studied or looked at, examined them?  How do they fit into your philosophy?
Speaker 2: It's a very good question.  I'm not sure I have a very good answer.  I've looked at some traditional African religions more from a point of my scholarship looking at kind of African musics and the relationship between African music and religion and dance and all of that.  But I'm not really not a student of African--traditional African religions per se.  I have studied it in terms of my own understanding of black aesthetics in terms of kind of looking at musical time and ontologies of time.  So I have kind of a way of thinking about black musical cycles like the blues or other kind of musical progressions because they simply loop and I understand how dynamic looping can be as a concept of time, it's not linear.  So I think one of the things that I get from some traditional African religions is this notion of cyclical time rather than linear time and I've incorporated that in my understanding of trying to teach folks about black music and how we can have a bass line that keeps repeating ad infinitum and where one person coming out of different essay would say "That's boring, simple and stupid."  I would say "No, the power is in the repetition where you lose yourself to it.  So that then you can add your own dynamic expression to the stasis."  So in those sense, that comes out of studying notions of African time and cycles and that comes really out of Robert Farris Thompson the great African art historian who wrote a book called "African Art in Motion."  He helped me to understand that the African Diaspora and African cultures in the new world when you look at what ties them together, the black music in Brazil and Cuba and Haiti and Puerto Rico and Georgia.  You'll see certain aspects of what blackness meant in Africa and it still means the same thing.  But that's about the depth of it, kind of understanding time and thinking about time and expression, individuality and the communal collective.  How those things are impacted by traditional African religions.  These are not religions that are ascetic.  You can't come out of the community to be religious; your religion is in the community 'cause that's how one lives.  And so I definitely try to reinforce those senses of community and the power of community to both allow you to be an individual but your meaning comes out of your place in your community and that to be is an African concept which black people have managed to keep, God bless them, for a long time in spite of a lot of things that would tear at the fabric of being able to be both an individual i.e., the improviser as well as part of a larger collective--the ensemble, I mean that's where jazz comes from.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting analysis, Yeah, the movie "The Da Vinci Code"--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: "Da Vinci Code" yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a--there are these monks in there that flatulate themselves; they're going through ascetic thing where they get isolated from everybody else the holier they are which is not an African concept.
Speaker 2: It's not an African concept and it really as you know in the history of Christianity; it really was a perversion of a concept.  It came out of attempts to try to understand and to make sense of what it means--what does suffering mean in religious expression and so as you saw for many centuries the Catholic Church struggle with how do you resolve the suffering of Christ as a triumphant act.  And how do you participate in the suffering of Christ and so the church at various points in time would come up with rather complicated and bizarre ways to reflect and to empathize with the suffering.  But by the grace of God, many of us say "Well if Christ already did that suffering, we don't need to go re-enactment is not what Christ was about."  And so thank goodness--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Who knows on this earth what suffering we may face at any time?
Speaker 2: Exactly
Speaker 1: Disasters and other things, who knows.
Speaker 2: There's enough real suffering in the world without having to kind of ritualize suffering.  So I mean in some ways this is what I think the challenge of our time is, is to kind of create ritual that have some meaning that actually has some impact in terms of changing the world not ritual for its own sake; empty ritual so that you can feel like you did something.  So these are the kinds of things that I would like to think we're trying to struggle with and wrestle with.
Story_ID: 101695
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you're at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut] until when?
Speaker 2: Until I came here [Atlanta, Georgia] in 1980--no that's not true, until 1986.  Then I--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: You participated in other--scored other plays and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah I've done--well I've done plays for August [Wilson].  The plays I did for August were "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Joe Turner," ["Joe Turner's Come and Gone"] "Fences," "Seven Guitars," "[The] Piano Lesson."  I worked on "Gem of the Ocean" but not before it came into New York.  I worked on it early on and I worked on the revival of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."  But I also last season or two seasons ago I did the music for the revival of "Raisin in the Sun" [Lorraine Hansberry] with Phylicia Rashad and P. Diddy [Sean Combs] and that was a great experience and so it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: That's right, the famous P. Diddy version.
Speaker 2: Yeah the P. Diddy version and so it was wonderful getting a chance to work with him and Audra McDonald and its wonderful casts, terrific casts.  So I do get a chance--I've worked with [HM] Pearl Cleage a lot.  So that's been a great joy over the years. So.
Speaker 1: Did you know her in Detroit [Michigan] back then?
Speaker 2: I didn't, she was a little bit older, she's not going to want me to say that but she was a little bit older and had already left Detroit and come to Atlanta.  So our relationship has really blossomed here through our work together with the director, [HM] Kenny Leon and I've done music for several of her plays, "Flyin' West" and, oh, I can't, "Blues at the Bor-" No. "Bourbon at the Border" which is a story about Detroit [Michigan] and Windsor [Canada].
Story_ID: 101564
Speaker 1: Well, did you come back to Atlanta to be part of the faculty at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia], is that what it was?
Speaker 2: Actually I did.  What happened was in 1986 I received a Mellon Fellowship to continue my work on my doctorate and so I taught two years at Rice University in Houston, Texas and I taught at the Shepherd School of Music and while I was there actually I got a letter--an invitation to apply to a position here at Emory which hadn't been on my radar screen quite frankly.  But I did come and interview and my wife [Desiree Pedescleaux] who is also an academic, she's a political scientist and so we decided that we would give Emory a look because there were some things about Atlanta that we wanted to look at very carefully, it was just a logical place to be.  She's from Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and I'm from Detroit [Michigan] so being in Atlanta kind of gave us a way to be a little bit closer to both family homes.  But Emory interested me because they were interested in my work, artistically as well as intellectually and it was very important for me to find an academic home where I didn't feel in conflict about my work on the real stage versus my work in researching and doing writing.  And so Emory was interested in that and I thought interested in me and so it was a good choice and so it worked out.  My wife now is a political scientist at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] and she's one of the deans at the college and Emory has been supportive for almost twenty years now in my faculty work as well as my performing work.  So when we were developing plays with August [Wilson], it would sometimes mean I'd have to travel as we developed the plays out of town.  And I've always felt that the school really supported those efforts.  They saw the importance early on-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so that's what got us here.
Story_ID: 101565
Speaker 1: So after I finished my fellowship at Rice [University in Houston, Texas], I got married and my wife [Desiree Pedescleaux] and I came to begin our life together in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1988.  I started teaching; she kept writing and got a chance to for the first time spend some time with [HM] Andrew Young and Jean Young.
Speaker 2: Yeah now he was the mayor when you got there, right in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 1: And he's always been such an enigma for me.  I wanted to get a chance to build a relationship with someone who had really been very important even though I didn't really know him.
Speaker 2: How-- you say he was an enigma in a sense, I think there's a--I read his book, we interviewed him a while ago at least we got half an interview done.  There is a public perception of him that he's the calm, "Let's all calm down" type of person and like the deputy for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Well for me--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: But then the other side during the [President Jimmy] Carter years when he seemed too radical for Jimmy Carter, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right, well if you look at his career, he has a career--he has built a career on not being very predictable.  I mean, I think that's part of who he is but more importantly than that at least for me is that I don't think I've ever met a person who is more committed to trying to make things better.  Even when you disagree with his choice of how to do it, one never questions his intent and so for me he's been really a hero because even when he's taken very unpopular positions, I've never doubted why he's taking them.  And he's helped me to understand the movement better because I could see if you go back to the days of Martin and Ralph Abernathy and [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson and all of those guys, Joe Lowery [HM Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery].  How did that group hang together to get anything done because these personalities were so different.  You could see how Andy as one of the members of that community could help to keep it altogether.  He was another part of the balancing, I think, of what is a pretty disparate team of forces that Martin held together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you didn't mentioned Hosea Williams and [HM Reverend] James Bevel, you know--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's right when you look at those guys it's amazing that they stayed together but it's also completely understandable that they would not have been able to stay together without Martin.  But Andrew for me has never strayed from a life committed to helping other people and he's very committed to that and so he is still very, very much for me a source of wisdom.  He always--he's a member of my church so he calls me his pastor which is pretty daunting, how do you pastor Andrew Young.  But Andrew's perspective on Africa, his perspective on economics has really forced me to rethink some things even when we don't agree.  He invariably will not give you the answer that you think he's going to give you and in all of those answers, I always grow and learn.  So the great joy for my wife and I being in Atlanta for the last twenty years is certainly been the teaching and the preaching but has really at core been having a big brother in ministry and in life like Andrew Young who has really been a resource to help me understand my own sense of possibility and responsibility.
Story_ID: 101566
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you're with First Congregational Church [Atlanta, Georgia]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm the pastor.
Speaker 1: Yeah pastor and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: With great difficulty (laugh).  The long and the short of it is simply that I was teaching at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia], wanted very much to continue my ministry in some way in Atlanta and after a couple of years of not really being offered very much here at First Congregational Church where my wife [Desiree Pedescleaux] and I attended the senior minister finally invited me to work with youth as an assistant minister part-time.  So I took that on.  That was right around 1992.  After two years of working with the youth, Rev. [George] Thomas left suddenly to take a church in Chicago [Illinois] and so I thought that since I had been such a good successful youth minister that of course the church would realize my depth and my wisdom and make me the senior minister.  So I candidated for the senior minister's position and unfortunately I wasn't selected.  The church really was kind of split and they selected another candidate, a very gifted preacher from Washington [D.C.], Susan Newman.  Susan came as the senior minister then I needed to be like any old administration, I needed to get out of town in a way but I couldn't really leave town.  So I think I worked on [August Wilson's] "Seven Guitars" the play as my excuse for not being at church while she got settled in her administration.  But what happened was she only stayed for a couple of years and then left suddenly and then the church had no minister and so those that had really wanted me said "See we told you, you should have taken Reverend Dwight" and others they wanted Susan, they were disappointed that she was leaving and the church was really fractured.  And then enter [HM Andrew] Andy Young who at a church picnic says, "You know the church is at such odds with itself, it's not ready to call a minister.  Why don't we have a ministerial team and take some time and just let everyone catch their breath.  We have many ordained ministers who are members of our church" and so that's what we did.  So the church allowed me to be the head of the team-to coordinate the team and so for three years from 1996 to 1999, I was the coordinator of a team ministry to give us time to be renewed and to heal.  Then finally in 1999 the church said, "well Dwight we like a team but we really want to have somebody to blame when stuff is not going right so we want to call you as the senior minister" and so that's how it happened.  So in 1999, I was installed as the senior minister of the church.  But as you can see it was the long way around and I think that was a good thing for everyone.  I certainly was in a different place when they asked me to come again and I think they were in a different place when they saw that I might serve them well as a senior minister.
Story_ID: 101567
Speaker 1: Okay. How has the journey been so far?
Speaker 2: It's been, it's been, it's been (laugh) a challenge.  It's been good but it's been a challenge.  It's been good because we're making progress and we're rediscovering our sense of possibility in downtown Atlanta [Georgia].  It's a challenge because Congregational churches are notorious for having very well educated folk in their membership and when you get a lot of well educated folk, everybody thinks they know everything so that's a challenge.  But I think we are making some very, very good progress and we're renovating now a historic structure that was built in 1908.  And so for the first time now we're out of the building and in the midst of a renovation and what's really interesting is that church at the turn of the century was the church where the [W.E.B.] DuBois used to come on Sundays and read poetry just before the 1906 race riots.  Booker T. Washington came and gave the groundbreaking speech for that building.  So it's a church that has a very, very rich history and we don't want to kind of lose ourselves to our history but rather be buoyed up by it and move into the future.  So it's a fantastic place to be right now.
Story_ID: 101568
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what are you--artistic pieces are you working on at this time?
Speaker 2: Well I'm working on a couple of things that are really important to me.  I'm working on finishing some poems by James Baldwin.  These were published in a small collection that I discovered in our special collections at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia] and I'm just about done with those, a chambers setting of poems for soprano and piano and chamber instruments.  And then I'm getting ready to work on a documentary film on Haiti with Louis Massiah who's a wonderful film maker, MacArthur Fellow out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  We did a multi-segment series on DuBois ["W.E.B. DuBois: A Biography in Four Voices"] several years ago and I did the music for that.  So now we're going to work on a new one on Haiti which I'm very excited about 'cause that's a story that really needs to be told and to get a chance to try to find the right music and create the right music to help tell the story.
Speaker 1: You're right. Those who are in black studies or really deep in African American history, that's a seminal story.
Speaker 2: That's right and most of us don't know about Haiti.  So that's what I'm preparing for.  We'll start work on that in the fall and that's the focus really.  Working on that film and finishing these chamber pieces and just trying to practice.  I'm still knocking around as a jazz tenor saxophonist so that means I have to kind of try to stay up on my horn and we just did a record with Geri Allen, a wonderful pianist in New York [New York City, New York] and so we've just done some vocal arrangements her and she's interestingly enough doing some music with jazz vocals that have a kind of political, cultural basis to them.  So I'll be working with her this fall as well.
Speaker 1: Now that's a genre that in the '70s [1970s] there seem to be a lot of and people miss it.  We interviewed [HM] Jean Carne here in Atlanta [Georgia] but Doug Carne produced some fantastic music.  Most people know her for disco music--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Those early records, that's right.
Speaker 1: Those early records, when we talked to her I reminded her of those and she just went into a whole other thing.
Speaker 2: Absolutely
Speaker 1: Great music.  Let's see. Oh were you aware there's a play, [HM] Douglas Turner Ward is doing a trilogy on Haiti in New York.
Speaker 2: No I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: He's working on a trilogy.
Speaker 2: No I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: You should.
Speaker 2: I've got to keep up.  You seemed to be so much more up on what's going on in my world than I did.  I need to do what you're doing, just keep up with people.  No but I didn't know that, I have to try to make sure that when I'm back I can take a peek.
Speaker 1: Yeah Douglas Turner Ward is working on something; I think [HM] Woodie King [Jr.] has something to do with it, also out of Detroit.
Speaker 2: I've just got to pay attention.
Speaker 1: It hasn't been publicized that much, we just saw him last spring and he was talking about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Someone I haven't seen in a good while.
Story_ID: 101569
Speaker 1: So tell me, so do you have like a, I guess, you're doing so many rewarding things, do you have a big project of your own in the future that you'd like to complete?  That you haven't-- I mean that you've started on or conceived of?
Speaker 2: Well I have a couple.  The backdrop to the first project is that television is so powerful and I think I've been really slow to understand the power and just how visually oriented our world is but I'm trying to figure out how do we have the kinds of conversations that you and I might have in a conversation like this, how do we have those important conversations through television.  And so I'm kind of rethinking my relationship to the media in general.  I don't know what that means yet so it's a question mark for me.  But I don't want to be naive that the prosperity ministers understand how powerful television is and they've exploited it to its maximum and they know what they're doing.  That does not mean that it couldn't have the same potential for other kinds of expression or other kinds of sets of ideas.  So I'm really wrestling with trying to understand what's the potential for other discourse to come on TV.  So that's one thing that's kind of in the back of my head and I don't know how it, how it will pan out, just thinking about trying to address it.
Speaker 1: I've thought myself about how do we get hold of something that would be like a black public television or something.  A place where black intellectuals can share not that it has to be exclusively black but you know what I mean.  Some of the ideas that we have--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Just to kind to make a deeper--just a deeper, broader conversation.  I was in Detroit [Michigan] a few weeks ago and I was listening to the kind of black talk radio and without going into anything specific, it's just the level of the conversation was kind of shallow for where I think we need to be and where I think people are ready to participate.  So that's one, one, one issue for me.
Story_ID: 101570
Speaker 1: And so I'm just trying to think my way through it and then the other thing that I'm working on right now is I'm working on an essay on spirituality in jazz.  What I'm specifically have tried to do is I'm trying to just look at the sacred music of John Coltrane, Dave Brubeck, Albert Ayler, Mary Lou Williams, Pharoah Sanders and I think I have someone else.  But it started with Trane and Mary Lou; I wanted to look specifically and in a more detailed theoretical way at their late spiritual works, specifically that were sacred works by their own expression.  And I wanted to try that in the context of their overall trajectories because I'm finding that when I look at Trane now as a saxophonist but especially when I look at the texts and read his biographies that his own spiritual quest, I think has not really been completely unfolded.  So I think there is a way to look at his late music and his relationship to avant-garde for example as a part of his spiritual quest in a way that's presently not written about.  So I really to look at those jazz musicians who try to either say something specifically spiritual or transcend it and those that wanted to like Mary Lou Williams wrote her sacred music in the context of a mass.  So you have some people who obey in a sense the existing sacred liturgical forms.  Where Trane's [John Coltrane's] music really moved away from any particular religious expression and really went to kind of transcended level all by itself--all into itself.  Certainly influenced by African and eastern religions as well as his own Christian religion background.  So I really want to do that because jazz, I think, still is not really understood as a potentially powerful spiritual expression and I think there is a lot of music that already says that.  So that's the big essay that I'm working on.
Speaker 2: It seems--it's interesting that the musicians that play cutting edge jazz, they see Coltrane as a spiritual leader.  Pharoah Sanders came to Chicago [Illinois] a couple of years ago, all the AACM [Association for the Advancement of creative Musicians] greeted him like Catholics greet the Pope.
Speaker 1: As their leader.
Speaker 2: They followed him in a pack wherever he went and he hosted all of them, he talked about what he was doing.  It's the themes of his music--his music speaks better--if you ask him about what he's doing, you don't get the depth as you get, that you really get when you hear him.
Speaker 1: But that's exactly right.  I think it would really be worthwhile to go back and revisit that music and look at it in the context of the latter part of his life.  I think it really tells you something not only about his own spiritual quest but how music reflects the angst and the sense of opportunity.  By his last works, you know Trane had kind of left basically all of the criteria that we usually talk about with music and melody.  What he moved to in terms of the free improvisation and kind of serving as a catalyst for these wonderful, one time expressions that can never be repeated.  It's also a part of why it's so important.
Speaker 2: A Love Supreme (unclear)
Speaker 1: Exactly so I think because black music and jazz specifically sometimes is maligned because of its own social history not unlike black people are maligned because of their own social history.  I think it would be great to provide another way of looking at the tremendous spiritual potential in this music that get explored by Trane but doesn't get fully--doesn't get played very much, little understood.  Also because Dave Brubeck and other are still alive, it's interesting to chat with him to get his perspective of why he feels drawn to these large expanded sacred works now at this point in his life.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that about him.
Speaker 1: Yeah he's actually written several large works and several commissions and you know he's still a vibrant player.  So I'm just trying to kind of put that into a conversation and I think it would be interesting.  I saw Pharoah about a month ago in LA [Los Angeles, California] and I'm interested to see how that impacted their gigs, their approach, their relationship to the music world as well as to their own internal expression.  So that's my big project and I hope to finish it in the next two years.  I'm gonna talk with [HM] Wayne Shorter, those that are Buddhists; I want to try to understand how that fits in and what that journey has been about.  And so that's the big project.
Story_ID: 101571
Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to ask you about this before I ask-we have a series of reflective questions that we ask towards the end but I wanted to ask you about Ken Burns' film "Jazz," you were part of a group that hosted a forum to discuss the film and you had, you had kind of a critique of it that you offered up, can you tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well the--I think that the forum that we had in which we were all together, Ken, myself, Gary Giddens, [HM] Stanley Crouch, Ingrid Monson, I think, who is a musicologist at Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts].  We were all together at Harvard for a session and Ken and I had a rather testy kind of exchange during this forum.  Interestingly enough not about the contents so much of the series but I had raised a question of how it is that a great filmmaker like Ken Burns and he is a great filmmaker, great storyteller, but as a jazz historian and scholar of jazz it troubles me that one can get funded even when one says, "I don't know anything about jazz, I don't know anything about the history, I don't know who's important and who's not but I just want to make a film about it and I will learn about it as I make the film."  Well the problem for me as an academic is that there have been many jazz scholars who were better prepared to make that film who could never receive that kind of funding.  That has to do with the racist way in which philanthropic institutions fund stuff and I thought that was problematic and I tried to raise the question about that only because it does shape ultimately in this very visual world the way in which we learn.  So I could not be funded to do a documentary on neurosurgery, I don't know anything about neurosurgery; nobody's going to fund me.  And so it troubled me that Ken Burns had the kind of underwriting that he had both private and public for this series because I feel that impact of his documentary good or bad was, in fact, kind of driven by his personality as a filmmaker and not by his understanding of the music.  Consequently, it got reflected and several of the segments in which if you're not a student of the music, some of the comments by some of the musicians and critics will really lead you down the wrong road in terms of who's playing, who's important, who's significant, who's not especially with regard to the music of the avant-garde.  The later segments of Ken Burns' documentary for me as an intellectual and black creative artist are really problematic because I don't think it gives proper context to avant-garde expressions.
Speaker 1: How did he treat, for instance, John Coltrane?
Speaker 2: Trane not so much Trane, I don't think Trane suffers as much as someone like Cecil Taylor.  Because if you have someone like Branford Marsalis, a very potent, very strongly opinionated and brilliant musician, literally if you take his most acerbic comments and make that the commentary on Cecil Taylor then for the novice their going to say "Hey I know Branford Marsalis, I know he is a great musician, I know he speaks my language.  The Cecil Taylor guy must be out."  And, because of that, those segments, I thought they were particularly problematic.  I also know that Ken Burns interviewed a lot of people who did know the history of the music who never made it into the history.  I understand you have limited time and everything but in a sense he skews it to the story that he wants to tell.  So if he's not a historian or a scholar, it means that he in a sense uses the jazz celebrities to essentially tell the story that he wants to tell, that's problematic for me because I think if you look at jazz scholarship, that's what half of jazz scholarship is.  Some celebrity who kind of likes a musician writing a book about it, that's a problem.  He keeps away from a more intelligent, more critical way of looking at African American music in general, that's also a problem and that's why scholarship in America on black music is pitiful, there's no other way to say it and it will continue its own kind of racist trajectory until people call people on it.
Speaker 1: Now there are a couple of centers for black music research--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes very important one in Chicago [Illinois], Sam Floyd--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah [HM] Samuel Floyd and there is a David in Indiana.
Speaker 2: Oh David-
Speaker 1: You know who I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Yes, David Baker
Speaker 1: David Baker, right.
Speaker 2: And Portia Maultsby at Indiana [Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana].  There are some important centers doing very, very great work and research both in terms of written research and performance research.  And I'm hoping that they will continue to get the kind of support that they need but my only challenge of Ken Burns is that I think the music is due the kind of respect and preparation for the study before you make the movie not as you make the movie because persuasive musicians then will become the storytellers and you will make it the way you want to make it.
Story_ID: 101572
Speaker 1: Okay. What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My biggest concern is very simple, the black community has become what [Amiri] Baraka predicted it would become forty/fifty years ago in "Blues People."  We are consumers of everything and we have become so materialistic that in our wealth and our abundance, material possessions really have become our sense of value and for that reason in the black community people will kill people for their gym shoes.  So that they can have the gym shoes and the sense that one's own personal value comes from something inside not from something that you wear is a problem.  Unfortunately some of our most successful African Americans are preaching, literally, this same kind of affluence which I think is empty and will lead to our doom; it already has in certain ways.  Popular culture has just created yet more product of character assassination of black people, men and women and now black and white buy it it and live into it, how bizarre to want to grow up and be a thug, how bizarre to want to grow up to be somebody's bitch or somebody's hoe, how bizarre to even use that language and to think that language doesn't have power.  Even I ask my young college students, "how can you dance to that song when that song says that you are a worthless piece of ass" and then when the young college student says to me, "But I'm not listening to the words, I'm listening to the beat," then something's wrong.  So the fact that the black community is no longer thinking and is no longer resisting, it is being pimped right into oblivion.  So my concern is that we have a serious conversation with ourselves for our own salvation which I think is really threatened.  I think it is--we're at the edge of the abyss.  Baraka raised the question in "Blues People" he says, "What happens when capitalism and racism come together" and I don't think he could have ever envisioned where black people would be on the side of the collusion between capitalism and racism but that in a sense, I think, is what we have.  Now we have BET and we have other profit makers on black terrible images.  Everyone profits from it and that is the only sign of value.  And so I asked my students what makes for a great piece of music and now the students says "Because it sold 100,000 copies" or "Because it went platinum" and so it's another way of saying that I value the music that is most popular or that has sold the most units.  It means I have no listening apparatus which I can determine will I really like that piece.  It says that we value everything simply because of its commodified value and we even put one another up in terms of that kind of commodified value.  So the people that are successful are the people that sell the most units; that's a problem.

Speaker 1: We--I've heard so many students--I'm at Wright State [University in Dayton, Ohio] and I hear them all the time say "I don't listen to the words, I just dance to the beat" and you were saying that's not--that's insincere.
Speaker 2: "Insincere" is the nice word, I really think it is what it is.  I think it's really BS and I think that we let our kids off the hook when we say what do you mean you don't listen to the words or you don't watch that image on the video when he runs the credit card up the girl's butt.  I don't accept it and I think our kids need us to not let them off the hook.  I mean if they want to dig that music, that's cool but then they have to be as committed to it as they need to be.  You can't say "I like this part, I don't hear this other part."  That's just a cop out.  So I think part of what the challenge of the black community is really--it needs to ask itself the hard questions and unfortunately I don't think happens enough.  Not just for our music but around every aspect of black culture.  People are trying to get paid, that's a problem.  The concept is a problem.
Speaker 1: Yeah it comes ahead of the work almost, to get paid; I'm trying to get paid.
Speaker 2: Right. The work is incidental, the work is a distraction.  So these are the things that I'm hoping we will continue to struggle with and move forwards.

Speaker 1: Okay. When you look back at everything you've done to this point, it's been so much, is there anything that you would do differently now if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Yeah there are a few things and usually up until recently in my middle years there wasn't too much that I would change but now I think that there are some things I would change.  I would have learned to play the piano when my grandmother [Estelle Andrews] could teach me and I rejected it because my grandmother was a piano teacher.  So I didn't want to learn from my grandmother, I would have changed that.  I would have become a student of foreign languages much sooner and I would have immersed myself in French and Portuguese and Spanish much earlier.  I didn't understand the importance of really becoming fluent and I think I would have taken more time to live and not to work.  I'm sad to say that at this point but I think at middle age I'm very happy to have had these wonderful accomplishments but that's because I worked my brains out and I think now looking back on it I probably should take more time--should have taken more time.

Speaker 1: Likewise when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know; that's a very good question.  I'm not sure; I think that--I think I have tried in my work to resist the pat solution.  In my church work and in my music work and I always tried to open up the possibilities--no I do know, I think my legacy if there is such a thing would be that I brought many different communities together, I think in my work.  In other words, people that come to my jazz vespers get a chance to get connected to a church that they don't often times come to church.  A lot of people, my actor friends and director friends and movie--film friends that I've been able to discuss with them their spiritual lives.  I think I've been able to bring different communities together in an interesting way and in a way that only I probably could have done because I was uniquely situated, to be in the theater and to be in the jazz club and to be in Europe.  And to be-- So I probably have opened up some people to looking at themselves in a deeper way.  I don't think of legacy though in terms of work anymore.  When I looked at August [Wilson] in that casket and I thought about the great work that we did together, it really just confirmed to me that one's legacy should be more than one's work.

Speaker 1: Okay. Well tell us about your family.  You're married-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm married; we have no children maybe that will change, God willing.  I have a lovely wife who is a political scientist and is very smart.  Her name is Desiree Pedescleaux and she's from Louisiana and she's great because she--Desiree does not get pumped up over all this stuff and so she's very cool and laid back.  And in fact, I decided to marry her one time, she didn't know it but when we were both in graduate school at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], [HM] Earl Graves, the publisher, and Barbara [Kydd Graves] they had a son [HM Earl "Butch" Graves, Jr.] who was going to Yale at the time and I was his student minister, Butch was there.  And Earl came up to Yale one week and he said, "I wanted to see what kind of church is this that my son goes to."  We had a student church; it was pretty radical but kind of critical thinking in modern music and everything.  But anyway so Earl and I got a chance to know each other over a period of years while he was coming up to see Butch and he was very, very much a supporter of African American studies.  So we got a chance to know each other kind of personally.  So Earl and Barbara were having a twenty fifth wedding anniversary and he invited me, a graduate student--kind of student minister to come to his party and I wanted to have a date so Desiree and I rented a tuxedos and a fancy dress and we went to Earl and Barbara's twenty fifth wedding anniversary at their house in Riverdale or whatever it was.  Fabulous, everybody in New York [New York City, New York] was there.  You name it, they were there and Desiree who was beautiful and stunning but she just enjoyed it, she was so comfortable with kind of all of the princes of New York black society and I said you know what this is the kind of partner that you can take anywhere whether it's fixing a flat tire or at Earl's birthday party.  She's just the same person so we have been hanging for eighteen years and it's been really good.

Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything that we haven't discussed that you think you want to mention before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: No I think you guys have gotten-drained me dry, I'm going to call my therapist in the morning and try to get some treatment for some of-- (laugh).  Oh now I think we've just about covered everything.  I think this is an exciting time and I do think there's some important conversations that need to happen both in public and in private.  Skip [HM Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] and Cornel [West] and the guys that were in graduate school with me, you know, we talk on the phone and I can't help but think we need to spend more time just yakking and not in public forums where we're paid to yak for ninety minutes and then have a reception but just some real down time to do what we're doing.  You know, the exchange, you know, we have people in common and we have such-and we don't do that very much anymore and I think we need to do that some more.  I think there is some important conversations that need to happen especially by those that have influence to see if we can kind of find our way out of this box and--so I'm looking forward to that part.

Speaker 1: Okay. Our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (laugh) How would I like to be remembered? (pause) I think about this kind of a lot in the sense that, you know, when you bury so many people that you like and you funeralize them and you ultimately try--you end up kind of summing what does this all mean, who was this person.  And frankly, I think I would like to be remembered as a guy who was very generous.  Who is a very generous person and frankly, I think I'm also very accepting which sometimes is a problem in my work because people in church are not always the most accepting of one another but I basically am because I think that's what we're called to be.  So I think generous and accepting which is interesting because I've worked my brains out to produce all this work but that's not what I'm interested in being remembered for.  I guess I will have to go see my therapist about all of this (laugh).
Speaker 1: I hope whatever you have is contagious.  Thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you, its great chatting with you.
