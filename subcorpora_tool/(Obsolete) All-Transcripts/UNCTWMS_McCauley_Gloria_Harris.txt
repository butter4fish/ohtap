Josh Bridges: Hi my name is Josh Bridges; I am the interviewer. And the interviewee is Ms. Gloria McCauley. Now Ms. McCauley, through your work in the God Did It Recovery Home, we&#8217;d just like to recognize you for not only have you contributed to several women&#8217;s lives post-prison, but just the women&#8217;s movement as a whole. And because of these contributions we&#8217;d really like to learn more about you and your upbringing. So could you tell me a little bit about your upbringing and where you&#8217;re from and just how you think this affected like your life now?  Gloria McCauley: Well I&#8217;m fifty-one years old and I come from a really good family, mom and dad in the household. My mom and dad were married for sixty years. My dad worked two jobs basically all my life and my mom got hurt on the job and she was out. She was in the home, I guess, probably from the age of probably eight years old for me. She was in and out of the house and very active in our lives and everything. Kind of strict; she didn&#8217;t let us go to a lot of places and be involved in a lot of things, which today I can be thankful for. But because I didn&#8217;t go to a lot of activities I kind of rebelled and later on in life it found me in prison. Myself, it found me out on the street, not homeless, but homeless because I chose not to go home a lot of times because I was ashamed of some of the actions and things that I was doing.   But I ended up still going through college. I have a B.A. degree in social welfare at Bennett College in Greensboro. And I have one son who is twenty-three years old. Um [phone rings, keys jingle] but as far as addiction, I always had somewhat of an addictive behavior. Myself, like I said, looking for attention in all the wrong places. In school I started to petty steal some and just wanted what I wanted and wanted to do what I wanted to do. And I ended up marrying early; I had a good marriage. But I just continued to, even in the drug addiction, I just was looking for myself and still couldn&#8217;t find anything that still was satisfying, you know?   And so after I finished school I got involved in retail management and found myself working in Roanoke, Virginia. My husband and I were flying home to Fairfax, Virginia every other week training in regional management, all those things before I was twenty-two years old. And so I&#8217;ve always had a lot of opportunities, always been one that knew that hard work would yield you, you know, financially and what I thought to be the good life.   But all the issues that came along with it. I think that being a woman--women deal with issues of loneliness, rejection, all those things more so than needing hands-on like men do. And with my mom having five kids, it seemed to me--now that I&#8217;m grown I know it wasn&#8217;t that way--but it seemed to me that I didn&#8217;t get my amount of attention that I needed. So I was always looking for something that it was just hard for me to acquire.   But in the midst of it, I had so many opportunities to do the right thing. I can say that the thing called addiction, it took me from one level to the next level. It started with marijuana, to the pills, to acid, that type of thing, to the powdered cocaine to crack cocaine. And I stayed in the addiction for twenty-three years. So there was so much about people and life, because my mom was so tight on us and didn&#8217;t let us do anything, that I didn&#8217;t know about that even in the midst of that it would have seemed to be a bad thing. But it really wasn&#8217;t bad because I learned so much even being out there in the wrong places to have learned that. But I still learned it, you know?   So I found myself in prison for the first time in the year of 1990. And basically that&#8217;s where I really learned who people were. A lot of times my mom wasn&#8217;t prejudice. We had a lot of white people in our house. My younger brother was really involved in athletic stuff and she was always at games and people were always at our house and things like that [5:00]. But she would say things like, &#8220;Good girls don&#8217;t go in those clubs.&#8221; And when I see people come out of them, I thought that I was better than they were. So it wasn&#8217;t something she imparted in me; it was what I took out of it. And so I had to go to prison, I feel myself to find out that I was no better than anybody, I was no worse than anybody. But if I did the same thing as they did, I was going to get the same result, you know?   So, like I said, I found myself in prison for four different times: for petty larceny, for writing checks, embezzlement. I ended up with a $1000 a day drug habit. So it was a job every day to go out and make enough money to support my drug habit but I can honestly say that I never got into any trouble being stupid. I always thought that I was smarter than everybody else. But I know today that I wasn&#8217;t because I still made a lot of bad choices that got me into a lot of bad places, but out of the grace of God I still made it back out.   But when I had my son I was in full addiction. He&#8217;s one of the best things that I&#8217;ve contributed to my life. He&#8217;s my son that I came out of full addiction with a son that&#8217;s healthy, and never had any health issues or anything like that. But had it not been for the goodness of the Lord--I have had abortions before. And he probably would be at Women Pavilion today had not God knew what I really had need of.   And so, but I&#8217;m married. I&#8217;ve been married for twenty-five years to my husband. He&#8217;s a carpenter, his own business has been in business for almost fifty years and is a very good provider for us. And after I found myself in prison those four times and laid down so many things that I didn&#8217;t want to do anymore, I came home and got involved in the church. And I wanted to do something to help somebody that had come out what I had been in. Never had a friend. I&#8217;ve been a friend to a lot of people but I never had a friend in all my life. Not one that I didn&#8217;t pay for, you know. Just one that liked me and just wanted to be around me for me. And so I wanted to give back and befriend some people.   When I opened the God Did It Recovery Home in the year of 2002, I didn&#8217;t go in it to open a home for women. By the grace of God my husband paid all of our bills, I was working and I was able to keep the money that I had and I saw a lot of girls out on the street that didn&#8217;t have anywhere to go. And I just wanted to help them and I just wanted to find a friend, somebody that I could find fellowship with, could go make church, we could laugh, talk, maybe go bowling, beach, mountains--something together. And so I didn&#8217;t go into it with the idea I&#8217;m opening a home for women or any of those things. I just got a building, a home, and I paid the rent on it, like the gas bill, water bill, to let those girls--that was my intention--to let those girls live in it and pay the bills until they could get up on their feet. But God had a bigger plan than I did with the God Did It Recovery Home because when I opened it, I had over seventy women to apply for beds. And so I saw the need in our community. And I didn&#8217;t know any of the girls who I let come in because, by the grace of God, by that point in life, I didn&#8217;t have to be on the street, but my addiction was no better than anybody else&#8217;s was.   So when I said I opened the God Did It Recovery Home, I had started working. I managed retail for years and then I got into food service and then I was manager of food service for a lot of years. And then I had left my job in food service and they offered me a position at the Detox Center here in Alamance County. And so I worked there for like three and a half years in their detox department and I really enjoyed the work. And from there I think that I was kind of intimidating to the people there because I brought everything that I had to my job, you know? I didn&#8217;t come there for paycheck. I came to be a blessing to somebody and I think that intimidated some people. And so I just felt like that I was called out to go do this for women. I think that I was called there, but because they were intimidated by everything I did and it wasn&#8217;t a blessing to be there, then I needed to do my own thing.   And from that point we didn&#8217;t have any money to do anything. But miraculously somehow or another, money came from nowhere. You know, I know it was all God who, you know, put the right people in my path that believed in this ministry and believed in the vision that I seen for the ministry. And so we had to fight with the zoning commission [10:00] but we always won. The first donation that was given to the God Did It Recovery Home was given by the biggest church in Alamance County, which is St. Mark&#8217;s. I had never been inside the church or anything and everyday when I&#8217;d go to work I&#8217;d pass it. And I could just feel like I needed to go in and talk to that man in there but I was afraid to go in and talk to him because I didn&#8217;t feel that he wanted to hear what this little woman had to say or anything. But I went ahead and went with my heart and I went in to talk to him, really nice man. They gave us our first donation of $3,000, and I took that $3,000 and I invested it in our living room, because the Lord told me that if I plant a seed of excellence, excellence would always follow this ministry. I&#8217;ve never put broken down stuff in here. I&#8217;ve never put hand-me-down stuff in here. Not that some of these things weren&#8217;t donated or anything like that. But I&#8217;ve never put anything that I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to put in my own home, you know, for these girls to live in because they&#8217;ve already been given people&#8217;s throw-aways and castaways and all those things. I wanted this to be a home, you know? Not a facility. A home where they could feel good about where they were, you know?   JB: Mm-hm.  GM: And so from that point we&#8217;ve been working. I&#8217;ve had opportunities to do state, to go state because we do have our own doctor and our own nurse, five health care techs. But I chose to be a Christian facility and not use the state because I don&#8217;t want the state regulations and all of those regulations, although the state has been here. I&#8217;ve got all that paperwork from the state that, you know, they don&#8217;t have to come here every time they come around. We chose not to take state. And so then we can run it as a Christian organization and we can let the Lord make the decisions of what happens here and what doesn&#8217;t happen here.   And so on an average, it&#8217;s like $17,000 a month to run this one home. But by the grace of God this year, we&#8217;ve been working for seven years toward our second home, which is going to be located in the Manteo area in the outer banks in Manteo, North Carolina. And it would be for women and children and it&#8217;s called the Hosea House. And they&#8217;ll be opening this year and that house is $1.8 million and it&#8217;s totally debt free. So it&#8217;s kind of like I fell into a place of just faith in God, earnestness to want to help somebody, not all the smarts that it probably takes to help but a genuine desire to help somebody. And anything that I didn&#8217;t have, God sent somebody to help me with, you know?   And so we&#8217;ve been doing business here, we came here. When I hired my staff we didn&#8217;t have any money in the bank and I stepped out in faith and I came up with a price that I thought, you know, that they could pay their bills with and everything. And stepped out in faith and we&#8217;ve never had checks to come back any of the above, you know? It&#8217;s been like a miracle story, you know? And we&#8217;ve run on an 86% success rate. A lot of women have come through here and lives have been changed. I can&#8217;t hardly tell a story without getting moved myself now that I think about it because I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time thinking about it. I&#8217;m a worker.   A lot of hard places over the years. A lot of hard things have happened in my own personal life, in my home, with my family, with finances, with people you know, learning that people who come for a season, they don&#8217;t come to stay. Even people that contribute, they come to contribute maybe one thing. They don&#8217;t come to stay and, you know, be a permanent fixture and stuff like that. I think I&#8217;ve had to do a lot of growing up, you know, in this because, as I said, for twenty-three years I was basically in a room with the windows closed. So a lot of places where I should have been learning at that time in life, I had to wait until I got older to learn. So [phone rings, coughs] excuse me. But it&#8217;s been an adventure. I&#8217;ve got a facility manager here now. And I&#8217;ve still got a lot of dreams for God Did It Recovery.   I was in a real bad car wreck a couple years ago and was out of work for a little over a year and I could still manage the facility but I just couldn&#8217;t come down a lot. And I had to trust other people to do it for me and coming from a place where I found it hard to trust people because I&#8217;ve been hurt by a lot of people. And a lot of people had let me down and lied; done a lot things that people normally do today, I know, you know. But persistence and [15:00] faith in God will take you a long way down this road. I found that it&#8217;s all about what we&#8217;re willing to put into it is what we&#8217;re going to get out of it, you know? I don&#8217;t want to do things the way that everybody else is doing it. I learned how to do that in the streets when I was using drugs. I found out who people were. I don&#8217;t want to be like people. For me that&#8217;s the easy way out. But I found that if you do the right thing, you do right by people, you don&#8217;t have to worry about lack, you don&#8217;t have to worry about any of those things; God will take care of the situation.  JB: That&#8217;s good. Well you mentioned that you began the recovery home, you initially just you wanted it just to be a home and the women that you initially brought--you just wanted them to be able to have a place to fellowship with you. And so when you did this, I had a couple of questions about that. One, where was this initially located and also were you still under the addiction at that time?  GM: No. I wasn&#8217;t under addiction. I think in fact I had probably been clean for about uh [pause] I can&#8217;t really even remember but I think I was about five years clean at that time. But it was located in Burlington at 904 Stone Street where the first home was. And when I opened the first home, although it was my thought that I would just open the home that way, when I went to open it, I had to go through the guidelines to get it open. So I had to go through the zoning commission. I had to have nonprofit-ship in order to open, you know? I had to have 501(c)3 open. I had to have all these things opened and I did open it the correct way, you know? I had to have a million dollars worth of insurance on the house and all these things.   But that&#8217;s not what I initially wanted to do, you know? It was just a, per se, open a home because I&#8217;ve had I&#8217;m going to say well over a hundred people that sat at my desk and asked me, &#8220;How did this home open?&#8221; But they never, I haven&#8217;t had a hundred people that sat at my desk that asked me, &#8220;How can I help a woman?&#8221; So it leaves me to believe that more people want a home than to help. I don&#8217;t just want a home. I want to help somebody along the way and I know what that&#8217;s about, you know? So I basically kept that concept in my heart that faith outreaching hands is what the ministry is under and it&#8217;s the ministry that I minister under, that God Did It sits under. And that mission statement is saving lives, saving souls one at a time.   So I do Christian counseling and I basically just help people to understand what life is about because someone who walk in my office and talk to me, they can say all the right things. But if they don&#8217;t speak in my language then I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying. If they talk over my head, if they talk in a language that I don&#8217;t talk in, if they came from a different place in life that doesn&#8217;t speak to me, then it doesn&#8217;t speak to me. And when they leave I may shake my head, bob my head, act like I understand. But I&#8217;m just in the same place the day they walked in the door.  JB: I understand. Well as far as the area, it seems, like this area, it seems to have a big place in your life. You said you went to Bennett College and your first home was opened in Burlington, and now here in Mebane. Are you originally from this area and also just why this area did you choose, simply?  GM: Well I am. I&#8217;m from Burlington and I guess being from Burlington I don&#8217;t have to do a lot of explaining or convincing people where I came from, you know? You know I can say my mom and them are very established in this area. They were married sixty years. My mom still lives in the same house we lived in as a child. She&#8217;s still got the same phone number, you know? And so those people saw me get out of school. They saw the expectation and what my other brother and sister siblings, none of them have ever been any trouble. They all are business people. My younger brother, he has the bus line of Harris Travel. He&#8217;s got three buses, charter buses. One of my brothers is a pastor. My other sister&#8217;s a commercial loan officer; she does million dollar loans. And then my other brother, he&#8217;s just of all trades. There&#8217;s nothing he can&#8217;t do. And then there&#8217;s me [laughs, 20:00]. But they also saw a period of me coming in over in the middle of night, walking the street in the middle of the night, you know stuff like that. And so for them to be able to see people that were basically good people go down to nothing and then be brought back up to something, I mean, that&#8217;s why I came here and stayed here. Now I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll always be here myself because this facility can run without me, you know? So I&#8217;m off doing whatever the Lord would have me to do.   I&#8217;ve been going to the prison and having the opportunity to speak to the ladies at the prison for now about seven years in Rocky Mount. And so this year the door was open for me to go to Raleigh and go in and speak with the ladies there on whatever level I want to talk to them on, you know, on a Sunday morning. And then I&#8217;ve been going to our community jail here in Graham, North Carolina for nine years. And so, those bad things were turned to good and had I not been through all that--I could do a good talk, but I couldn&#8217;t really understand where they were at and how it feels to be in that room and how it feels when you made all the wrong choices. But you&#8217;re surrounded by a group of people that are saying, &#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; but yet they don&#8217;t treat you like they treat everybody else, you know? It&#8217;s hard to pull out of a pit without willing people to help you out, you know? And so, like I said, the majority of it has been a lot of growing up for me. It&#8217;s been an adventure, you know, until I, you know, fell into a place.   At one time my board and everything--I wasn&#8217;t looking for a secular board like everybody else&#8217;s board. I was looking for a board that we came together, we prayed, we&#8217;d talk about the girl&#8217;s issues, what they had need of. All of those things we didn&#8217;t center it around money. And so it went on for a while. We never had any lack in this home. We&#8217;ve had more than enough of everything. Those girls eat good. They eat steak, pork chop, you know, all that good stuff like that. I began to, you know, I&#8217;d pray and I&#8217;d ask God what would you have me do and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;d do. But when people come together a lot of times they come with their own opinions and all these things and what they think should happen and all that. And, you know, I&#8217;ve never been one to control anything so I thought out of ignorance maybe I should do it that way. And I began to do it that way for a little while and it looked like every door around me closed. You know, these were people that had degrees, money, everything else that looked like that I could benefit from them. But I didn&#8217;t benefit a thing from them and it was a great learning experience that I&#8217;ll never do again, you know?   We&#8217;re a self-sufficient ministry and when people are giving to our ministry they give because they want to give. We do do fundraisers and stuff like that but we&#8217;re not out soliciting or begging nothing from nobody. You know, we&#8217;re just on about doing good. We&#8217;re just on about doing good. And people hear about us from word of mouth or, you know, somebody&#8217;s life was changed and we&#8217;ve got ladies that are here from Texas. We&#8217;ve had ladies from Wisconsin, New York, everywhere from here. You know, how they got here we certainly didn&#8217;t send no ad out [both laugh]. But somebody told somebody told somebody and they ended up at the God Did It Recovery Home for Women.  JB: I gotcha.  GM: Yeah.  JB: Speaking of those women, you mentioned earlier and you started smiling as well, you talked about how a lot of times you don&#8217;t sit back and think about the women that just came through. And I don&#8217;t know if you, would you mind just telling a story of a woman that&#8217;s touched you, that&#8217;s come through and really benefited from your home?  GM: Well one of them that you&#8217;ll be interviewing in a little bit, Bonnie Mize, she&#8217;s been with me for nine years. She&#8217;s our facility manager now and I&#8217;ll let her definitely tell her story. But I was working at the other treatment facility. It was on 9/11, the day that the towers came down. And I was working there and she was in detox and she was in a lot of pain and a lot of stuff had gone on in her life and I was just sitting at my desk and she&#8217;d walk up and she&#8217;d want to talk. And I was sharing with her about giving her some hope but also sharing about one day I wanted to open a home. And she was, you know, not able to do a lot for us like stuff to do physically, but she got up like on one [25:00] elbow and she said, &#8220;Ms. McCauley, when you do that I want to help you,&#8221; you know? If you looked at then you&#8217;d naturally be like, &#8220;Girl you in here tore up. How you gonna help me [laughs]?&#8221; You know? But I didn&#8217;t look at it like that, and I really didn&#8217;t even think about it. I just heard what she said, you know, and to imagine that this girl is sitting right beside me, working beside me everyday. And she&#8217;s got the same heart that I got.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Over the years I can&#8217;t imagine that she&#8217;s held back from this ministry in giving up her time, her efforts, her money. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about at the end.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Yeah.  JB: As far as your upbringing, let&#8217;s focus on that a little more. You talked about how your parents were together sixty years several times. And you talked about just how that influenced your life and how being, I guess, brought up strictly it made you, I guess you said rebel. And I guess it ultimately led toward I mean your addiction and this heart that you have. So I guess could you just talk about your parents more. So just the jobs they had--you mentioned the jobs; you didn&#8217;t say what they were--and just how you feel the way they raised you affected you in this women&#8217;s movement and the things you&#8217;re doing now.  GM: My dad was a really strong man. He worked two jobs from the time I was born until I was about thirty-eight years old. He worked at Textile Mills but he worked two full-time eight-hour jobs. Not only did he work those jobs, he went in to work an hour early. He never went to work on time or just made it in to the time clock. My mom, after she had us, you know, wasn&#8217;t working herself, she would take his food down to him at lunch time instead of him taking a lunch bag, you know? She was a dedicated mother and, you know, wife. And when I think about what I&#8217;m living in now and when I think about dedication and how people are so quick to, &#8220;Well you know, we&#8217;re divorced.&#8221; And, you know, I came from a family of people, that covenant that they made with each other, they stuck with it.   And I&#8217;m sure they had hard times. I&#8217;m sure they had times when they were disappointed with each other. They never let us know it. I never heard my dad holler at my mom, call her out a name, any of that kind of stuff, you know? I can&#8217;t definitely blame my mom or dad that had anything to do with my addiction, you know? They didn&#8217;t contribute to that in any kind of way because my mom and dad, my mom was brought up very strict. So therefore she could only give me what she was given, you know? But my mom, she said she&#8217;s never smoked a cigarette, never drank a beer, she never, you know? She never done any of those things. She&#8217;s always been somebody that I respected. I didn&#8217;t like how she wouldn&#8217;t let me go, but there wasn&#8217;t anything else about her that I didn&#8217;t like, you know?   I went through FHA in school. I was a girl scout. You know, I learned how to knit, crochet, do all that as a young girl. She let me iron, so you know I was going to be a Susie Homemaker one day [laughs], and you know things like that. I saw that in her. Like I said my dad I can remember him missing one day out of work in all those years that he worked and that day he was hit by a tow motor and he wouldn&#8217;t even go to the hospital. I think that contributed to him having Parkinson&#8217;s. They said if you have a hard blow, sometimes that starts Parkinson&#8217;s off and he died of Parkinson&#8217;s.   But my dad, he, the times that his car broke down he walked to work. And one of the places he worked was here in Haw River at Cone Mill, so he walked all the way to Cone Mill rather than walking across the street and asking those people to take him to work. He was a very proud man, you know? And he taught us that life was about hard work. And so you can&#8217;t live in something all the time and see it and that not be instilled in you. So I really think you know we were given more than ample what most people got out of a family situation. When my dad had vacation time, he would take us every year on vacation for a week with him. He&#8217;d load up the five kids in the car and he&#8217;d take us to [30:00] Tweetsie Railroad, to the lake somewhere, to New York, Baltimore. But he would always spend his time with his kids the one week off he had a year, you know?   He was a disciplinarian, so my mom didn&#8217;t whoop us. When he got home, he whooped us. And you know he didn&#8217;t barter with us. He told us what to do, we did that. There was no way around it. We didn&#8217;t talk back. He didn&#8217;t play that. So I don&#8217;t remember ever going hungry at home. I remember the oil being turned off sometimes and him going out and talking to the man, or doing whatever and the people coming up and putting oil in that thing, you know? He took care of his own and that kind of thing was always kind of instilled in me, about covenant and family. Although, like I said, in addicition, everything that you learned basically you got back on it in addiction. I probably took more money from my mom than anybody else than I can remember. I was a professional thief and whatever it took to get that $1,000 is basically what it took, you know? An addiction after a while you don&#8217;t have any emotions so you don&#8217;t feel. So you might do something and then you hate it later on. But I didn&#8217;t feel anything, you know?  JB: So what--excuse me sorry--so what made, what ended up being the thing you felt, what made--. I know you mentioned your son earlier, but what was that moment that led you to change your life and to doing these great things?  GM: My son. My son. He was, like I said, I never in my whole life thought that I would have any children. I didn&#8217;t want any kids. Now I didn&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t want Nicholas, I just said I didn&#8217;t want any kids because I wasn&#8217;t really living a life where I had time for children, you know? So I never planned to have kids but you know. But one day he said--and that&#8217;s all he wanted to do was spend time with me. I went through like a postpartum depression when I had him and I forgot that I even had a child within the first three days because I used till the day he was born. And my mom had him and I remember when I called home she said, &#8220;Why you didn&#8217;t call and check on the baby?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;What baby?&#8221; You know, sickness runs very deep. This thing called addiction it can go into levels that a lot of times we don&#8217;t, if we had never been there, we don&#8217;t know anything about it, you know? But actually I had forgotten that I even had a child.  But he would always want to be up under me and of course I would always push him away because it was all about me and I was always busy being high. And my sister-in-law would tell me because they would keep him, my mom would keep him, and they would take him places like Disney World, Hershey&#8217;s, Pennsylvania, you know, take him on cruises with them and stuff like that. So he really never hurted for anything other than a mother. He had a grandmother and my mother was the kind of person that she didn&#8217;t want to take my son away from me. Although all the things I did, her desire was from me to get my life back together and get my son back. So he would say, try to call her mama and she would say to him, &#8220;No I&#8217;m not your mother. I&#8217;m your grand mama. Here&#8217;s a picture of your mama.&#8221; So she was always pushing towards that to happen.   And he would ask them, &#8220;What do you want for your birthday?&#8221; When they&#8217;d ask him stuff like that he would say, &#8220;I want my mom and dad to get a house and to move with my mom and dad.&#8221; That was his greatest desire; he just wanted to be with his mom and dad. And so times when I had been in prison and stuff like that, they&#8217;d been in every week to see me. My mom would come every week. They would never not come. They would, if we could have thirty dollars a week, every week I got thirty dollars regardless of what I had done. And he would say times when I&#8217;d be home, he&#8217;d say, &#8220;Mama, is you gonna leave and go back to prison?&#8221; And that, I hadn&#8217;t cried in seven years. I cried. I wasn&#8217;t going to cry. If there was going to be any crying, you had to do the crying, you know? And a tear dropped down my eye and it was like a block of salt it had been so long since I had cried. And that&#8217;s what the Lord used to break me down. It was the love for my son, you know. Unconditional. There was nobody like his mama, [35:00] regardless of what I had done.   You know, you sit at home sometimes and you hear your parents, they&#8217;re out of hurt and out of truth they&#8217;re talking and they&#8217;re saying things about you that is the truth but it still hurts. And they&#8217;re talking like you&#8217;re not there. But a child, he doesn&#8217;t see any wrongs in you at all, and all he wants is that hug and all he wants is to know is if you&#8217;re going to be there. And like I said that&#8217;s what the Lord used for me to cause me to want to do better, you know? To want to get my life back together, to get him straightened out. I didn&#8217;t want the thought of him one day coming and saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t tell me what to do, crack head!&#8221; I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to handle that, you know? So I knew I was going to have to do something to change so I didn&#8217;t have to while he was still young. And basically that&#8217;s what happened. So he was six years old when I got him back. He was six and from the time of six all the way to twenty-one he was with me.  JB: That&#8217;s good. As far as the movement that you have going now, I know you said that you&#8217;d be opening a new spot in Manteo, and I know you said you had five doctors and I believe you said seventy patients. Can you go into a little more of the specifics of what you&#8217;re doing now to help these women and just how it&#8217;s going to further contribute?  GM: Well we have, it&#8217;s five health care techs here, you know, that watch over the home, that monitor the women, that help them with their day-to-day living. The house is like a home. We help in every way. We provide clothing, food, help them to look for work, do family counseling, reunification. We take them places: the beach, mountains, wherever the Lord provides for us to take them. It&#8217;s not about just they pay to come in here. No, we give back just as much as they give us, you know? In fact my thought is that we are going to give you more than you ever give us, you know? We love them, share with them our heart. We don&#8217;t try to separate it out because I&#8217;m the founder and director of this program. I&#8217;m a woman just like they are. I share my joys, heartaches with them as a group. Because most people know how to live in a structured environment, they don&#8217;t know how to live when they go home. So I try to get it as much like home as possible.   The ladies we help them to transition back into the world out there by savings accounts and kept within the facility, so when they leave they&#8217;ll have money to buy a car or even an apartment to get back on their feet again. But we be a covering, a support system while they&#8217;re here and hold them accountable. There&#8217;s consequences to actions.  JB: That&#8217;s true.  GM: So we help them feel good about themselves again and it takes every one of us doing what we do. We all bring our little piece to the table that they might be made whole.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Yeah.  JB: As far as--I just have a couple more questions for you. When you, looking back, I know you kind of touched on it earlier but did you believe at the time, when you look back now, do you feel like your intentions were to help a women&#8217;s movement or to help with this greater cause, or were your intentions less than that? What do you feel like your intentions were in that aspect?  GM: Well my intentions was to help the women not on this scale. I didn&#8217;t see it in this big, you know. But I thank God that he knew more than I knew as far as what he wanted done. At that point, I didn&#8217;t see the epidemic called drug addiction that disease. It&#8217;s from one thing to the next. It&#8217;s now prescription meds and [40:00] the ice and the spice and the--you know, it&#8217;s just the progressive thing, you know? And I do know that the drugs are not their problems. The drugs are what they use to stop from dealing with their problems. So it&#8217;s a big work and it&#8217;s gonna take all of us doing our part in order to see that one girl&#8217;s life set free.   But I think that what I set out to accomplish, like I said, one day I believe that we&#8217;ll have a home for women with AIDS that are in addiction, you know? One of the first videos I did it had on there, I wanted to have two homes that were sitting right beside each other. They were small houses that only had two or three bedrooms in them. And this house can house, it could house up to ten women. And I was able to be at the house twelve women as far as the zoning commission, but I only wanted to do eight women at a time. But the two homes, I wanted to have one home be big enough--it&#8217;s what I said in this video--I wanted a home for women and children, a home for women with AIDS, and we talked about the women&#8217;s prisons and different things. All of those things that I talked about on that video have already come to pass except for the home for the women with AIDS. I&#8217;ve been introduced to some people that are doing that right now that I could have stuck my hand in at that point and probably been a part of that, but I&#8217;m not in a hurry to do anything. I want to do what I do the best I can do. I&#8217;m not trying to get big. I ain&#8217;t trying to get no name. I ain&#8217;t trying to get nothing. I&#8217;m just trying to live one day at a time, (any of it, some might have grown away, 41:51).  JB: And as far as the movement now, how do you feel like people--I know you touched on it earlier. You said no one&#8217;s ever asked you, &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; How can other people, not only in North Carolina, just in general help out with these kinds of movements? More specifically yours but just in general?  GM: Well there&#8217;s always a lot of ways to help. We can help with our prayers. We can help financially. This is good ground to sow into. We can help through volunteering. We don&#8217;t allow people to come in and take the ladies look for jobs and all that different stuff. We do that in house. You know we don&#8217;t have a big face of volunteer people that come in and volunteer. People that do come in and volunteer, they volunteered through doing Bible studies, sewing classes, cooking classes, well-women classes, fitness classes, you know, different things like that. But as far as to take the women off the facility, we don&#8217;t allow them to take the women off of the facility without being staff going with them.  JB: I got you.  GM: For the safety of the women as well as the safety of the volunteers. But not that I feel that somebody&#8217;s going to be hurt but you never know until people cross a certain line in recovery what they&#8217;re going to do, you know? So there&#8217;s many a ways to help and, like I said, if they really wanted to help you could call into the facility and, you know, we got numerous of things we&#8217;d love help with. We one day, we had a garden out in back one time but only because somebody had a heart to do it, you know? When it becomes work then I don&#8217;t think you oughta do it. If you asked me to, &#8220;Visit us, will you come and speak? Will you come and cook something and bring,&#8221; you know, whatever? I&#8217;ll come and I&#8217;ll keep coming, I&#8217;ll keep coming. But if you come and you say, &#8220;Can you work in the flower garden?&#8221; I&#8217;m going to come that one time and then I won&#8217;t come back because that&#8217;s a job to me. That&#8217;s not something I really enjoy doing, you know? So I like when people come and bring their gift or the thing that they enjoy doing so that they can keep it up just as long as they feel the need to give.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Yeah.  JB: What would you say you&#8217;re most proud of with your work with this God Did It Recovery Home?  GM: I guess the thing that I&#8217;m most proud of is that I see lives that have been transformed. I&#8217;ve seen women leave in the wrong way and because of what they&#8217;d been taught, they come back some weeks later some months later some [45:00] years later to tell me that they want to actually sit down and tell me, &#8220;Ms. McCauley,&#8221; and they&#8217;ll begin to laugh about times that happened when they were here. And I can tell that those were some of the happiest times in their lives, that they have used those times to make markers out of them where, you know, in our home life when family members die or when you have a separation from people, you go back in your memory bank and you think about all the good times in life. God Did It had been a part of so many women&#8217;s life, a good time in their life. And I think that&#8217;s one of the things that brings me more joy, or when they&#8217;re up sharing their testimonies, they go to church and they share their testimonies. We go to churches. They have their own choir. They sing at churches. Churches invite us out and they sing and they tell their testimonies. And a lot of times when they&#8217;re telling their testimonies I forgot what they&#8217;d be talking about. And as they&#8217;re talking about it and something that is so important to them, you know, it just makes me my heart just burn inside just thinking, &#8220;Oh wow, that meant something to them really?&#8221; You know? But the women in the home, the thing that I&#8217;m most proud of is how they have taken this program and embraced it and gone out to help somebody else.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Yeah.  JB: And I guess just my final question would be is there anything you feel like it should be said, not only about this recovery home and how it contributes to this women&#8217;s movement, but also just in general anything you feel that could be said that could not only help the women&#8217;s movement, but anything other people would benefit from as well?  GM: Something that we took out of work, emotion, love, caring, compassion. You get in a lot of trouble on the job a lot of times, you know? That&#8217;s why I would rather have the facility that I&#8217;d have to stand on my knees a lot rather than had the check that&#8217;s laying on the table already ready for this girl to come in here. Because the love is what keeps raising these women up, you know? That I&#8217;m able to show them that. That I&#8217;m able to require that they go to church. I&#8217;m able to require that not only they go to church but that they go to church together, because we don&#8217;t go to one denominational church because it doesn&#8217;t matter to me what denomination they end up going to. It&#8217;s just important that we feed and eat together. You know we learn at the same process so that one won&#8217;t be way up on the spectrum and another way down or one has once thought of something and another is thinking something else when you need to be hearing the same thing at the same time so we can work together and reason together. [Pause]   That&#8217;s what I think about it, that everything that&#8217;s real has been basically taken out of recovery. Everything, you know, it&#8217;s a twelve-step. I believe in twelve-step myself. There are steps you got to go through. I believe in NA because nobody can sit and hold you in the rest of your life. It&#8217;s an organization. It&#8217;s big; it&#8217;s around the country. You know and all this, you know. But things that were one time, somebody came in just like prayer in the school, and one person changed that. Just like NA it was a Christian organization and then it was opened up so that Atheists can come and now you can&#8217;t name the name of God. I&#8217;m not into all that stuff, you know? I guess I&#8217;m from the old school [laughs]. I don&#8217;t think that anything was wrong with what grandma said. She&#8217;s got the harvest of a life that was clean, notable to bring to show what she stood for was good. And the rest of these things as I see it, doors are closing; it doesn&#8217;t have any stability to it. And I want to be on something that&#8217;s solid.  JB: That&#8217;s good.  GM: Mm-hm.  JB: Well I thank you for your time and we really appreciate your contribution to this program. And we just thank you.
