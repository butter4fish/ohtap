Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  There's a phrase that I like to give my students in my syllabus, by Bertrand Russell [British mathematician, logician and philosopher]; it's a long phrase but it starts off as "Mathematics rightly viewed can be appreciated as an art that is to be compared with the finest sculpture."  I haven't memorized it but I do have a copy of it with me, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, by Bertrand Russell, okay.
Story_ID: 28754
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family; I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Robert Leslie Williams] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first and then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Inaudible response.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Minnie Lucile Williams--Wynn Williams, M-I-N-N-I-E L-U-C-I-L-E W-Y-N-N W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 14th, 1918, Apalachicola, Florida.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: A-P-A-L-A-C-H-I-C-O-L-A, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Well we can trace our history back several generations to my great grandfather's family.  We have located his, his childhood area as Georgia, and we know that he has several sisters and brothers.  His name is Henry Clary (ph.) Thomas.  He marched with General Sherman in the Union Army and was discharged in a place near Savannah, Georgia.  After being discharged, he moved to Apalachicola where he met his wife Eliza Frances Porter Brantley (ph.); she was a widow with a daughter Minnie, and the two were married and gave birth to two daughters, Mary Elena (ph.) and Maude Elizabeth.  Mary and Maude grew up in Apalachicola, they had the opportunity to attend school at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida]; Mary graduated in the class of '08 [1908] and this was the last year that the university was known as the Florida Normal School for Colored People, and Maude graduated in the class of '09 [1909], which was the first year of Florida A and M Uni--College, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College.  Maude was my grandmother; she married George Henderson Wynn.  George was from Campbellton, Florida; he had, I think, four siblings and he always wanted to go to study with George Washington Carver at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he moved to Apalachicola so that he could save money to go to Tuskegee.  There--he met my grandmother and they--he eventually married and gave birth to--my mother was the first born, and four sons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of these sons--all of their children had the opportunity to go to college.  One went to Tuskegee, the others went to Florida A and M--College at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather had a chance to go to Tuskegee after he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's what he aspired to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 28755
Speaker 1: So your mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] was raised in Apalachicola [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Apalachicola, Florida, okay?
Speaker 1: All right; and she's one of the ones who went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, she went to FAMU; she attended high--middle school or elementary school in Apalachicola and she--from junior high school she went a year in Quincy, Florida and then for high school, because there was no high school for African Americans in Apalachicola, she graduated from high school here in Tallahassee at Lincoln, Lincoln School.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Are there any stories your mother shared with you about growing up in this area?  What it was like?
Speaker 2: Many stories.  Growing up in Apalachicola, she had many fond memories and she always wanted to know what was on the other side of the bay or she always wanted to--she always looked forward to crossing over into the bay, the Apalachicola Bay.  At that time, the means of transportation was by a boat; there was a big wheel boat called the Crescent City Boat.  Now, there a bridge between the peninsula, Apalachicola, and the mainland and so--but she always looked forward to traveling--to go to Tallahassee to go to college and so she had that opportunity.
Speaker 1: So Apalachicola is on a peninsula that juts out into the bay?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a seafood port, okay?  And--
Speaker 1: Now this is near here, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is eighteen miles south of Tallahassee.
Speaker 1: And Tallahassee is in northern Florida (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--In the [Florida] panhandle; it's in the northern part of Florida, okay?  Probably almost central between the--Pensacola and Jacksonville [cities in Florida], okay?--which are on the opposite sides of north Florida--the boundaries.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what did your mother study in school?
Speaker 2: Well, when she came to Florida A and M, she studied--she majored in French and mathematics.  She also enjoyed English, but her majors were French and mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she use?  Did she use her major in her profession?
Speaker 2: Well she--when she graduated, she became a teacher and she taught at many of the local schools here, many of them at that time were one-room schools, so she had a chance to teach in a one-room school.  In the '50s [1950], in 1950, she came to teach in Tallahassee at Bond School, Bond Junior High School, and she was appointed assistant to the principal at that time, and so she taught English and assisted the principal; eventually, she became principal, and so her career was as an educator in the Leon County schools.  She held several positions in the school system here as a curriculum developer for the elementary schools, etcetera.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28756
Speaker 1: Well, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Robert Leslie Williams, and that's R-O-B-E-R-T L-E-S-L-I-E W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Quincy, Florida and his date of birth was May 13th, 1980--1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.  And where was he born?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Quincy, Florida.
Speaker 1: Oh, Quincy, okay. Quincy, Florida.  Now again, what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well our, our, family research begins with his father, Louis Williams, and I think we know of his sisters and of his parents but Louis--Louis, Louis Williams was a musician.  He played with The Rabbit Foots Company, which was an all-African American minstrel company, okay?  And he had his entire year there--career with The Rabbit's Foot Company.  He married Ola Williams.  Ola Williams was from Fort Meyers, Florida and to their union were four daughters and two sons.  My father went to school here in Tallahassee [Florida], graduated from high school; he went on to serve in World War II, okay?  After serving in World War II, he found employment at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] College [Tallahassee, Florida] at that particular time and he--his first employment there was as a police, policeman--campus policeman, and then he held other various positions among staff and etcetera.
Story_ID: 28757
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanna go back and ask you some questions about The Rabbit's Foot Minstrels; that really seems like an interesting--now this is--you made an important distinction that this is a--African American--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --company which is--and this is, I guess this had to be one of the last minstrel companies, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the original owner and person who started The Rabbit Foots Company was Pat Chappelle from Jacksonville, Florida, okay?  It's where the company originated.
Speaker 1: So this is an African American, right?
Speaker 2: He's an African American.
Speaker 1: Okay; from Jacksonville, okay.  How far did that go?
Speaker 2: I believe this was around 1900--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and for a while, the company was located in Tampa, Florida, but soon it became a tent minstrel and it traveled--it traveled through the South, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, even traveled to some places in the North during its time; North Carolina, Tennessee, and I believe that Pat Chappelle died around 1917 and it was purchased by a gentleman--Wilcox-Wilcott [Fred S. Wolcott]; and he held the company I think until the 1930s and then it was bought a third time.  But I think that The Rabbit Foots Minstrels existed as late as 1967--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --and it was, through its career, the only African American-owned-managed company where all of the, all of the members of the minstrel were African Americans.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is sort of a strange history of entertainment in some ways because the minstrel show was started by white people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who were imitating black people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then when black folks wanted to get involved in entertainment, that being the prevailing--they had to imitate white people who were imitating black people. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Right; absolutely.
Speaker 1: So were the audiences of The Rabbit's Foot Minstrels mostly white audiences?
Speaker 2: I understand that they were mixed.  At that time, they sat on different parts of the tent but they attracted both black and white audiences through the entire life of the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were mixed but segregated.
Speaker 2: Mixed but segregated.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now there has to be--are there any stories about, you know, what it was like to have an African American minstrel show?
Speaker 2: Well, there is a book that is titled 'Ragged But Right', and it is a book that covers many of the minstrels, and particular--during that particular era, and so the information we gathered from The Rabbit's Foot, that was the source of our information.  Now we have pictures from our father [Robert Leslie Williams], okay?  That show The Rabbit's Foot Minstrel, and we also have this clarinet, but we were very fortunate to come across this book in which we learned quite a bit about The Rabbit Foots Minstrels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28758
Speaker 1: And your father [Robert Leslie Williams] was a clarinetist in the group?
Speaker 2: My grand--my [paternal] grandfather [Louis Williams] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Your grandfather, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Louis Williams was a clarinetist in the band of The Rabbit Foots.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's your grandfather and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-- Yes.
Speaker 1: --so a minstrel show, from what I understand, were consistent.  You had to have a fairly good-sized band.
Speaker 2: Yes.  They had several bands, as I understand; they had, they had, they had a--it was a very prosperous show; they had dancers, they had entertainers; some of the famous entertainers, I believe, are Ella Fitzgerald [jazz vocalist], and I also think that Moms Mabley [stand-up comedian] was one of the entertainers that they both got their start in The Rabbit Foots Minstrels.  It was one of the largest and one of the most successful minstrels during the era of the minstrels.  They owned--they owned Pullman cars and they had a very large tent, and I heard that they would have 2,000 guests at some of their shows, so it was an extremely large--they, they would introduce themselves with a parade, okay, when they arrived in the town.
Speaker 1: It was almost like a circus, like the traveling circuses used to do in those days, you'd have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--parading through town first, and put up the tent, do the show (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, then you put up the tent and then you have--that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  That's something.  So you say you have some pictures of all this stuff?
Speaker 2: Well, we do have a picture of the tent, it was a very large tent that--they had buses; during the last years of The Rabbit's Foot, they were located in Fort Gibson--I think that's Mississippi, and there was a Rabbit Foots hotel, and the owner Wilcott [Wolcott] bought a plantation there which became the home--the Rabbits Foot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't--we do have a picture of the tent and the outfit at some point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did your grandfather--was his entire career spent with Rabbit's Foot?
Speaker 2: His entire career; he passed, I think, in 1947 or somewhere in the late 1940s and so his entire career was with The Rabbit's Foot--Rabbit Foots.
Speaker 1: So he was almost like someone who worked as a Pullman Porter so he was gone a lot, I guess--he was on the road (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes he was; in fact, the book that-'Ragged But Right' does have a--an article that my grandfather wrote to the Freeman's Newspaper where he was--another minstrel invited him to work and he was--the letter that he wrote thanking but denying the opportunity, was published in the Freeman's Paper.
Speaker 1: Was this the Indianapolis Freeman [the first illustrated black newspaper in the United States; Indianapolis, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. All right.
Story_ID: 28759
Speaker 1: Now your father [Robert Leslie Williams] went to World War II, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think he was in the area of Italy and maybe Greece and Germany--Greece and Italy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that area.
Speaker 1: And are there any stories about the war that he shared?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember many of the stories that he shared about being in the war, okay?  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  When he came back--now was he married before he went to war?
Speaker 2: My mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] and father married in 1945 so he was--had been discharged at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, he was from Quincy [Florida] and my mother studied a year in Quincy; my grandfather wanted her to take a foreign language and Stevens High School in Quincy offered Latin, so she went to Quincy a year to study a foreign language, and that was the first time that my mother spoke of knowing my father and this was when they were in junior high school maybe?  She has fond memories of him playing and I don't know if they were classmates, they were probably classmates.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28760
Speaker 1: So when you think about your parents' [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams and Robert Leslie Williams] personalities and their dispositions, what they looked like, how they walked and talked and their sense of humor, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I have quite a bit of both of their characteristics.  My mother was outgoing, she was a community worker, a church worker, did a lot of volunteering and social service, my father was a private person; his favorite hobby was fishing and he used to like to fish whenever he had an opportunity.  Now I think that my spirit of giving and serving comes from my mother, but I think my spirit of being private probably comes from my father--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --so I think I have a lot of his--I think I have a lot of the Williams personality, okay?
Speaker 1: So you're more of a low-key and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28761
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your brothers and sisters--or do you--there's just two of you, right?
Speaker 2: It's just two of us, yes.
Speaker 1: And the eldest is your brother?
Speaker 2: My brother is Ronald Leslie Williams and he's three years older than I, he was born in 1947.  And he, he also graduated and went to FAMU High School [Tallahassee, Florida] and he went on to study at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] in engineering sciences, and upon graduating, he went straight to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] where he worked for the [U.S.] Department of Defense [DOD]; he went on--he stayed there maybe about five years, and continued his graduate program at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] in mechanical--electrical engineering, I think--electrical engineering; he left there and moved to Los Angeles [California] and worked for Hughes Corporation and at some point, he decided that he would go back to graduate school to pursue the Ph.D. and so he went to the University of California Los Angeles [UCLA] and majored in physics, and so he received the Ph.D. in physics from UCLA and returned to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and is now currently a professor of physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now he's quite a mathematician, I guess, too if he's a physicist.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So does mathematics run in the family?  Were your parents gifted mathematicians?
Speaker 2: My mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] majored in mathematics here at FAMU yes, and taught mathematics and English; she taught mathematics, English and French during her teaching years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28762
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory.  I remember having piano lessons all my life, and I think I started at the age of five with piano lessons.  My mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] wanted me, I believe, to be a teacher--a music teacher, and in our neighborhood there were quite a few musicians and so we had a choice of teachers and so those were some of my earliest memories of just going to piano lessons with J. Harrison Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is with--you said J. Ernest Thomas?
Speaker 2: His name was initial J. Harrison--
Speaker 1: J. Harrison.
Speaker 2: --Thomas, emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At some point, he was a professor at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida], he also taught school; his wife was also in music, a teacher at home.  She taught the young, the very young students in their home.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I also have fond memories of growing up in the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church and so that has been a part of my life--all of my life, been a member of that church, Baptist Training Union (unclear).
Story_ID: 28763
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you describe your neighborhood?  Now you were born here on the campus of Florida [Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahasee, Florida] right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so did you live close to the campus when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I still live in the neighborhood from which I grew up and this neighborhood is right across the street from the university [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee].  The university almost engulfs the neighborhood so my family was one of the first settlers of the neighborhood; we were relocated in Tallahassee to that area--to the area where we are now when the state capital was expanding, okay?  This area, because of its close proximity to the university, easily became the homes of many of the faculty and staff as well as other educators around the city.  And so there we have professors continue to live in the neighborhood; the neighborhood is--probably began in the early 20s [1920s], okay?
Speaker 1: Is there a name for the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It's called the--there are three regions on the local plat; it's the Florida A and M subdivisions, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was extended in three different areas, Florida A and M subdivision, Florida A and M annex, and Florida A and M annex 2.
Speaker 1: They all sound so institutional (laughter), the names of the neighborhoods.   Nobody has that--I mean there's not a more colorful name for them (laughter).  Florida A and M annex 2 and--
Speaker 2: This is how it was described in the County Plat neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's not a more colorful name for any of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well we call ourselves the Florida A and M Neighborhood Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But if you told somebody where you lived, you'd probably say you lived over by Florida A and M, is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--"I live over by Florida A and M" is exactly what we say, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your family live in the same home the whole time you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, originally we lived in my aunt's house--my father's [Robert Leslie Williams] sister's house; she was one of the families relocated, and next to her house was my father's aunt's house and so we grew up in both of those houses for I guess about nine years of my life in one house, and then my mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] bought my aunt's house--my father's aunt's house--restored it, and we moved next door.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28764
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe what the neighborhood was like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the neighborhood [in Tallahassee, Florida] was a very nice place to live.  Most of the children in the neighborhood felt very close and were as sisters and brothers, we all had the same experiences.  Now one thing that I remember--have fond memories is the fact that our neighborhood was bounded--bordered by the FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] farm, so we would look out of our doors and we could see cattle, horses, I guess the farm may have been a hundred acre farm, which is now currently dormitories, but many of the young men worked for the dairy, the FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] dairy, and almost all of the children at that time participated in what was called Children's Theater, which was a part of the theater program at Florida A and M University, and so every year we would give plays, and this tradition continues today, the Children's Theater.
Story_ID: 28765
Speaker 1: Okay, so this [Children's Theater, Tallahassee, Florida] started--did this start before you came around, or do you know that?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not quite sure when Children's Theater began, but I think I was about the age of five or six or seven when I began to participate in Children's Theater.
Speaker 1: So is this an activity that's year-round, or just in the summer, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: It's year-round?
Speaker 2: Yes, it has--it's now under the direction of Dr. Valencia Matthews, which is the dean of the College of Arts and Humanities [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida].  At that particular time, during my time, it was under Dr. and Mrs. Edmonds and they, at that time, were department chair of theater at Florida A and M University.  And we also had Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and many of our troop leaders were community members and we--almost all of the students in the neighborhood went to FAMU High School so we were very cohesive--small but cohesive, modest neighborhood.
Story_ID: 28766
Speaker 1: Now were there other African American high schools in the Tallahassee [Florida] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--There was Lincoln High School, which is the school that my mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] and father [Robert Leslie Williams] graduated, and there was Florida A and M [FAMU] High School, so those were the two African American high schools.  There were some junior high schools and elementary schools; my mother taught at Bond School, there was Griffin School that was a--I guess a very famous school that started in the 1900s under the Bethel AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church; it was started as a church institute and it--during my childhood it had become an elementary school too, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it used to be a high school too?
Speaker 2: Yes, it used to be a high school that was--attracted students from all over the state of Florida so it was Lincoln Institute and then as years went by, it became a high school, and it still--junior high school, and it still is in existence today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's an elementary school now?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the students at FAMU High school, were they exclusively the children of the faculty and staff?
Speaker 2: No, they--the school was open to all citizens; there was very limited space because of its size, and so we had students from all local communities, the Bond community, the South Side community, they were all our classmates; it was a small school.  My, my class had--my classmates came from various communities but there were thirty-five of us to graduate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so it was--it gives you an idea of the size.
Speaker 1: That would be 1968, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28767
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells?  We were on that, and I think I got you distracted.
Speaker 2: Well as a child, I used to enjoy traveling with my parents [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams and Robert Leslie Williams] and family.  We would make annual trips for my mother, who was a teacher, to state teacher conferences and this gave us an opportunity to see a lot of Florida.  I enjoyed traveling with my family; my cousins grew up--they were also descendants of the Apalachicola [Florida] lineage and they grew up in our neighborhood, and we would travel together.  We would like to go to Apalachicola, we had a favorite spot, it was Money Bayou Beach, which was an African American beach.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-O-N-E-Y--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: B-A-Y-O-U, okay?
Speaker 1: Oh, Money Bayou Beach, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we would go there, we would love to go there, it was just a beautiful secluded beach.  Of course many of the people from our neighborhood were also--looked forward to going to the same beach and so we would--I would enjoy visiting Quincy [Florida] and my grandparents there; well at that time, I never knew my grandfather or my grandmother, but I knew their aunt--their sisters and brothers--their sisters--and we would visit there and in Quincy, Florida, I used to enjoy visiting my cousins in Apalachicola, Florida.  In latter years, the Wynn family [Williams' maternal family] began to have family reunions which I always looked forward to and so that's--traveling, I remember traveling to--with my mother and my cous--her first cousin and their children to--they had a friend the Donaldsons, and they had a farm and I used to enjoy watching the mule grind sugarcane and turn it into syrup and/or sugar juice, and so just a small rural area of this particular region of Florida I have very fond memories.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now this part of Florida is not the southernmost part, but the weather here is fairly warm most of the time, right?
Speaker 2: The weather is very warm because--one reason is it's very humid area and so the water--the area can be warmer than South Florida as a result of the humidity that we experience but no, it is in the northern part of Florida.  It's in the region that is called the panhandle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28768
Speaker 1: You were telling us about church, Bethel MB--Missionary Baptist Church [Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I think we had to stop [to change tapes] just as you were talking about it, but tell us more about it.  Did you have, I guess, responsibilities as a youth in the church?
Speaker 2: Well, as a matter of fact, my music teacher was the organist and pianist for Bethel Baptist Church, and I was his assistant and--not that I was a very good player, but I played for the Sunday School, and when Mr. Thomas was not available, I would try my best to play for services.  It was a very well-known church; it had a pastor during my youth, the Reverend C.K. Steele [preacher and a civil rights activist], which was a peer of Martin Luther King, Jr.; I think that they were both classmates at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], and so our church was the center of the Civics Rights Era in Tallahassee [Florida] and--as well as the local area.  The church was, I guess, very instrumental in the bus boycott that was local, and the integration of the city of Tallahassee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So the local bus company was segregated when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: It was segregated when I grew up and during the 60s [1960's].  Members of our church were very active; in fact, there is a book called 'The Pain and the Promise', and it chronicles the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee and how the--our church was--the role that our church and our pastor played in bringing about integration into the area.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now did the bus boycott occur before the one in Montgomery [Alabama] or afterwards?
Speaker 2: Well I think that they were simultaneous--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was not as famous as the boycott in Montgomery and our pastor, Reverend C.K. Steele, was very active on the national level during the days of the boycott, and he was with Martin Luther King, very close association with Martin Luther King, Jr. at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I know many parts of the country where we'd go, we'd hear about boycotts and sit-ins and movements that happened long before or simultaneous with the ones that are famous--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but most people don't hear about it--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but they're just as important, you know, as the others.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how long--now you were about five [years old], I guess, when this was going on; five or six, right?
Speaker 2: I was probably in middle school when this occurred.  It began in the 60s [1960's], so I was more maybe ten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, okay; so this is after Montgomery (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay so yes, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--occurred in '56 [1956], so this is in the 1960s (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The '60s (1960s), yes.

Speaker 1: Did you experience much of the segregated environment when you were growing up?  Did you go downtown [Tallahassee, Florida] a lot, or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in the segregated South during the 50s [1950's] but it was a positive experience.  There was a segregated Tallahassee and we had our own town, French Town, we had our own grocery stores, service stations, our gas stations, so we were a complete business district in Tallahassee and so we did very well business-wise, the African American community here during the segregation part.  And I think that the fact that we were in a state--we were in the seat of state government, two universities--two prominent universities, contributed to the fact that the segregated Tallahassee was a very thriving place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or black Tallahassee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes.  (Simultaneous)--Black Tallahassee was a very thriving community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a major--was there a name for the black community in Tallahassee then, or was there a major street that ran into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, there was not a major name, there were communities; we had Springfield, we had French Town, South Side, Bond Community, and so we had various subdivisions and communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a major street running through, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--the black community where you had a lot of businesses and--
Speaker 2: Well, French Town was a major street; it was in a major--there we had doctors, medical doctors, drug stores, barber shops, grocery stores, theaters, a--well, I think we had more than one theater during the life of segregation here, and so French Town was a main street there during that, during that time and maybe this is during the 40s [1940s] as well as the 50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: I remember Whitney Young [civil rights leader] coming to Dayton [Ohio] when I was in high school and telling us that we were 38 percent of the population; we were like shocked; we didn't realize were that--
Speaker 2: Large?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What was the size of the black population here in Tallahassee?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know the size of the black population; we, we, we covered South Tallahassee almost completely, and this is south of the tracks; but there was also a very prominent white community called Indian Head Acres that was right across the street, so I guess if you partitioned Tallahassee to four regions, north, south, east, west or northeast, south (unclear), we were southwest and northwest I guess were the regions that we covered.
Speaker 1: And what do you think the percentage of the black population was I mean just a conjecture?  I don't expect you to know exactly.
Speaker 2: I would say it was 40 percent, okay?  Perhaps 40 percent of the population.
Speaker 1: And the rural part of Florida, is that--that's significantly African American too, right?
Speaker 2: That's significantly African American.  We had--Tallahassee did have plantations; In fact, in this area, which is thirty miles from Georgia, there were many plantations, okay?  I'd say maybe close to hundred, I'm not sure; and Quincy [Florida] was a--the business there, the main source of the economy was tobacco in Quincy, and Quincy is fourteen miles away from here.
Speaker 1: And when you mean plantations, you mean really big agricultural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, areas, yes, yes.  Cotton--cotton plantations--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm, okay.
Speaker 2: --and this was--many of these plantations still ex--not exist, but many are--open up for museums and things, but this was an area of cotton and this was, I guess, during the middle 1800s, middle 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So when you growing up then, did you experience--you said your experience during segregation was mostly positive in the black community, but did you ever have to encounter the white community (unclear)?.
Speaker 2: No, it was just a--it was just a fact of life that--seats were segregated on the bus, okay?  And there were various African American communities but I don't remember experiencing any adverse experience as a result of my color, okay?  It was segregated; we knew there were white people, we would see them when we would go to town, okay?  But as a child, we--my parents [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams and Robert Leslie Williams]--my mother, my parents were able to shop at all of the regular shops, there were restaurants that we couldn't visit, okay?  We had our own restaurants, okay?  But I didn't have any negative experience relative to racial issues as a child growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So would you say you lived in sort of an insulated community?
Speaker 2: I think it was very insulated, very--but yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28770
Speaker 1: How has it [Tallahassee, Florida] changed today--since you've been here?
Speaker 2: I think that it began to transition with the bus boycott, and I think that the bus boycott was a necessary change but it did not generate any real violence.  There were citizens across the track that were assisting the African Americans in the believe--who believed that the state of affairs are not fair, and many were the bankers; two of the bankers assisted by providing support in many ways for Reverend C.K. Steele [preacher and civil rights activist] who was the leader of the boycott and civil rights activities here.  And I guess because it was--I don't know why, but the governors--many of--the governor at that time, I can't remember his name but he really did not want, I guess, any negative history associated to his time so it was--I won't say it was a peaceful transition because there was a resistance, okay?  But it was a non-violent transition to integration here in Tallahassee.  When we finally integrated the schools, it happened I guess around 1967 in the schools--1966 when the schools began to integrate.
Speaker 1: Did integration affect the black business community?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of the African American grocery stores, the gas stations that we grew up with no longer exist.  The Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [FAMU] Hospital provided medical services during the segregation for all of north Florida and probably African Americans throughout Florida, and you may get a--you may be able to see it before you leave; now, it serves as the administrative building, and so I think it was in the early '60s [1960s] that the hospital closed because now the hospital in Tallahassee was now integrated and so this sort of ushered in the closing of FAMU's hospital.  But yes, so we don't really have--we have a few of the businesses, small businesses that existed during the segregation period but I would say 95 to 99 percent of them are now closed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We do have African Americans that own businesses, but they are not the businesses of the 50s [1950s] and 60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay; businesses that focus on essential needs like gasoline, food and--.
Story_ID: 28771
Speaker 1: Now you started school here on campus [Florida Agricultural and Technical University, Tallahassee, Florida], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, at--I started as--in nursery school at N.B. Young, which it was named I think after one of the presidents of university and N.B. Young was one of the dormitories, and in the basement of that dormitory was the nursery school, and then the elementary school was named Lucy Moton and then there was FAMU High School--Junior High School, FAMU High School.
Speaker 1: I just wanna go through 'em one at a time now.  Now Lucy Moton is named for--is this the--a relative of Robert Russa Moton [African American educator and author]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that she was from Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] and I don't most of her history but I do know that there was a Lucy Moton who was famous in African American history and I think it's the very same lady.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you like school?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed going to school; I can't say that I enjoyed studying, but I enjoyed school life and the football games, I enjoyed growing up on the--in the shadow of the university there, so we had access to theater and many of the guests that came to the university, we had access to them.  So my school days were very enjoyable; I sang in the choir but I think that I became studious when I went to college, but in high school I was just enjoying high school life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28772
Speaker 1: We were talking about, you know, going to school, and you said that it was exciting living on a college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] campus--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with a lot of activities, but when you were in grade school, did you have a favorite teacher at all?
Speaker 2: In grade school did I have a favorite teacher?  I think my first grade teacher might have been my fondest teacher.  Mrs. Fare (ph.) was her name, and I think that because life was just a happy, good life at that particular time, that I enjoyed first grade.
Speaker 1: Any other teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: Well yes, my second grade teacher was Mrs. Seabrooks (ph.) and she was a neighbor; my third grade teacher was Mrs. Miles (ph.) and her--she was also living on a--in a community called Ellen [ph.] Subdivision which borders the university, and my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Weber, became a very good friend of mine because we were both in the Tallahassee [Florida] Spelman College Alumni Association.  Mrs. Wright was my fifth grade teacher; she was also a neighbor.  I lived up the street so my parents [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams and Robert Leslie Williams] had all of the grades covered, I mean we couldn't--anything that happened, my mother was able to find out about what would happen at school because of my neighbors.  Mrs. Fields was my sixth grade teacher and she also lived in one of the communities that bordered the university.  One of my favorite teachers I guess was Mrs.--Dr. Sherman, Mabel Sherman, because she was the music teacher and I enjoyed choir; I enjoyed being in the music choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28773
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  Were you tending toward mathematics in those days at all?
Speaker 2: No, I was enjoying friends; I was not aspiring my future.  I was enjoying Girl Scouts and I think I was very dependent; I think that my brother [Ronald Leslie Williams] was always disciplining me or looking out for me, and so I felt rather sheltered, didn't have to--a dependent person, depending on my brother to lead the way for me, at least that's what he tells me (laughter), so--but in high school I think that--and in--I think that it was thought that I would be a music teacher because of my piano lessons.  As a matter of fact, I did graduate and go on to college and major in music as well as mathematics.  But I think that my interest and my--not interest but my ability in math was discovered maybe during my junior and senior years, based on statewide exams.
Speaker 1: This was when you were a senior in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think that as a youth, I was aspiring to be a music teacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was Sunday school teacher, I mean pianist for the summer--for the Sunday school, and the Baptist Training Union, and from fifth grade through twelfth grade I was constantly taking music lessons--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, excuse me, from first grade through twelfth grade; I started music, I think, at the age of five.
Speaker 1: And mostly piano?
Speaker 2: Just piano, piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28774
Speaker 1: Who were some of the--you mentioned the guests coming to campus [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]; are there any memorable lectures that you remember of people coming to campus to talk or to perform?
Speaker 2: Well I hear stories about--during the segregated South when scientists or other scholars would come to Tallahassee [Florida] that they would live in our neighborhood because of the hotels were segregated, and George Washington Carver I think was a popular guest of one of our neighbors; one of our neighbors was the Mathisis (ph.) and he held a position in agriculture on the state level and also one of our neighbors was the famous Cannonball Adderley and his brother Nat Adderley [jazz musicians]; their parents were professors at the university and so--I don't think that they were born in Tallahassee, but they also lived in Tallahassee and they--their parents moved to our neighborhood at some point.  And so many artists came through.  I remember Nancy Wilson [jazz singer] coming to Tallahassee.  As far as the scholars are concerned, I think that--also some of my neighbors, older neighbors who were maybe the generation of--before my mother actually, were associates of W.E.B. Du Bois [sociologist, historian, civil rights activist], okay?  Whether he came to Tallahassee I don't know.  My church was a regular stop for Martin Luther King and a lot of the civil right activists nationally and would be in the pulpit on a regular basis.
Speaker 1: So at the time, did you have a sense of his status in the country?
Speaker 2: Martin Luth--yes I did.  I think that I was a teenager, okay, at that particular time.  Because of his close relationship with our pastor and Jesse Jackson [civil rights activist and Baptist minister], Martin Luther King and others would be regular visitors at the church, okay?  We had a high sense of, of that particular time of history, what was going that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28775
Speaker 1: Now--okay, so when you were in high school, it's in--when you're in your junior and senior year, people started to notice that you had exceptional talent for math?
Speaker 2: Talent for math, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was recognizable, okay?  I guess because of my performance on the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test], when it was time to go on to college.  My brother [Ronald Leslie Williams] was known to be very talented and scholarly but I was not known to be very scholarly; I guess my strength was in music, but when it was time to take those national exams and prepare for college is when I, I'll perform much better than was expected.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were your grades like before?
Speaker 2: I think I was a B student in high school, okay?  And I think I did well in math; I think that I enjoyed math in high school, I think that math was my favorite subject in high school.  As a matter of fact, my junior year and senior year, I had the opportunity to--during the summers, to study at Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] and I had an opportunity to study both mathematics in a summer program, as well as music, and I guess my mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams]--excuse me--wanted me to be a musician, so it seems as if her final decision is that I will go to the music programs as opposed to the mathematics programs, summer programs so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so it was my junior and senior year when my mathematical interests really grew and, and, and I considered it as an area to study if I--when I went on to graduate--to undergraduate school.
Speaker 1: What was the highest level of math offered at Florida A and M [FAMU] High School?
Speaker 2: I took algebra and geometry; we didn't have calculus so trigonometry, algebra and geometry were the courses that I took.
Speaker 1: Okay, so trigonometry is like the ceiling there--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so no calculus.  Now is there a math teacher that you were particularly aspired by?
Speaker 2: I was fond of Professor Willie Cook; he taught math at FAMU High and I think that he--I had him when he was a--still in college and he was interning, and then I think he went on to be a professor there, but he was my favorite and then in due time, he became an associate in the Department of Mathematics at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] in the university.  So he was very inspiring for me when I was in high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and today still remains a dear friend, we're still colleagues.
Speaker 1: All right.  When you were a senior in high school, did you have any sense that math could be a career?
Speaker 2: I had a sense that math could be a career; I also liked architecture because I had a cousin majoring in architecture at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia] and I can't say I really knew what all architecture was, but he would draw houses when he would come home and so I, I was inspired by, by my, my college cousin, okay?  But when I went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I couldn't decide whether I would be a math major or a music major, so I tried them both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28776
Speaker 1: Now, before we graduate you from high school, was there any special thing--anything special about high school graduation?
Speaker 2: Anything special about high school graduation? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Did you have--did you receive any special--
Speaker 2: An award?
Speaker 1: Inaudible response.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--I received awards but I do remember receiving one award as Outstanding Student, but I was probably ranked--out of the thirty-five [in Williams' graduating class], I was probably in the top 20 percent, so--of my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you received an award for Outstanding Student?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do remember receiving an award for Outstanding Student on Senior Day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this was based on your musicianship and your other activities?
Speaker 2: Perhaps, perhaps my rank in the, in the, in the school; I guess overall.  I--there was very talented students in our class and I was in the top 20, and I guess many of them received awards and this is the one that I received; it was just an overall good, good student award.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28777
Speaker 1: How did you decide on Spelman [College, Atlanta, Florida]?  Did you have counseling or did your parents [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams and Robert Leslie Williams] decide or what?
Speaker 2: Well, my closest friend was going to Spelman and we wanted to go to school together and so we both applied to Spelman.  Her--and we both applied to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and so when we both were accepted, we decided to go on to go to Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28778
Speaker 1: '68 [1968], the spring that you graduated was the same spring that Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: And what was--is there a story about that?
Speaker 2: Well we were very, very stunned because I do remember being in class when the announcement was broadcast throughout the, throughout the school, that he had been assassinated and so it was a very trying time for us and during that period, there were--during the time when he had the March on Washington, so many people in the community were very active and went to the march; I think that our pastor was on the program there.
Speaker 1: This is in 1963, right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You would have been twelve [years old], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you go?
Speaker 2: No, but this entire era, Tallahassee [Florida] was very civic conscious about what was going on, and when he was finally assassinated, I was a senior, I was a senior and all of Tallahassee mourned together his assassination.  And many people went up to the funeral because many were very close friends and close associates during the Civil Rights [Movement] with him, okay?  Bus-loads of people from Tallahassee went to the funeral.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I thought I'd ask about that from--that was in April and I guess you graduated in May?
Speaker 2: June.
Speaker 1: June?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28779
Speaker 1: Well did you work during the summer or did you do anything special in the summer before you went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.  As a child, I never worked; I guess the only work I had (laughter) was as a musician at the church, okay?  And that was more like training than it was work, okay?  But they did give me a little stipend but my summers were spent in summer schools, okay?  There I--in summer schools I learned things like to sew and crochet and things, but I never had a job while I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have a job while I was in college either.  To pay for my college, I went--scholarships and then loans but no, my first job was at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Really, after college?
Speaker 2: After college, after graduating with my master's [degree]; my very first job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about Spelman.  Was there good math instruction at Spelman?
Speaker 2: It was a very wonderful experience.  I had a teacher who was very strict which I appreciate very much today; her name was Shirley McBay and she was the chair of the math department and she was also my calculus teacher, and Spelman had very good teachers in mathematics.  I had Dr. Etta B.--Z. Falconer, who taught me my upper-level classes in mathematics, who succeeded Dr. McBay as chair of the department.  Dr. Falconer became a long-time friend and mentor throughout my career.  I had a few classes at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] because the two schools share a lot of the science courses; it was a very positive experience being a student at Spelman; a very good place to leave the home and grow and develop new values and experiences.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. McBay is--her name resonates throughout most of these interviews, and her husband is Dr. Henry McBay [on the chemistry faculty at Morehouse College].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Chemist.  So you had calculus from Dr. McBay and were there any other activities on camp--I mean did you--what about the music department, were you still in music?
Speaker 2: I, I, I dropped music as a major I think my sophomore year, and so my junior year I was a full-time math major and I didn't participate in any of the organizations on Spelman's campus; I enjoyed the arts, I enjoyed the theater and the activities in the arts that they had at all of the universities, but I think that I had to devote quite a bit of my time learning the mathematics and developing it to the level of the expectations of Spelman, so that's where I really became a studious person.
Story_ID: 28780
Speaker 1: What attracted you to mathematics?
Speaker 2: Well I think that mathematics was in the family because my mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams] taught mathematics and majored in mathematics, and I do remember during the summers being in some of her summer school classes where she was teaching mathematics, so I think that because--and my brother [Ronald Leslie Williams] always wanted to be an engineer so math and science were just a part of our lifestyles when it came to aspirations, and I guess my parents [mother and father, Robert Leslie Williams] did try to rear us with the conversation of what we would do as we--in our careers and so there was a lot of science and more science I guess, growing up.  But I think that mathematics--one thing I really appreciated about mathematics was the subjectivity.  When you're right, you can prove that you're right, okay?  So you can almost predict your grade because if you're guessing, you know, that's an error for--that's a margin of error, but if you can prove your results using the mathematical theory, then you know, you--it was not subjective.  So the objectivity of mathematics was something that strongly attracted me to mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned Dr. [Etta] Falconer and--now she was the department chair, right?
Speaker 2: She succeeded Dr. Shirley McBay--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so during the two--during the years I was there, I was under two chairs, and Dr. Etta Falconer was the chair of my junior and senior year as well as my mathematics professor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28781
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any extracurricular activities at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] like sororities and that sorta thing?
Speaker 2: No. The, the philosophy at Spelman at that time was that we were all sisterly; there were young ladies who did go out into the city and join city chapters but I didn't know of chapters on campus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's interesting; I didn't realize that Spelman did not encourage sororities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Sororities during the '60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now during the summer of your senior year, you participated in a program at the University of California, Berkeley, right?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: That was exciting 'cause you had a chance to meet Dr. David Blackwell [first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first black tenured faculty member at UC Berkeley].
Speaker 2: Yes, it was indeed very exciting.  It was very exciting to be on a large campus among mathematicians of whom I had heard through their books or through their subjects, I--to meet Dr. David Blackwell, to be taught by someone who just--I perceived to be a genius, I think his genius succeeded his reputation for me at that particular time.  So it was--he was very inspiring and motivating, and very--there were eighteen students in this program and what we did in this program was simply to take summer courses at University of California, Berkeley.  Now Dr. Blackwell himself also had some special courses that we attended, so we were enrolled in summer school and we took these courses that Dr. Blackwell taught.  So it was a very positive experience being around eighteen young African Americans that enjoyed mathematics.
Speaker 1: Who sponsored the program?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure; I can imagine perhaps the National Science Foundation [NSF] because they now sponsor thousands of programs of that nature, for many years now.  But I don't know who was the sponsor.
Speaker 1: Is it--did the African American Mathematical Association (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--National Association of Mathematicians.
Speaker 1: NAM, right; yeah NAM.
Speaker 2: I don't think that in '68 [1968] they were existing; I think that they were forming; they were forming.
Speaker 1: This is in '68 [1968] before you went to Spelman or your senior year in college?
Speaker 2: Oh, '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: Oh, '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: --so the National Association of Mathematicians was in existence at that time but I don't believe that they were, were sponsoring this program; I think that this program was sponsored either by the University of California, Berkeley or by one of the national agents, and perhaps the University of California, Berkeley.  I, I have a sense that they had a very diverse philosophy at that particular time about education.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: This is also the time of Sputnik [first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the USSR in 1957] and trying to enhance the sciences, the population of scientists and mathematicians at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28782
Speaker 1: So when you were--anything special about Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduation?
Speaker 2: Anything special about Spelman graduation?  It was a very--the entire Spelman experience was good because of the traditions, and so there were the traditions of Spelman's that we had.  We share our baccalaureate; they still have baccalaureate today and we shared it with Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and we had--our commencement was separate, in Sisters Chapel, and there were I think about 175 young ladies in my class at that particular time.  That was just a very special send-off, just beautiful; the ceremony was beautiful, very traditional Spelman, the alumni walking through the arch--the Alumnus Arch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28783
Speaker 1: So you had already been accepted to graduate school at this point?
Speaker 2: I had been accepted into graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I proceeded to the University of California Berkeley and--during the summer, but at the end of that summer, because of the distance from Florida and several factors, I felt that it was in my best interest to return and go to the University of Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So University of Florida; now had it been desegregated long when you started?
Speaker 2: No, I was the first African American graduate in the master's program in mathematics and it had not been integrated long, to my knowledge.  There were individuals from Tallahassee [Florida] that were in graduate school at that particular time in other areas, but I was, I was the first graduate in their master's program in mathematics so--there were three, three of us African Americans in my particular cohort at the University of Florida.
Speaker 1: Who were the other two, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Let's see, one's name was Roscoe McNealy [ph.], and I think that before he graduated, he was offered a job at the university; he was married with a family, and the other gentleman I can't remember his name but he was also a high school teacher; both of these were people who had careers and were--Roscoe was a veteran.  He went to university on a veteran scholarship or--as a result of the veteran.  But they were most--they were older than I, and the other gentleman was actually a school teacher.
Story_ID: 28784
Speaker 1: Okay, so now we're at University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], this is what, 1972?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So there were three other--two other black students in the department [of mathematics]?
Speaker 2: In the department, yes.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and you were pursuing a master's degree in mathematics?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics but I stopped at the master's program, and the one reason I stopped is that at the end of the--after receiving the master's [degree], I came home and was offered a job so I took it.  And--but I always wanted to go back and continue to get a Ph.D., which I did--several years later, but I spent two years at the University of Florida where I received a master's in mathematics.
Speaker 1: And the job you were offered was here at--
Speaker 2: As an instructor of mathematics.
Speaker 1: At Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: At Florida A and M University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First job in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--so were you anxious to get to work, I guess?
Speaker 2: I was excited to get to work; I guess my first teaching experience was as a teaching assistant at the University of Florida which was very good as an experience before becoming a teacher.  But I was very excited to teach at FAMU; I guess I knew many of the faculty at the university and I knew some of the faculty in the department.  One of my neighbors has always been one of my colleagues in mathematics and so I, I, I started--the summer that I graduated is the summer that I planned to go to Florida A and M to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about the math department of Florida A and M and then when you started in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Well, the math department was very large; we had a large number of mathematics majors.  We had--at some particular point, we had 200 math majors and--which was very large for a math department.  There were professors, both with the Ph.D., and many of the professors had their master's [degree] like me; we were serving as instructors.  We taught all of the--we taught all of the, as we still do, general courses; we teach every student that graduates from FAMU because mathematics is a required course.  Six hours of mathematics has always been required.  And because of my teaching at the University of Florida, I do believe that my first year I was teaching college algebra as well as calculus; I had taught calculus for architecture majors at the University of Florida and so I got to teach these sophomore-level classes as well as the freshman-level classes in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you teach?  Did you teach like two classes in succession (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I taught (simultaneous)--three classes every semester, which is the standard load for faculty then and now--then and now is teach three courses.  During the summer I didn't teach; they always had summer school but I was not teaching during the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--okay, it says here that you also served as--now this is some time later; this is over ten--so you taught at FAMU from '74 [1974] to '79 [1979], right? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, as an instructor; as an instructor, yes.
Story_ID: 28785
Speaker 1: And then I left FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to continue my Ph.D.--pursuit of my Ph.D. at the Univers--at Florida State [University, Tallahassee], which is right--close by, I didn't have to move, I didn't have to make any arrangements, and so after five years at FAMU, I went over to Florida State to continue the pursuit.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now when you were at Florida State, did you teach there?
Speaker 1: For the first few years, I did not teach; I was full-time student.  Teaching was a part of the requirement for the degree so before I graduated, I did teach algebra classes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.  And you also taught at--was that--
Speaker 1: Randolph-Macon Women's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, Randolph-Macon Women's College [Virginia], right.
Speaker 1: Yes I did, yes.  I went there before finishing my Ph.D. but I think I started working there after all of the research for the dissertation had been completed and I was writing, and so that was in '87 [1987] and so I went there for a year and had the opportunity to return to FAMU, so I took the opportunity and so in '88 [1988], the year that I did complete my dissertation and graduate, I was also in my first year back at FAMU, teaching.
Story_ID: 28786
Speaker 1: Now who was your Ph.D. advisor [at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. advisor is Professor Warren Nichols; he's a graduate of the University of Chicago [Illinois] and we both--all of his students were studying various aspects of Hopf algebras.  He had four students in the area of Hopf algebras.
Speaker 1: And tell us now--tell us the way a layman can understand it and also tell us the way a mathematician can appreciate it.  What is Hopf algebras?
Speaker 2: Well, Hopf algebras is an area of algebra named after a mathematician whose last name is Hopf [Heinz Hopf], and it is a set with dual algebraic structures and algebraic structure is a set with binary operations such as addition and multiplication, and so this is fundamental mathemat--algebraic structure.  But Hopf algebras is one in which it plays a dual role, okay?  It plays a role as a vector field, and then it plays the role as the operators on a vector field so in mathematics terminology, it plays the role of elements as well as functions on elements.  Now the application of Hopf algebras--it's an area of pure mathematics.  Mathematics is usually thought of in two ways, pure mathematics and applied mathematics.  Pure mathematics is the extension of known mathematics because as you are learning more about math or science, it always opens up new questions, and that's how the sciences and the mathematics grow.  As the result of solving new problems, new questions arise; some of these questions can be solved with the existing knowledge, but some of these questions also push the boundaries of knowledge and become conjectures that may take anywhere from one to 300 years, or even greater, to solve.  So my area of Hopf algebras is in the pure area of study.  Now the area of applied mathematics is very similar to pure mathematics; it's only that it is developed with a sense of physical application.  For example, solving global issues of energy or environment; these solutions are very quantitative, okay?  And so a lot of the mathematics is not designed to solve these problems but are directed, okay, applied to solve these problems.  So you're taking pure mathematics which was derived as a result of expanding the knowledge of mathematics; the applied mathematician will try to use this mathematics as well as develop net--new mathematics to understand the molecular system, the economic system, the physical system, the environment, so--so it's difficult to convince anyone that Hopf algebras has any real world applications to--it is the applied mathematician who will be able to take the Hopf algebras, okay, and see that it could be a model for some real world application, to solve some--a model to solve a real world application.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess a--an example is that in physics, some Brownian motions started off with physics, mathematicians--pure mathematicians tried to generalize it, then applied mathematicians found out that stock markets satisfied the same type of model, and the applied mathematicians ended up making financial derivatives from the mathematics of physics and pure mathematics, and now financial derivatives is a part of economic issues today, global issues.  So we sort of think that many of the solutions will be successful sometimes based on the known physics and mathematics, okay?  To, to what extent you can solve real world problems precisely or exact.
Story_ID: 28787
Speaker 1: You were telling me about David Hilbert and his association to your dissertation.
Speaker 2: Well, David Hilbert was a German mathematician and he is a very famous German mathematician in the area of algebra.  During (unclear) his area, mathematicians and scientists alike contributed to so many areas and developed so many areas of mathematician--mathematics.  Now, my association with David Hilbert is that in one of his presentations perhaps at a conference, he introduced ten problems that were, were very interesting problems to work on in mathematics.  Well these ten problems ultimately served to--as the direction for which a lot of mathematics took as a result of trying to address these ten problems.
Speaker 1: Now Hilbert's a German, right?  So he was a German, a Jewish German (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't know whether he was a Jew, but he had a student, Emmy (ph.) Nerva (ph.), that I think was a Jew.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--She came over after the war, right? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--She came over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--after World War II.
Speaker 2: Right, and she ultimately became a professor of--at Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] and she maybe started the Ph.D. program there, I'm not quite sure.  I think that they--it is a women's college that has a Ph.D. program in mathematics, and she contributed quite a bit of algebra--mathematics to the area of algebra, and what Hilbert did was, at the time that she was a young professor in Germany, she was not able to teach in the German universities and so Hilbert made it possible for her to teach under his professorship, okay?  But later on, she moved to the United States and became a professor here.  Now Hilbert is special to me because many of--not only did I inherit his problems, but a lot of--my major professor [Warren Nichols] is a student of major professors that lead back to students of Hilbert, so one of his, one of his students taught I think with Vin (ph.) Verdon (ph.), I'm not quite sure, but eventually Coplansky (ph.), Nichols, and then I was a student of Nichols, so we say that I am in his lineage.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28788
Speaker 1: You're actually written into the lineage for your--how did you put it?  You said you came up with a partial solution--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to one of the ten problems--
Speaker 2: --problems in Hopf algebras, yes.
Speaker 1: --and this had to do with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Finite Dimensional Hopf algebras.  So in mathematics, there are a lot of structures or constructs that have been proven to exist but as far as finding examples of such so that they can be used to solve other problems so--my problem was to actually construct these finite dimensional Hopf algebras.  Many of the infinite ones were known, and many special examples were known, and I was interested in categorizing them all, which is a very monumental problem which is probably still going on now, to be able to describe what all Hopf algebras--their structure.
Speaker 1: So no one's every really done that yet.
Speaker 2: No, it's, it's a, it, it's a large field, it's a large field that has lots of applications in the area of pure mathematics, okay?  And knowing what these--we know the properties of them, but to say exhibit a particular Hopf algebra with a desired set of properties is not available at this particular time; people are still trying to construct families and categories of Hopf algebras.  This is one of the ways that mathematics grows in general because there are several major areas of mathematics, algebra being one, analysis being one, okay?  And this is how mathematics is developed in these various areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it if you worked on finite dimensional Hopf algebras, that there is something called infinite dimensional [Hopf algebras].
Speaker 2: Yes.  They are more well-known.  Or examples--the first examples of Hopf algebras were probably infinite dimensional Hopf algebras.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28789
Speaker 1: So these are--this is pure math, what we were discussing there, pure math.  Now has there been any, I guess practical or engineering use of Hopf algebras to this point?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of any, I would imagine that there is an intersection of theory with things like biology, okay?  Molecular vibration energy in physics; and so there may be applications forthcoming when it comes to what is known as quantum mechanics and molecular vibrations.
Speaker 1: So physicists, at some juncture, might be able to use--
Speaker 2: Would be interested in Hopf algebras, yes. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Hopf algebras, okay.  Now I think it--would it be true to the saying, I guess it's true--I would just think it's true (unclear) any mathematical I guess form will have a use, all depending on what your problem is, I guess.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  This reminds me of the mathematicians of antiquity, Plato [Greek philosopher], and the Platonic solids and polyhedron, okay?  Well that was what?  400 B.C. or maybe 500 B.C.?  However, these same polyhedra that he--Plato categorized are now used as models of molecules, to talk about how molecules behave, how molecules are attached to a polygon, to describe its movements and its behaviors, so at the time that Plato categorized the platonic solids, atoms were not known, molecules were not known, but this mathematics--this is just one example of how the presence of mathematics can be explored to, to investigate current issues on current problems.
Speaker 1: I know it's well known that Isaac Newton [English physicist and mathematician] invented calculus basically to solve certain problems in physics.
Speaker 2: Yes, Newton is known for his laws of gravity, okay?  And I think that [Johannes] Kepler [german mathematician, astronomer and astrologer], who--observed the, the, the movement of the planets and the sun, and he--Kepler, Kepler made his observations and conjectures and conclusions based on empirical data, and Newton used calculus to prove them theoretically.  And so Newton is known as one of the fathers of calculus, and the other one is [Gottfried Wilhelm von] Leibniz [German mathematician and philosopher], okay?  But I think that Newton is probably known for his contributions in physics, astronomy, calculus, so he's one of the great mathematicians of all times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28790
Speaker 1: So, now your advisor, Warren Douglas Nichols and yourself presented your partial solution at various conferences--
Speaker 2: Probably so; I have made presentations--I know I made a presentation early on when I graduated, but Professor Nichols has continued on to present results from four of the students that I know and one of his--some of his present results bear his name with some of his students, and so he continued on to do well-known Hopf algebras; he was well-respected and well-known among the Hopf algebraists and wrote many articles.  When I came to Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] where there is an undergraduate department, I found it very challenging to continue the research in Hopf algebras but I felt an inspiration to take students that I thought were very talented and motivate them to get their Ph.D. in mathematics, and so my charge--personal charge changed when I came to work here because the demands on doing research were not necessarily compatible with my job description, which was to educate undergraduate students, and so I found both to be very rewarding. As a result, I really enjoyed my experience as a researcher, I really wanted to continue, but when I found myself teaching in undergraduate institutions, I also found great pleasure in trying to encourage students that mathematics is a good field.
Story_ID: 28791
Speaker 1: So you came back to Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in '88 [1988]?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were you tempted to go anywhere else to become more of a research mathematician?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  What I did do is continue to take courses and seminars at Florida State University [Tallahassee], all the way up to the time that I became chairperson of the department; so every semester or almost every semester after teaching here, I continued to go to Florida State to participate in the research seminars and, and so--but no, I didn't pursue research at the graduate level; I did pursue research projects for my students because I wanted to use research projects for my students as a motivation to go on to get the Ph.D. in mathematics, okay?  And I had programs for research projects for students, and many of the students came from other schools and I wanted to do projects that they were interested in. Sometimes I would ask a student "What would you like to do research in?"  It meant that both of us would have to learn that subject which, you know--if it had been in biology, we both had to learn the biology; if it had been in economics, we both had to learn the economics, even though we had faculty members that would collaborate with us on these projects for the students.  And so that's the direction that my research took, and this is more of applied mathematics to economics, to chemistry, physics, and biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We've been hearing in the course of these interviews that chemistry, biology are becoming increasingly computational.
Speaker 2: They are, yes.  I worked on a seminar for several years now, many years, with a chemist.  And the book that we read is a very advanced mathematics and it, it's an application of the mathematics; not Hopf algebras but it's mathematics of the area of algebra which is more general, called representation theory.  So Hopf algebras is a special area of representation theory; representation theory is used quite a bit by researchers in physics as well as chemistry, okay?  So--
Speaker 1: So we're getting close to (laughter) maybe close to a practical use for Hopf algebras?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because I haven't been keeping up with the research because in order to do so, you have to devote a lot of time, it may be applications to physics and chemistry at this particular time using Hopf algebra techniques.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28792
Speaker 1: All right. So now as you said, you've been involved, and you're known for finding funding for programs that encourage undergraduates to pursue higher degrees in math.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are some of the first programs you started and--?
Speaker 2: My very first funding award was titled Young Scholars, and--Young Scholars Program, and the title of the program was Mathematical Applications to the Social Sciences.  This, this program was for two summers; the first summer, we had thirty students that were talented--I think junior high school students, and most of them came from Florida; one or two came from other states, and they took courses or seminars in computer science, mathematics, but their charge was to develop research projects.  They looked in areas of--they looked in areas of science, chemistry, physics, and they developed actually science fair projects.  But they were based on, they were based on social issues like the depletion of oil or over-population, you know, or better (unclear) foods, okay?  So they were based on current issues.  So the program the first year had thirty students, and the hallmark of that program is when the governor of Florida invited those young students up to present their science fair projects at the State Capitol.
Speaker 1: This is in what year? When would this be? (unclear)
Speaker 2: This may have been around 1997, 1997.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28793
Speaker 1: Okay, so your first program, the Young Scholars Program at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida]--this is in--I'm sorry, this was at--
Speaker 2: Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee](simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Florida A and M, yeah.  Okay, yeah; and that's in 1997?
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe it was 1997.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You didn't do anything in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Well, I continued seeking funding for programs all the way up to maybe 2005 or 2008.  As a matter of fact, in 2011, I sponsored as a subcontract from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] a program called Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) for Women, so it was a span of a decade or so, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess something every summer there's an interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduates, Alliance for the Production of African American Ph.D.s in the Mathematical Sciences [Alliance].  What's the success been like?  Have you been able to shepherd more undergraduates to, you know, higher degrees than that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that FAMU has had success in our students going on to receive Ph.D.s in mathematics; the one I am proud of is Jose Diaz Alban (ph.), who received his Ph.D. from the Courant Institute [of Mathematical Sciences] in New York City, and which has the reputation, I believe, as being the best applied mathematics school in the nation; that's the way I look at it; and so--but yes, we've had success in graduating Ph.D.s.  Now the Alliance was founded at FAMU and I served as one of the co-founders with a professor from the University of Iowa [Ames, Iowa] and it has evolved into a national effort, okay, consisting of maybe--I would say twenty graduate programs and many, many undergraduates programs; it's emphasis is now--originally for African Americans to get their Ph.D., but now it's for any student who desires to get a Ph.D. will get the correct amount of support, okay--services; and I guess its main audience would be Hispanic students as well as African American students, but all students now participate in what is known as the National Alliance for Doctorial Programs in the Mathematical Sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, now this is with Dr. Kutzko?
Speaker 2: Yes, Dr. Philip Kutzko.
Speaker 1: At the University of Iowa?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 28794
Speaker 1: Now tell us now, do you have a philosophy of teaching math?
Speaker 2: Yes I do have a philosophy of teaching math.  I think that all students have very similar capabilities of learning mathematics; I think that one of the challenges that mathematics as a discipline face is that the citizens don't see how mathematics fits into careers.  When you're looking at television, you don't see--you see lawyers and you see doctors, but you don't see physicists or you don't see mathematicians, so it's not a mainstream area for a career; however, we hear--on the other side of the conversation, we hear that we need more mathematicians and we need more scientists to solve the global issues that we are facing, okay?  Or we just need more science and mathematicians to support the, the high technology society in which we live, okay?  And so I guess it falls on university professors to increase the pipeline for mathematics.  And so my philosophy is that, and my philosophy is based on my experience, is that students who we would ordinarily for one reason or another not be at risk of not even graduating, or would not be good candidates as mathematicians, I have learned that anyone who is given the motivation or exposure, okay, can be inspired to be very good mathematicians.  We come with different levels of background, okay?  For example, some people come from backgrounds where you take algebra because you have to take algebra to get a high school degree, and you never use algebra one day after taking algebra.  The only mathematics that you may use will be to balance a check book and we don't balance check books (laughter); it's not the same requirement.
Speaker 1: We don't do it often enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.  However, our sense of mathematics could help us to manage our money better, okay?  And to have quality lives because we're able to--our home economics can be tremendously approved--improved to be understood interest better--interest rates better, and the--so life could--mathematics could improve our life when it comes to home economics.  So I've run into students who are at risk of not even getting a degree and they have very good quantitative analytic skills once someone invests their time into developing these skills.  My philosophy is that math and science is going to be very crucial for our solving the problems that we have in the environment--world hunger, health, energy sources, global warming; the fundamental research for solving these problems will be very heavily mathematics and science.  So we need to develop more scientists and mathematicians, and for the students that I serve, I want to make sure that I'm able to reach them regardless to their background.  The challenge in teaching at Florida A and M University [FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida] is that any class you will have students that have excellent backgrounds, and you have students who have very weak backgrounds, but I try to teach in a manner that addresses the problems or the, the needs of the students; I like to give challenging student--problems so that students can--all students can understand the value of mathematics.
Story_ID: 28795
Speaker 1: Have you been able to, I guess, bring students up to speed, I mean, is it something that's easy to do or--
Speaker 2: It's not easy to do and it takes a lot of time but it's very doable.  Students who you bring up to speed, and it happens all the time, are the students that are taught how to study mathematics, okay?  If you come up with a systematic set of activities for studying math--when I was a student, it was 'practice makes perfect', okay?  You have to practice math, you have to read the book.  How do you read a book?  Well, there are various strategies of reading a math book; it's just not the same as reading a novel from cover to cover; you have to memorize definitions, you have to learn the rules and the tools, you have to look at examples; so breaking up your study time into various different activities and at the end of the day pulling them together by reading the book--so, for students who are serious about learning mathematics, and many of them are serious if they feel that they have a real opportunity to learn; so I see--I think on a class-by-class, students who come in with weak backgrounds who invest the time that they need, I see them performing with value added, A or B; I've seen--I have had students with an F average in math graduate their senior year with As; part of the problem is stigmas--removing stigmas, okay?  Part of the problem is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Stigmas in what?  About math itself, or--
Speaker 2: Well, you can do that.  You're poor, you're from a--you're in a poor background, you're not--you're, you're, you're challenged educationally, and you're behind.  Well, as a teacher, if they seek you out, they--if a student seeks me out and wants me to address their issues and motivate them.  I'm a teacher who's at work from eight o'clock to five o'clock, okay?  Many times, just mentoring students, encouraging students, okay, to not give up.  And I try to design my classes so that you don't give up; I mean many math classes students just give up hope and just drop, okay, after a week, after a month, and I try to design the classes so that there is always extra credit, there is always extra work, there is always something you can do that you have a chance, that if you do these activities, you can continue on and you always have a chance to pass a class; just don't let the students drop out.
Speaker 1: Now I read here too, that you conduct frequent quizzes and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Quizzes to develop a discipline of studying, reading, visiting the subject on a regular basis.  I quiz weekly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about these open book tests?
Speaker 2: To make sure the student--I like to give open book tests for several reasons.  To make sure that the students visit a book, okay?  Many of them have books, many of them haven't learned the value of purchasing books from the diverse population I serve.  So an open books class will test--students will bring the books and they will begin reading and I will see them reading and they will, I think they benefit from being required to read this book.  If I read this book during this particular time and solve problems, this--I think is, I think it is an exercise to encourage students to read their books--open book tests.  You're gonna get credit for reading your book today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--now you use, I understand, an axiomatic approach to teaching.  Explain what you do.
Speaker 2: Well, there are a lot of ways to teach mathematics.  Many times, in high school, you learn mathematics by example.  A teacher will solve a problem and solve several problems using the same method and you learn by example and this is very good.  As time goes by and the mathematics becomes more advanced, you don't have that common feature from problem to problem but what you do have is, for example, in trigonometry--trigonometry is a set of definitions, a set of rules like sine square plus cosine squared equals one; sine squared of x plus cosine squared of x equals one; so the axiomatic approach concentrates what are the rules?  What are the theorems?  What are the definitions and how do you put them together?  You can view them as pictures of pieces of a puzzle, a puzzle that can give you many images based on the way you put them together.  But they are the rules and tools; they are your--in mathematics, the axiomatic approach is equivalent to, in English, grammar, okay?  Subject verb agreement, okay?  Participles.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So it's less on teaching by examples but learning the rules and tools and creating your own solutions.  I love to emphasize the fact that a solution is never unique; many people will solve problems different, based on the theorems that they use but the answer is the thing that is unique.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28796
Speaker 1: Does FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] have a large, I guess, math and science--what proportion of the school is devoted to math and science?
Speaker 2: FAMU has a large math and science population.  I think that 25 percent of the students are in engineering, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, engineering and math, so that would be 3,000 students; that would be--they have a large percentage.  It may be even larger; it may be close to a third of the students, 33 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So are you--now you've been teaching now for how many years?
Speaker 2: I started as an instructor in 1974 and--either as a teaching assistant or as a teacher, since 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you heading toward retirement now, or are you--
Speaker 2: I qualify.
Speaker 1: But you're not--
Speaker 2: Yes, I have reached the criteria; I satisfy the criteria for retirement in years of service.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you're not thinking about it right now?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there--do we have a good supply of young math teachers coming up?
Speaker 2: I hope so, I'm very encouraged by the students at FAMU that major in mathematics; the only thing is that they enjoy mathematics while they're at FAMU, but graduate school is a different type of educational system and many of them get discouraged and--when they get to graduate school where they--at FAMU they may have been the best math majors in the class, when they go to graduate school they are average or they're in classes with international students and so the challenge is greater, but if we can just keep those set--we are educated, if we can just keep 'em--to get a terminal degree or to even go into the high schools and encourage students to teach--study mathematics and--or at least love mathematics or remove the fear of anxiety about mathematics.
Story_ID: 28797
Speaker 1: Now in that regard too, you're the director of a program called Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education for Women or EDGE?
Speaker 2: I sponsored this.  The director when I sponsored it was Sylvia Bozeman [also a HistoryMaker] at Spelman College [Atlanta, Florida], and a professor at Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], so let me get back to her--Rhonda Hughes, Rhonda Hughes at Bryn Mawr; they were both chairs of the math department at the time, of the two female schools; they became very close friends and they developed this program enhancing--graduate school for women because their students both share common challenges as they went on to graduate school, and so they developed this program that rotates throughout the nation for women and so in 2011, FAMU sponsored this program here.
Speaker 1: So are the numbers going up for women (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, that program has been extremely successful; I would say a 90 percent successful rate of students in that program are receiving their--are going on to graduate school and receiving their Ph.D. [degree].  What the program does is it gives you a capstone course, smash course in two basic courses for graduate school, and then it gives you an introduction on the graduate levels--capstone, senior and then introduction to graduate level on two of the core courses for graduate school, as well as continued support and mentoring through the life of their graduate experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I don't know (unclear) I get the impression that there are a lot more maybe black women mathematicians than there are, I don't know, but I (unclear) you know, mathematicians at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], and they always talk about Shirley McBay [mathematics faculty at Spelman College] and then there's you, and there's maybe some others.  How are black women represented on the campuses of historical black colleges and universities [HBCUs]?
Speaker 2: I think that we are represented very well.  I think that there may be more black Ph.D. females; I think, okay?  And they are disseminated throughout both major universities as well as HBCUs, and so there is a strong presence of African American females in academia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28798
Speaker 1: Who would you say today is a pre-eminent African American mathematician?
Speaker 2: David Blackwell [first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first black tenured faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley].  I mean beginning from--wait, of course he's the late David Blackwell; but our leaders today are Sylvia Bozeman [also a HistoryMaker], Shirley McBay, are certainly two of the leaders; there is Dawn Lott at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] who has a strong presence in the mathematical world, particular as it pertains to students of color--women of color, okay?  There is a young lady--mathematician in California, her name is Tanya Moore; she has been sponsoring the Infinite Possibilities Conference [IPC] which is a mathematical conference for women; she and a cohort of female mathematicians of all diversity because this is a diverse group of mathematics professors on all levels; students, graduate students, undergraduate students, professors in the academy, professors in research, in industry--women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28799
Speaker 1: Now you're a member of NAM, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the National Association of Mathematicians.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: African American organization?
Speaker 2: Well it's interest is--originated in serving African American issues and making--providing the support needed for African Americans to sustain and maintain their careers in, in mathematics.  But it continues now and it's open to membership for anyone who wants to be a member of the National Association.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but you've served on some--the NSF [National Science Foundation] panels, right?  Haven't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've served on NSF panels in evaluating applications for programs and I have served on panels of other organizations in which I speak of the assistance that the National Science Foundation has given me through funding programs, okay?  Making it possible for programs of Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in general, and my programs in particular; I like to give them credit.  I've had the success with the National Science Foundation; I've had grants with the [U.S.] Department of Education [DOE], okay?  But I usually apply to the National Science Foundation programs.
Speaker 1: But they are your major funding source for the kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --activities that you (unclear) in terms of encouraging (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Training students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--undergraduate students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--training undergraduate students is the way I think of the programs that I've had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28800
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything that you've done in your career to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm glad that I trained in piano, that's my hobby to learn how to play the way I used to (laughter), so that's my leisure.  But I'm very satisfied with my career in mathematics and I enjoy my work very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, and once again, when you look back over everything you've done, what today are you the most proud of?
Speaker 2: I guess I'm most proud of opportunities that I have assisted in giving undergraduate--very talented undergraduate students opportunities that were limited to them in the areas of mathematics.  I wanted to be a researcher, I ended up in a undergraduate program, and I found a lot of pleasure in serving the needs of undergraduate programs, so I guess building new African American Ph.D.s and encouraging, or trying to increase the pipeline of African Americans for the technology workforce--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --increase the diversity of the technology workforce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28801
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today, in general?
Speaker 2: My hopes are that our institutions of higher learning sometimes are being challenged, our historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs]; I feel that they have been the, the institutions that have provided the success that we, as an African American people, have succeeded--provided our--assisted in our success, as well as our churches--our churches and our historically black colleges and universities are the two institutions that I view have been more valuable to our participation.  Our HBCUs are challenged financially, a lot of small schools are challenged, and I hope that our community will keep them and maintain them and--because I feel that there is a great need to give the type of nurturing and mentoring that these schools provide, okay?  And I think that they succeed in providing the type of nurturing and mentoring.  So that's my hope, that these schools will continue to serve their students, and all students who need, in the future.
Story_ID: 28802
Speaker 1: All right, the second part of the question was concerns for the black community.
Speaker 2: My concern is that the education in general seems to be a challenge for all, all of the population and, and I think that education is important for a country to--in a world in which we have a high technology world, and I think that education is important for us to preserve our world because we are creating global issues that we need to address and solve if we're gonna sustain the world, okay?  Environmental issues that require a great educational knowledge, energy and issues, health and issues, world hunger, okay?  Ethics, ethics, economy.  All of these is--are global issues that require advanced education and so I hope that people of color will be participants in solving these problems because a lot of these problems affect them--hunger, health, economy, okay?  And so it is my hope that--my concern is the, the educational system in general, and that--are we educating and training students to solve the issues that they will inherit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any specific hopes in this area for FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm hoping that FAMU will continue to grow and serve the culture that it does; it is a center of arts, entertainment, science, okay?  It is a large institution that attracts students globally, okay?  And it is a school that has an open door policy so that--and that is a challenge because our motto is "excellence with caring," okay?  And so we want to educate as many people as possible through our open door policy and, and so that is our hope, that FAMU will continue on to sustain in the future.  I would like for it to have Ph.D.s in all of the scientists; I, I feel like there are certain issues that pertain to certain parts of the population that FAMU is in a good position to address, okay?  Okay?  And so my hope is that--I'm very proud of what they have done; they have a very national reputation in various aspects of pharmacy, their pharmacy school, their Ph.D. physics--in physics, their music department, their theater; all excellent programs.  All--an excellent place for young people to grow and become educated.  And so I'm just hoping that FAMU will continue on in the future--satisfying its mission, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28803
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever marry or have children?
Speaker 2: I never married, I never had children.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We always ask people about their family, so your family here at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] basically is an extended family of--
Speaker 2: My students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) I'm guessing a very close family too, over the years, considering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, I, I keep in touch with my students, I try to--many of my students who are in graduate programs I meet them at conferences; I met a few just this semester, last semester at Purdue [University, Indiana] and I keep in contact with them.  Students who are working for their preliminary exams on their Ph.D., I try to keep in contact with them and mentor them along that path. And so I like to--I love doing research projects from students because of how much I learn from students, and I love to be able to share my mathematical backgrounds with them.  But especially when it comes to economics, and when it comes to welfare economics, an area that--for which a lot of research is needed.  I think that the greatest experts in economics, in certain aspects of economics, are the students; no one can describe the economical situations better than them.  And what I can provide them are the tools, the quantitative tools that they can use to address the questions or the problems that they can well articulate.  I learn quite a bit from my students, and I hope that I'm able to share my knowledge in a way that benefits them through my research projects.
Speaker 1: Now is there much in regards to social sciences, do you interact, I guess, in a meaningful way, with the social science departments in terms of statistics and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I would like to think that I am doing--I've been, I've been asked to provide a research study on a concern and issue that has nothing to do about mathematics, it has to do--well, it is--it has nothing to do about mathematicians or scientists; it's a group of, I guess--social scientists have asked me to assist them in a particular study so I'm currently working with some social scientists to collect data and to see what are the findings of some things that they are concerned, so yes I do.  I have worked in agriculture, I taught statistics in the College of Agriculture and I've enjoyed that because I now have a great appreciation for agriculture, and so I've worked in agriculture.  I work with economics professor on a regular basis; we meet and we study economics, particularly women's issues in economics and welfare issues.  I'm interested in poverty and poverty traps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28804
Speaker 1: Now is there anything we have not discussed I need to ask you before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you; you've been very patient.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I would be-I'd like to be remembered as a giver of her time and service, someone who was generous of all of her resources, someone who was caring, okay, approachable, okay?  A human touch, a common touch, loved the Lord, loved students, loved mathematics, loved life and all of its challenges.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you so much.
Story_ID: 28805
Speaker 1: Here we have students who participated in one of our grants.  These students were members of what was known as the FAMU UP, Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida] Undergraduate Program that was sponsored by the university--by the National Science Foundation [NSF], and here they are traveling to a conference at Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama], a science--an undergraduate math and science conference.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: I would say 19--2005, approximately 2005.
Speaker 2: These are undergraduate and faculty and graduate research presenters, this is at American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto, California.  These--they are participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduate and Faculty.  I co-coordinate this with along with the American Institute of Mathematics and so Ph.D. researchers are sharing their research topics with these undergraduate faculty so that they can carry them back to their students and share their research that's going on in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Here are members of the Alliance for the Production of African American Ph.D.s in Mathematics.  We have a student on the far left and we have a faculty member on the far left, Dr. Eva C. Wonton (ph.).  The co-coordinators are--I mean the co-founders are Roselyn Williams and Dr. Phil Kutzko.
Speaker 2: Unclear.
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is my immediate family; this is my mother [Minnie Lucile Wynn Williams], my brother [Ronald Leslie Williams], and my cousin which we have reared from a child, Desmond Michael John Seats (ph.), okay?  It's my aunt's grandson.
Speaker 2: Here is a picture of eighteen students; there were eighteen students to go to study at the University of California, Berkeley under the directions of David Blackwell so there is a group picture, and here we have David Blackwell [first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first black tenured faculty member at UC Berkeley], and there's me. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Unclear question.
Speaker 2: 1971, summer of 1971, okay?  I was there twice, once in this program and once beginning graduate school.
Speaker 1: This is my brother and me, Ronald Leslie Williams and Roselyn Williams. This is our father, Robert Leslie Williams, okay? This is our mother, Minnie Lucile Williams. That's Roselyn Williams, that's me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Again, this is faculty--undergraduate and graduate faculty at the Research Experience for Undergraduate Faculty, hosted by the American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto, California.
Speaker 1: These are participants in my very first grant, the Young Scholars Program; these high school students created science fair projects and here they are with the Governor of Florida.  The late Walton Charles invited the students to present a science fair at the State Capitol, okay?
Speaker 2: This is my grandmother, my paternal grandmother Ola Williams. This is my maternal grandfather George Henderson Wynn.
Speaker 1: This is my second grant activity.  These are young scholar students, eleventh graders; we are at Kennedy Space Center [Cape Canaveral, Florida] where they are witnessing the launch of a Space Shuttle.  You can see where the shuttle was once, okay?
Speaker 2: Unclear.
Speaker 1: In 2011, we--FAMU hosted these students; these are eighteen young ladies who have been accepted into Ph.D. programs around the nation, the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education [EDGE] for Women.
Speaker 2: This is a poster that was at the University of--at Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa] announcing a talk that I was giving, okay?
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the graduating class of 2009 and my grandmother is on the first row, far right.
Speaker 2: Right here.
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is the Rabbit Foots Minstrel Company around 1900--between 1900 and 1905, and my grandfather [Louis Williams] is (inaudible) [points]
Speaker 2: Off-camera discussion.
Speaker 1: So this is a poster of The Rabbit Foot Minstrels, it shows the tent and some of the buses, and members of the chorus girls that participated; its founder is Pat Chappelle.
Speaker 2: Is that Pat Chappelle there in the picture?
Speaker 1: Yes, on the far left, and [Fred S.] Wolcott bought the Rabbit Foots after Chappelle's death, okay?
