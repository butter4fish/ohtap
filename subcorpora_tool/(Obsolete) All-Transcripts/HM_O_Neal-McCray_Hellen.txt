Story_ID: 372793
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Lester O'Neal] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E, her maiden name is Long, L-O-N-G [Willie Long Anderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And O'Neal I guess is--was it O'Neal?
Speaker 2: My mo- my parents were divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she he--she ended her life as an Anderson, A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what--what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth I am not exactly sure, but it was probably around 1909.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Coahoma County, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how do you spell Coahoma County?
Speaker 2: C-O-A-H-O-M-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now how far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side, how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: I can only trace the ancestors back to her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about him or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  I only know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Ellis, E-L-L-I-S.  His last name was Long, L-O-N-G [Ellis Long].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well that's your--that's--that's her grandfather right?
Speaker 2: That's her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew my mother's father because he--actually he lived 'til I was an adult well into an adult.  His name was Mitchel Long.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any--any stories that your grandparents passed down to you about life?
Speaker 2: Not on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay and what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: They were farmers, they were farmers.  I still have an aunt who lives on a farm--on the farm in--between Tutwiler [Mississippi] and Dublin [Mississippi].  It's my Uncle Rayford's [Rayford Long] wife, my mother's youngest brother's wife.  She still lives there.  She's in her nineties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they--so they didn't talk about what life was like for them, whether it was easy or hard or--or did they have a lot of money or did they--were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They talked--they didn't have a lot of money.  They worked very hard.  They always had some money because they worked very hard and my grandfather and my Uncle Rayford they did a little bootlegging on the side for cash, cash money.  They didn't make whiskey, they sold whiskey that you buy and then resell.  So that was--
Speaker 1: Did they have a place, like a joint that people would go to or did they just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well my Uncle Rayford, my Uncle Rayford had a little joint out on his--actually not far from his house.  So he had a little joint, but I think it only opened like on Friday and Saturday nights.
Speaker 1: Okay, that sounds like a pattern that (laughter), I've heard that kind of thing before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be way in the woods sort of back off the main drag.
Story_ID: 372794
Speaker 1: So did they talk about--I mean when you were growing up I guess in Mississippi in the times that they were growing up did they have any stories about race relations down there and what they (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They talked a lot about race relations.  They talked about lynchings.  I think lynchings was one of the things that they talked about a lot.  They also believed that you should defend yourself if you were approached or if somebody came to your house to take somebody out.  I--I remember hearing that kind of talk.  My Uncle Rayford [Rayford Long] always kept a loaded pistol, probably up until he died.  That wasn't a pistol; that was a little gun he kept propped up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably a .22 or something like that.
Speaker 1: So di- did they tell ya- do they tell any stories about any lynchings that you--that you can remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I--the only lynching that my mother [Willie Long Anderson] told me about was there was a man who was lynched in Clarksdale [Mississippi] that they hung in Clarksdale.  They hung him up in Clarksdale.  I don't know what the lynching was, I don't know what it was about.  But she always talked about them hanging the man up in Clarksdale.  Didn't talk too much about it.  I grew up at a time, I think, when black people were very protective of--of--of their children.  They didn't want 'em to know the horrors of being black in Mississippi.  And I think that was part of it.  I can remember often when people were talking that I had to get up and leave.  They would realize I would be sitting there and they'd make me get up and leave, because whatever they were talking about I wasn't supposed to hear about.  So I think a lot of that was talked about outside of my hearing.  Although I lived with my mother, I knew my father's [Lester O'Neal] people, but--some other than my aunt and uncle who lived in Clarksdale.  I knew my mother's family better--my father's family better.
Story_ID: 372795
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Willie Long Anderson] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: The only thing that my mother talked about a lot, she had a real desire to go to school.  At the time that she was going to school, school stopped in the probably sixth grade and so she wasn't able to go to school.  She wasn't able to go to high school.  She finished high school actually after I finished high school.  And then she went to Coahoma Junior College [Coahoma Community College, Clarksdale, Mississippi] and took some courses and--and started to teach as an assistant teacher in the Head Start program.  That was one of the things.  And one of her dreams, there were four of us, my mother had four children, was that all of her children go to college.  That was a dream that she said she had had since she was a child.  She wasn't even sure what college was, but she wanted her children to go to college.  So all four of us did go to college, her three daughters graduated from college and two of 'em ended up with, you know, degrees beyond their bachelor's [degree].  But beyond that, I don't think she talked very much about--about growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do--do you know what school that she--she attended in?
Speaker 2: Some school like, I know, Shady Grove [Shady Grove School] keeps coming to my mind, but that may not be--be accurate.  It was some little church school or school out in the country that had a church to it.  I remember her telling me that they walked to school, they took their shoes off and they walked to school, she and her younger brother [Rayford Long] so they wouldn't get their shoes dirty and muddy, and then they washed their feet.  And then she said, she called her father [Mitchel Long] Papa, then she said he bought--gave them a mule to ride to school so then they rode, her and her brother, rode the mule to school and then they didn't have to worry about getting their shoes dirty and having to wash their, you know, feet before they could put the shoes back on.  I don't know if you had to have shoes on to go to school--in the school or not.  But she talked about having to--they would take them off and carry them.
Speaker 1: Trying to preserve the shoes that's--
Speaker 2: Trying to take care of the shoes.
Speaker 1: --interesting.  Now people wear 'em to protect their feet and they wanting to protect the shoes, you know, taking 'em off to protect the shoes.  Yeah that's interesting.  But, okay.  Any other stories you remember your--your mother telling or did she--
Speaker 2: That's probably all I--I don't remember a lot.  My mother was busy working around.  I--I, you know, I think about that, I never really sat down and talked to my mom very much.  She was always busy.  And so we--I didn't--I don't have a rich, a lot of conversation to remember from her because she worked very, very hard.
Story_ID: 372796
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Well I have--since my parents were divorced, each of my parents had three additional children.  So I have living two siblings, but my mother [Willie Long Anderson] had two--two other daughters and a son and they all died.  And my father [Lester O'Neal] had three daughters and one of them died in August.  So I have two siblings remaining, my father's children.
Story_ID: 372797
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Lester Calvin O'Neal [Lester O'Neal].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: What did I say?  My mom's [Willie Long Anderson] was 1909, my dad's is 1909.  My father was born, I think, in Avon, Mississippi.  That's what was on his--the obituary.  But my Aunt Mary said that they were born on the Muscadine plantation [Washington County, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: On the Muscadine plantation?
Speaker 2: But, now where that is I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting 'cause I know what a muscadine is.  It's like a big grape, a cross between a grape and a plum or some big grapey, it's a grape actually.  A big grape.
Speaker 2: I think that was the name, I don't think they grew muscadines, I think they grew cotton.  But I think that was the name--
Speaker 1: Of the--
Speaker 2: --of the plantation.
Speaker 1: I just wondered, 'cause muscadines do grow down south in Georgia and Mississippi and you can't find 'em up here usually, you know.  You have to be down there in the fall to get 'em.  And they sell 'em in the supermarkets, but not, you know.  That's interesting.  Maybe they--maybe the grapes were part of it, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 2: I have no idea, but that's what she told me once when I was trying to find out about exactly where they were born and about their pa- I knew my grandmother [Katie Harrington O'Neal].  My grandmother died when I was twelve.  But I didn't know my grandfather [Irving O'Neal] and I was trying to--to find out something about--about--about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how far back can you trace your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can trace my father's side back to my great-grandparents.  I even know when they were born.  I mean that's just.
Speaker 1: When were they born?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather on my father's side was born in 1848 in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is getting interesting now, 1848--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I--I know that.
Speaker 1: --and that's before the Civil War--
Speaker 2: Before the Civil War.
Speaker 1: --in Oklahoma out in a free territory, Indian [Native American] territory.
Speaker 2: And he was born, yeah he was, I guess, half Cherokee.  And the other part, I know he's a Harrington.  So my Cousin Bernice [ph.] said he was half Cherokee and half Irish, but I'm not real sure about that.  And my great-grandmother was born in 1851.  And her--she was half Creek and half, I don't know what.  But she looked Native American.  She looked, you know, that way.
Speaker 1: Now was she born in Oklahoma too?
Speaker 2: No, she was born somewhere in Mississippi, I think.  Now that I'm not exactly sure, but I've been led to believe that that's where she was born in Mississippi.  I knew her.  She died when I was about twelve.  So, I--I actually knew her.
Speaker 1: Now are there stories passed down from your great-grandfather, your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Very little.  Now, my great-grandfather's name was Bailey Harrington.  I don't know as much about him, but I know stories about my great-grandmother [Mary Harrington].  And I still have relatives that live on that farm.  I just don't know them.  They had a farm between Goodman and a--Goodman, Mississippi and probably Durant, Mississippi.  I think their town would've been Goodman, Mississippi.  But I know stories about my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things that she was, I guess you'd call it like a midwife in the community.  She brewed herbs and--and things like that.  She helped with deliveries and that kind of thing.  But my Cousin Bernice always tells me the story when she was visiting people across the street and this white guy came up on the porch and he said, the men were talking and one of the little girls was sitting there and he said, whose little gal is that.  And my Cousin Bernice spoke up and said she's not a little gal, she's a girl.  And so the man said something, that: "You don't talk to a white man like that."  So Bernice got up and went to got her grandma.  And so my great-grandmother went across the street.  She was, by that time, walking on a cane and she put her cane on his nose and told him that he didn't talk to Harringtons that way.  And so Bernice says they were walking away, said she heard the man say, "Those Harringtons, them niggers, they're crazy from the cradle to the grave."  So that's one of the stories that I've been told about my great-grandmother.
Story_ID: 372798
Speaker 1: So they owned their own farm then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, on both sides of my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People owned a farm.
Speaker 1: So neither one of 'em was sharecropping or anything like that, they had their own place?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  Although these were small farms, I'm not sure, if this farm was eighty acres or forty acres.  Because my [paternal] great-grandmother [Mary Harrington], so this--this is kind of confusing to me, when the son had stayed, Uncle Bob [ph.] stayed to help.  So she split the farm.  She went to Lexington [Mississippi] and deeded him half of that farm.  And I'm not sure whether she deeded him forty acres or if the whole farm was forty acres and she deeded him twenty acres.  But some of his descendants or his descendant's wife, but there are people there who a--who are related to me in some form or fashion.  I just have not been there since my [paternal] grandmother [Katie Harrington O'Neal] was buried there in the little cemetery.  You know, back, people had a little cemetery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, any other stories from that side of the family?  Seems like--are there any stories about Oklahoma, about how your great-grandfather [Bailey Harrington] came from Oklahoma (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there were not.  That's mysterious.  I don't even know how they happened to own a farm.  Neither of them were ever slaves.  I know that much, my--I--I've been told that.  But how they got their freedom or not.  Once my Cousin Bernice [ph.] told me that her grandmother told her that her father took care of him and that he drove a stagecoach or something.  So maybe he was some kind of a teamster, but I don't know what his racial makeup was or any of that.  I have no idea how they ended up on that farm, but they owned that farm and they were never--they had never been slaves.
Speaker 1: I know sometimes, I don't know if it's true all the time, but a lot of the stories I've heard where people know there--there's some white paternal person there who make sure that they have the land in the first place and can protect their rights to it at least to a certain extent.  And that's how people end up with land in those situations, when the general aim of the white community was to make sure you didn't have any land, you know.  But somebody would step up and do that.  That might be the case here, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  But my--I know they had like eight--eight children.  And my Uncle Bob just died about three years ago, he would've been 105 if he had lived a few more days and made his birthday, 'cause he was born, I think, in 1895 or 1885.  Course they had a lot of children so they were spread.  He was the youngest one.
Story_ID: 372799
Speaker 1: Your father [Lester O'Neal], did he grow up in Aron, Mississippi [sic. Avon, Mississippi] or in a (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father grew up out there on the--on that farm, on the farm.  This is murky, because people kind of keep secrets.  My grandmother, I guess you call it, ran off.  My aunt said that it was marriage by lamplight because black people and white people could not get married.  But she left the farm with Irving O'Neal, who is my grandfather or who was my grandfather.  And they went somewhere.  They had four children, one died in infancy.  And she stayed with him, oh well long enough to have four children, maybe ten years, I'm not su--
Speaker 1: Irving O'Neal was white, just want to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was from Ireland.  And they didn't see her again until she brought her children to her parents' farm.  And now what happened between my grandmother and Irving O'Neal I have not a clue.  My aunt told me that s- they saw him.  They came to see them.  He found them when they were still children on that farm.  He came to see them and that he brought knickers and socks for his two sons.  But he didn't bring anything for her.  So he gave her grandfather money to buy clothes for her.  But instead, he took the money and bought seed for planting and they went to town and bought this mat- one--this fabric and made her one, I think one dress and it was--had--it was candy-striped.  But, so we don't know what happened to him.  My aunt speculated that maybe he met another woman or something.  But up until that time, they were a family.  Because my dad had memories of going to Memphis [Tennessee] with him.  You know, he would go to Memphis.  He'd take my dad with him on the train to Memphis.  You know, for--to take care of some kind of business, I don't know what he went to take care of.  But he lived out on a plantation, I guess it was a muscadine plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so marriage by lamplight, I hadn't heard that?
Speaker 2: Lamplight.  That's what my aunt said it was a marriage.  Because see they put in these obituaries like my, and I--and you know, you know people didn't get married, but she said it was her way of putting marriage by lamplight.
Speaker 1: Now what--what was--I--I--I neglected to ask you your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother's name was Mary Lashley [ph.] and then Harrington [Mary Harrington] when she married John Harrington [sic. Bailey Harrington].
Speaker 1: Okay and your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Katie Harrington [Katie Harrington O'Neal] and then she mar-, Las- but she used O'Neal, but, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 372800
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Willie Long Anderson], did she grow up in--in Goodman, Mississippi--I mean your father [Lester O'Neal], did he grow up in Goodman (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father grew up in Goodman, Mississippi on my--his--it was his [maternal] grandfather's [Bailey Harrington] farm.
Speaker 1: Okay and was he able to go to school?
Speaker 2: He probably went to school 'til he was about fourth grade.  After he came out of the [U.S.] Army, he went--
Speaker 1: Oh so he--he participated in a--
Speaker 2: World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: World War II.  Now that's--he's kind of--he'd been sort of old for World War II?
Speaker 2: But he was in World War--he might have been, you know, in his thirties, I'm not sure 'cause my parents, both my parents were about thirty years older than--they didn't have children real young.  So and I was his--so, but he did, he went--he went to the Army.  It was one of his things he was always really proud of and never could understand how I was out protesting against the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] after (laughter) after he had been in the--in the--in the service.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a World War II vet [veteran].  Did he have any stories about the war that he told?
Speaker 2: Not much.  No, he didn't talk about.  The only story--my father was very light and he had light eyes.  And I guess, you know, that you didn't always have birth certificates.  Census determined like your age, you know, they come and, census come around.  And at points he passed and at other times he didn't.  His brother [Irving O'Neal] passed and then they found out that he was black, he used to drive the train in Indiana and he got--was fired.  So they were light enough to cross over and so.  I don't know if he was a black--went in as a black person in the service or not.  But he never really talked about it.  He always thought it was just a great and wonderful thing.  He almost saw it has his liberation.  He already, I guess had carpentry skills, but after then he developed other skills and he was able to make a good living and his wife could stay at home.  And I think to him being able to support your wife so she didn't have to go and out work was success.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that could--yeah that, that could really be important in those days.  So he made a living as a contractor basically?
Speaker 2: No he was a--he was a welder.  He worked on skeletons, you know, bridge skeletons.  'Cause he migrated to Chicago [Illinois]--actually not Chicago, Hammond, Indiana is--is where he lived.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right outside of Chicago.
Speaker 2: So he did skeletons on bridges, you know, welding.  And I think that's the skill that he--that he--that he went to night school and--and--and got.  And he made good, what people say good money.  Was able to buy a house with the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and get that training.
Speaker 1: So he remarried and all that and the other?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents were divorced by the time I was two.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they met?  Do they talk about how they met in the first place?
Speaker 2: No, the only thing about my dad that I remember as a young person, he rode a Harley [Harley-Davidson].  And he had a, I understand a sidecar 'cause mom used to ride in the sidecar.  She used to ride on it with him and I have a picture of him holding me up stan- standing on the seat of the--I just have his hands, so I know it's him, but standing on the seat of the Harley.  And you know, he had these various names like people called him Red or Sonny Boy.  You know, he didn't have.  But he was working when he was in Clarksdale, Mississippi, but he was working I think as a carpenter out on the King and Anderson Plantation [Clarksdale, Mississippi].
Story_ID: 372801
Speaker 1: So I was asking you if there was a story about how your parents [Willie Long Anderson and Lester O'Neal] met and you don't--you don't know if there is one?
Speaker 2: No, no story about how they met.
Speaker 1: But do you know why they split up?  You probably don't.
Speaker 2: I--I'm pretty sure.  My father was a womanizer.  And I mean that's--that's pretty much--pretty much why they split up.  I think he settled down, you know, when he remarried because he married a younger woman [Marie O'Neal].  And I--I think that--and I--I'm not sure he wanted children either, because they were--they were divorced.  I have no memory of my parents ever living together.  So I was two when they were--and they had been married--I think they were married ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now do--do you have--when you--when you think about their personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: A little bit of--I am pro- I look more like my father, except I'm not light with light eyes.  I look more like him.  But I--and I might have personality more like him.  But I'm--I'm like both my parents, but probably more like my father.
Story_ID: 372802
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  My earliest childhood memory, I used to have some neighbors and they were little white children.  They had a store on the corner and I used to play with them.  And their--the lady who--black lady who took care of them that they called Nurse, Nursie [ph.], used to take us downtown in Clarksdale [Mississippi].  I think at that time Clarksdale had a little bus, I must've been under five, and we used to ride on the bus and we all sit up on the front seat in the bus 'cause she had these little children.  Then we would go and I remember once we were in Penney's [J.C. Penney Company] and Penney's had these fountains and I didn't know, you know, and there was this--about the fountains.  She was trying to make me drink colored water and I wanted to drink same kind of water, I didn't know about race.  And so I remember hearing her tell my mom [Willie Long Anderson] that she couldn't take me anymore 'cause I didn't know my place.  I remember that.  And then with these little girls, I told 'em I wasn't calling--their mom's name was Jenny [ph.].  I said I'm not calling your mom Miss Jenny anymore, 'til you call my mom Miss Willie.  So they must've gone asked their mom and they told me that their mom said that you don't call colored women Miss, Miss.  So my mother said that she decided then that it was time for me to stop playing with these little children because up until then I had played with them, I had spent the night over, I had eaten over.  The first little birthstone ring that I ever had, it was--my birthstone is aquamarine.  Their father had given me a small ring as the first piece of jewelry that I had.  And that was the end of--end of that relationship.  And I don't think I had any contact with white people anymore the rest of my growing up.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So you didn't really have to come in contact with white people that much in your--
Speaker 2: Not that much.  We had, you know, you had to go by grocery store and you went to--we shopped downtown and we shopped only at certain stores.  My stepfather [Fred Anderson] was very protective.  I remember going to the dollar store.  I mean it was Fred's Dollar Store, me and my brother [Rayford Anderson].  And we were in there and I gave 'em my package, you had to check if you had to package it, check it in so you couldn't steal anything or put it in a package.  And I remember when I gave her mine, I told them my name was Miss O'Neal [HistoryMaker Hellen O'Neal-McCray], and they said, "Maybe you're O'Neal, but it's not Miss."  And so me and brother we walked around the store and then we came back and I told 'em Miss O'Neal and I'd probably seen that in the movies or--and by the time I got home, some black people who had been in the store had told my stepfather that we were down there messing with white folks.  'Cause--several black people in there 'cause most of the black people that were in there, said, "Shh don't say."  But my stepfather said, "Well that's who you are, Miss O'Neal."  And so--
Speaker 1: How old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was probably--'cause my brother was probably about six, I probably was about eleven, you know.  Not--not--not very old.

Speaker 1: You grew up in Clarksdale [Mississippi], was it on a--was it on a farm or?
Speaker 2: No I grew up in the town of Clarksdale.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: One of the smells, the thing that I remember most is when they sprayed for mosquitoes.  It was that--that--spray and we used to run and play in that.
Speaker 1: You used to pra- play in this?
Speaker 2: Play in it, uh-huh.  Run behind the spray thing.  It was spraying DDT and we were running, it was a big smoke and we'd be (laughter) running, running behind it, playing.  That was, nobody knew--it was be running behind it and playing in the DDT and it would be everywhere.  But that's one of the things that I remember that smell, that bug spray.
Speaker 1: Did you ever--did anybody ever get sick?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anybody getting sick.  I don't remember kids getting sick.  Maybe kids got sick, but I have no memory of sick kids.  I don't--the only time that anybody died, I remember a couple people drowning when I was growing up.  But I don't remember kids dying or getting sick.  And so, we--we did that.  That's one of the things that I remember.  I remember passing by churches, the church music, that I remember.  The smell of cooking of fried chicken, those are smells I remember.  Blues, because, you know, when I was growing up if your parents went somewhere, you went too.  So I went to chip joints, so I heard blues.  I heard mostly blues 'cause I'm still a blues fan, I think that's where that comes from.  I still like your Howlin' Wolf, howl for his--his darling and--
Speaker 1: So, so, where were they--where were the kids go when the? So would they (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you--when you went with your parents?  They just take you.  You knew to sit down.  They'd buy you a Coke [Coca-Cola].  They'd have a beer or you didn't buy mixed drinks, Mississippi was dry.  And if they were having whiskey pretty much, they probably had it at home.  Neither of my parents did much, my mother [Willie Long Anderson] or stepfather [Fred Anderson] didn't do very much drinking.  But--when our relatives from Chicago [Illinois] came, you know, we might do some drinking.  And we got to have a little sip too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you remember any--were there any particular people you remember playing in these joints by name?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  But I remember, one of the things I remember that fascinated me was the harmonica.  The mouth harp I guess you call it.  That was one of the instruments that I always loved.  I loved hearing it.  I especially liked it when people played a guitar and then they carried it on there then they cut put the thing up and play it.  So that's what I remember most about growing up.  I remember school, the smell of the church, and also the chalk dust.  I--you know, I went to Immaculate Conception [Immaculate Conception School, Clarksdale, Mississippi].  I remember the sound that the nuns made when they walked with all those rosary beads.  And I used to think, oh I want to be a nun so bad.  I don't know what to do, that was what I wanted to be.
Story_ID: 372804
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you hear any tales about Robert Johnson, that being Clarksdale [Mississippi] and all?
Speaker 2: You know, actually most of what I know about Robert Johnson I learned as an adult.  But I had heard that there was some guy who met the devil.  I never heard it was Robert Johnson.  But there was a guy who met the devil.  And some--people tried to, you know, to--to discourage you from listening to that.  It was about selling your soul to the devil, you know, I heard that expression.  But not a lot about Rob--I didn't hear his name.  I think I learned that as an adult and what his name was.  'Cause my parents didn't have--my stepfather [Fred Anderson] went to church and went to C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church.  He built the C.M.E. church.  Him and his brother actually built the church.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: It was C.M.E., Mt. Moriah C.M.E. Church [Clarksdale, Mississippi].  And they--they built that church.  His brother did the bricks and he did the carpentry work.  And he took us to Sunday school and church there.  My mother [Willie Long Anderson] didn't go there much.  She was not what you would call super religious.  She had stuff to do at home so she didn't go a lot.
Story_ID: 372805
Speaker 1: We went to--I went to Immaculate Conception [Immaculate Conception School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] and my younger sister went to Immaculate Conception, she actually graduated from Immaculate Conception, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now was that expensive to do--to go to?
Speaker 1: I think it might have been for the particular time it might have been expensive, but it was like five dollars or something.  I don't know if it was five dollars a week or five--because I remember losing my tuition once.  You know, I took it out of my book bag and lost it.  I think it was five dollars, but I don't know if it was every week or every month.  I--I didn't stay.  When I was in the fourth grade I went to public school.  I decided I wanted to go to--go to Myrtle Hall [Myrtle Hall Colored School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] 'cause my friends were there and I went to Myrtle Hall.  Then again--
Speaker 2: Myrtle Hall School, huh?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Myrtle Hall Colored School (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now who was Myrtle Hall, do you know?
Speaker 1: I don't know who Myrtle Hall was.  Because you know the library was named Myrtle Hall.  Went to Myrtle Hall Colored Library [Clarksdale, Mississippi].  I know who Higgins was named after, where I went to high school, W.A. Higgins [W.A. Higgins High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] was named after a man named W.A. Higgins in Clarksdale [Mississippi] who was the principal.  But he was the colored superintendent 'cause we had complete separate, separate schools.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the principal of the colored school was the superintendent of the colored school too?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And his name was W.A. Higgins and--
Speaker 2: Okay. So it's W.A. Higgins High School?
Speaker 1: Yeah, W.A. Higgins High School, that's where I went to high school.  In the eighth grade though I went to Holy Rosary [Holy Rosary Institute] in Lafayette, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay so you--how did you manage to move to Lafayette, Louisiana?
Speaker 1: I didn't move, I went to boarding school.  My mother [Willie Long Anderson] sent me to--to there.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's a boarding school.  How did you like that, I mean?
Speaker 1: I loved it.  Loved everything about it.  I can't think of anything I didn't like.
Speaker 2: So, your household when you grew up consisted of you and your mother and your--your--
Speaker 1: Stepfather [Fred Anderson] and my two sisters [Inez Anderson and Odessa Anderson] and brother [Rayford Anderson]--
Story_ID: 372806
Speaker 1: So eighth grade you went to Holy Rosary [Holy Rosary Institute] in Lafayette [Louisiana] and came back and finished high school at Higgins [W.A. Higgins High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And came back.  I--I would've stayed.  My mom [Willie Long Anderson] just felt so bad because when I went, I went in the fall and I didn't get to come back 'til Christmas.  I went back at Christmas, didn't get to come back until school was out.  And so, and this is when people didn't just talk on the telephone.  So she thought that that was--and her friends, I guess people said, "Oh you shouldn't sent that girl away, that's such a shame," and so she felt guilt sending me away.  I loved it.  I was perfectly happy there.  I would have stayed there, but she brought me back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I always liked reading.  I was not what you considered a good student by any means.  I was a lazy student.  I read.  I was bright enough to pass, you know, without doing anything.  But I was, I read books.  I would get caught reading books.  You know, I'd be--they'd be talking about something else and I'd be reading on my lap.  So I had trouble with not paying attention a lot.  So, that was probably--literature probably was my favorite subject.  Anything I could read, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you get in--in trouble in school a lot, now?
Speaker 2: I got in some trouble in school.  I got in trouble even when I was in--I remember when I was going to Immaculate Conception [Immaculate Conception School, Clarksdale, Mississippi], I got in trouble for being haughty.  I'm not exactly sure what I was doing, but I had a little day school day picture and I was haughty on it.  But that was something probably I read in a book.  'Cause I think I used to act out some of those behaviors, you know, being haughty or that kind of behavior.  You know, so I got in some--I got in some trouble.  Back when I went to school, you know, they gave you spankings at school.  And so I got a few spankings.
Speaker 1: That's eighth grade though?  Even in eighth grade?
Speaker 2: When I went to boarding school, yes.  I--the only time I've ever been slapped, I mean actually slapped in the face, I was slapped at Holy Rosary.  Sister Loraine [ph.] slapped me, and she slapped me I think on both sides.  I remember just being so angry I couldn't--I just--whew--I was so angry I couldn't say what I thought and I couldn't--I was very angry.  She slapped me on both sides of my face.  I didn't come, go and eat, I sat on those steps and she just kind of left me alone.  And then later on that evening, people went to dinner and they came back from dinner, she brought me--brought me something to eat.  She brought me a tray.
Speaker 1: Now what did she slap you for, what was her--?
Speaker 2: I ran into her.  I was running and I actually ran into her.  And she--she slapped me.  That why I was slapped.  It's just--that's probably the only time because my mother had never slapped me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty rough.
Story_ID: 372807
Speaker 1: --Was Holy Rosary [Holy Rosary Institute, Lafayette, Louisiana], now that was all-black school, basically a boarding school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a black Catholic boarding school.  The head priest, Father Windolph [Charles Windolph], was from Germany.  The black priest was Father Francis [Francis Wade].  They had two white brothers.  I know one of 'em was Brother Stillfried [Stillfried Wahl] and Brother Lambert.  And then they had a black brother whose name I cannot remember.  But it was three brothers and two priests.  And it was in Lafayette [Louisiana].  And they had day students too and boarding school, boarding students.
Speaker 1: Okay and you had nuns teaching the classes?
Speaker 2: Nuns.  Nuns.  I'm trying to think if there were any lay teachers.  It seems to me there might have been a couple lay teachers in the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Everything was very separate, boys sat on one side of the room.  Girls sat on one side of the room.  After classes were over, the girls stayed on one side of the campus, boys stayed on one side.  The boys had a store on their side.  We could go over to the store, but we couldn't like hang around that store, we had to come back.  But, if you were naughty in class, the nun would lock you in and there were these windows and you could kiss boys through the windows.  So we did--kiss--do a little kissing through those windows.  And then on Saturday nights during confession, boys would be over 'cause the chapel is on our side.  People who had boyfriends would sneak and kiss boys, stand up on those steps.
Speaker 1: Well that's a lot of--now this is in eighth grade?
Speaker 2: That was in eighth grade.  But there were high school people.  But eighth graders were interested in kissing boys.  I mean that was--that was--well we thought it was a lot of fun.  One of the things that we--that we did that we thought was really bad and then you have something to confess.  You had had some impure thoughts or as long as you didn't take part in impure acts I guess you're all right, but something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you just stayed there for the eighth grade and you came back to Clarksdale [Mississippi] for high school [W.A. Higgins High School]?
Speaker 2: Came back and Clarksdale for the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 372808
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers in school through--throughout in school?
Speaker 2: Actually my fourth grade teacher [at Myrtle Hall Colored School, Clarksdale, Mississippi], Miss Shanks [Willye B. Shanks], was one of my favorites.  I always say I dressed just like Miss Shanks to this day.  Miss Shanks is still alive.  I saw her a couple years ago and she remembered me, which I found surprising.  She was one of my favorite teachers.  I didn't have a lot of favorite teachers.  I always liked her.  In high school [W.A. Higgins High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] I don't think I had any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 372809
Speaker 1: Were you involved in the clubs in high school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was in the marching band in high school.  I really did like that a lot.  I was in the marching band.  But not really in--in clubs, no.
Speaker 1: You know, what instrument did--did you play?
Speaker 2: I played cornet, I played the base horn.  The cornet and base horn.  We had this wonderful young band director, Mr. Rhymes [Robert A. Rhymes] and we had a very good marching band.  I enjoyed that a lot.
Speaker 1: How many students were in your school?
Speaker 2: That I don't know, I can't.  But I know in my high school graduating class there were about thirty-six.  So probably was a couple hundred students, maybe, in Higgins [W.A. Higgins High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi] in the high school.
Speaker 1: Any of the high school teachers served as mentor or leader?
Speaker 2: Not for me.  There was a young woman, Miss Washington [ph.], who taught.  When--when I went to high school, you know, girls were encouraged to take shorthand, typing, home economics, and I hated home economics.  So I took those business courses from Miss Washington.
Story_ID: 372810
Speaker 1: Now when you were in school, were you aware, I mean how aware were you of the Civil Rights Movement that was sweeping the country?
Speaker 2: I only became aware probably, well we alway- my stepfather [Fred Anderson] read the Chicago Defender.  So he read a lot about what was going on in the--in the world.  So I'm conscious of things happening.  I can remember when Arthur, Autherine Lucy, was it University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], when she--?  Because we--he would read--he'd talk about that.  When the sit-in's started, that was pretty exciting to me 'cause he talked about that.  You know, he'd read the paper.  And sometimes he'd actually read it out loud.  You know, we'd be sitting in the living room trying to watch television and I guess he'd want us--and he'd read it out loud.  So he used to read the Chicago Defender some passages out loud or something that happened.  So I probably was aware.  I knew Aaron Henry so I knew about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Now how did you know Aaron Henry?
Speaker 2: Because he was the druggist and we called him Doc Henry, because you used to go to the drugstore when you were sick.  And my--my stepfather was very quiet, but he had strong opinions about race.  My sister told me once when she was sick that he took her to the doctor, the black--we had only had one--one--one black doctor at that time.  And for some reason he was away or something so he had to take her to a white doctor.  And they wanted him to go in the back door and sit on, and he took her back home.  (Laughter) I mean she didn't get to see--she didn't get to see the doctor.  I know we went to the black dentist and we went to the black doctor, you know.  And we went to Doc Henry when all else failed.
Speaker 1: So Aaron Henry was a druggist, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a druggist, had a drugstore.  Fourth Street Drug Store [Clarksdale, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, when did--when did things start heating up around Clarksdale [Mississippi], I mean in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Things have probably always been heating up in--in a--in a strange kind of way.  We had a neighbor and his name was Lindsey Gaines [ph.] and he used to work.  Oakhurst [Clarksdale, Mississippi] is a white neighborhood and I think he'd go over there and work and cut grass and do things like that.  You know, how they'd hire black young people.  And some white women claimed rape or something over there.  So they were trying to arrest somebody.  And they arrested him and they took him to the jail and you know, they beat him up, they beat him up.  But I guess they couldn't make him confess because he hadn't done anything.  So they let him out.  And I rem- what I remember about that is that people, I guess friends and neighbors, when he got out of jail, that--his mother and her children, I don't remember how many children there were in his family.  They were put on a train headed north because they--people assumed that they would come back and get him.  Now I don't know if somebody drove 'em to Batesville [Mississippi] to catch the City of New Orleans [Louisiana] or if he went to Memphis [Tennessee], but somebody took him and they left.  I remember his name was Lindsay Gaines.  I--I don't remember even how old I was when that happened.  But I believe I was probably in my early teens.  It might have been round about the time that Emmett Till was murdered.  And--but I--I remember that, I remember that.  I also remember people telling me, and this I can't prove, that black men at the Coca-Cola plant [The Coca-Cola Company] in Clarksdale, one of the--the woman [Carolyn Bryant], I can't remember, I guess it was Bryant's [Roy Bryant] wife.  I guess Bryant was the younger one of--of the two.  Milam [J.W. Milam] was the older one, Bryant was the younger one.  That Bryant and his wife came to Clarksdale and that she got a job at a store, Dallas department store, which I guess was kind of a store like--like maybe a cheaper ladies store and that black people stopped going there, and so they had to let her go.  And then her husband had gotten a job at the Coca-Cola bottling plant and the black people refused to work with him.  I just heard that story.
Speaker 1: You mean white people refused to work?
Speaker 2: No.  Black people--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --who worked at the Coca-Cola bottling plant would not work--would not work with him.  So I guess there's always been some kind of movement or some thinking in Mississippi.  I know when people came out of World War II [WWII] and they went to vote and they wouldn't let them vote in Clarksdale that they organized around that back in the '40s [1940s] I had heard about that.  And I think Aaron Henry might have been the young man who actually did that.  But those'd be just snatches of conversations that I heard growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So things pretty cool--
Story_ID: 372811
Speaker 1: You graduated when, in '59 [1959] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [W.A. Higgins High School, Clarksdale, Mississippi], did you have a career--were you going to college at that point, did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to college.  I had no career in mind.
Speaker 1: And--and how did you decide which college?
Speaker 2: I didn't really decide.  I had friends, one of my best friends at that time, who was probably about three years older than I was, but she was at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and I really wanted to--if I was going to college, I wanted to go to Tennessee State.  I hadn't given college a lot of thought.  I had a high school boyfriend, I think I would like for him to have a maybe--liked to maybe have gotten married or something.  I--he went to Chicago [Illinois].  He ended up, he moved to Chicago.  He graduated in Chicago.  'Cause a lot of boys in my town in the summers would go to Chicago and work and then come back.  So he went to Chicago.  My mother [Willie Long Anderson] had made up her mind that I was going to college.  She decided on Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] because Mr. Higgins' wife was at Jackson State.  And that's why--how I ended up going to Jackson State.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right in Jackson, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Right in Jackson, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 372812
Speaker 1: Jackson State University [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], I guess you--you had started the fall of '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Fall of '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay, well how did you like Jackson State?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, at the time I went to Jackson State, I hated it.  I look back on it a lot fonder then I felt about it when I was there.  You know, you had those--all of those rules that if you left campus you had to leave with a person, you had to sign out.  You--I mean just really strict rules.
Speaker 1: Was it--let me ask you this, was it stricter than Catholic boarding school [Holy Rosary Institute, Lafayette, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Catholic boarding school, I was a child, you know, and I expected somebody to be in control or in charge of me.  But it was strict, you know, I was eighteen, I thought myself as adult person or, you know, kind of different.  So it wasn't as strict because you didn't have all the stuff about sex that you have in Catholic schools, you know.  But you had rules, a lot--a lot of rules that I didn't like.  I only stayed on that campus.  I left--when I was a junior I moved out in the city.  I took a room in a lady's house named Elnora Johnson [ph.], and I took a room in a--her house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And that's where I stayed until I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you decide to major in?
Speaker 2: Well I started my college career as--as a biology major.  I thought I might like to be a nurse.  I thought that because I had worked for a doctor, a Dr. McCaskill [Luther McCaskill] that summer.  And I really did admire Dr. McCaskill.  He's another person that I would think of as a--a sort of as a hero because he treated people.  They came, I mean he didn't keep office hours or appointments, I mean you just sort of came like you do to a barbershop and just sort of.  But you know, he didn't--he wasn't that concerned about money.  He treated people, you know, and I admire--I admired him.  There was just something--something about him that I really liked.
Speaker 1: Was he in Clarksdale (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was in Clarksdale, Mississippi.  He probably died--he died after 1994 'cause he was still living.  I went up in the delta with somebody and I know he was still living.  I wanted to go and see him, but I didn't get a chance to do that.  And he also had had trouble, I think he ended up in prison about abortions or something at one point.  Because I remember writing him once when he was in prison.  But he was certainly to me what I think a doctor should be.  So I admired that and I thought well, I'll major in biology.  And I--I said--for a year, chemistry was so difficult for me that I had to give that up.  I like art, but my--and writing, but my mother [Willie Long Anderson] kept saying well, you need to get a teaching degree.  You need to--you need to--you need to--so you can make a living, you may have children, you have to support your children.  So I ended up majoring in education.  That was kind of what I ended up doing.  And I didn't--I didn't like that.  I didn't like it particularly.
Speaker 1: You really didn't want to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: At that time I didn't, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 372813
Speaker 1: What kind of things were going on on campus when you were--I mean what did you--
Speaker 2: When I was first at Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], I guess just regular parties and--and--and basketball games and football games.  I went to some of that, I didn't go to a lot of that.  Then at the end of my sophomore year I was going to summer school.  At the end of my freshman year, I went to Chicago [Illinois] and I worked at Feinsteins on South Wabash [Avenue].  Then end of my sophomore year, I was walking down the street and I met--I think I met James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], I know I met Bernard LaFayette, and I met them and they would tell me about the movement.  That's when I--'cause nothing really was going on on Jackson State.  They had had a demonstration back in February of, I don't know, 1960 maybe or '61 [1961] I'm not really sure anymore 'cause I was not there when that took place.  I was at home [Clarksdale, Mississippi].  So I don't, I can't remember the dates of that.  But when--in the summer of '61 [1961] when the Freedom Riders had started to come to Jackson, Mississippi I met Bevel and LaFayette.  I think--I think--I know I met also somebody named Paul Brooks and [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, and Thomas Gaither.  And I don't see much written about Thomas Gaither.  I always think there should be a lot written about him.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Oh, why?
Speaker 2: Well, when I--he was a person in Jackson, Mississippi at that time, I'm sure all of twenty-one, twenty.  When people were being released from the Freedom Rides, he was a person making sure that they got out of jail on time to appeal.  Making sure that the office ran.  Also trying to organize a--he worked for CORE [Congress of Race Equality] trying to organize a Jackson nonviolent movement.  Well I think that's what we named it, Jackson Nonviolent Movement.  'Cause I was a co-chair, me and Charles Cox.
Speaker 1: Now, well you didn't become a co-chair immediately did--did you in Jackson?
Speaker 2: Well, we--see we org- we actually organized it.  We, yeah I was a co-chair, Charles Cox was a co-chair.  I think Charles--
Speaker 1: Now this is in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: In '61 [1961], um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you met--you met Bevel and Bernard LaFayette.  I mean were you thinking about what they were doing--
Speaker 2: They told me.
Speaker 1: --when you met 'em or did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I met them.  They were talking, you know, they were talking.  They're kind of snappy and I was talking.  And they told me about the office and I said, yeah, you know, I thought they were trying to be fresh.  And so, we're just talking and they said well come down to the office.  So maybe I saw them a second time or so.  But I eventually went to the office and I met Thomas Gaither.  And he was getting people--he told me what he was doing.  And there were some high school students and I remember, I--I think they were there at that time.  One of the boys was Lavaughn Brown and I remember the other boy was Charles Cox, Charles Cox died in--died of some kind of kidney or something and he didn't live to be very old.  He probably died about three or four years after that.  I'm not sure exactly, but and Jesse Harris.  And so we organized.  It was pr- pretty--pretty shortly thereafter that I became the co-chair of the Jackson Nonviolent Movement.  He was, we were co-chairs, Charles Cox and me.  Only reason I remember that, I got this thing from the sovereign commission [Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission] and that's what it said, if I remember that.  And that made me remember it.
Speaker 1: Now had you ever been the chairman of anything before?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) no indeed.  I hadn't even been the--I saw on my class thing, I was the class secretary or assistant class secretary, but I never remembered even doing that, I don't remember doing any--anything.
Story_ID: 372814
Speaker 1: I went with Thomas Gaither to somebody's house.  Some people had been released from jail and I went with him.  And I think it was some--maybe Mrs. Harvey's [ph.] house.  Some Jackson [Mississippi] clubwoman.  Their group had organized to give people things that they needed--needed when they were released.  Like hygiene items and things that you might need when you were released out of jail.  So--and I met some people who were being released and Richard Haley from CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  No I didn't meet him then.  Thomas Gaither and maybe it was the Jackson Nonviolent Movement, I can't remember this exactly, there was going to be a Southern Governors Conference at the Heidelberg Hotel in Jackson, Mississippi.  And so they wanted to know if I would go on a demonstration and picket the Southern Governors Conference and I said I would.  So the next day when I came to picket the Southern Governors Conference, there was nobody to go with me.  So Richard Haley went with me.  So we went down to the--somebody took us in a car.  Went down to the Heidelberg Hotel and I don't know if we took our signs up about these signs, so we had the signs and we started to walk in front of the hotel.  And before we could take too many steps, Captain Ray [John Lee Ray] said that if we didn't stop picketing--we would be--we were disturbing the peace and transquility [tranquility] of the State of Mississippi and the City of Jackson we would be arrested.  I remember that.  We turned and walked back the other direction and before we reached the end of the hotel, there were photographers and people there, I was about to die, I was so scared.  He said, "You, you're now under arrest for disturbing the peace and tranquility of the State of Mississippi and the City of Jackson."  And they told us to get in the paddy wagon and we did.  We weren't handcuffed back then, we're just told and we got in there.  And they took us like, it must've been the scenic route 'cause it wasn't that far.  But they took us around corners and you slide to one side, then you slide to the other side, I remember that.  Then we got to jail.  They locked me up in the city, in the women's part of the city jail.  And they locked Richard Haley someplace.  He died too--I don't know when Dick Haley died, but he has died.  And then we went a couple days maybe, we went for like an arraignment in the court and that was--that's when I met William Kunstler, it was first time that I met him.  He was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the lawyer, the civil rights lawyer, William Kunstler?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the first time I met him.  Well, you know, I'd never seen anything like him.  So I was pretty--so then they sentenced us to six months, five hundred dollar fines.  And I went off to the county jail and I'm assuming that's where he went.
Speaker 2: So, you were sent to the county jail for six months in the county?
Speaker 1: I was in the county jail six months.  I stay--
Speaker 2: Did you spend six months, okay?
Speaker 1: No, I stayed ten days and Thomas Gaither bailed me out.  Because he was in charge of, you know, making sure people got out of jail.  Nobody got lost in the system.  There were people who stayed six months, right there in Dayton [Ohio] there was this girl, Winona Beamer, I think she was from Dayton, I know she married somebody in Dayton, who actually did stay six months in Parchman [Parchman Farm; Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].  So there were people who--who stayed six months, but I was not one of them.  I stayed ten days.  I was cont- you know, I was fine.  I mean I could have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 372815
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this though, let's go back a little bit, but--but--how did you--what compelled you to get involved in the movement in the first place 'cause you hadn't had a history?  Now you had a history of being resistant to that--that social order down there as a child, but you hadn't had a--an organizational history of being involved in anything.  So, well very few people down there had a history of that I guess.  But what, what was it that pushed you over the edge to be involved in the first place?
Speaker 2: I always thought that I should do something, the something I did not know what it was.  I always admired people who were integrating schools or who were--the people who were in Little Rock [Arkansas].  Because we read about that and we actually saw that on television.  So I had a admiration for people and I just figured that since I was a person who was being discriminated against I should certainly do something.  People were coming from up north and everywhere and that I couldn't just sit around and have somebody--but as I had always been taught in my family, you know, to--not to accept things from other people.  That the only thing that you should owe people is respect.  You don't borrow money, you take care of yourself, you look out for yourself so you aren't in debt.  So that might've actually had something to do with it.  To go through life not owing anybody anything except respect.  So I--that could've really--I felt like people were doing something for me, that I should probably be doing for myself.
Story_ID: 372816
Speaker 1: Now how did you feel after you were arrested?  Did you--I mean now you'd never been arrested before and--
Speaker 2: I know, I was scared, I was scared, but I was more afraid.  You know, I withdrew from summer school.  My parents did not have a lot of money.  My edu- my mother [Willie Long Anderson] worked to pay for my education and here I was wasting money.  I wrote her a letter and told her, but she was livid.  So I would not have minded staying in jail because she certainly--my stepfather [Fred Anderson] sort of eased away from me there, but my mom was upset.  I withdrew, I didn't get any of that money back.  I had to have somebody pay my money for the fall and I actually, that fall--I'm trying to think.  I applied--student loans came and I applied for a student loan.  But I'm thinking it was actually the next summer.  I don't remember how much it was.  But I applied for it.  I got one quarter of it and then I was on some kind of demonstration or something on Jackson State's [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] campus and they revoked it.  So other than that one quarter, my mother paid for my education.  My stepmother [Marie O'Neal] and stepfather.  So it wasn't like I was getting grants and things, scholarships.  They worked and paid for that.  So yes she was upset, to say the least.
Speaker 1: So, so did you--did you get back involved immediately after you got out?
Speaker 2: I got out.  I went home [Clarksdale, Mississippi] very briefly.  It was not an easy homecoming.  I came back to Jackson [Mississippi].  I spent the summer, the rest of the summer in Jackson.  I pretty much stayed with some people, their last name was Morman.  They had a daughter named Brenda [Brenda Morman].  I had met Brenda.  Brenda attended too, but I had met her through Thomas Gaither and the--the Civil Rights Movement.  And I stayed.  They lived (unclear).  And I stayed basically, spent the rest of the summer.  They sort of living with them.  And I was going to work at the office.  It wasn't the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office then, it was I guess basically probably CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], but I was doing that--I wasn't paid.  I was doing that because I couldn't--
Story_ID: 372817
Speaker 1: Then that--around Labor Day, I think, I decided to--or maybe it was earlier, I'm not sure, just go home.  I got on a Greyhound bus and I sat on the second seat, and I was arrested.  Bus driver told me to move and I didn't, and I was arrested.  I was taken to jail and they kept me all day.  I was never charged, but they kept me all day.  They didn't give me anything.
Speaker 2: Now how did they--how did they treat you both times?  Now you were in jail ten days and they--was it--when you--were you treated excessively rough or how did they what is?
Speaker 1: Basically I was not treated parti- I wasn't, I can't remember any specific treatments the first time.  What I remember though is the in- the inmates, I guess that's what they are, how they treated me.  The women that I was put into the cell with at the city jail were wonderful to me.  I mean they were wonderful, they were black women, they were wonderful.  I mean I--
Speaker 2: Did they know why you were there?
Speaker 1: They knew why I was there.  They were wonderful to me.  Then when I went to the county jail there was--there was like there--there were four cells, it was like a little cell block with a little hallway.  And in one cell was a lady waiting to go to Parchman [Parchman Farm; Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].  I don't know what she did.  I believe she killed her husband, but I don't know what she had done.  She's a black lady.  Right next to me was a white woman.  I don't know her real name, but I called her Jessie Mae, and me, and then the next cell there was a woman who was going to go to Whitfield [Whitfield State Hospital, Whitfield, Mississippi].  Whitfield is the place for the mentally ill.  And they used to lock people up in jail until they had a space I guess.  And so that was--and I talked to the white woman in the cell next to me and also the lady who was at the end, her cell door was open.  She'd bring us water, a bucket and dipper, we'd drink water.  And--
Speaker 2: So she was in jail, but she will get out and walk--
Speaker 1: But she couldn't get outta the cell block.  But they also, they didn't let me have any magazines.  They took the mattress, I had an army blanket, that I think was harsh.  But they had trustees and it was a black man in jail, his name was Ray.  I cannot remember his last name.  And he was in jail because they were bootleggers and they had a cafe on Lynch Street [Jackson, Mississippi].  He was in jail because the police had come and they had slapped his sister-in-law.  And he had gone down to the, I guess to the police department and beat up a few policemen or something.  So he was in jail, but he was a trustee.  And he used to bring me magazines, he'd slip things to me, so.  Black people were very extraordinarily kind to me and--and looked out for me in ways that, so it was some--interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now so the second time you were arrested they kept you overnight you said?
Speaker 1: No, they kept me all day.  I was arrested in the morning.  They did not let me out 'til night.  They took me to the bus station, it looked like to me it was a ha- at least a half dozen of them.  They--some of 'em had on plainclothes.  They had guns.  They was standing around making sure I didn't go into those bus station doors.  They had taken my--I didn't have a ticket.  And so the bus came, I got on the bus, I got in the second seat.  A young black guy got in the second seat with me and we rode together.  Nobody bothered us.  Same seat that I had been arrested in--
Story_ID: 372818
Speaker 1: But what I did was, I testified in a case, in a court case, about that, that fall of 1961.  So I--I testified and Constance Motley [Constance Baker Motley] was the lead attorney.  Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] was her--sat the second seat in that case, so I testified about it.
Speaker 2: Okay now, the case was about--? It was--?
Speaker 1: I guess it had something to do with interstate rulings.  But specifically I can't tell, but it was written about in The Clarion-Ledger I'm sure.  And I have actually newspaper copies of when I sent ones to the sovereign commission [Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission] and they sent me stuff, that was one of the things that was in that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--what was--did you get a chance to--to--well what were your observations of Constance Baker Motley and--and Derrick Bell?
Speaker 1: Well first thing, I hadn't seen very many black attorneys.  Only black attorneys I had seen was Carsey Hall and Jack Young.  And watching a black attorney from Mississippi is different.  Constance Motley was so sharp and so--she had a way of putting--putting those southern attorneys down because her wit was much quicker.  She was brighter and I was just fascinated, just so impressed, absolutely impressed.  She was well-dressed, extremely well-spoken.  And I thought if I could talk like that.  You know, I--so--so that was--I'm trying to think, 'cause I wasn't arrested again, I did--I wasn't arrested anymore until sixty--
Speaker 2: So, so that's twice that some--
Speaker 1: That was--that was two times that summer.
Speaker 2: On the bus and then arrested before, so that's three times?
Speaker 1: No it was two times, because then I was arrested not again that summer--
Story_ID: 372819
Speaker 1: I came back to school [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi].  My mother [Willie Long Anderson] made me promise her that I would stay in school because I was talking about dropping out because the people were dropping out.  See, I met Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] too that summer.  It seems to me when I got out of jail and came to the office, Bob Moses was sitting in that office.  He had just come down to Mississippi.  So I met him--I met him that summer.  There were other people who came that summer that I met like Diane Nash, I'm trying to think.  And then some people decided that they were gonna stay and they went to McComb [Mississippi].  They got out of jail and they went other places around the South.  So I continued to go to the office and do some work, but I stayed in school 'cause I had promised my mom.  Well that summer, I had to--I went to Chicago [Illinois] to work 'cause I needed money.  When I came back my senior year, I did some stuff for the movement.  But then I--I finished--I actually ended up going to summer school.  I was going to summer school, must've been '63 [1963].  I--I was there that summer.  I didn't go to the March on Washington.  I stayed in Jackson [Mississippi] and did office--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was actually working for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] that summer of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Now how did things plan--now you were recruited into this activity by Bernard LaFayette and James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], and they were SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] basically?
Speaker 1: Well see in the beginning--
Speaker 2: And Gaither [Thomas Gaither] you think was CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]?  You said was CORE.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  In the beginning I--I just knew it was like everybody else in the South, I just thought they were Freedom Riders when they first came.  You know, I didn't--I didn't have the sophistication to--
Speaker 2: Know those organizational affiliations, all right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh, to know the differences between those organizations.  I--I wasn't that sophisticated.  So it was--when I actually became a paid staff person for--for SNCC and got my first check for nine dollars and sixty-four cents was I believe the summer of '63 [1963].
Story_ID: 372820
Speaker 1: And I was arrested with a group of students on demonstration.  I was arrested that summer [1963] twice.  I was arrested first time with a group of people on demonstration.  And then the second time I was arrested, that's the only time I suffered any kind of physical something, I was arrested by myself.  I was out canvasing, voter registration, going door to door.  And a policeman stopped and he picked me up, he said I was li- I think littering.  And I was taken to the city jail.  I was sick.  It was one of the few times in my life I've been sick.  But I was feeling--I was really sick.  So the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] came and interviewed me.  I don't know how people in the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office in Jackson [Mississippi] knew that I was in there, 'cause I hadn't did--I don't remember calling anybody.  But the FBI came to see me.  I was sick.  They told them that they should take me to the doctor.  So the guy came--
Speaker 2: Well, wait a minute.  What was wrong?
Speaker 1: I had like a probably a flu or pneumonia or something, I'm not sure what it was.  But I was just really sick.  And so they came at night and wanted, and I told 'em no I wanted to go not anywhere with them at night.  So the next morning there had been a fight in the cell, two women were fighting about something that had happened on the street between 'em.  And so there had been a fight.  One lady had an arm broken.  I don't know if the other lady broke it or the police bro- I don't know what happened.  So they took us both to the hospital--took us to the hospital.  And so as we riding--first when they were going to the police car I had my hair in braids, I'd twist in 'em, and I had a pencil stuck in 'em and the police yanked my hair and took the pencil and said, "Niggers, they ain't got no business, niggers ain't got no business with no pencil in there."  They yanked my hair and they yanked it hard enough they pulled the pencil out.  But they actually pulled out a shank of hair (laughter).  And so we got in his police car and we're sitting in the back of the car and they started to say things like to each other, say, "We ought to push her out of this car and shoot her and say she tried to escape."  I was looking at this other lady and I was thinking if they try to push me out, what is there that I can hold on to.  'Cause, you know, I'm thinking these people may really push me out and shoot me.  And they kept and finally we got to the hospital.  They walked around and checked all the windows and act like I was going escape from the hospital.  Like I was a real--and I had borrowed--I was arrested in a dress and I had borrowed from one of the trustees a pair of pants and a shirt and so that's what I had on.  The pants were kind of ripped and so they went all around and they were--they were doing that.  Then the doctors--I saw the doctor.  They gave me two shots, probably penicillin or something.  I don't know what they were.  But they were hard shots, I mean I bruised so much on my hips from those--those shots.  And then they took me back.  Now that's the only time that I've been, you know, physically touched or anything like that.
Story_ID: 372821
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about--now the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] interviewed you?
Speaker 2: The FBI interviewed me when I was in--in--in jail that summer.
Speaker 1: In jail, okay.  Now what did they--what did they ask you?
Speaker 2: They wanted to know how I had been treated, who arrested me, what I was doing and just sort of general kinds of questions.  I think they had interviewed me earlier that summer also because I had been arrested with a group of students, there were demonstrations in Jackson [Mississippi].  And I had been arrested and all--everybody had been taken to the fairgrounds and we--they wanted us to--we ate and they wanted us to dip these dishes in water and I refused to do that.  So they took me and separated me out and took me and locked me up in the--in the--I believe the city jail.  I don't believe I went to the county, I believe I was in the city jail.  I was there for three or four days that time.  And then when I was arrested for littering, I was there.  Not many--I was sick, so I was probably only there about three days.  I don't remember being there too.  I was arrested maybe on a Friday, so Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night.  I believe I got out on a Monday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have a feeling that the FBI was trying to protect you or wha- what were they doing?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm suspicious my nature.  I'm suspicious.  I was--in my upbringing I think I was brought up to be almost suspicious of anybody I wasn't related to by blood.  I mean it's strange kind of way that southerners are--and--and--and people that you are close to in your family.  So I did--didn't know, I was surprised that they came.  I don't know how they--I guess somebody in the office [of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)] called them and told them that they had me, and they came and they interviewed me.  They wanted to know who the people were, how they looked.  I remember telling 'em, I don't--they were just white men.  I didn't know what they--and they're just white, looked like regular--other white people that I'd seen.
Speaker 1: This is after you got out, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh they interviewed me while I was in jail.  The ca--
Speaker 1: While you were in there.  And they asked you about who arrested you?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  They asked me questions about that.
Speaker 1: That seems curious 'cause it seems like they would know.  They were right there.
Speaker 2: But that's--that's what they--
Speaker 1: There aren't that many officers in Clarksdale [Mississippi] are there?
Speaker 2: It was Jackson, Mississippi.  I was in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In Jackson, well even in Jackson?
Speaker 2: So that--they did--they asked me that and I think that they were the people who told them that they needed to take me to a doctor because I was pretty sick.
Story_ID: 372822
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea, now by 19--I guess '63 [1963] was SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] like the major group there or did you still not really make a distinction between who was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I made--by then I made the distinction.
Speaker 1: What--was Ella Baker there in those days?
Speaker 2: Ella Baker was in Atlanta [Georgia].  But SNCC by 1963, all of the organization--organizing in Mississippi actually starting about 1961, sixty--the all organ--organizing Mississippi was done by SNCC.  You had NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], they--they were--they were mostly, I think, looking for legal cases and cases that they could take to court.  But the actual grassroots were--in Mississippi--was done by SNCC.  I don't even--I know Annelle Ponder worked for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and there were people who went to the voter education project and I think that was SCLC.  But the sloshing around on plantations trying to get people registered to vote and to organize people and communities was done by SNCC.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember how--how--how it was done?  I mean, how--what--what would you do, you know, just kind of give us an example now?  When you were sloshing around up to somebody's house and?
Speaker 2: Well you walk up to their house, knock on the door and they tell you to come in or sit down, have a seat on the on the porch, you sit on the porch.  And you start talking to 'em.  You tell 'em what their rights are and they think about and they might decide, well they don't want to do that, they don't wanna get--or they may think well maybe I'll think about it.  You go back and see 'em.  And that was basically what you did.  You had to have patience.  I didn't do a lot of that.  I had the misfortune of knowing how to type and be pretty good at it.  So I did a lot of work in offices which probably was okay for me.  But that's how it was done.  You went to their houses.  You visited.  I mean it was slow, very slow and it really wore on people, because it was kind of work, it was grinding.  You know, you were doing the same thing over and over and sometimes you didn't get anybody registered.  I mean after weeks of working you'd only have a few people registered.  So it was grinding.
Story_ID: 372823
Speaker 1: And then I--I worked for the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] that summer.  That fall, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] had gotten some kind of money.  He had a professor in Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] named Dr. Blyth [John W. Blyth] and Bob had gotten some kind of money and he wanted--he had approached me.  They were--had this project called, it's called the Literacy Project.  It was to develop program learning materials to teach adult illiterates how--so adult illiterates could teach themselves how to read.  Casey Hayden and Doris Derby, John O'Neal and an artist named Lee Jack Morton and me.
Speaker 2: Now is this the summer of '64 [1964]? Now what this is?
Speaker 1: This is the starting of fall of '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Okay, fall of '63 [1963].  We worked on this project.  It was out at Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi].  We worked on the campus.  We and Casey and Doris Derby lived across the street from the Tougaloo campus in a little white house on County Line Road.  It's still there, it still looks exactly like it looked when we lived in it.  And we'd walk across the street to where we'd write these little program learning frames.  John O'Neal has told me--'cause I was curious about where he lived.  He said he lived in Jackson [Mississippi] so he came out.  And John O'Neal, we all worked on this project around May because there was planning for the summer.  They decided--Dr. Blyth I guess was the head of the project, decided that the project should be moved to New York.  I left the project at that point.  Casey had already left.  Casey Hayden, that's who I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Now she was white, right?
Speaker 1: She was white.  She had already left.
Story_ID: 372824
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there very many white activists with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point, quite a few.  I mean not--there were like people who had been there since the beginning.  People like James Stanwich [ph.], Casey Hayden, Bob Zellner, I can't think of this boy's other name, his last name was Shirah [Samuel C. Shirah, Jr.].  But, you know, people like that.  They were people who had been there.  Quite, quite often southern whites.  I think somehow southern whites fit in better.  There was something, northern whites appeared too aggressive or too bossy.  You know, I--southerners have a different way of behaving I guess.  So, yeah, there were qui--
Speaker 1: I mean who--who was that the most valuable in relationship to--was that a valuable relationship to organizing the black people or diffusing the white criticism?
Speaker 2: Well no, they stirred up the white criticism.  But they were probably--they were just have been there for a long time.  I think the first time I am conscious of a lot of white people coming down is when Al Lowenstein [Allard K. Lowenstein] had these law students to come down.  And I'm mixed up about years.  I--I know it couldn't--'cause I wasn't there in the summer of '62 [1962].  So it must've been in the summer of '63 [1963].  There were a lot of law students, white law students that came down.  And I think that's the first time they worked, believe that November, on that mock election.  You know, Al Lowenstein was shot and killed by Dennis Sweeney.  Al Lowenstein went to [U.S.] Congress and was actually killed by, I think, a young man named Dennis Sweeney who was also white who had been involved in--in SNCC or involved in the summer project or--
Speaker 1: So they were both in the summer project at one time?  And Sweeney killed Lowenstein (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Al Lowenst- actually it was after that, it was after Al Lowenstein had gone back to--to New York or--
Speaker 1: So this was years later?
Speaker 2: It was--it wasn't that many years later, but it was like, yeah it was later, a few years later.
Speaker 1: Oh is that, I think that--I read a book about Mary King called 'Freedom Song' ['Freedom Song: A Personal Story of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement'] I think is the--is this--
Speaker 2: Okay and do you--probably when you read Mary King's book, 'cause I--I'm actually mentioned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think there's--is part of that, well was--wasn't Sweeney cra- well he had had some mental problems, right?
Speaker 2: Maybe he did.  See I didn't know him that well.
Speaker 1: And I think that what--I think that's what she's saying and I think that some people, she and Casey Haden and some others had kind of noticed that something was wrong with him.  But he, you know, it had finally, you know, exploded.
Speaker 2: Just exp- yeah.  So it could've been.  You know, I'm not--'cause I didn't know him that well.  I didn't know him that well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the book's called 'Freedom Song' by Mary King.
Speaker 2: And I think in there she mentions that Casey might mention something about me and Doris [Doris Derby] 'cause we were--we shared that house together when we worked on the Literacy Project.
Speaker 1: Doris?
Speaker 2: Derby.
Speaker 1: Derby, okay.  Okay, all right.  So, yeah that's a strange story.
Story_ID: 372825
Speaker 1: As you all you approached--so you were working, you were training people for the literacy test of--?
Speaker 2: Well we were trying to.  I don't know how successful that project [Literacy Project] ever was, but the one good thing about that project, we received a actual paycheck every month.  A real paycheck, not nine dollars and sixty-four cents.  It wasn't a lot, maybe it was fifty or sixty dollars a week, it might have been like two hundred dollars a month, but it was a real paycheck.  And so it gave you a little money and that was nice to have a little money and you could still do your other COFO [Council of Federated Organizations], they were organizing COFO.  You could still do--do that work.  And then Dr. Blyth [John W. Blyth] decided to move the project.
Story_ID: 372826
Speaker 1: COFO [Council of Federated Organizations] was like--like--like a--
Speaker 2: Umbrella.
Speaker 1: For all the organizations that were working down there including SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was, but it was really SNCC.  Dave Dennis worked for CORE and Matt, Mateo Francisco Suarez [Mateo "Flukie" Suarez] worked, they were CORE workers.  I don't know, I can't think of anybody else for CORE, and I can't actually think, I do think of Annelle Ponder when I think of SCLC.  But--and I'm not real clear on who was working for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So I don't really remember that.  'Cause I always thought of the summer project of the COFO was--the whole idea was to organize entire community and bring all these, but it was a SNCC project, it was basically SNCC.  I don't know if other people think that, but that's what I think.
Speaker 1: One thing when you read about it you're pretty much guessing what's the initiative of SNCC and the others, you know, without leaving 'em out, they just brought 'em in to cover them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you around when they made the decision to bring all the--to--to make it a big project?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  We went to meetings and people argued against it.  People argued.  I think we had a meeting in Greenville [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Who was for it and who was against it?
Speaker 2: You know, I think Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] was really for it and I think that there were a lot of SNCC field secretaries that were against it.  But if my memory serves me correct, I believe people like Mrs. Hamer might have been for it.  It's kind of hard, my memory is not--not that great anymore.  But--
Speaker 1: You're talking about Fannie Lou Hamer, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And--but people argued.  I remember people--plus we had these meetings and they lasted forever.  It was like by consensus you had to come to a consensus.  It was like true democracy.  Everybody got to say something that wanted to say something.   And these meetings could go on for hours, it's participatory to democracy, and I thought oh.  But they would go on and on and I never had a thing to say, but there were some people that just had a lot to say and they just go on.  And then Bob would speak.  And he would speak very softly and then people would have to be quiet if they wanted to hear what he was saying.  And I don't know when we reached a consensus to bring these people down.  And I have often thought about that in retrospect and wondered if that was not the beginning of the end of SNCC.  Because things changed.  Relationships changed.  I--that summer I left Mississippi at the end, maybe it was the first week in September of 1964 and I never worked for SNCC again.  I just figured that was it for me.  The summer I thought had been difficult.  It wasn't as difficult for me as other people, because I'd had that house out there on County Line Road, and it's a three-bedroom house.  Casey [Casey Haden] had gone and Doris Derby had gone.  People came, you know, from--people coming in, they'd send them out there to stay.  At first I was working in a COFO office.  You know, I had a specific assignment.  I was working in the COFO office.  And then the Freedom House was bombed in McComb [Mississippi].  And Bob Moses asked me, what did I think about going to McComb teaching Freedom School and I told him sure.  And I went to McComb and I finished up the summer.  I lived in the house belonged to Eileen Quinn and I taught Freedom School.  And at the end of summer I left.
Story_ID: 372827
Speaker 1: I know from what I've read, at the beginning of the summer is when they--they kind of--well I guess before the summer started, the made a call for college students to come.  So a lot of white and black college students came down?
Speaker 2: Came.  It was a lot of white students.  And some black college students.  I don't know what percentage.  'Cause I did some recruiting.  I remember going to Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] and Mississippi Valley [Mississippi Valley State College; Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi] and some other schools.  I remember writing a letter and I actually have a copy of the letter that I got when I sent for the stuff from the sovereign commission [Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission].  They have copy of the letter.  I had forgotten I ever wrote the letter and I realize when I looks this letter I misspelled enclose.  Every time I look at that, I--oh my God how I could've done that.
Speaker 1: Did you spell it with an I or something?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Spelled with an I, yeah I did, I did, I did that.  And I have such an eye for misspelled words, but how could I do--do something like that.  But yes.  So we tried to recruit black students.  I don't know how many black southern students, you know.  And I--I think the movement changed.  Because before, you know the field secretaries were local black people often, and people who had been in and around SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] for a long time.  Then when all these people from the North came, especially white people from the North, you know, the cameras were following them around and--and suddenly you felt like they were authorities or they felt like they were authorities and I think that was some friction.  That, that--
Speaker 1: Yeah and I've read about that, that there was--was some.  Now, now there was a training before they--well some came down without the training, but--
Speaker 2: There was a training--
Speaker 1: --did you know Goodman [Andrew Goodman], Schwerner [Michael Schwerner] and Chaney [James Chaney]?
Speaker 2: I knew, I didn't know Goodman.  I knew Schwerner very well and I knew Chaney very well because I had been down in Meridian [Mississippi] two or three different times to their project.  I had gone down there with Matt Suarez.  I called him Flukie [Mateo "Flukie" Suarez].  So--
Speaker 1: Flukie?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that's what I called him.  I think everybody else probably did too.  But I think maybe as a sixty, seventy-year-old man he mi- probably wanted to be called Matt (laughter).
Speaker 1: He was sixty-something years old at that time?
Speaker 2: No, he was, you know, now he, now he is.  But I had--so I had been--I knew--knew--knew Rita [Rita Schwerner Bender] and Su- and I knew Cheney.  'Cause I knew them, but I didn't know Goodman at all.
Story_ID: 372828
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when you found out what happened or did you--did you?
Speaker 2: I remember what night that they went missing.   I had met a man named Buford Posey.
Speaker 1: Buford Posey, now that's the--is that the--no that's not the same, okay go ahead.
Speaker 2: I had met this man.  I told you I lived in this house on County Line Road out across the street from Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi].  This man came to speak.  He said he was a ex-Buddhist monk to speak at Tougaloo or at one of their somethings.   So he was from Neshoba County [Mississippi].  And so he came to get a Volkswagen and he came to our house in--on, you know, out on County Line Road.  So when the--that night when the young men were missing, I believe, I'm not sure if it was Casey Hayden or somebody who was in town in Jackson [Mississippi] at the COFO [Council of Federated Organizations] office called me.  They wanted to try to find out how to get in touch with Buford Posey.  I didn't know how to get in touch with him, but I think he is a relative of somebody who might have been involved in that murder.  But we had met him before.  Just recently asked somebody about him, maybe John or I don't know who I asked.  But I asked somebody about him.  And I think he's still living.  Buford Posey from Neshoba County.
Speaker 1: Wha- wha- what county is that?
Speaker 2: Neshoba County.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I don't know how to spell (laughter) Neshoba.  I just know--
Speaker 1: Is it Neshoba?
Speaker 2: --it's Neshoba County.  It's where Philadelphia, Mississippi, it's a county that Schwerner [Michael Schwerner] and Goodman [Andrew Goodman] and Chaney [James Chaney] ended up missing in.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so, this was a cloud hanging over the project before it really got off the ground?
Speaker 2: I think--I think it might have been.  Although, you know, the project hit the ground running.  I don't know if, because there was a lot of argument against it.  I don't know if it was really a cut--'cause I think people were so busy, they didn't have time to--to--I guess we actually didn't have time to carry grudges.  And also people in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] were very close, the people were very close.  So but I do think soon after people started to come that there were problems, with people coming and not tell you.  You know, you've been doing this all of this time, how--how this should be done or you know, it was--it was difficult.
Speaker 1: It's interesting, some of the--I know a lot of them were trained here, near--near here in--
Speaker 2: In O--
Speaker 1: --in Oxford [Ohio], Western College, it was Western College for Women which is now closed, but trained--trained to be in Oxford.
Speaker 2: They were in Oxford.  But even that training--
Speaker 1: Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] was up here and [HistoryMaker] James Forman and others here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I don't know.  Probably most people were fine.  It's probably just--and it could be just perception.  I don't know.  It could be just the way northerners talk.  It could just be any number of things that, but there was certainly difficulty, because, you know, in less than two years SNCC was breaking up.  And that was--they expelled for some people, expelled the white people from the movement.  I was--I--I was not involved at that time, 'cause I left in--in '64 [1964].  I think first of September (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that summer of '64 [1964]
Story_ID: 372829
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that summer of '64 [1964] did--did you--now you did a lot of office work you said and did you--
Speaker 2: And I taught Freedom School in McComb [Mississippi].  I taught Freedom School in McComb.
Speaker 1: Did--did you go to the Democratic National Convention [Atlantic City, New Jersey] in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: No.  I did not go to the Democratic National Convention.  In fact, what did I do?  I must've gone to New York [New York].  I think that's 'cause I left and I went to New York, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Was it on a SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] mission?
Speaker 2: No, I went to stay.  Never to come return.  My intention was never ever to return.
Speaker 1: Now what--why were you--what--what really turned you off about that.  I know there was a lot of tension to have some--with all the different kinds of people down there and what was going on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--it wasn't that because I'm fairly--I'm actually pretty easy to get along with and I'm fairly self-contained.  You know, I don't need any extra company or anything.  So, I just think it was just difficult I think, the young men that were murdered, that was difficult.  I think, just difficult and I thought I'm leaving and I'm not coming back.  And I left and I went to New York City.  I thought well I'll go and I'll study art.  I like--like art.  That'll give me something that I like doing.  I went to New York and I found various little jobs.  I worked for American Group Psychotherapy Association because Morty Schiff's wife or ex-wife was executive secretary.  So I worked there.
Speaker 1: So it was through connections you made in SNCC that you got--
Speaker 2: Through, through, through connections.  Then I worked for the Law Students for Civil Rights, and they have been down.  Then I worked for Harlem Le- Legal Defense Committee and that was Paul Chevigny, have you ever heard of him?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: He wrote, he's written a couple books, but one of the books that I find kind of interesting was about getting the cabaret laws changed in New York City.  I worked for him.  And that summer of 1965 I worked for Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee.  I went down to Shreveport, Louisiana and opened an office for them.  They had--CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] had projects in Louisiana and they needed attorneys.  And they had these rotating attorneys coming.  One of the attorneys that I met was Stanley Tolliver [HistoryMaker Stanley Tolliver, Sr.].  He told me that you already interviewed him.  He was the only black attorney, I think, that I met down there that summer was him.  And so--and then I went back to New York after that.  I never--then I went to Atlanta [Georgia], I believe, in 1966.  SNCC was still, but it was in it's last throes I think in 1996--I mean 1966.
Speaker 1: I think by then, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] had to leave the country, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah Bob had--
Speaker 1: He--he was in Tanzania I think by then?
Speaker 2: Someplace and I think people had just scattered.  I think they were probably suffering from battle fatigue because it was certainly a battle.  And I think the stress of just--I think, you know, it was very stressful for some people.
Story_ID: 372830
Speaker 1: On a number of different levels.  I've heard that it was like a--well you indicated a clash of cultures.  You had a lot of northern college students coming to the South and then not really knowing how they ought to behave in the South, and you know, good intention, but down there in a situation they've never been in and you know, there's just a lot, I heard there were conflicts of--of male-female kind of things and there was problems with white women, you know, dealing with the black men.  I heard there was a lot of anger about that.  I don't know.  I mean it's a lot of--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  There--there was, I'm sure, some because, you know, when you do that black rhetoric about being so black and then you being as intimate as you can get with other human beings, I just--I find that kind of hypocritical.  But somehow that never bothered me particular.  I guess because I didn't have any interest in--in the men that they--they were involved with.  'Cause I cared very much about all--most of 'em, the men that I knew from SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  Some of 'em I was closer to than others.  I don't think I have ever met or ever will meet a finer group of men.  I think the male-female tension was overblown and I think that's a result of Casey [Casey Hadyen] and where King's [Mary King]--what was it called--position paper ['Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo,' Mary King and Casey Hayden].  And I don't think--I just think it was overblown.  Because I think, as a person, that had I not been involved with SNCC and hadn't had an opportunity to--to do--to do those things, I think I would've been a very different kind of person.  I probably--I think it opened me up to new experiences.  I am more outgoing, more outreaching.  I think in a way, it liberated me.  It didn't just give me freedom from oppression from white people, or from a white South, but it freed me from oppression that African American or southern women might experience or--I'm no longer reticent.  I was just so--so I think SNCC really liberated me in a way.  That's--I think I'm different from what I would've been, a--a lot different.
Story_ID: 372831
Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to ask you about the--what you felt at that time after having worked all summer on the Mississippi freedom project [Mississippi Summer Project] and help--help 'em form the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  What did you feel about the convention [1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey], I know you followed it from what end, so what did you think about it after the politicians kind of snubbed the party, even after the white Mississippi delegation walked out, they didn't let the black delegation or the mixed delegation take the seats?
Speaker 2: Well first thing, I wasn't surprised.  I didn't expect them to get seated.  I didn't even expect 'em to get one--one seat.  Because I know that the South is not that different from the North.  I had been in the North enough times to see segregated neighborhoods.  But I spent a lot of time in Chicago [Illinois], so I knew how northerners felt.  So I wasn't surprised.  I think other people were surprised.  And since I wasn't surprised I didn't probably feels the same kind of anger and hurt.  I was very proud of Mrs. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer] though for refusing that one seat and how she represented black womanhood.  And there--I just thought she was just elegant and I just, that's how I felt about it 'cause I wasn't surprised.  There was nothing surprising happened.
Speaker 1: I--I think she said we didn't come down here for a crumb, you know?
Speaker 2: That's right and come all the way here for one seat.  Then she wanted the whole delegation seated.  No, I wasn't surprised.  See I wasn't surprised.  I think people who expected that they would be seated.  So I--it was what I expected.
Speaker 1: So did you observe a lot of disappointment on the part of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] staff (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some people were disappointed and I think younger people might've been disappointed and maybe even, but I don't think hardened, people who had been around SNCC a long time were disappointed.  I think people--it was pretty much--it was a challenge and I think the outcome was probably what they expected.  I'm--I was surprised that they even offered one seat.  Because always the South had--the Democrat Party had courted the southern Democrat Party.  They always courted that party.  It had remained apart, you know, in the South until shoot, I don't know.  I remember when, I think it was 1963 or something when this man, Rubel Phillips ran for governor on the Republican ticket as a white guy.  That was the first time that I had ever heard of a white Republican.  The only Republicans that I knew about were black Republicans.  There wasn't that many of--of those.  So the South only started to be Republican after the civil rights bill, probably after 1965 at all.  So I wasn't surprised.  Because they had tolerated people like Strom Thurmond and Eastland [James Eastland], and Stennis [John C. Stennis] of Mississippi.  I can't think of anybody else.  The governors, the very racist governors were always Democrats.  My mom [Willie Long Anderson] used to talk about Bilbo [Theodore G. Bilbo], how he used to talk about black women and black people.  So I just, no I wasn't surprised.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 372832
Speaker 1: Some people seemed to be surprised that a person like Hubert Humphrey would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Didn't surprise me.
Speaker 1: --would be telling, you're going too far, why don't you just cool out and just accept this little seat [at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey], and you know.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't surprise me.  'Cause I had always been taught you scratch below the surface.  I had always been taught that.  So I was not surprised.  What might have surprised me is that there were black people thinking that Mrs. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer] should have accepted that.  And I'm, you know, I don't know SCLC's [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] position on that.  But I seem to have read that there were black organizations like maybe the Urban League [National Urban League] and organizations thinking that she should have accepted that.  I know--what was the attorney, Joe Raul--
Speaker 1: Joseph Raul from the United Auto Workers [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I think, didn't he abandon Mrs. Hamer's position, I think he did.
Speaker 1: Well they--he was in a--on the floor by himself and they said that they just, you know, outmaneuvered him.  He was there, you know, everybody else is across the street listening to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Hubert Humphrey telling that they were asking for too much, yeah, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I never really knew what Dr.--Dr.--
Speaker 1: Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] thought that Raul betrayed 'em, but Raul says he really didn't, so I don't know.
Speaker 2: That he didn't, because I was thinking that he might have and Hubert Humphrey that didn't--didn't surprise me.  'Cause you know what, they've always backed away.  When it's down to crunch time, politicians back away, they really do.  And I mean, you see that now.
Speaker 1: It was a--yeah, that certainly was American crunch time.  It was--Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] did not know that he would be re-elected by a landslide in '64 [1964].  When--during, you know, during that campaign, he didn't know it.
Speaker 2: No he didn't.
Speaker 1: He's trying to make sure he covered all the bases.
Speaker 2: Yeah he was trying to make sure.  And he did not want Mrs. Hamer on television.  He didn't want to see that.  He didn't want the nation to see it.  And people were able to see her.  And I think those of us who saw her, it was a blessing.
Story_ID: 372833
Speaker 1: Now did you--do you have any reflexes of--reflections of Ella Baker at all?
Speaker 2: I met Ms. Baker two or three times.  I was not one of those people who was close to her.  I--my reflections of her, I thought she was a very strong woman.  A very bright woman, extremely sophisticated about politics.  And these were areas that I didn't know very much about.  And I never felt that I was particularly well educated.  You know, I--I--somehow I had been lead to believe that everything up north was better.  So if you were educated in the North (laughter) you were better educated than if you were educated in the South.  And so I never really talked to Ella Baker.  Because I didn't think I had anything to talk about that would be interesting.  And--and so I never approached her, you know, but I just in--just a very casual kind of hello how are you conversation, one of the few times that I went to Atlanta [Georgia] to the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office and I saw her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Story_ID: 372834
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections of [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry 'cause I think he was chairman of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in '64 [1964] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what, I thought very highly of Marion Barry.  And when I talk about Marion Barry I try to get my students to see him like I saw him.  Young, radical, very bright, he was a chemistry major, very committed.  So those really my reflections on him.  I thought highly of him and I did think, you know, I think--I don't think people should ever be judged by us.  I think you should be judged by your entire life, not just what's difficult or what you do badly, because we all do parts of our lives badly.  It's just not always in the newspaper or the television or on camera as we're doing it.  So I--I thought he was bright and I thought he was--I thought he was committed, I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's interesting that he and Ivanhoe Donaldson, two SNCC people really organized D.C. [Washington, D.C.] city government, really (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I just absolutely, Ivanhoe I really admire, absolutely admire.  I think--now that's another person I think was one of the brightest people I ever met in my entire lifetime.  You know, yeah, I thought he was extremely bright.  Thought very highly of Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture].  I didn't know a lot of other people that--well but I would see Stokely periodically when he came through here.  But I certainly did.  Marion Barry was--was--was bright, bright.
Story_ID: 372835
Speaker 1: Were you in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] when Malcolm X spoke, you know, to the SNCC group and that--you?
Speaker 2: I wasn't there when he spoke to the SNCC group.  I was in New York (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you didn't meet him?
Speaker 2: --and I went to hear him speak a couple of times.  In fact, one time I went up to hear him speak, Mrs. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer] spoke at the--at his meeting it was like on a Sunday.  So yes I heard him speak, but I did not hear him talk to SNCC.
Story_ID: 372836
Speaker 1: After--well when you went to New--New York you worked--you said you ended up in Louisiana, last I think chron- chronologically as far as we got, we--we had you in Louisiana working for--
Speaker 2: LCDC, Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so how long did you do that?
Speaker 2: I did it for a summer, it was just for a summer.  I was working for Law Students for Civil Rights and Henry Schwarzschild I think who worked for ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] I believe, I'm not sure about that anymore.  But he asked me if I would be interested in doing this and I said it sounds interesting.  'Cause I had also received a--a--an invitation or offer to come to Mississippi I think and work on Head Start or something.  But I had said I would never go back and so I didn't want to go back.  So I went to Louisiana, I went to Shreveport.  And I think--I think they paid me, what, fifty dollars a week or something and my--not much.
Speaker 1: So this is 1965, '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: It's 1965 when I worked at Shreveport.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so what happened next, when you--you were there--there how long?
Speaker 2: I was there for the entire summer.  I went back to New York and I was in New York 'til I believe February of 1966 and I went to Atlanta [Georgia].  And I worked for Southern Regional Council [Atlanta, Georgia] because I needed a job that paid money and I--I don't think SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was paying anything.  I don't think they had any money.  But I was--I worked for Southern Regional Council.  I left Southern Regional Council and worked for National Sharecroppers Fund for two or three months.  Jack Wasserman was the--the director of--or executive for that.
Story_ID: 372837
Speaker 1: And then, I came to Yellow Springs [Ohio] and that's where I've been ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay, so in 1967 or so you, what was it?
Speaker 1: I came to Yellow Springs actually in 1966, the end--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah around Labor Day.
Speaker 2: See Yellow Springs.  Well you got here just in time for the black students to take over the a--one of the buildings (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: If I'm not mistaken, they called it Umoja House [Nyambi Umoja] and took over a building at Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio], I don't know if you?
Speaker 1: Because I went when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  I demonstrated with Antioch students down on Xenia Avenue, we blocked traffic.
Speaker 2: That's '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: That was '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Well, how did you finally get Yellow Springs after being involved in--?
Speaker 1: I didn't find it.  McCray [HistoryMaker Willie McCray] had come up here for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or doing something for SNCC and had been at Antioch.  And somehow, Ernest Morgan had offered him a job.
Speaker 2: You're talking about Willie McCray, okay, now this is your husband, Willie McCray, okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's a--
Speaker 2: And when--when did you all meet?
Speaker 1: We met in New York after I came back from Shreveport [Louisiana].  He was still--he was living next door in what at that time was a SNCC apartment.  [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry had lived in that apartment.  And he--when I came back, he was gone, he and Reggie Robinson were living there when I left to go to Shreveport.  I sublet my apartment, I lived next door.  But I--that apartment came up empty.  And I don't know how I knew Marion Barry was looking for an apartment, but somehow they ended up moving next door and it became a SNCC apartment.  Because wherever SNCC people lived, it had a way of becoming a SNCC apartment.  My apartment was never a SNCC apartment, it was my apartment.  So when I met him he was living next door--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when I came back.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you all got together in New York and then he--he came to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  And then he went back, he went back to Atlanta [Georgia].  And then a few months later I went to Atlanta.
Story_ID: 372838
Speaker 1: And Charles Morgan [Charles Morgan, Jr.] was working on [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond's case at his law office.  And I needed a job and I don't know if I called Julian, but somehow I ended up going down there to type.  And I told you, I could type.  I was just typing away pretty.  And this man from Southern Regional Council [Atlanta, Georgia] came through and asked me if I would like to take a--a typing test.  I remember typing for Charles Morgan.  I was typing, he was going to pay me four dollars an hour, that's when that was a lot of money.  So I was real happy about--about that.  But it was just for that particular thing.  And so I went up and took the typing test and I started to work for Southern Regional Council.  And I worked for--while I worked for Southern Regional Council I worked for a woman named Margaret Long who was a writer in residence at Southern Regional Council.  She was a southern white woman who had worked for newspapers.  And I also worked for Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] indirectly 'cause my job--my duties were split.  I worked for Margaret Long probably more than I did anybody else.  But I worked for her and I worked a little bit for Vernon Jordan, basically his secretary.  I did things that probably she didn't want to do.  And I worked and then I left and when to National Sharecroppers Fund.
Speaker 2: Now this is in?
Speaker 1: Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: In Atlanta, okay, there you go.
Speaker 1: I think I was there all of nine months and I had two jobs.  I probably worked at one six months and the other three months.
Story_ID: 372839
Speaker 1: But in '66 [1966] you moved to Yellow Springs [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you--who did you work for here or did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I worked for Fels Research Institute [Samuel S. Fels Research Institute, Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: F-E-L-S, like the soap.
Speaker 1: And what--what did Fels Research do?
Speaker 2: Fels Research had, at the time that I worked for 'em, had the longest longitudinal study of growth and development of any other place in the United States.  They measured the density of bone.  They had people come back year after year and they measured the cortex.  And it was, I guess scie- growth and development, scientific research.  'Cause the man that I worked for, Dr. Israel [ph.], he did research on dental facial research.  That's what I worked on.  I worked there about two and a half years I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's through 1966 and--
Speaker 2: I started working.  I actually started working at Fels in February 1967.  The reason I'm pretty sure it's February, I ended up there I had been on a fetal study and I went to the--when I was pregnant I went to this study and after I had the baby, they came picked us up and went to the study and they asked me what I was planning to do and I told 'em I was looking for a job.  And they said go down, take your resume down to Erma [ph.].  And I didn't have a resume, so I went down and she took this information.  And then she called me on the phone to come in for an interview.  And Dr. Israel interviewed me and he wanted to know if I could draw and I could draw, and wanted to know if I could type and I could type.  They wanted to know if I was good in math and I said I was, but it's simple arithmetic (laughter) I am, but I didn't know anything about statistics, and so I did those a couple times and that was the end of that.  And--but I continued to type and draw 'cause computers didn't--couldn't do that then, you know, draw--do these little charts and graphs and draw bones and stuff like that.  That's what--that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.  So, now did you--so what did your husband [HistoryMaker Willie McCray] do when you were doing that?
Speaker 2: He worked at Antioch, it was called Antioch Bookplate, but now it's called Antioch Publishing [Antioch Publishing Company, Yellow Springs, Ohio].  But that's where--because that's where his job was.  That's what he came up here to do, to work, to work there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he worked in the printing trade as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah he did.  At that time, that's what he did.

Speaker 1: --You went back to school, I guess?
Speaker 2: I went back to school.  I started going back to school actually when I was at Fels [Samuel S. Fels Research Institute, Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].  I worked for a really good boss.  He would let me--I started going to Wright State [Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] when he was, it was like four buildings or something and he would let me leave at three o'clock three days a week to--to work on my degree.
Speaker 1: So this is '67 [1967] or?
Speaker 2: This would've been probably--it probably started--I finished my degree in '73 [1973].  So it could've actually been six--'68 [1968], '69 [1969] when I was going back to school.  But then, he was leaving to get a Ph.D.  He was a dentist.  He was a periodontist, but he had already gotten a master's degree in something and he decided he needed a Ph.D.  And so he was gonna leave and I decided well I'm gonna leave too 'cause I'll never find another boss like this.  And I started to teach.  I taught public school in Springfield [Ohio].
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: I started teaching in Springfield probably 1970, I'm not--'69 [1969], '70 [1970] somewhere.
Speaker 1: Now did you--had you graduated from Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had graduated Jackson State in '63 [1963].  I mean I finished, I stayed, I had promised my mother [Willie Long Anderson] I would stay 'til I did--did graduate from Jackson State, I think it's 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're going to Wright State to work on a master's degree?
Speaker 2: I was working on a master's at Wright State and then I taught school in Springfield city--Springfield city system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did you teach in the Springfield city system?
Speaker 2: Too long.  I take that back.  I loved it, I actually did.  I taught--I taught about twenty-nine years.  I taught a long time.
Speaker 1: That is--that is a long time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I never tell my students how long I taught.  I never want--they wanna know how old I am and I don't wanna 'em to know.  So I keep that--they already think I'm old enough.  But if I told 'em how old I was they'd just really think I was about one foot in the grave.  So I--I don't ever tell them dates about anything, because they try to figure out the answer.  Well what year was that (laughter)?  How old were you in 1961, I've never told them.
Story_ID: 372841
Speaker 1: Has it been pre- pretty quiet since that time or is there anything sig- you know, that--
Speaker 2: That I've since that time?
Speaker 1: --yeah, I mean in--in terms of teaching school.  And have you--have you remained sort of an activist in--
Speaker 2: Actually I have not.  I have not been an activist.  For a long time I was just raising my children [Malcolm McCray and Lawrence McCray].  And then I left--when I--actually as strange as this may seem, I haven't thought about the Civil Rights Movement 'til I went down in 1964.  I really haven't given it any thought.  It was like, somebody else had done it.
Speaker 1: You mean in '94 [1994], '94 [1994] when they had the thirtieth anniversary of the sum--the Freedom Summit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, '94 [1994].  Yeah and I went down, that's the first time I started to think about it again.  And I started thinking about it 'cause [HistoryMaker] Judy Richardson--and I go--got a letter and they were trying to put a book together.  So I had to think about it to try to write a little piece for the book.  So that's when I started to think about it again.  I hadn't thought about it.  It had just been something that I had done.  'Cause I never thought that I had done anything that was that important enough to maybe talk about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know, it certainly is.  I mean, this is probably one of the most heroic chapters in--in American history you're talking about here.  So, it's something that certainly changed the face of the country.  So, did you--I mean, when did you start--I mean, do you realize that now, I mean?
Speaker 2: I start as I think about it, but even now there other people I think about.  People who actually lived there, who were going to be there, whose jobs were there, who had children and who made that kind of sacri- I didn't own a house.  I didn't own a car.  I didn't have a job.  I ran no risk, you know, of losing or of giving up anything.  I didn't have any--I didn't have anything to give up.  So I think that there were a lot of people who gave a lot.  But I think me, I did some work, but I don't think I risked anything.  I don't think I--I think of people who risk things or people who had children who, you know, people might throw bombs in their house or hurt their families.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a story that Endesha Ida Mae Holland tells in the--the movie 'Freedom On My Mind' that her mother's house was bombed--
Speaker 2: Yeah those are the kind of people--
Speaker 1: --as a result of her activities in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 2: That--that lost a lot.  Me, I lost a student loan and I was--I mean it wasn't like that ended my school career, that was just my mother [Willie Long Anderson] had to give me money.  I mean that was a sacrifice, but it wasn't the kind of sacrifice that you can't overcome, was nothing I felt just directly.  So I've--but I do think about the Civil Rights Movement as people die and I read about people who've died on lis- SNCC list's (unclear).  I spent some time with Jim Forman [HistoryMaker James Forman].  In, I believe, 2001, I went to the Freedom Riders reunion in Jackson, Mississippi.  And I went to that because when I was arraigned, I was arraigned as a Freedom Rider.  And I went to that and he was there and we had breakfast together every morning.  And that's actually out of all the time that I had been in SNCC and seen him, that was actually the first time that I really talked to him.  I'd never really talked to him.
Story_ID: 372842
Speaker 1: So I--I thought about it more and as people die, I always hope that their stories will be told, that people will know about them.  Because I probably, other than the little piece that I wrote for the book that has never been published, I probably won't write anything.  I've written a couple little things for the newspaper.  When I came back in '94 [1994] I wrote a couple things for--I wrote some for Springfield [Ohio] paper and something for the Yellow Springs [Ohio] paper.  But, you know, that's probably all I'll do.  You know, might write an article or something.  But I won't write a book.  I won't do a memoir.  But I do want people to know that there were black people involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  There were some black students, there were people like me 'cause I don't think I'm unusual, I think, you know, there were other people like me.  We may not now their names, but they existed and they were active in their communities.  And we don't see that a lot in books.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you said during a break once that you--you--after going to the thirtieth anniversary of Freedom Summit you would never go to another one of those reunions?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I'll go back.  I don't think I'll do that again.  I--there was something I found very sad about that and I'm not sure what.  Because I've been to high school reunion and I never thought I'd do that.  I went to high school reunion and just loved every bit of it.  But there was something just sort of sad.  I think I like to remember people from the Civil Rights Movement like they were, young, energetic, I don't wanna see them get old.  I don't want that to be my memory of them as--as old people.  I sort of think about 'em as like just--maybe, you know, the way people think about cowboys, you know, in th- in this country this--so that's how I think about.  And I just--I don't want 'em old in my memory.

Speaker 1: Now when did you start teaching at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].  January of 1999.
Speaker 1: And--and you teach literature and composition?
Speaker 2: I teach composition always.  I teach literature, I teach African American literature.  Sometimes I teach non-Western writers.  I teach African American writers.  I teach poetry.  What else do I teach, film and short story.  I love teaching short story.  I love teaching African American literature.  And I like teaching major African American writers.  Those are courses I love to teach when I--I don't teach 'em every semester.  Occasionally, I adjunct at Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio] Saturday school and I teach African American literature when I do that.
Story_ID: 372844
Speaker 1: Yeah, who are some of your favorite writers?
Speaker 2: Walter Mosley is my favorite.  I love his 'Easy Rawlins Mysteries' [Walter Mosely].  He's one of my favorite.  There is a young woman from Haiti called Edwidge Danticat.  She is my favorite--
Speaker 1: Say her name again?
Speaker 2: Edwidge Danticat.  I think that's how it's pronounced.
Speaker 1: I think you're right, you're right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I love--I love--I love her short stories.  There are some of them that I can't read without crying.  I mean, I just love--love the way that she writes.  I enjoy reading J. California Cooper.  I like that.  I like Toni Morrison, although I have not read her la--last book 'Love.'  I have it on my shelf but I didn't read that.  And then there's some writers that I read years ago, that I still like.  I like Richard Wright and Baldwin [James Baldwin].  I have students right now working on book reviews and I'm always real happy when they go back.  I think those were really (unclear).  But it depends too, 'cause my favorite author doesn't always remain the same, a favorite.  I go through phases.  I like Zora Neale Hurston.  You know, I didn't know her until about the '80s [1980s], so I started to read her, some of her short stories, I love her short stories, 'Sweat.'  I make my students read it whenever I'm teaching short story, just so I can hear it again.
Speaker 1: What is it about any particular author that really moves you?
Speaker 2: I like the narrative.  I like authors who tell a story, a story that I can follow that makes sense to me.  Because I always--I--I--I like story telling.  I like to hear people tell stories.  So what appeals to me is authors that tell stories where the narrative is good.  I like language.  I like rich language, but I also like sort of a spareness of--I don't like excessive words, I like a spareness also of language.  I like rich words, but not too many of them.  Kind of that's what--and I like peo- the characters.  I like to read about people who have certain kinds of bad things that happen to them, but they sort of work through those bad things and they manage to come out in a good place.  Maybe they don't stay in that place, but they work through these bad things.  I think that's what I like about J. California Cooper.  She's such--such an optimistic person where no matter what bad is happening, people are able to work through that and end up in a good place.
Story_ID: 372845
Speaker 1: What is it--I mean, give me some kind of--I guess, what are your--what's your assessment of today's students?  Now you're at Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], the oldest black college in the United States?
Speaker 2: The oldest black college in the United States.  I think they're bright.  I think they're very bright.  I think their historical backgrounds are kind of shoddy.  I think somehow high school has--I think in high school they haven't had much history.  They haven't been able to be very philosophical.  They haven't been--they haven't been encouraged to think beyond whatever is being told to them.  And I understand what happens.  They don't write a lot.  They aren't given essay exams.  Teachers are so pressed to teach to these tests that they're giving, that students are, are not allowed, they don't have the room to explore, to think about things, and to change what they think about.  So things are just very--tests where you fill in little bubbles.  So they have difficulty with writing for that reason.  And they don't read, because the reading is not something that people do for pleasure or they don't think of it as something to do for pleasure.  Black men seem to think it's not something they do.  The women in my classes are more apt to have read things that I ask about.  Men have the tendency to sort of see this as maybe something that women do.  You know, not you only read, because it's assigned to you.  They haven't discovered the--the pleasure of just--on a day like today, they have these things to read and they say, "Oh I don't wanna--I don't wanna--I can't read a book in a night."  I say, "Well, there's nothing else to do."  You can't, it's cold, you don't wanna be outside, read a book.  And so it's that they're bright, they're bright, they're--they're--they're urbane, they're sophisticated about many things, they teach me a lot.  I also learn a lot.  I think I'm much brighter as a result of our association.
Story_ID: 372846
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns about the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concern, one real co- concern that I have is the dissolution of families and of community.  I believe that community is necessary and I believe families are necessary.  And somehow we are losing that community.  There is no longer a time where you live on a street and everybody on that street knows you and knows your family.  And in a way, they have a watchful eye for you.  They see you about to get into some kind of difficulty.  They warn you that they are going to tell on you or they speak to you directly about that.  There is no real sense of--we're losing it.  I'm sure there're places where you have that sense of community, that we're losing, sense of family, belonging.  That's a concern.  The other thing that I think concerns me and what I would really hope, a lot of black people are doing really well, there is no doubt about it.  But there're a lot of black people who are not doing real well.  And I would like to see those black people who are doing really well think about those black people that are not doing very well and put themselves out, extend themselves a little bit to try and to--to do that.  Not be so obsessive about stuff, clothes, shoes, jewelry, bling-bling.  To kind of stand back and look at that and not--that's my hope.  And that our young people start to value education.  But I think as long as the whole soci- I don't think it's valued in the society, so it's kind of a lot to expect young people, but to somehow make that our focus, our education and I don't mean just going to college and getting a degree and going off to work in an office or a corporation.  I mean but to--to--to know about their history, to know about things there--in their background, to read and to understand the political system.  So, that's my hope.
Story_ID: 372847
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I would be better educated.  I would be better educated and I would take advantage of opportunities.  I cannot say I didn't have an opportunity to do this or that, there were opportunities.  But I didn't know--take advantage of them and once they're gone, they're gone.  I--I think that's what I'd do.  I would simply be better educated.
Speaker 1: Okay. And when you look back on everything that has happened at this point, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Or what I hope it will be: I was a good teacher.  I was a teacher.  I think of myself as a teacher.  And then I was hopefully a good teacher.
Story_ID: 372848
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family as it is today.  I mean, you're married to [HistoryMaker] Willie McCray.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And do you have any children?
Speaker 2: We have two [Malcolm McCray and Lawrence McCray].  And they are just--I--I they're--my children have not turned out as well as I would hope.  Like many families, they've had some trouble with drugs.  I--that's, you know, some difficulty with the law and I--I don't know exactly sure why that happened.  Then I--I don't quite understand.  So maybe if I really thought, maybe I would parent different, but I'm not exactly sure how.  Then I can't, because I have certainly searched my mind try to figure out what--how did I get it so wrong?  But I don't know.
Speaker 1: Is the--is there anything we haven't asked that--that we haven't that you think we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I--I can't think of anything that you haven't asked.
Story_ID: 372849
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Really I haven't thought about how I would like to be remembered.  I hope that--I do--I have this old superstitious notion that when people stop remembering me I'll really be dead, but as long as they remember me I'll be alive.  I'll live through that.  I would simply like for people to remember that I tried and I tried really hard at whatever it is that I was doing at the time, that I really tried hard and I tried.  Not always successful, but I tried.
Story_ID: 372850
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you this, now this is unusual to ask, but how do you think SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] will be remembered over the years?
Speaker 2: I hope that some--I hope that people will think of SNCC, you know, as the organization that I hope--I want SNCC to be remembered the same way that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is remembered.  I know you can't make it a person you can focus on and remember.  But I think SNCC, more than any other organization, changed the face of the United States.  I believe that.  I think they forced history to change.  I think eventually it would've changed, but without SNCC it would've been longer.  I think SNCC sort of invented that in your face, I'm not backing up, kind of not waiting, that impatience.  And I think only young people can be that impatient.  I think you get older you get patient.  Young people are impatient.  I would like for SNCC to be remembered as, as a major civil rights organization.  That's what I--and I would like to see people like Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] and Ivanhoe [Ivanhoe Donaldson], I'd like for my grandchildren to read about 'em in books.  Yeah, that's what I.
