JESSIE WILKERSON: This is Jessie Wilkerson, and I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee with Gay Evans, and the date is August 4, 2010. So, Gay, why don't we start by talking about your earlier years? So can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?  GAYE EVANS: I grew up in East Tennessee. I grew up in Knoxville. Early on, we lived in South Knoxville, and then we moved to what's now called Reardon. We lived in that area, and then we moved a little further west, so, pretty much within the city. But my father's people were all from Anderson County and Clinton. So that was very much a part of &#8230; My grandmother lived there, and so that was very much a part of our lives, was that connection with Anderson County. My mom was from Arkansas, and so her people were all from, as far as we know, as far as we can trace back, were from Arkansas and Texas. And then we think that I have a great grandmother who was from West Virginia. But she was disowned by her family. So we're not sure .. But in any case, I grew up here, in East Tennessee. I was born in Tyler, Texas, but I was very young when I left there, so I know nothing about it. I&#8217;ve never identified that way. I totally feel like an East Tennessee native.  JW: What did your parents do?  GE: My mother was a housewife. My father was a journalist. He went to school on the G. I. Bill at U. T., and was, I guess, one of the first persons in his family to finish college, as a lot of men in his generation were. He went to work at the old Knoxville Journal, back when it was&#8212;we had two papers back then, the Sentinel and the Journal. He worked his way up from a reporter, and then he went to work for the Associated Press for a while, and then he became the assistant city editor, and then became the city editor. Then ultimately he went to Washington and he worked there for a magazine under the Nixon administration, a magazine in the Commerce Department. He was an editor. That really was what he did. He did some reporting early on, but he mainly did editing. I guess he did a lot of hollering at people to assign them important tasks. He was, like, &#8220;Get out there and interview So-and-So!&#8221; And Mother was a housewife. That was the way of the times. Women didn&#8217;t really work outside the home that much. She did part-time things, I should say that. One year, I remember, she worked for the census, she was a census worker, and she would do things like that, but that was it.  JW: Where did you go to school, and what was that like?  GE: I went to school-- Where did I go to school, like &#8230;?  JW: Grade school.  GE: I went to grade school in South Knoxville, and I went to high school at the old Bearden High School, which used to be on Kingston Pike near the antique mall there. Of course now it's way out. It was dull. I didn't like school that much. I went to school during segregation, so it was all white. I went to all-white schools until I went to U.T., and then that was the first time I had gone to school with any African American kids or any people of color at all. And it was very, I don't know, I don't even know how to describe it. It was a public school education. It wasn't very good. I liked the music part. I liked being in choir, and the rest of it I was pretty bored with. So I don't know, I don't think that &#8230; There were a couple of teachers I really liked, and that I really responded to. One was the history teacher, and then the music teacher. But it didn't inspire me. There was nothing really about school that was -- It was fairly easy for me to make fairly good grades. I don&#8217;t think I was ever particularly challenged, I was never particularly encouraged to do better. I was never particularly encouraged to get on a particular track, or to think about, oh, here&#8217;s where your interest lies, you might want to go into music teaching, or whatever. It was just, you know, get through school.   JW: So how did you end up going to college?  GE: I guess because my dad wanted me to go to college, because he had gone to college, and he valued that. Even though I was directionless, I mean, it&#8217;s terrible now, when I think about it, it was a directionless thing. I think for women in my generation, it was like, in the South, in that particular setting, it was more like going to college until you got married, because then you were expected to drop everything else. I mean, it was part of how women were socialized in that time, was basically, everything was to prepare you to get married. It was more like, you go to college, and then you&#8217;ll get married. But I didn&#8217;t finish, and my father was very disappointed in that. But again, I didn&#8217;t like school. It&#8217;s interesting to me now, I could never really admit that until recently, that I don&#8217;t really care for school. I love to learn, I love to read, I love to talk with people, but I do not like to sit in class. Maybe if I, I don&#8217;t know, maybe if I had another kind of educational environment I might have really enjoyed it more, but I never, it was just not energizing to me.  JW: Were your parents politically active?  GE: Yeah, a little bit, yeah. The paper that my dad worked for was a very conservative Republican paper, but it was the old-line, traditional kind of Republicans, nothing like how we think of Republicans today. But it was definitely Republican. So I guess some of my political exposure was just him bringing work home, talking about various things, political campaigns, who was running for office, and so forth. And my mother would often work the polls at election time. She was really smart, and she was interested. She read a lot, she read the paper a lot, so she was always up on the political candidates and so forth. So in that way, they were politically active and aware.  JW: Since you were in school, you were a young person when the civil rights movement was going on&#8212;were you aware of that, do you remember things about it happening here, or what was your sense, or memory, of that?  GE: I was aware of it. I&#8217;m not sure &#8230; I guess that I, like so many people, saw it as a problem somewhere else, in a way. But I do remember very distinctly, there was a department store in town. Well, it&#8217;s now, the building is still there. It&#8217;s where the U. T. conference center is, down at the corner of [?] that was Millers&#8217; Department Store. I worked there for a while and I remember very clearly--.  I don&#8217;t even know what year this would have been. Anyway, I remember when they integrated the lunch counter. They had a little lunch counter grill, and I remember going down there and seeing a white guy and a black woman sitting there eating, and that was, I think, the first time it really registered in my mind about, &#8220;Oh, yeah, this is different. This is something that people have been denied.&#8221; I don&#8217;t remember ever &#8230; my grandmother was pretty, she was pretty prejudiced. My family, we were not &#8230; I think a lot of people were like this. We were not brought up to think it was wrong, that segregation was a good thing, but we were ignorant. As white people living in a racist society, the deep analysis of that race was not present. And even though my family was not bigoted in a hateful way, certainly there were a lot of things growing up in the South that you absorbed. I&#8217;m sure you were aware of that, too. And so the civil rights movement--. I just never understood at the time, being young, like, &#8220;Well, why can&#8217;t they come in and eat? Why can&#8217;t they go to school with us?&#8221; It never did make sense to me. But until I walked into that grill and saw that couple and realized what it took for people to really try to challenge those legal barriers, and those people barriers, that was the first time it really was like my &#8220;Ah-hah!&#8221; moment about what the civil rights struggle was really about. &#8216;Cause I can remember, you know, like, &#8220;Oh, my gosh!&#8221; It felt so dangerous to me. And I&#8217;m sure it did to them, my lord. Even though this was not the Deep South, it was still very, it still is, a very segregated city.  JW: How old were you?  GE: I must have been about 18, because this was after the--. It was a little later getting here than some other places. And there wasn't the attention. I mean, it&#8217;s interesting to me now to know that Clinton High School, that those young people, the Clinton 12, I think it was, or 13, who graduated in, I think it was 1957, and we didn&#8217;t know anything about that. I mean, that high school was integrated. I remember when they blew the school up, which was after that. But at the time that those students were integrating Clinton High School and then graduating, I didn&#8217;t even know anything about that. I didn&#8217;t know that was going on. So civil rights, it&#8217;s like, that really intense, what you saw on television happening in Alabama and Mississippi, that was not happening here. Other things were happening, but I felt--. It felt distant. And then the real activism didn&#8217;t come until later here in Knoxville, when people tried to integrate. Well I guess the thing at Miller&#8217;s must have been one of the starts of that, integrating the first part of the store, the lunch counter, and &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember what else.  JW: Maybe U. T. &#8230; was U. T. already integrated?  GE: Yeah, when I went to U. T., it was integrated. There were not a lot of students of color, but there were a few. I had a lab partner in Biology my freshman year. She was from Knoxville, but her family had sent her to New Jersey to go to high school, and then she came back here to go to college. And so she was the first person my own age of color that I had a relationship with. Yeah. And I was, well, I was a freshman in college. And so I knew other people of color. I knew African-Americans. I was trying to think if there were other ethnic--. I think there were some Chinese folks that we used to know, but mostly African-Americans would be who we would have related to, and not very many. Like I said, it was a very segregated time. And as far as people my own age, that was the first experience, I think. Can you imagine that? To go through your whole school life with all white kids? I think that&#8217;s horrible. So, but anyway, that was a great experience, of course, and U. T. was that--. That might have been the first year they were integrated. But there weren&#8217;t many students of color.  JW: Were you involved in any organizations in college?  GE: I wasn&#8217;t.   JW: So what did you do &#8230;?  GE: Oh, actually, I take that back. I was actually in a sorority, just for a minute. I had a bunch of friends who were involved in the sorority, and so I got into this sorority. I thought that was what I wanted to do. Oh my God, I hated it. And they didn&#8217;t care too much for me, either. That&#8217;s why I said it was just for a minute. So yeah, I was in that for, I guess, a year. But I wasn&#8217;t in anything else.  JW: So what did you do after college, when you decided to leave U. T.?  GE: What did I do then? Somewhere, I don&#8217;t know, I worked at something boring, and then played a lot, around. Somewhere along the way I moved to Atlanta, and I lived down there for a while. I had some job, working in an office somewhere. Gosh, I can&#8217;t even remember where it was. That&#8217;s how bad it was. And that was, oh, my gosh, well, see, you&#8217;re really putting me on the spot about my memory. It all runs together. So I lived there for a while, but I wasn&#8217;t happy with that. I wanted to go away somewhere. I wanted to get out of the South. Even though I wasn&#8217;t active in anything, and I didn&#8217;t even understand--.  I don&#8217;t think I even understood myself what I knew was wrong with things, that there was no articulation for me, I mean, there was nothing about school, there was nothing about my family, there was nothing particular that I could say, this is what turned me into a political person. But somehow it was more like a feeling, and almost like an instinctive reaction to things I would see around me. But I didn&#8217;t know how to analyze that, or how to understand that. It was just that it didn&#8217;t feel right. Or kind of a rebelliousness that didn&#8217;t have its basis in any analysis. It was like, well, why do I have to do this? Well, why do I have to finish school? Well, why can&#8217;t I blah-blah-blah? Somewhere in there I wanted to do something like paint, or write, or make music, even though I had no talent whatsoever. But it was like a breaking-out feeling, that things were not right, there&#8217;s something wrong here, there&#8217;s something wrong with this path I&#8217;m supposed to be on that&#8217;s not right for me. I didn&#8217;t like living in the South. I was ashamed of that. I don&#8217;t think I was ashamed of my family, but I thought that the whole culture of having been socialized myself in the [19]50s and &#8217;60s, in the South, in a middle-class household where, not so much my mother, but my peers, like in high school, where things were valued if you had certain, if your father did certain kinds of occupation, or if you were invited to certain kinds of, like, debutante balls. I mean, all of that was just like [gagging noise]. I just didn&#8217;t like any of that, and I didn&#8217;t understand. I didn&#8217;t know that there was anything else out there, as a lot of young people didn&#8217;t. But I knew that that was not a path for me. I couldn&#8217;t see myself going to teas and being in the Garden Club, which seemed like that was the only choice, or the main choice, for someone in my setting. So I didn&#8217;t want to have anything to do with all that. And I didn&#8217;t like it. Again, I didn&#8217;t know how, what was wrong with it in terms of being able to say, &#8220;This is really bad classism&#8221;, or whatever. I didn&#8217;t have any analysis. And nobody to talk to about it. It didn&#8217;t occur to me that that was something to talk to anybody about. To say, &#8220;This sucks.&#8221;   So anyway, I ended up leaving. I came back from Atlanta. I was very unhappy, I was very depressed. And so I wanted to get away from home, and I didn&#8217;t know any other way to do it, because we were not a very wealthy family. We weren&#8217;t even wealthy. My father worked two jobs, so we were barely middle-class. Anyway, so I joined the airlines, and that&#8217;s how I got away from home. That was my--. I got the job, they pay for you to leave home and move somewhere, and so essentially, that was how I got out of Knoxville.  JW: And where did they send you?  GE: San Francisco.   JW: So you went really far.  GE: Well, I went to Chicago. Yes, I did, I wanted to go very far. I went to Chicago first, and then from there I went to San Francisco, and loved it.   JW: Did you love the work, too?  GE: I did in a way, I did. Because it was fun, mostly. It was really fun. You got to talk to people, and people were interesting to me, and it was a whole new world to me, little Southerner that I was, from the closed society I lived in Knoxville. It was a real leap to go to California and meet all these different people on the airplanes and in the city, and stuff. So yeah, it was fun in that way, it was fun. It was like, again, there were a lot of rules and regulations and behavior, and the look and everything, that got to me after a while.  JW: Well, can you describe what that was like, at the time? Because I organized the papers for the Stewardesses for Women&#8217;s Rights.  GE: Say what, now?  JW: The Stewardesses for Women&#8217;s Rights. Did you know about them?   GW: They weren&#8217;t around then. I think they came a little bit later.  JW: I organized their papers, and their archives.  GE: No kidding!  JW: Yes, at the Tamiment Library in New York. And just doing that, it was this whole education on what that job used to look like, which is very different from what it is now.  GE: Yes, very different. Well, it was like being in the military, because it was, you know, you gotta look--. They put you through this training, which you probably know all this. They put you through this training, and they want you to look a certain way, so you go through this whole makeover, and you want to wear this kind of makeup, and your hair looks a certain way, and you act a certain way, because you&#8217;re a lady, and all this stuff. I went along with all that, because I thought, this is going to be a fun job. And they--. This is so unbelievable now. But of such things are more rebellious people made. I mean, the more pressed you are, sometimes, the more you rebel, right? But in any case, they even had a part of it that was like I went to charm school, where they would say, &#8220;If you go out to eat at a nice restaurant, which you probably will be going out to&#8221;&#8212;some restaurant, and they named some fancy restaurant somewhere&#8212;&#8220;then here&#8217;s how you&#8217;re supposed to act.&#8221; And it was like this charm school. The whole &#8220;lady&#8221; thing. It was funny, and crazy. I had an instructor in that training who was a character, and she took a lot of that self-importance out of it, and brought a lot of humor into it. She made it into, like, this is really what the job is about. So it was like being in the military, where you were--. It was very structured in a lot of ways, but it also offered a lot of freedom in a lot of ways. Because you could pick your scheduling up to a point, I mean, it all went with seniority. And it paid decent at the time; for a woman&#8217;s job, it paid decent. You did get to meet some fun, cute people, and flirt around a lot, and go to some cool places. To go to L.A. and New York, and Denver; I went around the world. Me, I&#8217;d never been anywhere, really. And then, what was I going to tell you about that? I&#8217;m sorry, I just lost my thought about something that happened that I was going to tell you--. I don&#8217;t remember. Maybe it&#8217;ll come back in a minute.
I was in the union there, and that was another stepping stone. It was also during when I was in California, was during some of the worst parts of the Vietnam War. So a lot of the people that were going back and forth to Vietnam we had on flights. And that was another thing that was building my sense of, things are moving wrong, with injustice and bad stuff. Again, I don&#8217;t even know that I was articulating it more than I was feeling it. And the civil rights movement, it had gone by at that point. This was after the Civil Rights Act was passed. And of course, the racial struggles at that time in the Bay area was a different thing than it was in the South. I still see that. I still understand the South has a totally different relationship to racism than the rest of the country does, I think, because of our history of slavery and what we carry around from that, even if we weren&#8217;t aware of it. So that was a very different experience of race on the west coast and in the Bay area. Because there, the racism took the form of discrimination against Hispanic people and against Asian people. So between that and the Vietnam War--. the Vietnam War, that was really, seeing those guys, and it was guys, mostly. I don&#8217;t remember really seeing any women on the flights, and I think most of the women would have been nurses. But seeing those guys--. Oh, my gosh, I could just cry thinking about it. Going back, and mostly when they were coming back from Vietnam. It was like walking into the lunchroom at Miller&#8217;s Department Store. It just brought that reality home to me in a way that I couldn&#8217;t understand what we were doing, why we were there. Before that, I wasn&#8217;t for the war at all. I was basically, like, we just shouldn&#8217;t be there. But this really, seeing those guys and talking to them, they were like children, younger than I was. It just breaks your heart. The ones I saw were probably the least damaged. They were not--. So it really shaped me to encounter those guys and talk to them, and have that kind of, wow, man, within 36 hours they&#8217;re on this flight that I&#8217;m on, and talking to them, just they came--. So that was huge, that was a huge part of that experience of being a flight attendant was that part of it, was meeting those guys.   JW: Were you starting to become more active around then, with those issues?  GE: Yeah, I was. I tried to be. I was kind of peripherally involved in some anti-war stuff, and I think, this may be the part where at some point I don&#8217;t know if I would want this to go on record, but this is California in the [19]60s. There was a lot of pot smoking going on [laughs], among other things. And so, you can get off on a little track with that. And forget what you were doing. Like, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna go to the beach.&#8221; And so, that was--.  JW: That was a lot of people&#8217;s history, I&#8217;d say.  GE: Yeah, probably that&#8217;s right.  JW: Even if they don&#8217;t readily admit it.  GE: Well that was part of, I guess, if anybody who ever did any acid or did any other psychedelic drugs back then, at that time and space, and place, you couldn&#8217;t help it. I mean, all those things going on around. There were so many things going on! The civil rights movement had just, not ended, but sort of, won its major victory. Vietnam was huge, and it was all over the media, the national movement was really building for that. The women&#8217;s movement was starting to bubble up to the rest of us. Other types of people&#8217;s liberation movements were going on. So to put that on the canvas with drugs, music and free love, well, of course your mind was going to open up, and you were going to see things and perceive things in a totally different way, and go, &#8220;Man, what are we going to do to change this culture that we&#8217;re living in?" And, I mean, even though I think about it now as far as what we did wrong about the drugs, and what a damaging and bad thing that is now, it was really part of that whole liberating experience of people&#8217;s minds opening up, and people saying, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve got to change some things, this is really bad. Let&#8217;s go on this march, or let&#8217;s go down here to the People&#8217;s Park in Berkeley. That was a big thing. I had some involvement in supporting that. People took that little plot of land over and had the fight with the University of California about that. But again, I was kind of a free agent. I was having a great time. And feeling very political, but probably not doing as much as I did later on, or even, I don&#8217;t know, I want to say if I went back now, I&#8217;d do more. I don&#8217;t know if I would. Because it was such a, there were so many things, so many options, so many things that you could do [laughs].  JW: Well, I wonder if you could say more about, and like I said, we can, if we need to, edit or restrict anything later, we can. But I think it is an interesting story is history of those movements and the drug use that often went along with that. I wonder if you can say any more about, like a story that you remember about that. I think it&#8217;s so vastly different than what you see today with youth cultures, and people taking drugs for artistic reasons. There was a really different motivation behind it, at least in my mind, now that I think about it.  GE: I think that&#8217;s right. And I think that drugs themselves were, well, again there&#8217;s certainly--. I&#8217;m trying to think about, well certainly the beat movement, and the [19]50s, where things were more underground. There&#8217;s always that fertilizing period, where things are not known, and then suddenly they&#8217;re more in the mainstream, or at the edge of the mainstream, and then they become mainstream. It seems like it was more innocent, there was a more innocent attitude. And the drugs themselves didn&#8217;t seem as damaging. I mean, hell, I don&#8217;t know. I don't even know where the pot came from. But it wasn&#8217;t like cultivated, it wasn&#8217;t like people were--. It wasn&#8217;t a business. It was recreational, which I guess it still is for a lot of people, but it&#8217;s also a lot different. There&#8217;s a lot different spin on it. There&#8217;s a lot of different types of drugs out there. We took mescaline, and acid, which I think was less damaging. I don&#8217;t know, because I don&#8217;t know what they do nowadays about acid, how it&#8217;s produced or manufactured, or anything like that. But people weren&#8217;t doing, at that time, for that brief period, people weren&#8217;t doing heroin, cocaine, none of that was on the scene at that time. And those soul-sucking drugs--. I think pot and the psychedelic drugs were more opening up, liberating, nurturing, if you can say that about drugs. And then it was so easy to move into the really bad drugs. And later on, crack and that. But at the time, it was, for most of us&#8212;innocent, na&#239;ve people&#8212;that was not part of the scene. And that was scary to me, when it became more like that. That was very scary to me. And people started dying, and you realize the extent to which--. I&#8217;m not going to say that, because I don&#8217;t believe that just because you smoke pot or even take acid or a little speed or something, that that says you&#8217;re going to turn into a junkie. But I could see where it&#8217;s easy that you could stay on that path and become Janice Joplin, or somebody who overdoses on heroin. Simply because it was a time of experimentation, so people were more inclined to experiment, and to say, &#8220;Well, what the heck, if I feel this good, then why don&#8217;t I try this, and see if I feel good on that.&#8221; I think there was a na&#239;vet&#233; about it. It&#8217;s really sad, because now it&#8217;s a very bad part of our culture, a very bad part of--. I think what&#8217;s going on with drugs in this region and with young people, it&#8217;s not just young people, but, it&#8217;s prescription drugs and all that now. And of course, that&#8217;s a whole other conversation, but a lot of that&#8217;s due to the pharmaceuticals.
But anyway, back to what you&#8217;re asking me about. I don&#8217;t know where the turning point is for how that came to be something that was so much an important part of a rite of passage. And how the whole, I mean, to be in California at that time was just the most fabulous place to be, as far as just anything went. And people were wonderful to each other, and people--. There was like a common understanding and agreement of what we, political or not, it was a common acceptance and understanding that everybody had the same things going for them, or against them, and we were all in it. Whatever &#8220;it&#8221; was, we were all in it together. People had your back; you didn&#8217;t feel threatened. I&#8217;m just rattling, I&#8217;m just rambling. I hadn&#8217;t ever thought about articulating this. But it felt safe, even though--. It felt safe to be among ourselves and other people, but it didn&#8217;t feel safe insofar as the government felt more and more oppressive to people. So there was more and more, like, &#8220;Oh, we have to stick together,&#8221; because people were really feeling, there was a point at which people felt, in the Bay Area, anyway, people felt that they were going to come after us and put us in concentration camps. I know people that went away to the woods, with guns, because they thought that the government was going to come, and there was going to be a witch hunt for us. Specifically, to come after us and put us in concentration camps. And so there was that going on, there was that sense of the evilness of things, even while we were all running through the woods naked [laughs]. But I think that it felt like a really free time, and people were really not taking advantage of that freedom with each other. That was my experience. Totally a generalization. I&#8217;m sure there are horror stories about that time from other people. But for me, it was a time of being totally able to go to a limit that I never dreamed existed, and to understand myself in relation to some things that I never thought about before. And I always have been a little philosophical. I managed to always have been one of those--. And even quasi-religious at some point, and so, the whole spiritual and soul-searching aspects and behavioral aspects of doing drugs and the whole culture thing was fascinating to me, and wonderful. And music was such a big part of it for me. So yeah, it was a very, it seems now, it seemed like a long time at the time, but it was a really brief period of time that things were really great. And then they weren&#8217;t.  JW: Well, what was it like being a Southerner in that scene?  GE: Well, that&#8217;s a good question. It was kind of weird. But it was more weird in the job part of it than it was in my personal life. Because the job part--. I tell this story all the time. First of all, I didn&#8217;t know I was Appalachian. And second of all, I didn&#8217;t realize until I came back here that I was an Appalachian out-migrant, because there was a big out-migration of Appalachian people, young people, in the [19]60s. I knew I was hillbilly, but people would say things to me, and I thought, I&#8217;d just laugh, because I didn&#8217;t even realize what it was about. People actually said things to me like, &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t know y&#8217;all wore shoes. Where are you from?&#8221; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Tennessee,&#8221; and they&#8217;d say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know y&#8217;all wore shoes. Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, your daddy must be a moonshiner. Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah.&#8221; And stuff like that. And &#8220;Oh, where&#8217;d you get that weird accent? Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah.&#8221; And so it was that kind of thing, where people, the stereotypes are still around. So some of that, and then it was some stuff like, people who did understand and had some understanding of how racist the South was, so there was always a little bit of that. People challenging you about that, asking you questions like, &#8220;Well, did you have a mammy when you were growing up?&#8221; I mean, seriously believing that everybody in the South grew up with a black mammy who raised them. So some of those stereotypes that I experienced, being a Southerner. And I didn&#8217;t necessarily, well, some of it I didn&#8217;t take as negative, but now, if somebody said that to me about my daddy being a moonshiner or I didn&#8217;t wear shoes, I&#8217;d probably light into them. But I didn&#8217;t understand at the time. I sort of bought into it. It was kind of an internalized oppression, because like I said, I wanted to get away from the South. I didn&#8217;t want to be a Southerner, because there was some shame attached to that for me. And because it wasn&#8217;t just the race stuff, but also, people looked down on people from the South. People tended to think, and I think they still do to some extent, that if you were from parts of the South, you&#8217;re more ignorant. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen that film called &#8220;In Search of an Appalachian Accent.&#8221; Have you ever seen that film from Appalshop?  JW: No.  GE: It&#8217;s very interesting, how they talk about that, how the way that you pronounce words, or a certain way that you talk, people will make these assumptions about your level of intelligence. And so, I was going through that thing about denying my own heritage, if you will, my own roots, anyway. And so yeah, I just laughed, &#8220;Oh, yeah, Daddy&#8217;s not a moonshiner, but we sure did know plenty of &#8216;em, har-har-har.&#8221; I mean, we actually did, but it just didn&#8217;t--. I was sort of playing into it myself, because I didn&#8217;t necessarily want to say, &#8220;Well, hell, yes, I&#8217;m a hillbilly and proud of it.&#8221; It was just not where I was at at that point.  JW: So when did you become aware of women, the women&#8217;s movement? When did you start to think about feminism, or those sorts of issues?  GE: It was during that same time. Yeah, it was during that same kind of, all those people&#8217;s liberation movements. I can&#8217;t pinpoint exactly what it was that really put me into that place of, &#8220;Oh, yeah!&#8221; But I always did a lot of reading, and so, books that I have read, things I would hear on television that would lead me to books, were always a part of how I developed my consciousness about things, and my own analysis. So I don&#8217;t know, but somewhere along during that same period of time. And I think part of it was living in the culture of being a flight attendant, which at the time was all women. Oh, that&#8217;s what I was going to tell you a minute ago. It just came back to me. When I started with the airlines, I worked for United Airlines, when I started with the airlines, you had to sign a piece of paper that said you would not get married, or if you got married you would resign, and you would agree to resign when you were 32 years old.  JW: Oh, gosh &#8230;  GE: Can you imagine that now? And I signed it! I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, well, whatever, what the heck?&#8221; Well, as soon as the first person got married, or the first person turned 32, they threw the whole thing out, because it was actually illegal. But they actually were trying to make it into a single-woman, under-32 job. You were supposed to weigh a certain weight, and all this. And I went along with all that charm school stuff. Of course, once they threw the thing out about you couldn&#8217;t be married, we found out that half the people that were flying were married. They&#8217;d just been keeping it a secret. But if you were married and they found out about it, they fired you. And how insane is that?  JW: Then did you think, did people think it was insane at the time? Like the people you were working with?  GE: Yeah, it was a big, like I say, the union fought and fought and fought about it.  JW: What union were you in?  GE: It was the Airline Pilots Association, ALPA. I guess they still have it. Some of the airline flight attendants had their own union, but we were part of the Airline Pilots Association. But yeah, people thought it was insane. And I think the marriage thing, people thought was even more crazy than the age thing. I don&#8217;t think anybody thought they were going to fly until they were 32 [laughs]. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I'll fly THAT long.&#8221; But they did. I mean, you&#8217;ve flown recently. You know that people do. If you get the seniority, it&#8217;s a great career. You can fly two days a week and get all kinds of free travel benefits. If you can put up with it, which eventually I couldn&#8217;t. It was stressful to me. But, so back to the thing about it being a part of raising a person&#8217;s consciousness about women&#8217;s rights, certainly it was. It was a very macho kind of culture. Those pilots were &#8220;in charge,&#8221; and we were the little waitresses. There was so much more to it than that, but this is how everybody perceived it, and even the airlines themselves sometimes treated it as if we were there to be these adornments, and these little glamorous--. Well, it&#8217;s not glamorous, I&#8217;ll tell you that from the get-go. But to have this kind of experience for the travelers, most of them were [business] men, because it wasn&#8217;t like travel now. It wasn&#8217;t as cheap, it wasn&#8217;t deregulated. So the whole experience of an attractive young woman serving you some wine and steak, that&#8217;s part of what they were trying to promote. And so, the more I was in that, the more I was like, resisting that. And so somewhere all those things converged in me, and I&#8217;m sure part of it had to do with whatever I was reading. I don&#8217;t remember all the things I was reading at the time, but all kinds of stuff. I remember I read Germaine Greer&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Female Eunuch.&#8221; That had a big effect on me. I read another book called, oh, what&#8217;s that thing called? I can&#8217;t remember the author&#8217;s name, I&#8217;d have to do some research to even remember what that was, but it was about evolution and women. What was the name of that thing? Anyway, everything I read, I was like, &#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; You know, sort of in that place in my life where it was all new and exciting to me, to have all these ideas coming my way that I never had any exposure to before. And of course, then  people like Gloria Steinem and people like that were on TV, and Joan Baez, and people who I admired were speaking out and being featured in terms of talking about women&#8217;s issues. That all converged, I guess, at the same time. And friends, talking with other women and--. And during that time, I had an abortion during that time, too, before abortion was legalized. It was legal in California, but it wasn&#8217;t legal in the rest of the country, so that was, like, in the late [19]60s. Roe v. Wade was what, &#8217;73? &#8217;72?  JW: &#8217;72.  GE: So California had, you could get an abortion there. They called it a therapeutic abortion. You had to essentially be--. You had to go to a psychiatrist and you had to be certified mentally unstable. That was how they rationalized to whoever they had to rationalize it to, that you had to have an abortion because you were mentally unstable.  JW: So you went through that process.  GE: So I went through that process. I mean, it was all a setup, because your doctor gave you the name of a psychiatrist for you to go to in the hospital. And you went to the hospital. There were no clinics or anything like that. It was a little bit more torturous than it is now. It was more of an operation than it is now. So that happened to me. That was another piece of that picture. I had a roommate who actually had had to go to Mexico to get an abortion, because she was from California, but it was before you could get any kind of abortion in California. So she&#8217;d had to go to Mexico. And then I had another friend who had to go to New York, by herself, who had to make this long trip. She wasn&#8217;t very old. I don&#8217;t think she was 20 yet. So you start to have these experiences, and you start to discuss these things with other people, and at some point you take it all in, and go, &#8220;OK, this is not good.&#8221; So all that was all part of that experience, part of that, putting together whatever it was I came up with in my mind about the importance of women having not just choices, but having freedom and equality. And it helped me make sense out of some of the things that didn&#8217;t make sense to me about my life, about why I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable about being in that middle class, culture, with debutante stuff, and whatever. That part of that awakening about how women had many different dimensions and could have many different choices in life. It was like, &#8220;Oh, no wonder I always felt so out of it, and so out of place, because I just never &#8230;&#8221; It helped me understand those things in my own life that didn&#8217;t make sense to me. I thought there was something wrong with me, and then the more I thought about it, the more I understood it, that it was not just me. It had to do with the system, and the culture, and the way that we were assigned these roles that we were supposed to play. And that really helped me.  JW: Were your parents involved much in your life at this point? Did they know what you were doing out in California? What was your relationship like with them?  GE: Well, it was pretty good. There was some time, in a sense, so chaotic--. I kind of felt that way. I can&#8217;t give you a timeline. I just don&#8217;t exactly remember which things happened when . But there was a point at which I was going to get married. I met this guy that I lived with. In fact, living--. That was a big thing, to live with somebody. My mother had a fit, and she said, &#8220;Your father will have a fit if he finds out!&#8221; And then we were going to get married, and then we decided not to get married. During that time, my mother said, she wrote me a letter and she said she was so glad I was getting married, because she thought that was women&#8217;s role in life, was to get married and have children. And I thought that was interesting because I&#8217;d never heard her say anything like that before, and in fact, I always thought that she halfway resented that she didn&#8217;t have something else in life that she wanted to do, because she was so smart, and she read all the time. She was interested in so many things. But it didn&#8217;t ruin our relationship. And they didn&#8217;t know everything I was doing. They knew I was a flight attendant, they were proud of that. They came to see me and stayed in my apartment, and I took them all around town. They met some of my friends, and my father said later he was relieved to meet them. I don&#8217;t know if he thought I was hanging out with Jack the Ripper? I don&#8217;t know what his mind was coming up with, about who I was hanging out with. I didn&#8217;t introduce him to everybody! But I think he felt some sense of, &#8220;Well, okay, these are normal people, so it&#8217;s okay.&#8221; So there was no alienation in that kind of way. We did disagree about the war, and we argued about it because my father being a newspaperman, and having a lot of knowledge and very strong opinions, just like I did. So we did argue about the war. And we argued to some extent about the race stuff, because when Martin Luther King was assassinated, that caused a little tension between us, as far as, I was outraged and my mother wasn&#8217;t. Although later on I think she understood more about civil rights and race than she did then, just like we all did. But there wasn&#8217;t like an estrangement or anything like that.  JW: So was there a point when you joined a consciousness-raising group, or anything like that?  GE: Yeah. I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I&#8217;ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I&#8217;m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It&#8217;s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It&#8217;s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, &#8220;Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?&#8221; Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with &#8220;lefties,&#8221; right? We talk a lot, but we don&#8217;t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women&#8217;s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women&#8217;s work that I did in the [19]80s and &#8217;90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn&#8217;t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.  JW: Who was in the group that you started when you got back here? I&#8217;m wondering if people have been mentioning this group.  GE: Oh, I don&#8217;t know, I doubt it, because--. Well, Vickie Creed was in it, and she might have mentioned something about it. It&#8217;s interesting. My sister Melissa was in it. She doesn&#8217;t live here anymore. A friend of mine named Mary Pollock was in it. She&#8217;s passed away now. Mary and I actually--. Mary and Vickie were good friends, and Mary introduced me to Vickie. I don&#8217;t know if the three of us said, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; I don't know. It doesn&#8217;t matter. But anyway, Mary Pollock was in it, and another friend of ours named Victoria Crea was in it, and Mary Pollock&#8217;s sister-in-law Rachel, no, what was her name? That was the daughter&#8217;s name. Jeannie, that was her sister-in-law&#8217;s name, was Jeannie.   [phone rings; pause]  There was a person in it who was a person named Mary Laura. I don&#8217;t know her last name. I don&#8217;t even know what happened to her. She was married to a dentist. French, that was her last name. Ed French was his name, and he apparently was a horse&#8217;s ass, according to her. But anyway, so that&#8217;s who it was. And it pretty much stayed the same. I don&#8217;t think we really--. We just kept it about that size, and with that same group.  JW: And maybe you can say a little bit about how you define feminism. Maybe how you defined it then.   GE: Oh, gosh. You know, I don&#8217;t know. Feminism--. I think the way I defined it then was--. You know, I honestly don&#8217;t know how to answer that, Jessie. I think it was, to me feminism meant that women can have the same opportunities and rights as men, that was basically it. So that if we wanted to fly to the moon we had the chance to go, to have a career path that would take us to the moon if we wanted it. If we wanted to stay home and raise children, we could do that. If we wanted to be bums on the street. I mean, whatever. It was all going to be the same. There was no expectation about what women should or could be. I guess that&#8217;s pretty much where I still think it should be. Pretty simple, really, that women should have the same opportunities and the same rights and the same choices.  JW: And when you were starting a consciousness-raising group here, did you see yourself as part of the women&#8217;s movement?  GE: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.  JW: And do you think that was a mutual understanding with the group?  GE: I think so, yeah. I think it was. I think we were trying to, that people were feeling that and didn&#8217;t know exactly what to do with that. I&#8217;m not sure if there was even a chapter of [National Organization for Women], but NOW, that was the big place to plug in if you were interested in doing women&#8217;s lib work. And that&#8217;s what we called it, &#8220;women&#8217;s lib.&#8221; That was the only thing I knew of, as a national organization. I don&#8217;t even think there was a chapter here. But anyway, that was why we said that we wanted to get together as a group, because we all had that sensibility about women&#8217;s lib but didn&#8217;t know exactly what to do with it. I think we all did. That was my memory. I know at least--. I know Mary and I did, because that was one of the ways we connected initially, when we first met. You know, when I came back to Knoxville &#8230;  JW: Yes, why did you come back?  GE: Well, I came back with a lot of ambivalence. The main reason I came back, since my father had passed away, my mother had moved back here. It was very sudden. He was only 52. She was not even 50. They&#8217;d lived in Washington DC, and I felt drawn to come back here for that grieving time. And then, it was very difficult, because I really loved San Francisco, but it happened at a time when I had just left the airlines, and I had been working for a plastic surgeon, of all things, that&#8217;s where the bookkeeping experience came in. So I was at loose ends anyway, so I thought, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to go back home and be with my mom, and my family.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still here.  JW: So that was the year you &#8230;  GE: That was the year, right. So meeting Mary was like a lifesaver for me, because I felt so, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I remember why I wanted to leave here.&#8221; But I met her and some other people, and people were, it wasn&#8217;t as crazy as California, but people were certainly feeling like the rest of the country, that sense of movement and change, and hopefully, revolution. And Mary and her husband Bob, he&#8217;s an artist, a crazy man, happened to be some people that I met that was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, thank goodness! Oh, thank goodness I met you!&#8221; So immediately she and I connected around books, and we connected around women's lib. So I think at least for us two, and I think for Vickie maybe to some extent, and Victoria, that there was a sense of being a part of the women&#8217;s movement. I think the other women were starting to get there, but certainly understood some of their own pain as a woman. So that was partly what brought people to that.   JW: So how did you get involved in activism in this area?  GE: Well, actually it was through Vickie. Well, I mean, I shouldn&#8217;t say that. I got involved--. Let me see, let me think about that. I was going to say that the job I had at CORA (Commission on Religion in Appalachia), which was what brought me into the regional context, was because I knew her, and she was working there. And she helped me, she introduced me to this job that was open there. But before that, that was the first paying job that I ever had doing any kind of activism. Things that I had done before, which had been kind of sketchy, were always on a volunteer basis. I had worked on some political campaigns part-time. I'd worked on the McGovern campaign in California for a while, I had worked on a campaign here before I left to go to California, had worked on a campaign here one summer. And what else? I did some neighborhood work when I came back here, but I can&#8217;t remember. I think that was after I&#8217;d been back here for a little while. I can&#8217;t remember, isn&#8217;t that awful? There was also a period, well, when I came back here, the only big fight that was going on at that time&#8212;you know, the war had, they had signed the peace papers. Things were settled as far as that was concerned, or settled down. The environmental stuff was starting to get going. And the big fight here then was the Tellico Dam. When I came back, that was a big issue. I didn&#8217;t ever really get involved in that, except around the edges of writing letters and stuff. But I never did go to any of the actions or get totally involved in that. What else? That&#8217;s all I can think of, other than, well, I was working at U. T. I think that&#8217;s what I was going to tell you. I was working at U. T. I went to work over there, at the library, and that was my spring board to CORA, then, because I had known Vickie and she was working there. So she introduced me to CORA. So that was my diving into the regional stuff.   JW: What kind of work did you start to do for CORA?   GE: Well, I worked with her. She was the coordinator of the Appalachian Development Projects Committee, which was the community program in CORA. CORA had a weird structure. She may have talked to you about all this, but CORA had a very weird and hard-to-understand structure, because it was an ecumenical organization that was established in the [19]60s, as part of the War on Poverty. So there was this part of it that was all controlled by church people, and there was this part where they had, like, a community program, and that was the part that Vickie was the coordinator of.   [Aside to someone who comes in the room.]   And I worked like, I was sort of her associate. I worked with her, as--.  I think I was called the assistant coordinator, or something. She was the coordinator and I was the assistant coordinator. And then she left after about a year or two, and then even though I didn&#8217;t think, I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want her job,&#8221; that&#8217;s what happened. I stepped into her job.   JW: So what was that like? CORA worked a lot with rural people, right? So you came from the west coast back and got involved in that work. So what was that like, to suddenly be in the mountains of east Tennessee, having grown up in Knoxville?  GE: Well, I&#8217;m trying to think --. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m really trying to think about the trajectory here, so I&#8217;m going to back up. I was trying to think about--. When you were asking about activism, I got involved in something at U.T. and I can&#8217;t even remember what it was. But before that, I wanted to tell you this, which was, one of the things that I did when I came back here. I was looking for any kind of work. And I got involved with these women who--. I can&#8217;t even remember now how I met them. They were a lesbian couple who ran a photography business, and I was really into photography. That was one of the things I had started doing when I was in California, because I really had this vision of myself as being some kind of artistic person. And photography seemed to be somewhat manageable, because I couldn&#8217;t draw. And they had this photography business where they went around to beauty shops and they would take pictures. One of them was the photographer, the other was the salesperson. So they would go to the beauty shops and they would take pictures of women after they had their hair done. And they would have all these, the glamour things, the pearls and the velvet drapes and the soft lighting and the whole bit. They would also take pictures of families, or children, or whatever. So you&#8217;d take a picture of everybody who came in, and then the next week the salesperson would go back and try to sell people packages of these photographs. And the shop owner would get like an album with all of her hairstyles in it, or his hairstyles (some of them were men). So these all were, mostly, but not all, in rural areas. And so that was my introduction to the rural areas of east Tennessee, and even Kentucky, because we went out to Kentucky, was being a glamour photographer for a beauty salon. Now think about that.  JW: With a lesbian couple.  GE: With a lesbian couple, who owned the business. Now they were a trip in themselves. I made a lot of money. I think I worked for them less than a year, but I made a lot of money, because I would make commission off how many they would sell. But more importantly, it was really a part of my political education, was sitting in those beauty shops in those rural areas and really understanding, &#8216;cause I--. Sometimes you just sit around, and so you talk to people, and of course they always wanted to talk to you. Really understanding women&#8217;s lives, and what women in a small town or rural area, what they were dealing with. Women who worked at the mills, women who had relatives who were invalids who they took care of all the time, women with husbands who abused them, I mean, it was--. Even though I thought I knew a lot about women&#8217;s experience, it was a whole other piece of my political education. And then, also understanding the role of how those things work in small towns, like a beauty shop, how that works as far as what it does for the community in terms of bringing people together, and how it&#8217;s a place where, it&#8217;s like a consciousness-raising group. And how much support, and how much that was where women were able to be free. I don&#8217;t know, I could have written a whole book about that experience. It was a wonderful experience. It was so much a part then of what I came to more deeply understand about what was going on as far as women&#8217;s lives and working people in rural areas. It was really great. So that was a big thing for me.   And then, when I went to CORA, then I was familiar with some rural areas, but a lot of the places I&#8217;d never been. So it was great, I loved it. I loved meeting the people, and really having a chance to have a more, how do you say, to really try to live out things I felt I had been talking with people about, or reading in a book, or being in a group about. To really have a way to have that part of my day-to-day life was a little bit of a different experience. Up until then, it had been more in an intellectual way, to some extent. It felt like it came together more, when I went to work for CORA. And then other stuff about myself started making sense to me in terms of Appalachian identity. That was, coming back here was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah! Let&#8217;s see that now, I understand that differently.&#8221; I never understood that before. So I don&#8217;t know, this is like, I&#8217;m all over the place.  JW: That&#8217;s usually, it&#8217;s good when people to do that. When I don&#8217;t have to ask too many questions. It&#8217;s better. Your brain just kind of takes you--.  GE: Well, there&#8217;s stuff I&#8217;m leaving out, that I just kind of need to leave out. I can&#8217;t remember the chronology of things all the time, but nevertheless &#8230;   JW: Well, before we started recording, when we were talking about you had been committed to women&#8217;s organizing earlier in your career, was that something that you were doing in CORA? Or were you talking more about the consciousness-raising group, and that stuff?  GE: Well, when I worked at CORA, it was a faith-based organization, but they were considered very progressive and almost radical. Some people considered it radical because it was ecumenical, my god. And I still thought of myself as a quasi-Christian. I wasn&#8217;t really--. I mean, that&#8217;s how I was raised. I was raised in a Baptist church, a Methodist church and an Episcopal church. And when you&#8217;re raised in a certain way, you don&#8217;t really--. You absorb that, you internalize that. And actually, interestingly enough, and now that I&#8217;m saying this, I realize that when I was thinking about getting married, one of the things that happened was that, we went to the little Episcopal church in San Francisco to see if they would marry us. And they wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with us because I didn&#8217;t belong to the church, even though I had been on the rolls of an Episcopal church here. So that was another piece of, like, &#8220;This whole system is screwed up.&#8221; So how do I feel about religion? So I was more anti-organized religion more than I was anti-Christianity at the time I went to work at CORA. But I certainly wasn&#8217;t a church-identified person, or anything like that. But I did understand the role that the church played in the oppression of women, and how there were women who wanted to be priests, and again, it was like, &#8220;Oh, my gosh, that&#8217;s right! They&#8217;re all men!&#8221; So that part of it in CORA was very much a part of the conversation among people in CORA. A couple of the women, including Vickie and Tena Willemsma, and some of the church women, were very much putting that out there, like, &#8220;Well, this is a place for women to be able to be in leadership positions, we need to be sure that happens, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.&#8221; But I think what I was really--. So that was, I was affected by that, and I was very supportive of that. But on the community side of it, what really was the reality was that most of the community leaders were women, and they were the ones that were in these communities, out there pushing and shoving and hauling, and trying to make things happen. There was a really strong group of wonderful women who happened to be at the same place at the same time. Barbara Green was one of them. And within CORA, not intentionally, it just happened to be that time and space, that people were coming together in this particular structure. And it clicked. So things started to happen, and people started to talk. And it was a group of women who bonded together and understood the role of women leaders in the community grassroots organizing. And so it emerged as an organic thing out of this. I mean, I&#8217;ve talked with my colleagues since then, who I still have conversations with and am still in touch with, about gosh, one of those--. Whatever brought us together in that time and space, that spark, there was something in all of us wanting to do, wanting to think, wanting to talk, wanting to work, that we all fed each other. And that grew into then this more deeply intentional way for women to get together on a regional level, outside of this CORA setting, and that became the Women&#8217;s Alliance.  JW: Can you say a little bit about the Women&#8217;s Alliance, what it was, exactly, and why you thought it--. Were you behind the organizing of that?  GE: I was one of the people, one of the first people --. There was a group of women, there was a smaller group of women who--. Let me think. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what were the seeds and what were the flowers. Again, I think it was some women in some church settings, I don&#8217;t know if they were necessarily church women, but they were employed by the church. There were a lot of people who were employed by the church but weren&#8217;t necessarily church people. And truthfully, I&#8217;d say some of the most radical people that I knew, and still know, were people who were, especially in the Catholic Church, some of the nuns and priests who were very much liberation theology and people who were really out there putting themselves into the community. And so, backing off of that--. There was a women&#8217;s task force that was a small group of women, and somehow, because I was, I guess because I was affiliated with CORA, somehow I was relating to that. I can&#8217;t exactly remember where that came from, or who--. Anyway, somehow I got involved in that, I guess because I was--. I think it was the Episcopal Caucus and they were looking for women to represent different organizations. I think that&#8217;s how it came about. In any case, out of that, then, there were some women, a couple of grassroots women in that who were pushing for it to be less church-focused and more grassroots-focused. And so, out of that grew some conversations about taking it to a different level, about doing things that were more related to the grassroots women in the region. That was the very start of Appalachian Women&#8217;s Journal. Along about that same time, somewhere in there, before we actually officially became the Alliance, the big Pittston strike up in the coalfields happened. So there was the whole Daughters of Mother Jones women, who were the women miners and the wives of the miners who formed their own group, which was a whole piece of that strike, it was an unbelievable piece of that strike. So there was opportunity then to have women get together in that regard, with those women, and so, bringing some church women in, and other women in from outside the region. So again, it was kind of like being in the right place at the right time to make some of that happen, because people had connections. Labor women, union women, a group of women, the Women&#8217;s Alternative Economic Summit, came. And so there were several of us that were like this core group of women that would coordinate that and host that, and do teach-ins, and help women get there who could tell their stories and who could talk firsthand about the experiences and what was going on in their communities. So that&#8217;s how it all developed. And then out of that, at some point, we said, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we had something like a broad-based regional women&#8217;s coalition that could maybe tackle policy issues and stuff like that?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s when it became the Women&#8217;s Alliance. It became a larger group of core women, and then from that, trying to draw on those tentacles that people had in the region. Because we had a pretty good network of groups, and broadened into a real, bigger group of women which--. So that&#8217;s how it started. And then, people--. First it was a lot of response. And that&#8217;s where some of those conversations happened that I mentioned earlier about women, and feminism, and some of those conversations like, "Oh, yeah, I believe in women&#8217;s lib, but I&#8217;m not a feminist,&#8221; you know, those conversations. And trying to model something that was different, trying to not recreate--. Trying to not be, follow the same structures that, you know, trying to say, &#8220;Do we have to have a board of directors?&#8221; and, &#8220;Do we have to have a president, do we have to do this, do we have to do that?&#8221; kind of a thing. Trying to have it be more a flat, non-hierarchical model, which we&#8217;d also tried to do in CORA, with some success. Building consensus models, and having in the task force that I helped staff, or that I did staff. People calling each other on language, the women forming their caucus, because they just said, &#8220;We feel like people are acting so sexist and the men are treating the language, well, let&#8217;s have a caucus.&#8221; So the women would have their caucus, and the men would have their caucus.  JW: You had a caucus in CORA?
GE: That wasn&#8217;t in CORA, it was in the APDC, the program of CORA. The CORA piece didn&#8217;t have a caucus. This was the program part that was related to the community. It was part of CORA, but it wasn't the whole CORA. That would have been--. (laughs) Because, well, for one thing, the CORA itself, which was the commission, was pretty much all church bureaucrats. So that was very male, white male dominated. In fact, I can&#8217;t remember--. There were very few people of color in CORA, because they, mostly the churches who were members were these big mainline Protestant churches who were primarily white Presbyterians, Episcopals and Catholics and stuff like that. But in any case, no, these were causes within that Appalachian Projects Development Committee group, which was mostly community people. And there were, some of the churches had representatives in that, but it was mostly community people. So it was a very different organizational culture than CORA. And so that&#8217;s where the women, the grassroots women, some of them were like, &#8220;You know, we just don&#8217;t like the way that we're doing business here.&#8221; So anyway, that&#8217;s what they agreed to do. The whole group agreed that the men and women should have an hour caucus at each meeting, and the men should look at their behavior, and the women could say, &#8220;We need to do something about this.&#8221; So then we set up this whole thing of ground rules, and really worked on building consensus and being sure that there was &#8230; I mean, this sounds now like such a given, with collectives, and collaborative. But for all of us then, it was stuff that we knew we wanted to do, but we never had any place to practice it, and nobody ever seemed to want to practice it, because usually you were in a structure that wouldn&#8217;t allow it. And so it was great. We just .. people loved being in that. I think that was one of the things that we bonded around, was being able to build that work in that group. To be a model of something a little bit different. So then the Women&#8217;s Alliance, which was some of the same women--. We wanted to take that even further and figure out if it was possible to have an organization without that traditional structure, and titles, and all that stuff. And try to have consensus around everything. Oh my god! Oh, some of the battles!  JW: Well, what were some of the battles? What were some of the tensions, or challenges?  GE: Oh, class was a big tension. Class, big class issues.  JW: How so?  GE: Well, because it was such a mix of women. A couple of the stronger, one of the strongest women in the group, and in fact she was actually the staff person, she--. I don&#8217;t know how to say this, exactly. She really often didn&#8217;t seem to understand what it took for some grassroots women to be able to attend and participate in meetings. And was always conscious about money, and was always defensive about people claiming mileage, or stipends, or child care, or having to get child care, or the issues people would have around not being able to commit to whether they were coming or not. I mean, it was--. I mean, there&#8217;s such a lot of things you could say about a person who comes out of a--. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever been to any &#8220;Undoing Racism&#8221; trainings? Well, there&#8217;s a whole description of characteristics of white people, and really, it&#8217;s not--. I think we associate them with white men, but we, as white women, we also have these things, which is, we are task-oriented, we think we have to have evidence, we don&#8217;t often go on intuition and trust. So this person was acting out all of those behaviors, as far as, that&#8217;s what she brought, you know? And people needed different things, and they weren&#8217;t always getting them from the group, and it sometimes was difficult to talk about those things.   And so, when somebody wanted money for child care, it became a big issue for some people, and it shouldn&#8217;t have been. But these were the things that nobody ever--.  They weren&#8217;t &#8220;givens&#8221;, ever, in organizations, until women brought them up. Like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t come to a meeting unless I bring my kid, or have somebody keep my kid that I have to pay for, so why should I have to pay to come to a meeting? Why should it cost me a day? I have to give up a day&#8217;s work, I don&#8217;t get any vacation, then I have to pay my mother to &#8216;take care of&#8217; my kid.&#8221; So it was, like, again, encountering some realities that rural women, particularly, and low-income women had, that sometimes other folks, including myself, didn&#8217;t have. That was not part of my reality. And so I had to hear that, and I had to listen and understand that. And some people did that better than others, you know. So there were always class issues, and I think there always are, and will be, class issues in our society, because there are class issues. We have a class system, whether we actually admit it or not. And then the other battles were around stuff like what to name us, what we were going to call ourselves, what we wanted our slogan to be, what kinds of directions we wanted to go, which projects we wanted to take on, what kind of funding we were going to go after, who was going to do that? I mean, those organizational battles were--. But they were big battles, because we were so intense, and we were so--. Everybody had such a sense of ownership about it that those decisions were very, very important. It wasn&#8217;t like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care what we name ourselves. Let&#8217;s just give it a name and get on with it.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;This really means something, so we have to really struggle with it. And it was tedious, to tell you the truth, after a while. Some people were like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do that anymore.&#8221; But the process was part of it.  JW: I also wonder what the response was in communities, to have an organization or a group of women coming together as a group of women.  GE: It was sometimes very threatening to people. I mean, again, my ignorance or whatever you want to call it, that we would be in places where people, men and women, would say to us, &#8220;Are y&#8217;all a man-hating group?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Do y&#8217;all allow men?&#8221; So, yeah, people were threatened, or maybe "threatened&#8221; is too strong a word. Some people probably were threatened, but it was certainly something that people remarked on. And when we did the Women&#8217;s Caravan, which was ten days, we went all through the region. I can&#8217;t remember how many. There were different people at different times, but there were, like, maybe five of us that did the whole trip. That really was where we would run into people, that, I think a couple times some of the women felt a little&#8212;especially the women of color&#8212;felt a little uneasy in some of the places we went. And well they should. But we did get that reaction--. I think that refers back to what I said to you earlier, that some of the women said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in a group that people think we&#8217;re anti-men.&#8221; Because they just, some people automatically assume if you&#8217;re in a group of women doing something together, that you&#8217;re anti-men. Not that we weren&#8217;t sometimes, but not in the sense of--. Well, I was going to say, not in the sense of individual men. That's not true, that&#8217;s not true. Sometimes it was--. That we knew that individual men were evil and bad, and we wanted to do things to them. We would never do it, but we had a little guerilla group.
JW: Did you really?  GE: Yeah, we did. But we didn&#8217;t do much. It was so hard. Part of it was that everybody was spread out all over the region, you know, five different states, that core group. And it was hard. But anyway--.   JW: Well, so, from CORA, did you start this job? Was that what led you into this?  GE: I did. Yep, I did. It was a natural leap at that point. I actually got fired from CORA. And this happened to be open, so it was like, well, okay, I need a job. I mean, seriously, I needed a job, and I knew some of the same people, and it was so much of an outgrowth of what I was doing at CORA already. But it was very scary to me, because I almost said no. I had no ambition to be an executive director. It was like, oh god, the responsibility. But I really needed a job, and I wanted to stay in the region, and I wanted to stay working with the groups that I had come to know. So here I still am.   JW: Is leaving CORA something you feel comfortable talking about?  GE: Yeah. I don&#8217;t totally know why I got fired. I think it was because I came to a point where--. And it was a weird firing, but I think it was because I became more and more disenchanted with the way that the people from the churches were treating the people from the communities. And I think that at some point I&#8217;d actually had some--. Again, my own romanticism about how things were going to work out. I think that I actually thought that people genuinely were trying to have this partnership between people in the community and these church folks. And a lot of it had to do with resources, because the churches put money into CORA, and then part of what I did was help manage a grants program, and a process where the groups got grants through CORA. Because several churches would give money to pool their money, instead of putting it into the regions separately, they put it into CORA, and then CORA would make these grants. It&#8217;s a very similar grant-making program to what we have, in terms of what they were trying to fund. Social change work, and organizing--. And so it was always, the church people were never trusting of the community people, and the community people were often not trusting of the church people. I felt in the middle of that, and very pulled by that. I became more and more disenchanted with the folks from the church, because they--. I identified as a community person anyway, I mean, I wasn&#8217;t a church person, I was a community person. Even though at that point I was management, I&#8217;d always been a working person and kind of grassroots myself. So really, that&#8217;s who my people were. &#8220;My people&#8221; in the sense of the people around me, and my family, and so forth. And some of these church people, I just got to the point where it was so--. It just seemed so against what the church was supposed to be about, that I became more and more, probably, difficult about that. And I think it just pissed people off. I think there was a point--. And then this person, Jim Sessions in the ED, he left to go to Highlander, so Tina became the executive coordinator. She was a person I admired a lot, even though she was more based in the church, but she was a pretty radical person. And I was really happy that she became the executive coordinator. But it seemed like things--. I guess I had a high expectation of her, and after she became--. Here&#8217;s something, and again, this is another part that I&#8217;m not sure I would want to leave in here, but I&#8217;ll tell you this. It just became like she was a different person. And that was really disillusioning to me, because I was so in favor of her, a fellow woman becoming the director of this church-based organization, which was SO male-dominated, and I knew she could handle it. But she was almost like--. I felt like at the time that she turned on me. It was the weirdest thing. And I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t what about my behavior--. I don't know. I just have never totally understood it. But we became alienated, and I think that had a lot to do with her--. It was her decision to let me go. And I don&#8217;t know if that was because people were pressuring her to let me go, or what. But there was a point in there where I became more aligned with the community folks, and somebody else who was on the--. Some of the people in the ADPC group had actually, from time to time, they talked about spinning off from CORA. And that came up ever so often, that people would talk about it and say, &#8220;Well, now, it really won&#8217;t do us any good to do that, because we&#8217;d have to form another structure and raise our own money. This way, even though we&#8217;re, we have to struggle with these church issues, we are getting grants through this process, and if we spin off, then we&#8217;ll have to &#8230;&#8221; You know, it just wouldn&#8217;t make sense. It wasn&#8217;t going to be of benefit to them to do that. So apparently, as near as I can remember, there was some little conversation about that. Somewhere along the way, during this time after Tina took office, and someone who she knew who was at this meeting reported back to her that I was encouraging the ADPC to spin off from CORA and form its own organization, which truthfully was a flat-out lie. I was really against it, because I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s in your best interest to stay attached to these resources, and not to go off and try to form your own organization.&#8221; But anyway, that was more fuel for that fire. The person who told her that actually told a lot of tales about people and gossiped in inaccurate ways. But, the true part of it was, I was very disillusioned, and disenchanted about the way that things were--. It seemed like instead of becoming more equal and more of a partnership, it was becoming less so. That the church was trying to exercise more control instead of building more trust, and that the people who had become the leaders of CORA at that point were these very arrogant, self-righteous white guys who would actually say things, like about why these community people didn't go to church. And so then you&#8217;d have to go into, like, &#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t go to YOUR church, but many of them go to church. They may not go to the Presbyterian church, but they may go to the Pentecostal church.&#8221; So it was at that level, and it would be, like, &#8220;Oh, my gosh, this is insane.&#8221; And one of the last things that to me was just like (makes strangling noise of frustration) was that at one of the commission meetings, they had been talking about how to open up the membership to other types of faith-based organizations, including Jewish organizations, and Muslim organizations, and other types of faith traditions. And they had a big debate about this, at this meeting, and one of the commissioners, that&#8217;s what they called themselves, doesn&#8217;t that sound good? &#8211; commissioners? &#8211; got up and said, &#8220;Well, if we open up the membership to other faith traditions, who&#8217;s to say some of these Satanic people are not going to come in?" I just went, "Oh, my god, who are these people I&#8217;m working with?&#8221; It blew my mind. It just was like, ooh, one of those little moments where you just go, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t working for me.&#8221; So that what was happening. The country was moving in a more conservative direction, and so was the church, the institution of churches, and so were these people. And I think I got caught in that. And it was okay. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t really ready to go, but I certainly wasn&#8217;t at the peak of my happiness there. So that&#8217;s essentially what happened.  JW: Well, I&#8217;ve taken a lot of your time.   GE: Well, I&#8217;m talking an awful lot. You obviously must have opened up some kind of wellspring I didn&#8217;t even know--. I haven&#8217;t talked about some of this stuff forever. So processing it is kind of weird, because a lot of it I&#8217;ve never talked about. I don&#8217;t particularly like to. So it&#8217;s your fault, for getting me talking. (Laughs).
JW: Well, you told great stories!  GE: Oh, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m leaving out so much, but it&#8217;s okay.  JW: Well, is there anything that you think that we should cover? Since it&#8217;s getting late, something that we should definitely include right now? I can always come back, too. I often do follow-up interviews. Is there anything that has bubbled up while we&#8217;ve been talking, that you think would be important to add?  GE: Well, I think the whole experience of the Women&#8217;s Alliance, it&#8217;s a very difficult thing for me to talk about, because it didn&#8217;t end well for me, and I again had a sense of having a vision, an idealized version of what women--. I mean, I felt like the strength of women working together was what it was all about, and that we could be in solidarity with each other and that would never fail me. And you know, when I&#8217;d begin to--. And I&#8217;m still this way, I still can be very blind to the realities of human frailty. I always think I overinvest in how I think things should be. And I think the disappointments of how women treated each other through that, and particularly a couple of women who were really good friends, who I thought were really good friends--. And Tina, she wasn&#8217;t in the Alliance, but my disappointment in her as a woman who, I felt like we were the same generation, we kind of had the same issues, and that I just felt like, &#8220;Oh, wow, if she became my boss it would be so great.&#8221; So my disappointment, and my sense of, &#8220;Well, what is going on here?&#8221; was really painful to me. And the same, some of the same stuff happened in the Women&#8217;s Alliance. When I saw that there was one particular person who wanted to take it in a direction, and she really wasn&#8217;t--. She was kind of on a personal power trip. It&#8217;s been very hard for me to reconcile--. Even though I&#8217;m still a feminist, and even though I still--. Well, like I said, sometimes listening to the men go on and on, that those kinds of experiences of women grappling with power are things that I never have been able to totally understand and resolve in myself. Including my own, because here I am now in a position where I've had a lot of power, and it&#8217;s very hierarchical in the sense that the way that it&#8217;s structured. But I&#8217;ve tried to make it not be that way, and how difficult that is sometimes. And so I think that the questions about how women use their power, and how we seek power, and how we do with it when we get it, because we&#8217;re so unaccustomed to it, are still things that are really up in the air for me, and that I really don&#8217;t have answers for. Sometimes I&#8217;m able to share that and talk with other women about it, and other times I see women--. Because I think like with any oppressed people, when you get a little bit of power, sometimes you don&#8217;t use it well, or you don&#8217;t know what to do with it, or you feel like somebody&#8217;s going to take it away from you. And I think that grows out of the culture we&#8217;re in. I think that grows out of a capitalist society, where everybody&#8217;s in competition, where everything&#8217;s about individualism and getting something and having power, personal power. So that part of it, as far as trying to really go through and talk to you about what happened and the dynamics of the Alliance, that could be another whole afternoon&#8217;s conversation. Because it was both an incredibly wonderful and rich experience for me, as well as in the end, a very disappointing experience for me. Even though the Alliance still lives, and they&#8217;re still doing stuff, and some of what they&#8217;re doing is really great, and so--. I mean, that&#8217;s good. But that&#8217;s just a whole piece of my agenda for my life that just was not--. When it started out it was, &#8220;This is it! This is what I want to do, this is what I&#8217;ve been wanting all my life, is to have this experience of &#8211; not ALL my life, but of working with women in this way, and just the way that it developed and the way that it turned out was just so not like that. That it just has been--. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have any way to really explain it, other than that we&#8217;re all human beings, we all have frailties, and needs, and pain, and that gets played out in our organizations. We have to keep trying to figure out ways to make it work, I think. That&#8217;s a pretty simplistic explanation, but anyway, that&#8217;s all I would say. If there&#8217;s anything you want to know more in depth about the Alliance, that would require another conversation.  JW: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Well, thank you.  GE: You&#8217;re welcome. You&#8217;re very welcome.
