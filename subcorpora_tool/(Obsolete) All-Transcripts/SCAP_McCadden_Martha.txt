DANA: 	(unclear) OK, so I’m Illaria Dana sitting with Molly McCadden on May 19th for the Smith College Alumnae Oral History Project.  And I just want to start with (unclear).

MCCADDEN:	OK.  I grew up outside Philadelphia in Malvern, Pennsylvania, so west of Philadelphia, and came to Smith when I was 18 for college.  Then went to Smith for four years.  Went to live in Cambridge/Somerville [Massachusetts] area for four years after that and then I moved to Chicago.  So I’m traveling here this week from Chicago.

DANA: 	And how did you choose Smith College?

MCCADDEN:	I knew I wanted to go to a small liberal arts college and probably on the East Coast.  So that didn’t actually narrow it down too much.  There’s a lot of those.  But I think it was actually my dad who suggested Smith, because he had gotten one of those, you know, Princeton Review, top 300 colleges books and my parents had planned this kind of extravagant tour the summer before my junior year, I guess, of colleges, which around and I looked at a bunch of schools and Smith was kind of the winner, just when I first got on campus.  I had a vibe that I felt comfortable here and that everyone seemed super inclusive, super smart, super inquisitive, which is important to me.  And I am really kind of thankful that my dad recommended that we at least look at it.
I hadn’t really considered, you know, a classically all-female institution.  It wasn’t really something I was considering.  I went to a pretty large public high school and I was pretty, pretty set when I arrived.  I definitely — had the opposite feeling at other schools.  So it was helpful to kind of just know when I got here that it felt good.  And — I remember like walking over kind of past President’s House toward the Quad, with the pond and just feeling really energized by the vibe here and my mom always said, you’ve got to go with your gut and my gut chose Smith.

DANA: 	What did you study while you were here?

MCCADDEN:	My major was American Studies and I minored in Film Studies.  I took a lot of Women’s Studies classes now the Program for the Study of Women and Gender and I, so I did a lot of kind of film and media studies.

DANA: 	And why did you come to the reunion?

MCCADDEN:	Smith has — Smith has stayed a very important part of my life since graduation.  Sometimes to a more or less extent, depending on my mood.  But I definitely knew that reunion was a big part of being an alum and also being a student.  When I was here it was really insightful to chat with alums and see what their lives looked like after Smith.  So I kind of always knew that I would come to reunion.  It doesn’t hurt that I’m helping to plan it this year, so I kind of have to be here.  But it’s a really nice opportunity to stay in touch with some Smithies that I may not have already been in touch with as well.

DANA: 	So do you notice any big differences on the campus now as opposed to when you were here?

MCCADDEN:	Let’s see.  Honestly, it doesn’t feel that different.  Some of the buildings are different.  I notice that there’s a bench in front of Seelye [Hall] now.  That’s different.  My class had the Campus Center.  We were the first year; I think it like opened on our like first day pretty much.  So we didn’t have to kind of manage, deal with any of the construction of Campus Center, so we never really lived without that.
It all kind of feels the same.  Honestly, Northampton feels a lot different.  The, you know, all the facades are the same, but they’re filled with different types of stores and restaurants.  Some of them are the same.  I’m thankful that Woodstar [Café] is still there.  But yeah, campus really feels very similar.  I’m glad to see all the banners are still being hung.  They might say different things but they’re still kind of a traditions of that.  Although like the dining rooms, the plates are the same and the food, honestly, tastes the same.
One thing, when I — every time I come back to Smith I notice the bathrooms smell the same.  (laughter) Which is, I don’t know how they do it and also the signage in the bathrooms is the same.  So the sign that says something about like not dying your hair in the shower, it’s like that bathroom or that sign in the bathroom is still there.  You know, the way that the bathrooms are set up, the way the houses are set up, all, like I don’t know, I’m a sucker for signage, so I definitely notice that the door tags are the same, with the room numbers.  So honestly, it doesn’t feel too different.
I’m sure there’s a lot of different stuff going on, on campus.  But it honestly, it all feels very similar to me.  I guess not too much changes in 10 years, even though when I was here I was sort of thinking that 10 years from now everything’s going to be different.  But it really kind of feels very similar.

DANA: 	You were talking about houses.  What house did you live in?

MCCADDEN:	I lived in Cushing House.  All four years.  Cushing in the Quad.  And I was H.P. [House President] my senior year.  Very active in house dynamics.  Our class also, the first year was the last year before dining was consolidated.  So we still had dining rooms in all the houses.  So that was a big change from when I was here.  And you know it’s funny, I say that nothing, not much has changed over 10 years, but I’ve been back between now and then.  I think it might be a lot more kind of insightful for someone who has been, who hadn’t been back in 10 years, which I’m sure there are many of us and many alums.  But I lived in Boston once I graduated.  So I was here and I still have friends on campus.
But yes, so I lived in Cushing and there was dining in all of, most of the houses when I was here, so that’s a big change.  Probably for the better.  We fought it pretty hard my year, because we were very, our class was very much pro-traditions.  But traditions need to change for a certain reasons.  So the option, the dining room options are a lot better now; it seems like there’s a lot more fun, and delicious food.
Also, we had the To-Eat Guy so people didn’t really have cell phones.  Like we did, but they weren’t smart phones.  I had like a flip phone, a Razr, Motorola flip phone.  So everything that you needed was like kind of here for you.  So we had the To Eat Guy, we called him and you just dialed To Eat on your phone, your landline.  Wait, did the rooms still have phones in them?  No, OK, (laughs) yeah, exactly.
So we had phones and that’s how you would call your friends and you’d dial To Eat and we would hear him read the menus and then you’d like call your friend and say, “Hey, let’s go eat at this place,” so that was a fun change.  We also had the Daily Jolt, which was another like kind of like message board where you could post questions and you could, you know, ask for rides if you’re going places and Facebook was brand new my sophomore year, so we — and it was super exclusive.
Because it was only like Ivy League schools to begin with, because these guys at Harvard founded it and then they, you had to have a .edu email address in order to sign up and it was only certain schools and I remember our sophomore year Smith got on the list and we were all like, oh my God, we have Facebook (laughs) and then like you had friends, I got friends in like Penn State and they were like, what’s Facebook?  Why don’t we get it?  So of course, now it’s open to everybody, so that was a big deal my sophomore year.
So, yeah, I think it’s, it is interesting to see how like everybody has phones out and you know, but that’s kind of a marker of changes in the world.  That’s not really something that is obviously specific to Smith.

DANA: 	Mm-hmm.  So you were an H.P., were you involved in other clubs on campus? What was your social life like?

MCCADDEN:	What was my social life like?  I definitely, so yeah, I was H.P. and I mostly did house stuff.  Most of my friends were in my house.  I studied abroad in the U.K. in Norwich, England for my first semester of my junior year.  So I studied American Studies in England, which was an interesting experience.  I was at the University of East Anglia.  Honestly, I was going to go for a year, but I didn’t want to miss out on too much time at Smith, so I came back.  What else did I do?  Socialize?
So my first year I was in orchestra.  It was really fun.  I didn’t continue, for like various reasons.  I definitely, because I had played the cello for 10 years before I got to Smith and then got here and it was a very different experience and I think that maybe if I could do it all again I would probably focus a little bit more on that aspect of my time here.
Same thing, I didn’t take a language while I was here, which I am a little regretful for as well, just because I studied German all throughout like middle school and high school and then got here and I should have taken advantage of the study abroad program, for instance.  But I really loved being on campus, so I didn’t really want to spend too much time away from campus.
And growing up I was in, I was from Pennsylvania, so getting here and back wasn’t too challenging.  There’s trains.  I had a car my junior and senior year, too, so I was able to kind of navigate that way.  	So we were talking about the mall.  I don’t remember what like (laughs) we just called it “The Mall” but we would go to the mall sometimes.  We would drive there, get our snacks.  Yeah, we met at the house a lot.  I didn’t really go off campus to like any of the other schools too often.  And I was really happy to be here and kind of be in the Smith bubble and I didn’t really want to like get out of it too much.

DANA: 	Hmm.  Yeah, can I ask about dating? Did you date while you were here?  What was that like?

MCCADDEN:	Yeah.  So I was, I was dating women while I was here.  So I was, it was easy, you know.  I didn’t have to kind of like negotiate meeting people in the way that sometimes you hear, for folks who are really interested in maybe non-similar gendered relationships.  So it was pretty easy to — and to meet people and I dated a lot of people while I was here and I had a lot of fun with it.

DANA: 	Was that part of the inclusive atmosphere that you felt like Smith gave off?

MCCADDEN:	Yeah, for sure.  It was like growing up in, in high school I wasn’t necessarily as open about kind of different sexualities, but when I came here I felt very comfortable to explore and be whoever I wanted to be and whoever I wanted to be that day, maybe even.  It didn’t have to necessarily define myself as a certain way, and that goes across the board with Smith in general, was that I felt really comfortable, you know, like sounds kind of cliché, but like finding myself and I think that’s something I’ve really taken with me as I’ve been away from Smith is the ability to navigate different worlds and not necessarily be kind of like inauthentic about it, but really to be open and ask appropriate questions and learn and then take it and kind of synthesize and then move onto another situation.
So I do really believe that my time here gave me the power to kind of explore myself in a way that I wouldn’t necessarily have done and that’s something — I mean, maybe any other institution could have provided that for me, but I may have had to seek it a little bit more, whereas at Smith it’s just kind of expected that everyone is going to kind of be open and communicative about who they are and what they’re interested in and what they want and what is important to them and then kind of move on from that and kind of take it with you as you leave.  So it’s definitely something that I am thankful for and that I appreciate when I come back, is to be in kind of this spirit of whether it’s like intellectualism or intelligence or similar values, it’s not necessarily something that I find in my day-to-day existence outside of Smith.
You know, because it’s — people don’t necessarily like understand what it’s like to be in this sort of community unless you actually are.  Even explaining what reunion is to people.  People are like, wait, so 300 people from your class are going back?  And (laughs) you know, like you’re doing this?  And it’s not necessarily understood, I think.  And that’s been something that’s been a challenge for me.
I was actually speaking with our like Smith Fund coordinator about why I haven’t donated more to Smith and as like, honestly like I am thankful for the education that I got, but I don’t really feel it on a day-to-day basis, because of the world that I’m living in now doesn’t know what Smith is.  Really doesn’t care what Smith is.  You know, it’s not really as important to other people as maybe it is to me.
And that might be where I’m living.  You know, maybe if I’d stayed on the East Coast it would be a different experience.  You know, definitely when I was going to Smith people understood kind of what that meant, but now that I’m 10 years out, doesn’t necessarily have the same ramifications.  Nobody cares what my GPA was.  Right?  (laughs) Like I definitely, you know, I was here, I was like, oh man, I’ve got to study, study, study.  But I may have done that a little bit differently as well, because it’s — I mean, I’ve submitted my transcript because I needed to for grad school or for other things and maybe if I had, maybe if I’d gone to law school my GPA might have been important, but no one really cares.
But I think that now — that I am a little bit even more separated, 10 years isn’t too long of a time, but it’s obviously more than my five-year — I think I’m starting to really understand the value of Smith kind of moving forward and as I’m meeting friends who have kids who are in middle school and early years of high school and starting to kind of see the value of what it looked like to recommend Smith to someone and maybe get involved in that way, as far as like, working with the Smith Club in Chicago and the admissions portion of the that and like really like speaking up Smith.
Because I think I have kind of struggled with my role with Smith between when I was a student and now that I’m an alum, and maybe a little bit more of an active alum now, too.

DANA: 	Mm-hmm.  So I’m just going to ask you another question about any advice that you would have for students here at Smith and Smith students in the future.

MCCADDEN:	Yeah.  I would say take advantage of everything.  Say yes.  Don’t necessarily worry so much about grades.  That was a big thing when I was here was everyone was, at least my community, the folks I was hanging out with, a lot of the time we would get up and study on the weekends.  We would study very hard.  Also take classes that maybe you wouldn’t normally take.  I didn’t take any math classes while I was here and I think that I should have because one, it would be great to get an education at Smith in a subject that maybe I wasn’t as comfortable with and really challenged myself with.
I only took one science class.  And I know that that might be the other way, too, for science and kind of math-brained folks might be a little bit more likely to not take a writing class or, whatever.  I’m sure there’s different requirements now, but yeah, I didn’t have to take a math class and I definitely should have taken a math class.  (laughs)
So yeah, I think just open your eyes, keep your head up and say yes to any opportunity that comes your way and don’t worry too much about the ramifications of your actions currently.  Obviously, you know, be a good human being, but these little moments that you’re living are a part of a really larger life that you will continue to live.  That’s something that I, I think only really I began to understand in the past few years.

DANA: 	(unclear) Can you talk about your life since you’ve left Smith, what you’ve done?

MCCADDEN:	Sure.

DANA: 	What you’re doing now and if there’s connections, things that are connected to what you learned here, in that process (unclear).

MCCADDEN:	Yeah, sure thing.  So immediately after Smith I moved to, I lived in Somerville, but so Cambridge in the Boston area and worked the service industry.  I was a barista at a cool little café in Cambridge and loved it and — decided that I should probably keep my education going.  And I had worked in a few libraries in high school and then also at Smith I spent a lot of time in the libraries and I spent a lot of time in the Archives and I really felt comfortable around knowledge and learning and the value of libraries in general.  So I went to library school.  Got my master’s in Library and Information Science at Simmons and it was also kind of a trendy degree to get at the time, so I did that.
And really liked it.  I worked in a couple of libraries in Boston and Cambridge.  I was doing kind of traditional library internship and then also doing kind of like image curation.  At a digital archive, which was really fun.
And then I was dating someone who lived in Chicago and I wasn’t too, too happy in the Boston area so it was like, eh, crap, I’ll just go.  So I moved to Chicago and that was six years ago and of course, the relationship ended very quickly (laughs) once I arrived, as sometimes happens.  So she was like, “Well, I guess I’m actually going to move to San Francisco now.  Do you want to come?” I was like, well, I just got to Chicago, so nope.
So I was spending a fair amount of time looking for library-type jobs and kind of more career-focused jobs when I got there and didn’t really love it.  I was kind of in the mindset that I could find the perfect job for myself and turn down some stuff that maybe would have been useful opportunities but I just was like, no, I’m just going to take my time with it.
So I was working in the service industry.  Again, I was working at a coffee shop and then I worked at this really cool bar as a server for about three years and then randomly fell into this job that I’m currently at, a medical supply company.  So I’m doing inventory management for this company called Absolute Medical.  It’s a small business.  We specialize in compression garments for lymphedema.  So it’s a pretty niche market, but we do a lot of really kind of I think useful work.
It’s been a struggle to kind of rationalize that with myself a little bit because it is a for-profit company that’s making money basically off of insurance companies and sick people.  So it’s been a little bit of a struggle just kind of with my values and my own kind of just personal kind of needs for getting something out of a job, because I do tend to enjoy work, I’m a hard worker and I really like to work, but if I’m not doing work that feels like I’m giving back in a way, but then it’s a struggle.  But this job has been really useful because I’ve, one, I’ve challenged myself a lot and two, I’ve learned a lot.  And three is this is the first job that I’ve ever had that, where they said, “There’s room for advancement,” and then there’s actually been room for advancement.
So I’ve been there for about two years and I’ve already kind of grown with the company and they value me as a person who — is able to kind of see the bigger picture and has different experience coming from different worlds.  So I’m really thankful for this job and I, when I say I should have taken a math class, I should have taken a math class (laughs) because I am doing a lot with accounting type principles and I don’t really have much of that background.
But I’m actually going back to school this summer to one of the community colleges in Chicago and I’ll be taking a math class and a business class and that’s one thing that I definitely appreciate, I think that I learned from Smith is that it’s never too late necessarily to change courses and to kind of move on and if something isn’t working, push it to the side and find something that does work.
So yeah, it’s been a path for sure and it’s been a bit of a struggle sometimes when people, like when I was here at my five-year reunion, everyone was like, so what are you doing?  It’s like everyone’s favorite question.  I was like, well, I’m working at a bar and it was definitely hard to say that at times because at Smith it’s all, you know, who do you know?  (laughs) What politician are you working for?  And there’s a lot of — like even the ambassadors were saying, oh. We have someone next weekend who is like the chair of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or something and I was like, oh well, that’s great.  (laughs)
It’s like, well, I’m a nice person and we can chat, like I don’t have any networking opportunities for you, but I’m like thankful that, that those exist and that they are there for people and I — yeah, I love the opportunity to be back and I mean, even I have friends who aren’t working currently and it’s very challenging for them to say that.  Like what do you do?  It’s like, well, I’m taking some time off and it’s like, well, that’s fine, like that’s more than fine.  Actually, that might be better, so that’s something you say and like celebrate as opposed to feel poorly about.

DANA: 	Yeah.,

MCCADDEN:	Hopefully that helps.  I don’t know if I talked around all the questions or — sort of helpful.  It’s really fun.  I appreciate the opportunity.
