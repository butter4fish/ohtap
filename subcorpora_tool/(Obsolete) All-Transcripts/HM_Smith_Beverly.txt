Speaker 1: Good afternoon.
Speaker 2: Good afternoon.
Speaker 1: My name is Edward Anderson.  I'm an interviewer with HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers], and this is Scott Stearns, he's our videographer.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: We thank you for inviting us into your home and serving as one of our outstanding HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: You're very welcome.
Speaker 1: We're looking forward to chatting with you for the next several minutes, perhaps hours to discover much about you.  Will you start by stating your full name and spelling it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay, Beverly Ann Evans Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith].  Do you want me to spell it?  B-E-V-E-R-L-Y, A-N-N, E-V-A-N-S, S-M-I-T-H.
Speaker 1: And your date of birth and location of birth please?
Speaker 2: Is April 12, 1948 in Massillon, Ohio.
Speaker 1: What is today's date and what is our location at this time?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 16, it's 2006 and we are in the family room of my home in Marietta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Very well.  What is your occupation Ms. Smith?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I'm a consultant.  My husband and I have our own business called The HR Group, Inc. and my husband Stephen [Stephen J. Smith] does human resources work.  I do consulting work; I do a variety of things.  I do strategic plans for companies.  My main function is to look at operations, whether they're corporations or non-profits or churches and try and help organizations find ways to run better and by better, it's even more efficient, make more money, improve the morale of the employees, whatever they feel might be an issue.  Luckily I've got a gift to be able to go into any type of organization and kind of scan it, do some focus groups, do some interviews and figure out what would help the company work much smoother.  So that ranges from strategic plans to new appraisal systems to mentoring to the executives; to team building; so a real variety of things.
Speaker 1: Sounds very interesting.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: We'll want to explore that quite a bit more a little bit later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 331503
Speaker 1: During the next few minutes we want to talk a little about family, about you and family.  But first let me ask you five People magazine type questions before we get into that.  What is your favorite food (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  Oh I'm not good on favorites--popcorn.
Speaker 1: Okay and your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time is definitely the fall.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: You know, purples and reds are my favorite; bright colors.  Don't have a specific one.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: Anything sunny, beaches, I love the water.  We go on cruises sometimes; so just a nice sunny location, resort type area, I love.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite expression or phrase?
Speaker 2: Do I--I think other people probably would tell you that I do. I can't think of one right off.
Story_ID: 331504
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about family, Ms. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith], if we can.  Tell us your mom's name and a little bit about her. Well tell us her name and spell her name and then a little bit about her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure. It's Willa Mae Dumas Evans, W-I-L-L-A, M-A-E, D-U-M-A-S, E-V-A-N-S--that's my maiden name.
Speaker 1: All right. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Houma, Louisiana--no she--yes Houma, Louisiana. Napoleonville [Louisiana]; she was born in Napoleonville.
Speaker 1: Napoleonville. And what was her profession?
Speaker 2: She was a teacher.  She taught before she got married.  Once she got married, she was a homemaker.  So she was a homemaker her entire life; never did go back to teaching.
Speaker 1: I see.  What do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh she grew up mostly in Lafayette, Louisiana.  Her [Preston Dumas] dad was a railroad engineer; he worked on engines on the railroad, kind of worked his way up.  They moved a lot because he worked on the railroad.  They finally settled in Lafayette.  Her mom [Edna Hiem Dumas] was a homemaker.  She has three sisters and they grew up in a strongly Catholic family in Louisiana.  All went to college, all four girls.  My grandparents on my grandfather's side they were--he had about eight or nine brothers and sisters.  So most of his brothers were doctors, his sisters were teachers; so education was really a part of the family.  And Mom and all of her sisters, they all went to a different black--historically black institution [HBCU].  One went to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], one went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], she went to Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and--oh gosh I can't remember where the other one went, but they--Southern [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  So they all went to historically black colleges in the South.  She grew up in the South and she got married in 1947.  I don't think she had the best memories of the South growing up.  Her family--I remember she and her sisters all talking about the time when their father--they were very pretty girls and he wanted to make sure that they stayed where they should be and did not get into any trouble.  I can remember her telling me that he took all four of them to a bridge where a black man had recently been hung, so that they could see him hanging there.  It's funny because all of them still talk about that image, but he wanted them to understand that they needed to make sure that they stayed where they needed to stay and avoided any problems and that no one took advantage of them.  He didn't want them to have that same fate or to run into anybody that would, so.  But she had a happy childhood from what I can tell with her mom and her sisters.
Story_ID: 331505
Speaker 1: Any other stories from her [Smith's mother, Willa Mae Dumas Evans] that were relayed to you?
Speaker 2: You know we used to go visit every summer.  We lived in Ohio and so when we were young we would--my dad [Louie Evans] would put us in the car and you can imagine, I had two sisters [Joan Evans and Michele Evans] so the five of us in a car, we would drive from Ohio to Lafayette [Louisiana] in the heat.  It seemed like it was a two or three day drive, and he was always very careful where we stopped because he had to stop for gas someplace where he knew he could get gas.  And I can remember vividly a situation where we had stopped to get some gas and something to eat and because my mother is very light, we had to let her go in and get the food because my dad couldn't.  But we had to go to the restroom and Mom had taken us to the restroom. And my sister by mistake had gone into the restroom that was for white women instead of for colored women and we couldn't find her and I can remember everybody holding their breath as she walked out of that door and my mom just really quickly ran and got her so that we could get out of there.  But we didn't see that kind of--the drinking fountains and the restrooms that were colored and white in Ohio but we certainly saw them on the way going down to Louisiana to visit.  But we had a good time in the summer, we'd stay there for a month or two visiting grandparents [Edna Hiem Dumas and Preston Dumas] and Grandpa taking us around and visiting with cousins.  Once we got there it was great, the trip there was a little hectic. But we did stay one time in a hotel [Lorraine Motel, Memphis, Tennessee] where Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was shot and I remember that.  We remembered seeing pictures of the shooting.  I can remember my dad saying, I can remember-that that was the hotel where he had lost his life. So that's another vivid memory.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes. Such hotels and motels were few and far between for black travelers in those days.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Sure were.
Speaker 1: And you were born in Ohio yourself?
Speaker 2: I was, right, in Massillon [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And I think you gave me the date earlier, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-eight [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay. April, 1948.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  But Mom was born in Napoleonville [Louisiana] you were saying in Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Right Napoleonville, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other--is your mom still alive?
Speaker 2: She is.
Speaker 1: Good, good.
Speaker 2: She's alive and well; as a matter of fact she only has one sister who has passed away.
Speaker 1: Great, great. All are still with us.
Speaker 2: They're all alive and having a great time.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful (laughter).
Story_ID: 331506
Speaker 1: Any other stories from your childhood that you remember her [Smith's mother, Willa Mae Dumas Evans] telling?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know not--in terms of myself she--yeah, my mother was something.  She always thought I studied too much; apparently I was a very serious child which is why she put me in school when I was three.  I also started to play the piano when I was three.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that. She enrolled you in school when you were three?
Speaker 2: She did, she enrolled me in school when I was three; in kindergarten.  She found a private school [St. Paul's Kindergarten, Massillon, Ohio] that would take me and I guess for some reason she thought that was a good idea.  But I do remember walking to school.  She paid an older student to take me and she always--hate to put this on film but I can remember what she would do.  We had a fireplace in our living room and she had a big washtub and she would get me ready in the washtub and she'd get me ready-she'd always putting my underwear on last, I was little so I would go to the restroom before I left home and I can remember one time I went to school, got to school, sat down and it was very cold; so she forgot that last little step.  But you know I didn't say anything at least I remember having the wherewithal to just let that go, let it pass and not say anything.  Got home and explained what happened, she was so upset.  But she had another instance where she sent me to school and I really didn't--I think when I was four 'cause after I left that school and graduated, I still couldn't go to the first grade 'cause I was only four. So she moved me to another kindergarten that had an advanced program until the school would take me.  And I went to school and it was a holy day. In the Catholic church you don't have school on holy days of obligation. And I guess I didn't realize it was--and I went to school, got there, nobody was there.  Well the young lady had already dropped me off, so I was stuck there. So I remember running into a policeman and he asked me where I lived and I explained and he walked me part of the way home.  When I got back to our neighborhood--it was about a mile or two to get home and I went to a neighbor's house, and my mother--this is how my mom met her best friend.  I went to the neighbor's house and explained my mom's going to kill me, I'm not supposed to walk by myself but I figured I knew the way, school was out, there was no school, so I came back home.  Would you mind going home with me and explain to her the situation so I won't get into too much trouble?  So she did and she met Mrs. Wood [ph.] who just passed, gosh maybe a year or two ago, and that's how she met her best friend.  I mean they were best friends forever after that.  But always enjoyed school. My dad [Louie Evans] always wanted us to play an instrument.  His whole family--everybody played an instrument and so I started playing piano when I was about four and took lessons and then played concert piano in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] and participated in some competitions.  So growing up I think both of them were very, very strong on education; wanted to make sure we were well rounded and even from an early age got a chance to do that.  So she got us off on the right foot.
Story_ID: 331507
Speaker 1: Let's talk about her [Smith's mother, Willa Mae Dumas Evans] parents for a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her mom and dad.  Tell us about her mom first, what's her name, and please spell it?
Speaker 2: Her name is Edna Olivia Hiem Dumas [Edna Hiem Dumas]; now you want me to spell that. E-D-N-A, Edna, Olivia, O-L-I-V-I-A, Hiem, her parents were from Germany and her last name is spelled H-I-E-M, Dumas, D-U-M-A-S.  I don't know a whole lot about her.  I just remember her as a--as a matter of fact I read a letter that she wrote me when I was in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] just before you got here today.  I remember she had very, very long hair and she used to play peek-a-boo with us.  She would put her hair in front of her and open it up and say peek-a-boo.  She was always very encouraging.  She kept her mother; her mother lived in the house with them, so when we went to visit her mom was there also.
Speaker 1: Her mother, the person of German origin?
Speaker 2: You know, well, I know her dad was because his last name was Hiem.  We never could figure out--mom said they never knew whether their grandmother was black or white and nobody ever asked.  So it wasn't one of those questions you asked back then so they didn't.  But I'm pretty sure that there was a variety of diversity in the family on that particular side for sure.  But other than that about her and I don't know a whole lot about her.
Speaker 1: Did you meet her yourself personally?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes. She was alive until I graduated from college [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio].  She passed away in 1970; she passed away the year that I graduated from college.
Speaker 1: And her parents, did you know them?
Speaker 2: I knew my great-grandmother, yes, because she lived with them, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Great-grandmother. Oh yes the one who played peek-a-boo. Right, right, right. What do you remember most about her?
Speaker 2: That she was blind.  She had glaucoma, as do I, I found out. And she was in the house but she never really left the bedroom too much.  My grandmother took care of her and of course at that point when I was a child, she was very old but she did live with my grandparents until she passed away. And my grandmother died of breast cancer actually.  She communicated and we wrote back and forth.  She made my clothes when I was little, she was quite a seamstress, and we visited every now and then.
Speaker 1: Now your grandfather, Edna Olivia Hiem Dumas' husband, tell me his name and spell it please.
Speaker 2: Preston. What is Preston's last--middle name?  Preston Dumas, P-R-E-S-T-O-N and you know I can't remember right offhand his middle name, D-U-M-A-S was his middle name [sic. last name].  We do have a lot more history on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Tell me the years in which he lived and then give me some of that history please. He was born around?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh I know I have that information somewhere; maybe early 1890s, 1890s somewhere.  He had a large family; he had I guess about seven brothers and sisters.  I believe he's from Louisiana; if I'm not mistaken he's from the Houma [Louisiana] area.  His father was very active in Houma, Louisiana, H-O-U-M-A, and was kind of a civic leader there.  And the family had a lot of land and they do have a park there, the Dumas Park [Houma, Louisiana], that is named after my grandfather and I have some articles about the park when they dedicated it and we've been a couple of times to visit the park.  My mom went as recently as two years ago.
Speaker 1: Named after Preston or Preston's dad?
Speaker 2: Named after Preston's dad, John Dumas, D-U-M-A-S.  Very much a civic leader in the community and they really wanted a park and a recreation area for blacks in that city and they opened Dumas Park and a swimming pool for that purpose so that they could in fact have a recreation area for the children in the community.  You know which is interesting I hadn't thought about that because when we were in Massillon [Ohio]--and we'll get to this later--my dad [Louie Evans] did the same thing; opened a recreation center for black youth because there wasn't one in Massillon--but any how I'm off the subject.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah it is and you know I hadn't even thought about that.
Speaker 1: He modeled the same behavior as his father--his grandfather--his father-in-law, yes, grandfather-in-law (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He sure did, his grandfather-in-law. So the family has a great history there in terms of the park.
Story_ID: 331508
Speaker 1: My [maternal] great grandfather John's [John Dumas] father--I think I've got this right--was Alexandre Dumas, the author's, brother.  So our Dumas family name comes from Alexandre Dumas and Amadea [Amadea Dumas (ph.)]. Amadea was Alexandre Dumas' brother.
Speaker 2: I see. I was about to ask that, thank you for answering that.  So you are a descendant of the great Alexandre Dumas.
Speaker 1: Right, right, who was a famous writer and that's one of the things that I enjoy doing.  That family--very strong family in terms of education.  I can remember my grandfather [Preston Dumas] telling stories about his brothers, three of whom were doctors.  Who--one of whom was unable to practice here and got very discouraged and moved to France and never did come back home.  As a matter of fact several of them left this country.
Speaker 2: To include Alexandre; to include Alexandre, did he?
Speaker 1: He was never here, his brother came here.  His brother Amadea apparently came to Haiti and met my great-great-grandmother and then they came from Haiti to the United States as free people.  So that's how that side of the family--but on my grandfather's side because they felt that they were not able to practice their profession here, chose to leave here and he had another brother who was an artist who also left the country.  I got a chance to meet him.  He came back in--I must have been in high school or college then, and put an ad in the paper looking for relatives, and--'cause the family had lost track of him--and the family found him through an ad, one of the ads out in California, and most of my mother's [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] family is in California.  They were able to track him down and he came and got a chance to meet everybody.  He also wrote and was an artist but was very uncomfortable staying here and after he was here for awhile--he'd left his family back in France and he went back.  The rest of my grandfather's brothers and sisters mostly all reside in California in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area.  As a matter of fact the last one passed away probably two years ago.  They all lived to be very old.
Speaker 2: Have you had any contact to interact with the Dumas branch of the family in France?
Speaker 1: No I really haven't; and this is one of those things you really should do in terms of looking at genealogy.  I have not; on both sides I've got some strong information about background and haven't researched it but one of these days I have to look into it.
Speaker 2: What other stories have you heard about the elder or ancestor Dumas family during their sojourn in America?
Speaker 1: Mainly the stories around the fact that they were an educated people.  Sometimes did not have the chance to use that education as they wanted to, and in some cases they left and in other cases they just moved north.  I know my aunt in California has told me many times has told me--my mother's sister--she would never live in the South again just because of all the memories and discrimination.  Part of the family--there is a Dumas--there is another Dumas doctor who did move to Natchez, Mississippi and I have friends who are familiar with that part of the family and I have not explored looking into who's there but there is some of the family that's there as well.
Speaker 2: Let me make sure I have the record correct.  John Dumas' father and mother, tell me their names; do you recall?
Speaker 1: Oh, I have them somewhere here, I've got a genealogy that I can show you later.  But Amadea and Hannah [ph.], I want to say, but I do have that.  I can look that up for you.
Speaker 2: And John's wife--John Dumas' wife, their son?
Speaker 1: Is my father--is my grandfather.
Speaker 2: Is your--John is your grandfather--your great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Right my great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: And his wife's name was--do you recall?
Speaker 1: I have it written down but I'd have to look it up for you.
Speaker 2: All right. We'll get that a little later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right. I've explored five generations of your family on your mom's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can you go back further?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I cannot.
Speaker 2: All right and those interesting stories about people who have made a difference in this country and elsewhere in the world.
Story_ID: 331509
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Louie [Louie Evans].
Speaker 1: Yes your dad, right, yes.  Please give us his full name, spell it and give us his date of birth, please?
Speaker 2: Louie Edward Evans, L-O-U-I-E, E-D-W-A-R-D, E-V-A-N-S.  He was born March 25, 19--oh, and I know this.  My mother [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] was born in 1921, yeah, yeah that's when my mother was born in 1921.  So my dad had to be born--he was ten years younger [sic. older] than she was so he must have been born in 1911.  Yeah, her birthday is June 5, 1921.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That one I know, I've put that on so many forms these days.
Speaker 1: Well just go ahead and we'll recall the correct number here probably in a little while.  So tell us a little bit about your dad's family.  What did your dad do for a living?
Speaker 2: My dad was an electronic technician.  He was--has an interesting story.  He repaired televisions.  He--when he got out of the [U.S.] Army he wanted to try and find a way to use the veteran benefits to go to school, and had a real difficult time doing that because where--as he has written in his biography that he wrote for the kids--veterans benefits were available to white soldiers, they were not available to black soldiers, at least that's what he told them.  So he being himself challenged them on it and finally got a chance to use those benefits to go to school.  So he would drive from Massillon [Ohio] to Cleveland [Ohio], which is about an hour now so I know it had to be a long time then, and went to electronic school there.  He scored very well in school.  He did extremely well; he only had a third grade education when he was young because they didn't have education, then but he got education in the [U.S.] military and went to school.  But he told me stories of what the fact that they made him take his test twice 'cause he scored the highest and they couldn't believe he was scoring that well on tests.  So many times he would have to take his final exams a second time.  But he did tell at the end when he graduated with a 98 percent graduation rate, that they apologized to him for putting him through that.  But when he graduated he had three job offers--and he lived in this little tiny town so he had an offer from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [Dayton, Ohio].  He had an offer from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] in Florida--Cape Canaveral and the offer from Sears Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] to work in the television department.  So I can remember sitting at the table and he's trying to work through what to do and I remember him saying NASA.  He said there is this place in Florida and they're working on rockets; nobody's ever going to go to the moon, that's crazy.  So I think--I know we're going to have televisions so I think I'll take the job working on televisions 'cause the rocket thing is never going to work.  Years later you used to have to laugh at the fact that he turned down a chance to go to NASA as a black man, to worked on TVs.  I think he did what he was intending to do.  He was a TV repairman and the store that he worked for, he worked for Sears at the time, was having a down swing, they were having some issues.  He managed to turn their entire electronics department around and they wound up having the highest sales in television, appliances and so on because he's the one who took care of that.  And he trained--he wanted other young men to be able to do the same thing.  He was real concerned about young black men in the community.  And so he started an electronic school in the basement of our house.  So we still have that equipment 'cause we don't know what to do with it.  But he would take young men who were in high school and he would set up a school and if he saw somebody who had the ability, he would teach them himself and train them so that they could have a skill.  And when he retired and even before he retired, he knew that senior citizens really didn't have much else to do except watch television.  So anybody who is a senior citizen had a television problem, dad would repair the television sets for free because he felt like that was something that he could give and he couldn't do much for them. But he was very much involved in community.  So as much as my mom [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] used to complain--'cause he had us all in private school, he sent us all to college and I don't know how he ever did that, but he did a lot of free work for people that couldn't afford it so that they would have something and that he could give back to the community.
Speaker 1: Wonderful, wonderful. Let's talk about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was an interesting guy.
Speaker 1: Sounds like it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 331510
Speaker 1: Let's talk about his [Smith's father, Louie Evans] dad and mom.  What was his dad's name and please spell it and the timeframe in which he lived.
Speaker 2: His dad's name was William Edward Evans, and, oh--W-I-L-L-I-A-M, Edward, E-D-W-A-R-D, Evans, E-V-A-N-S.  I'm assuming he was from Georgia, I really don't know.  The history I have on my dad's side starts with my grandfather on Shepherds [ph.] farm in Tallapoosa, Georgia, which is right on the Alabama line.  And the story that I have--'cause dad has given a story--starts with him living on there and purchasing seven acres of Shepherds farm for his family to start a family farm.  And that was back in 1920; he was born around the 1890s, 1880s and owned a family farm when my dad was a small boy.  So somewhere around the 1920s--early 1920s.
Speaker 1: All right. And his wife, your grandmother is named?
Speaker 2: Julia Dunson Evans, J-U-L-I-A, Dunson, D-U-N-S-O-N, Evans, E-V-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: And the timeframe--the time period that she lived was?
Speaker 2: Around the 1891--I think she was born.  I don't know where she's from; I'm assuming it was in Georgia as well.  My dad I know used to form Dunson family reunions and have very large reunion for the family in Tallapoosa and had quite a few family members that came.  So I believe they were both from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did she work outside of the home or did she--.
Speaker 2: Yes and no---it sounds like my dad had nine brothers and sisters and from the stories that I have, she was a seamstress also and she worked for a family that had a retarded daughter.  She helped the mother take care of the daughter. And I think she--it sounds like from history that I have, she must have done that on a part-time basis.  So my grandfather had several jobs; also went to Ohio which is how they got connected with Ohio.  Found out that there was better work to make more money in Ohio and so he went there for several years to work, sending money back home and then came back home.  So they worked the farm and got their crop that way and she helped another family--the white family in the community with their daughter and did some work with them.
Speaker 1: Any knowledge of any other ancestors of William Edward Evans and Julia Dunson?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Do you have family reunions on either--for either branch of the family?
Speaker 2: No we really don't and that's unfortunate.  When, when my dad was alive they did have Dunson family reunions.  We never--I think, I think maybe went to one when we first got married but didn't really get a chance to go to any after that and don't really have a reunion, so no.  On my mom's [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] side, it really is just her three sisters and each of them had three children except for one aunt who had one.  So they are all very contemporary.  I'm the oldest granddaughter on my mom's side and so all of my cousins are younger and their children are younger.  So it's a very small family in terms of immediate family on her side.
Speaker 1: Any knowledge of the history of the name Evans and or the name Smith?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: All right. Or the name Dunson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay. We know about Dumas (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 331304
Speaker 1: Mrs. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories in the family of any Native American lineage among your ancestors?
Speaker 2: There is one on my dad's [Louie Evans] side in the autobiography he wrote for the children.  He indicated that his grandmother was a Native American Indian; and I don't know the name, I know it was the Blackfoot tribe and that's really all I know.  I know there were Indians in Georgia so I'm assuming that that's probably how that happened.
Speaker 1: And so her son--her daughter would have been Julia Dunson Evans, if that were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually it's on my father's side--on the grandfather's side.  So it would be William Evans, right my dad's father.
Speaker 1: William Edward Evans, right, right. All right any further stories of lineage that have been relayed down through the generations?
Speaker 2: I know that my dad had nine brothers and sisters and several passed away early.  His mother had twenty-two brothers and sisters.  In his book he mentions that his grandfather had been married three times and I gather from reading all twenty-two were around and he knew all twenty-two 'cause he named them all in his biography.  On his father's side he had--his father had three sisters and a brother.  Something happened in a racial incident with my father's uncle and they never saw him.  I guess after the incident happened they have no idea what happened to him, where he went.  So he obviously met with a bad situation.  The three sisters were around though.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So he did see them.
Story_ID: 331305
Speaker 1: When they were young and my dad [Louie Evans] had stories of instances where--he recalls a time when in the summertime they used to have to--part of the town where they lived in order to get to town you'd have to go through some trees like kind of a wooded area and he said on Sundays white men used to sit by this tree with a gun and take practice shots at the young men walking by to see if they could hit anybody.  And he tells stories of going through that scenario where they'd have to run to try and get from these guys and the sheriff coming by in the afternoon and shoo these guys off but that they would take target practice on the kids in that area.  He tells a story that I thought was interesting.  When he was young all of his--as I mentioned earlier music was very big in his family.  So they had a brass band and all of his brothers and sisters played musical instruments as did his parents [Julia Dunson Evans and William Evans], and as did his aunts and uncles 'cause he mentioned they all--he played two instruments.  He played the trumpet and he played the piano.  He played the piano for a very long time and their entertainment really was playing in that band and since they couldn't go to the school, they got their education from Sunday school and their life really did seem to focus around the church.  But he said when he was fourteen his father got him a car and he talks about the fact that they had an Edison phonograph and so on and he--a lot of jealousy around.  He was the youngest of the kids but he had this car and he mentions a time that he took his mother to one of her club meetings.  She was very actively involved in clubs in the town.  He'd take her to the church meeting, the Sunbeam Club that's what he wrote in the book, the Sunbeam Club.  He'd taken her to church to the Sunbeam Club and was sitting outside in the car waiting for her to come out and three white men came up to him and said we need you to come with us. And he said back in those days if somebody told you that you had to go someplace you just went.  So he said let me go in and tell my mother.  So he went in the church and told his mother that he had to go with these men and she said no I have to go with you.  So she went with him and he said they went to a house.  They drove his car and went to a house and took him out of the car and had this young lady come out and ask her is this him and the young lady said no.  So they let him go and he went back home and he said when he got back to the church everybody in the church had been praying that he was going to come back safely.  So that evening I guess she told my grandfather what happened and my grandfather immediately went to town to find out what the situation was and came back and said that this young woman had been raped by someone and had she just said that yes it was him whether it was or not that would have been it they would have hung him on the spot.  So he said you just didn't have a life of your own.  The funny part was he goes on in his autobiography and talks about the fact that the kids all played with each other and he went to help one of the white farmers with their farm and the white farmer's son came over and helped his dad with his farm and there really was a close relationship between the families and he said--I can remember him saying even a lot of the white folks back in that day couldn't give a good explanation for why there was such an issue.  He, all of his life really felt as though if people got a chance to know each other on a one on one basis that race relation issues would be resolved instead of the stereotypes that we look at today. And going back from when he was young and had an opportunity to get to know people he never could understand and always told us you know it's just a matter of getting to know one and other.  You could do or be anything you want to be because we all have equal talents with God.  It's interesting because there is a part in his book where he says we read the same Bible, we believe the same things but we go to different churches and for some reason we can't seem to understand how we come together.  He always felt that we had more alike as a people than we have differences and always tried to live that way and tried to make sure we did--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well.
Story_ID: 331306
Speaker 1: You've spoken several times about your father's [Louie Evans] autobiography.
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Has that been published, will that be published?
Speaker 2: It will be when I get around to it.  But he wrote--my two children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith] are his only grandchildren and he wanted them to have an understanding of history, of background and of knowledge of what it was like in that era, what it was like in the [U.S.] Army and growing up and so he wrote an autobiography for them.  Actually I have it with a typist right now to have it inputted into a computer because he did it all manually.  And I do intend to publish it so that I can make sure that they've got that history and that others can see that history.  He says some very interesting things in it about the [U.S.] military as well.
Story_ID: 331307
Speaker 1: How did your mom [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] and dad [Louie Evans] meet?
Speaker 2: Her cousin--when he was based in California in a camp he met my mother's cousin and she introduced them.  She suggested to my dad that he meet my mom and he went, as a matter of fact that's in his book.  He got a plane and went to New Iberia [Louisiana] and he met Ms. Dumas and her family and they corresponded the entire time he was in the war, he was in World War II [WWII] in the [U.S.] military and he re-contacted her when he got out of the military and came back home.  He actually proposed in a letter from what I read--not the best way to do that I guess, but she accepted by mail (laughter).  So they met through a relative.
Story_ID: 331308
Speaker 1: To that union was born how many children?
Speaker 2: Three; myself, I'm the oldest and I have two sisters.
Speaker 1: Would you state the names of your sisters and tell us your birth order in relation to them?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm the oldest by four years actually, four or five years, my sister Joan Marie Evans. Do you want me to spell that for you?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay. J-O-A-N, Marie, M-A-R-I-E, Evans, E-V-A-N-S.  Joan was born in I think '53 [1953] or '52 [1952] and my youngest sister Michele I think was born in '61 [1961].  She's considerably younger than I am.  Michele Elaine Evans, M-I-C-H-E-L-E she was born [sic. named] after one of my grandfather's brothers, Michele; Elaine, E-L-A-I-N-E, Evans, E-V-A-N-S.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 331309
Speaker 1: Let's move to your early childhood. What--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --are your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memories of growing up really are living in Massillon [Ohio], I guess because I went to school I do have a lot of really early memories. Around two or three years old, my earliest memory is of praying actually.  I used to say my prayers at night in bed and I had a window over my bed that you could see a lot of stars out of, and I had this really nice--about this color--green satin quilt and I remember that.  I remember on Christmases my [paternal] grandfather [William Evans] coming to visit.  I remember that tub, taking my baths in that tub in front of the fireplace in the morning.  I remember my dad--my mom [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] getting me a doll and my dad [Louie Evans] giving me a gas station and some cars.  I remember that--I guess he wanted a boy. I remember school as a young child growing up; playing in the yard (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Story_ID: 331310
Speaker 1: Can you describe what a school day in the Evans household was like and also tell us what the holidays were like, please?
Speaker 2: School days. About the time when I first went to school-you know, my mom [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] was a homemaker so you know, she always spent time getting us ready.  Of course until I was five I didn't have any sisters, so it was just me and she would sometimes walk me to school or have somebody take me--pay somebody.  I think the school was about two or three miles away.  I walked; firm believer in exercise so I walked.  We--when I was in the third grade we moved--now I know I'm skipping, 'cause this was when my sisters [Joan Evans and Michele Evans] were not in school yet. But we integrated--my dad [Louie Evans] was a very strong civil rights activist, and so all of our life growing up, we spent integrating neighborhoods and schools and pools and if he would find out that blacks or Negroes were not allowed anywhere, there we'd go.  We'd get in the car or go somewhere.  He built a house in a part of town where we were not wanted, as a matter of fact, or there. Matter of fact, the land lot that he bought says that the land can't be--this is interesting the land can't be sold to Negroes or aliens.  He could not get a loan in the State of Ohio to buy that property.  He finally found a bank in New York State that would give him the money to build the house.  The builder that he found was a friend of his that he knew at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].  He suffered several death threats while that house was being constructed, as did my parents.  The night we moved in that house I vividly remember people--men screaming and yelling and driving up and down the street all night long threatening dad.  Dad had a Winchester rifle and he stood outside on that front porch all night holding that rifle, determined that he was going to move in and we were going to live in that house.  My mother who's very prejudiced, she's not--she'd just as soon stay in an entirely black community; if she could she would have back then, just supported him in the effort but would just have preferred to have no part of that.  But we did, we moved in and--.  So school--we integrated the school that we were in in terms of the grade school [St. Barbara's Catholic School, Massillon, Ohio].
Speaker 1: How did that work out?
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember any--I don't remember any instances of that being difficult.  At this point-you know my dad had always said you can do anything you want to do, you're just as good as anybody else.  I had been in schools with majority white students before. Even from the time I was three there was maybe only one other black child in the class with me [at St. Paul's Kindergarten, Massillon, Ohio] and that was a boy so there wasn't any girls.  I just did it; he said I need you to do this and so I'd say okay and I'd go.  I had friends, boys and girls and we got along very well in the community.  I don't know if it was because it was a Catholic school that it wasn't an issue but it was not a problem.  The high school was the same way, I did not go to high school in Massillon [Ohio], I went to high school in Canton [Ohio] 'cause he wanted us to go a girls school and a Catholic school.  There had been a few other students in the school before; Alan Page graduated from the high school I went to.  [HistoryMaker] Renee Powell who is a famous golfer who is black graduated from there.  There was one other person in my class, I ended up as class president and most likely to succeed; so I didn't--it was lonely.  I remember it being a very lonely existence because there was some things that--some social events and activities that I just did not get the opportunity to participate in and I wrote a lot.  As a matter of fact that's when I started writing and I read a lot.  I really was--as my mother says, a rather solitary person.  But I think you--because you have to get so much strength from inside there--very religious, very focused on my spiritual relationship with God because that really kept me going.  But I had a lot of friends, enjoyed myself.  But on the social side it was--you know they had to find somebody to take me to the prom.  They had to find some black kid in town who'd be willing.  I probably went through two or three before they finally found some poor sucker who would take me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not true.
Speaker 2: So, I did go to prom, they found me a date and I went to the prom. But--played in the band, enjoyed school.  At that point I was strong enough in who I was and my own self esteem that what I was on the outside wasn't really an issue for me.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Wasn't really an issue for me. Was very involved in school.  My mom drove a lot, bless her heart, she drove us back and forth to a whole lot of activities.
Speaker 1: Wonderful. So you had to commute to the school that was outside of Massillon and your mom (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Took the bus--Greyhound bus because it was literally in Canton which was--Canton must have been fifteen, twenty miles away I guess.  It was the next city.  My dad did not want us to go to high school in Massillon, he wanted us to go to Central Catholic [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] and so we did.  So she either drove us or we took the bus and after a while Central had a bus for students who came from Massillon to go to (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.
Story_ID: 331311
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block and the community you lived in?  What was your house number?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh it changed a couple of times.  It ended up being 123 26th Street.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It started out as 1425 Glenbrook Avenue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: When we first moved there it was out of the city limits.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And finally that part of Massillon [Ohio] was incorporated.  We had a fairly large house on a double lot they called it back then.  Most of the houses were on a single lot, but dad [Louie Evans] built a pretty sizeable house.  It was three bedrooms all on one level, ranch style and had the basement but that's where he had the electronic school, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: With the garage. So it probably was--interestingly enough it was probably the largest house in the neighborhood, still is the largest house in the neighborhood come to think of it.  There--in all these years there has only ever been one other black family that moved in that neighborhood and in that part of town still.  My dad when he passed in 1999 integrated that cemetery and he is the only minority in that cemetery.  So for--I don't know why no one followed him there but they didn't, and the other black neighbor I was going in college before anybody--any other minority moved into that neighborhood.  But it's a good neighborhood, and we have a lot of friends there grew up there.  I can remember trick or treating--I'm probably rambling on I know--but I can remember trick or treating going up to somebody's house and the woman opening the door and saying to her husband, "Oh the little black girls are here. You have to come and see how they're dressed, they look so cute (laughter)."  Everybody knew we were the only ones out there so there they are, so you just go yeah okay fine; yeah at that point you're used to it, so (laughter).
Story_ID: 331312
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights, sounds and smells that you experience nowadays that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells that remind me of growing up.  Popcorn. My mother [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] used to make caramel popcorn.  She's from Louisiana so whenever we have red beans and rice I always think about mom, 'cause that was--red beans and rice and shrimp.  She had--in the front yard she had irises growing and I love irises and whenever I see them today--irises and lilacs. So whenever I see flowers she had growing in our yard early on, that reminds me of home as well.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other memories of growing up that come to mind?
Speaker 2: Memories of growing up; snow, lots of snow. You know Ohio had lots of snow (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lots of snow in Ohio.
Speaker 2: We used to walk to school--
Story_ID: 331313
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: St. Barbara's--St. Barbara's Catholic School [Massillon, Ohio].
Speaker 1: What teachers are memorable to you?
Speaker 2: Oh well one in particular because we had one male teacher Mr. Staronary [ph.], he was the only male we ever saw because it was a lot of nuns.  In that day nuns were more plentiful than they are today; so Mr. Staronary, our principal Sister Mary Nicholas.  I used to work with the nuns on Saturdays at the convent, why I don't know.  I don't know to this day why I did that, but we use to help them clean the convent--because there was a convent on the campus and another friend of mine and I used to work with the nuns on Saturdays and help them clean.  I remember Girl Scouts; I was in the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] and Brownies and enjoyed that. We--every now and then I see, if I go back to Massillon [Ohio]--I don't go back anymore 'cause my mom [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] is not there anymore and my dad [Louie Evans] has passed away.  But you still see Bordner's grocery store.  My mother truly thought that every white person was prejudiced and I can remember--we'd go to the grocery store, my mother would come home, she would take the check register and she'd look at the groceries--that's when they had labels on them and she'd check off the grocery labels and she'd pull everything out.  If it was a penny off she would put all the groceries back in the bag and she'd put us in the car and she'd go back to the store and said that they cheated her because she was black.  Poor Mr. Bordner who was the grocery store owner--Bordner's is still there--he'd see her coming in the door and he'd go, "Hi Ms. Evans what's the matter?"  So I remember her doing all of our hair.  We all had long hair, I can remember being in the kitchen when she'd wash hair and have to--her hair was very straight so pressing hair was kind of foreign to her so she of course would experiment on me.  By the time she got to my two sisters [Joan Evans and Michele Evans] she was a pretty good pro at that.  Getting us ready for school and pressing hair and getting ready in the morning.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I always got A's and Bs.  I was an honor student in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] and in grade school and in college [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], so.
Story_ID: 331314
Speaker 1: What type of child were you, were you well mannered, mischievous, were you rambunctious or just a good student, good, mannerable student?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I was well mannered.  My mother [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] said that she could, matter of fact she told me once she said, "I could tell you to watch your sister if I had to go somewhere and not move and come home an hour later and you'd still be in that exact same spot watching your sister."  She used to complain that I read too much.  She said it was going to--she said that my head was going to explode 'cause I read too many books.  So we used to have reading clubs in the summer where if you read so many books, you know at the library you'd get little I think sections of the caterpillar and at the end of the summer you'd get free movie tickets if you read.  So I would just really enjoy reading.  I was kind of an introvert I think.  I had a lot of friends but I did read a lot and pretty well mannered.  My sisters [Joan Evans and Michele Evans] were--they took care of the rambunctious stuff for us.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you recall having dreams and aspirations even as an elementary school student [at St. Barbara's Catholic School, Massillon, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I do. In elementary school my dream was to get married, be a teacher and have two children. You know, I guess you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you got married, became a teacher--
Speaker 2: I got married, I had two children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith], I taught for one year. My son is a teacher. But yeah I always thought that was just going to be a good profession and yeah my mom was a teacher, her sisters were all teachers.  You know back then that was really the only profession that you saw black women in so to me that was a good profession.  When I graduated from college [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] though I truly wanted to go into the convent and I had every intention of going and becoming a nun and I had got all the paperwork and I brought it home and my mother absolutely had a fit.  My dad [Louie Evans] supported it; my mother said that is just not the life for a woman, absolutely not.  I was crushed; she refused to sign that paperwork and that really was those last two years of high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] my ambition.  I had wanted to dedicate everything I did to God and I really felt that the best way to do that would be to go into the convent.  I was very influenced by the nuns that I went to school with. And he supported that which was interesting 'cause he grew up Baptist and converted to a Catholic.  She absolutely said that that is--you are a woman and you need to grow up and have a family and I just won't hear of it.  So when I went to college, I started as a math and a Spanish major because science really were a very strong area for me and I switched majors a few times and ended up in English and speech communications, and then went on to graduate school [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] in student personnel, university administration as I got involved in things.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: That was probably, in terms of career and aspirations, that was the first real disappointment.  That's the first time she really actually said, no, you cannot do something.
Story_ID: 331315
Speaker 1: Obviously church and faith was important to you and the whole family and still is, apparently.
Speaker 2: Yes, still is.
Speaker 1: Are you happy you followed your mom's [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] urgings?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I have a wonderful husband [Stephen J. Smith] and two incredible children that we are very blessed to have that are going on to do--my son [Brian Smith] is a teacher and a fitness trainer and my daughter [Stacy Smith] is a psychologist, she's finishing up her Ph.D. And Brian interestingly enough is very interested in youth, works with children a lot and is getting ready to start a foundation.  He's very much like my dad [Louie Evans] in that regard.  He feels that it's his role to somehow help young black men to get on the right path and he works with that a lot.  So he enjoys teaching, loves teaching, they are both civil rights activists in their own way, which has been an interesting turn of events for them.  The community we live in does not have a lot of African Americans, and when they were growing up, in his high school I think there were maybe four or five in his class.  We put them in those schools 'cause they were very good schools but I can remember the principal calling me one day saying nothing's wrong but just wanted to let you know Brian has set up class in the cafeteria and teaches black history at lunchtime and I said, "Oh he does?"  "It's no problem; he's doing a great job." They now have a program in his school because of Brian but the trend seems to kind of follow along.
Speaker 1: Good.
Story_ID: 331316
Speaker 1: Where did you yourself attend junior high school and who were some of your friends back then?
Speaker 2: The school I went to went to the eighth grade, so it was--the elementary school [St. Barbara's Catholic School, Massillon, Ohio] was first through eighth and then high school was nine through twelve.
Speaker 1: All right. Any particular nuns or teachers to influence you more than others would you say?
Speaker 2: Sister Desale [ph.] did; and two of my very good friends did enter the convent.  Neither one of them is in the convent now which is interesting.  One of them lives here and they both left the convent and got married.  Sister Delores [ph.] did, Sister Delores is not alive still, Sister Desale is I believe.  I think they were influential in terms of that direction.  They were very supportive. Central Catholic [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] as I mentioned was--there were two of us in my class and when the national merit scholar information came out--and I don't know if it still exists or not--but there is a national achievement scholar program for minority students.  Any minority scholarship or program they could find or competition they would enter me in or get me the paperwork on.  So they really went out of their way to make sure that I had every opportunity anybody else had even if it meant they had to find that opportunity by itself.  So I was I think very blessed growing up, in terms of the support I had in the situation that I was in.  So it was a very supportive environment.
Speaker 1: Where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: Central Catholic High School in Canton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And any close friends that you recall that perhaps you're still in contact with today?
Speaker 2: You know not really.  One, Carol Massey [ph.] is one of the women that went in the convent but is back out.  I saw her not too long ago; she moved to Atlanta [Georgia]. But in terms of high school or grade school not really.  A lot of people stay in their hometown or hometown area and we moved a lot. This is our eighth residence in how ever long--thirty years we've been married, so--.  And I really was not very good at keeping up with--you know life keeps you busy and I didn't keep up with people too much.
Speaker 1: Yes. How did you spend your time in high school?  I think you've already told me you were pretty academic.
Speaker 2: Yeah I was academic, I was very involved. I was student body president in my junior year, vice president in my senior year.  I was in the band, I played piano and xylophone and vibraphone in the concert band and I played the bass drum in the marching band, much to my mother's [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] dismay.  I was a concert pianist but you had to--to be in the concert band you also had to play an instrument in the marching band and so percussion was the only thing that I could play, so I wound up playing the bass drum, and she just thought that was horrible (laughter), in the marching band.  I was in a lot of the organizations; I was in the Spanish club, sodality, which was a girl's religious society;  so I was very active.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I got involved in a lot of summer programs the school had, academic summer programs they had as well.
Story_ID: 331317
Speaker 1: Mrs. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith], you grew up during the Vietnam [Vietnam War] era and the civil rights era.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: How did that impact you as a young woman coming along especially considering that you're in a Catholic school setting?
Speaker 2: Yeah in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] it really didn't--and the big issue for me in high school, I think I was a sophomore when JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] died so that was an issue and because we were a Catholic family and it was a Catholic school it was very devastating.
Speaker 1: By the way do you remember where you were and what you were doing at that time?
Speaker 2: I do. I was in second period geometry class and one of the nuns came in to let everybody know and then they made an announcement on the PA once the classrooms had been informed individually and they shared with everybody and we stopped for prayer at that time.  That's one of those things if you were around then you know where and when you were at the time.  We were--I guess because the family was so involved in civil rights issues in the community and we were actively involved in integrating things and my dad [Louie Evans] founded the Urban League.  He and two other founded the Urban League in Massillon [Ohio] and were very involved in that.  I think it was a natural part of what we were doing.  So we grew up in that era but also participated in that.  When I got to college, that's when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, the Black Panther [Black Panther Party] movement was very big.  There were sixty-three of us, I think on a campus of about fifteen, twenty thousand students when I was at Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] in Ohio and we had those who were detractors from it.  We had a hippie movement and there was so much going on.  That was just an era that was rich in everything, and the civil rights activists--we had a black student union for the first time on campus there--
Story_ID: 331318
Speaker 1: We had a sorority and I was--when I got to college because of what we did growing up I really didn't have any peers except for one other girl that I knew in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio].  I didn't know black students my age until I got to college.  So my college experience was really my first experience with people like me except for my family.  So I was a bit odd I think to a lot of people; they thought I talked funny, I think that was an adjustment.  I joined a sorority then I'm a Delta I joined Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and one of the main reasons that I did was because I really felt it an opportunity to get to know other black women and to really start to work on--I felt very comfortable with what I was and who I was for myself but how that related to others was not an area where I had much strength and much skill and I really was kind of quiet.  I wasn't really socially adept at that kind of thing.  So the sorority for me really was an outlet and an opportunity to get to understand more about who I was as a black woman. And because Delta is very civil rights activist and social activism focused, for me that was the right organization because that's really where my bent was in terms of involvement.  I got very involved on campus, when I was there; I was involved in high school.  I was outstanding freshman woman; in the end I turned out to be outstanding senior woman.  The only person ever, I understand--'cause I was on the alumni board of trustees not too long ago--to ever hold both of those titles.  I won a debate competition in my freshman year and for some reason I saw an article in Mademoiselle magazine about a Mademoiselle magazine college board and so I applied for that, sent them some short stories I wrote and won that competition.  So from the time I got there I wound up getting very active.  The boyfriend I had on campus was a student body vice president and also a black male so he kind of got me involved in a lot of that activist things that were going on in campus as well.  So I wound up between the sorority and that getting involved very early on in campus activities.  I was student body vice president when I was a senior.  I was the first student on Bowling Green's [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] board of trustees.  They decided at that time with all of the unrest going on with students--'cause this was back in 1960 and '70 [1970] around when the Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] incident happened that they really wanted to find a way to get student involvement.  So we had a forward thinking leadership on the campus and so they did decide to put a student on the board of trustees and I got the opportunity to be that first student who was on the board of trustees there at Bowling Green.  So it was a good experience.  When I ran for office my opponent--I can remember having an opponent whose campaign slogan was "Don't vote for the nigger."  They tried to keep the flyers from me but it just--at that point after growing up you have to say that's his problem not mine so that was my attitude and approach on that.  He lost; I won and it worked out okay.
Speaker 2: Great. Wonderful. Were you at Kent State at the time of the death of--how many students was it? Several.
Speaker 1: Oh gosh I know one for sure, but it was several that got killed on that hill.  I was a senior (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you?
Speaker 1: --at Bowling Green at the time.
Speaker 2: I'm--
Story_ID: 331319
Speaker 1: You later went to Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], all right, I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Kent State to work as a dean two years later, as a matter of fact, I was a dean there.  What they did though at that time we had--my senior year, I lived above the draft board in town which turned out not to be the best place to live. But when the riots happened, Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio]--our university was the only school that did not shut down and did not riot but at that point our student body officers, myself and my fellow officers had a really good relationship with the administration and because we had a good relationship we were able to work out some discussions and issues that we had so that the school did not close.  We were able to set up a post to really talk through issues that were there.  Unfortunately though living above the draft board I can remember the draft board got riots outside of our doors a few times in town.  But we didn't close, the student body officers they spent some extra time working with us.  Everybody was afraid then that we were being wire tapped on our phones so you know that was an issue that they were doing that to all student leaders in the State of Ohio because of that incidence; but we got past it.  So we graduated--that was in May [1970] I'm pretty sure, I was a commencement speaker, we had commencement in June.
Story_ID: 331320
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a student you were commencement speaker?
Speaker 1: As a student I was--I can't remember how that happened but I wound up being the commencement speaker at Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] that year, the year of that riot and I think--I will never forget I don't know why the--Frank Sinatra was still around and he had that song,  'I Did it My Way' [sic. 'My Way'] I think that was the name of it and that was the theme of my speech. And as students--the intent was to talk about the fact that as students we were going to do it our way.  We were very much engaged then with all that was going on in Vietnam and so on and that was very important to us so that was the theme I used in the speech.
Speaker 2: Wonderful and clearly you had a very successful academic and otherwise time in high school [Central Catholic High School, Canton, Ohio] as well as college to include being the commencement speaker.  How did that bode well for bringing other black students into each of those settings, both high school as well as Bowling Green?
Speaker 1: I'm hoping that it really led the way.  Bowling Green has more black students now obviously than it did then.  I was on the alumni board of trustees for four years.  Not too long ago; I think my term was up a couple of years ago. And there's been a decent amount of growth.  We've had homecoming queens and so on since then and Bowling Green now has a black president [Sidney A. Ribeau] as a matter of fact who is very successful there and had a black vice president when I was there and a great diversity of students.  I still recommend that school highly.  I got an excellent education, good experience there and the school does very well but I think--I'm hoping that it paved the way and that others were willing to go ahead and run for office and do other things and that did happen after that.  Central State--Central Catholic High School still does not have a lot of black students.  It is a private school so it has cost associated with it so I think that has something to do with it.  And for the kids in my hometown [Massillon, Ohio] it is a matter of traveling there.  The high school in my hometown is a very famous high school.  Massillon is a football town and for years Massillon Tigers were football champs all over the country and when I was growing up they were. They won a national championships and state championships every year.  As a matter of fact they never built another high school in Massillon because they wanted to keep all that talent right there.  Their football stadium looks like a major stadium for a national football team.  So it was a very--it was a school that was very popular so everybody wanted to go to Massillon High School [Washington High School, Massillon, Ohio]; except my dad [Louie Evans] wanted his girls to go to an all-girls school.  So I think the opportunity and desire for minorities and blacks at that point not to go to Massillon that was well known and to go to a Catholic girls school with nuns wasn't necessarily a--when there wasn't a lot of black Catholics in town, not something that was real appealing to a lot of people.

Speaker 1: At what point did you decide that you were going to major in something that relates to what you're doing now?
Speaker 2: Well okay-I'm trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what did you major in?
Speaker 2: I majored in speech communications.  Started out in math and, and Spanish (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right. And what was the carry over after college, any carry over?
Speaker 2: After I graduated from college [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], I went to graduate school [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] and I went to graduate school in university administration and from there I was a college dean for eight years.  So the university administration obviously played into that.  You know I try to relate--what I do now, I think I have to relate every experience that I had to the consulting field that I'm in now because I consult with non-profits and for-profits and churches and because of the variety in my background; because--I was a retail buyer first, which is where I met my husband [Stephen J. Smith] and then I was a teacher and then I went to university administration when I finished my master's [degree] and did that there and here in Georgia, and then went to a corporate environment and from a corporate environment I became executive director for Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], so I ran a nonprofit; went back to the corporate environment. And after so many people told me--and what I did in each of the organizations I went to, I would wind up either creating a new piece of the organization that didn't exist before or doing some organizational redesign to change something to make it run better.  But in each of the positions I was in, because it was a creative and developmental area, it finally led to doing that for a living for all the types of environments that I had been in previously.  I like change obviously and like to do a diversity of things so I've been lucky enough to be able to use the talents and skills I got along the way to do that.
Speaker 1: Very well, thank you.
Story_ID: 331322
Speaker 1: Is there anything else in terms of your preparation for your career?  I want to get into your career and talk about what you're doing.  I think you've articulated very clearly that everything has been a building block for where you are right now.
Speaker 2: It has been.
Speaker 1: Tell us about what you're doing right now and a little bit more about that and your enthusiasm for doing it.
Speaker 2: Okay. And I do get enthusiastic about it. I think the thing I like about consulting is the variety and the variety of clients and operations that I deal with.  Right now interestingly enough and this is almost coming full circle; one of the main clients that I work with now are churches. And in trying to do church surveys for memberships and to work with churches in determining how best to meet the purposes that the church has and take a look at what the congregation feels needs to happen for the leadership in the church as well as for the pastoring for the church family.  I do a strategic plan and I've done a great many of those lately for non-profits and for--I do retreats for leadership teams to help them get focused on the true direction that they want to go in.  If in fact they have made a decision that they want to either change direction or they want to pin point where they're going over the next period of time.  One of things that I do and spend a lot of time on is helping leadership teams and helping organizations kind of crystallize what their vision is for the future and then work with them on figuring out what steps they need to take to get there over the next five or ten years.  The other piece of my practice really is operations audits.  I will go into an organization and take a look at it and determine if there is a facet of it that they want to run smoother or they want to take a look and determine what they can do about getting employees excited about what they do so that they're motivated to do it greater.  I'll go in an organization and I will audit an operation, I'll do focus groups, I'll talk to people.  People usually know what the issue is.  I'll spend some time with the executives but I mainly start with the people who are working on the job every day and work with them to determine what issues there are and come up with a summary climate assessment if you will, for them to assess the environment that they're in and tell organizations, whether they be for profit or not, how they can make that organization run smoother.  I build appraisal systems for companies that are based on their goals to try and get employees more tied into and feel more part of the organization that they're in and I write--. That's the other piece of what I do.  I write articles and my real love, it really is writing. And really at some point want to take all the things that I've done and the things I've learned and lessons I've learned and spend some time writing about that.
Speaker 1: Are you working on a book or do you write for local publications?
Speaker 2: I've written a few articles in conjunction with a guy who works at Black Enterprise but I have a decent amount of unwritten work downstairs that I am working on a book that I'm trying to get together.
Speaker 1: Part of the Dumas legacy, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
Story_ID: 331323
Speaker 1: Immediately after college you indicated you taught for a short time.
Speaker 2: I did, well the first thing I did was, I was in retail buying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which I did for long enough to meet my husband [Stephen J. Smith] and left shortly after that (laughter).  I found that wasn't my profession.  The hours in retailing are tough and I had taken the job and honestly what happened; the vice president at the university that I graduated from Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] realized that I wasn't going to go to graduate school because I didn't have enough money to go and had taken a job in retailing.  He wrote me a letter which I'd absolutely forgotten about and I found this morning and was reading where he said if you decide you want to go to school, the president of the board of trustees will fund it for you.  We can find people in Bowling Green who can fund that, you really need to go to school and because you worked so much in the university administration and I think that's where you ought to go and you ought to go ahead and get your degree in that.  So they did, I went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and started my master's [degree] in university administration.  I had--as I mentioned, I met my husband in retailing and he proposed six weeks after we met.  We didn't really know each other all that well so I said I'll tell you what let me get through my first year of graduate school and if we're still seeing each other we'll get married after that and we did.  We got married that summer. I transferred to Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] and while finishing my master's in university administration, I worked as an assistant dean for financial aid then and I stayed in university administration until we had our first child and moved here [Georgia] and worked as an associate dean for student life at Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So I worked in university administration for about seven or eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay and those years covered 19--.
Speaker 2: Those years covered 1971--I taught for a year; oh that's what--okay I forgot about that--I taught for one year when I was working on my master's. Trying to get into school, I taught high school for a year.  The debate coach, directed the student musical and to this day I cannot watch 'The Sound of Music' all the way through (laughter).  I have visions of practicing with little kids that sang 'Do Re Mi' all night 'cause I was a drama major so I taught English and did that for a year and then started at Kent State and was there from '70 [1970] and we moved here. I didn't work for a couple of years when I had my first child and I stayed at Georgia State, I think until about '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 331324
Speaker 1: One of my students was the director of human resources at Southern Bell [Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company; AT&T Inc.], and when I went to Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] they did not have a student activities department, so when I went there, I started that department and formulated that particular area.  This man had seen me do that and had said you know we really could use your skills at Southern Bell; it was Southern Bell at that time.  We're having a problem with our systems technicians.  Ratings always go down, complaints always come on a full moon by the way, it happens, complaints always go higher.  But we're having a fundamental problem with customers and we don't exactly know what the issue is; and you seem to have a knack of being able to take a problem and resolve it.  Would you consider coming there?  They offered me a lot more money than I was making and so I left and went to Southern Bell.  When I got to Southern Bell I created a program--I worked for the vice president there--called project update and what we found was that where systems technicians for business customers would go on their premise, they would sometimes go directly to the box, fix the telephone stuff and leave.  In terms of customer interaction, they didn't know how to do that.  Very good technically but didn't--weren't really versed in that. And so I spent a lot of time driving in trucks around Georgia with systems techs meeting with customers to see if I couldn't figure out what the issues were.  I created a program for Southern Bell called project update; project update was a training class.  We took the--for business customers, we took their tools off of a belt and put them in a fitted brief case.  We gave them some training on customers' interaction.  We gave them some background information and some more history of the company.  It was basically an orientation program and worked to really focus on improving the skills, the appearance, the presence of a systems tech who worked on business customers.  We had a trial program that worked pretty well.  We then--the company decided that they wanted to take it statewide.  So they sent me, a little black female, to work with all of these white guys 'cause there wasn't anybody else at that time, so they sent me down to South Georgia to train and to try and introduce this.  So I'll never forget--Eddie Loveless one of my best staff managers, Eddie went down with me and we went to the union hall and talked to the union to try to get the union to go along with this.  Everyone was very cordial and I thought it went really well.  It wasn't until years later that Eddie told me he said remember when you had to go to South Georgia and went to all those union halls and they took you in and things were--I said yeah. He said well we use to call ahead of time and say look I know we're bringing a black female down here, but she's with the vice president, this is a program they want to introduce, I'm going to be packing and I need you to receive her well so she thinks you're supporting her.  So he told me that years later that they really didn't want to go on this program that well, but because they really made them understand this is something we want to do as a company.  To make a very long story short, that program went nationwide with AT&T [AT&T Inc.].  All of the AT&T operations adopted it and we developed something that really changed the system for the way business technicians interacted with business customers all over the United States.  So I did that there and moved on to another operation and company and did the same kind of thing.  So I had a very successful career with them.  I ended up as a district manager there; was with AT&T--Southern Bell and was with AT&T for eighteen years and introduced new appraisal systems to them, introduced a lot of new programs and innovations, managed technical services there and ended up doing some HR [human resources] work for them.  So I got a real strong background in introducing new programs--looking at environments, trying to figure out what would work, introducing new programs there and moving up, so--.
Speaker 2: And the last year of your involvement with that company was?
Speaker 1: Oh, 19- 1996.
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-six [1996].

Speaker 1: I took a hiatus in 1988.  On a dare, a friend of mine--Delta Sigma Theta's [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] executive director position was open. And I was at a chapter meeting and on a dare a friend of mine dared to me apply for the job.  I said you know, come on--so I did.  Got the job, took the job and went to Washington [D.C.] for two years.  AT&T [BellSouth Corporation; AT&T Inc.] did not want me to leave at that point and couldn't understand why I would ever go to a black sorority.  You know, executives really didn't--that didn't make any sense to executives in a white company.  But I really thought that it would be a good opportunity and I had a lot of support from my husband [Stephen J. Smith] and we went.  I did that for two years and really realized that the job was way too much travel and my children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith] were little.  It was a lot of pressure and when I left AT&T they did not want me to leave so they gave me a two year loan.  So I went on executive loan and when they called and said, "Your two years is almost up, you want to come back, we've got a job for you," and I said, "yes, sure."  And they bought our house there and moved us back and wound up moving back to an assignment here in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Story_ID: 331326
Speaker 1: And then from '90 [1990] to '96 [1996] I stayed with AT&T [BellSouth Corporation; AT&T Inc.], and when they got ready to change again and I really didn't think that the company was headed in the direction that made sense for it to go--before they had the big offers unfortunately; I decided to join Stephen [Stephen J. Smith].  Stephen, my husband had his own business at that point. When we moved back here [Georgia] in '90 [1990] after we were in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], he started a temporary employment agency and I joined him in '96 [1996] and formed the consulting division of that company [The HR Group, Inc., Marietta, Georgia] and have been doing that. We just finished our fifteenth year.
Story_ID: 331327
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you--about your accomplishments in Corporate America before starting--before getting involved with your husband [Stephen J. Smith] and your business?
Speaker 2: Stilted by sex and race. I think I had gotten to district manager with that company [BellSouth Corporation; AT&T Inc.], but I still think that there's a glass ceiling; at least there was at the time. And I think I reached a point where no matter what I did I was only going to be able to go so far there.  I really made a very rapid rise when I went there with the programs that we implemented that went nationwide and then kind of reached a plateau.  There were very few black female district managers back in the '90s [1990s] when I did become a district manager but I think I also realized that unless I was willing to move to New Jersey, opportunities were also going to be slimmer.  And it's a real change, corporate tide. So I see things--and I think it's a little bit different now.  I think black women have made a whole lot more progress in terms of moving up in companies than they did--you know '96 [1996] isn't really that long ago--than they did ten years ago.  But if I was going to be successful and try and figure out what defining success is, but really making a difference for individuals; and I think that's about the point I was at. Was taking the things I had learned and sharing them or using them to make a difference only because I think that's the way my father [Louie Evans] raised us [Smith and her sisters, Joan Evans and Michele Evans] to make a difference someplace.  I think I realized at that point I was not going to be able to make that difference in Corporate America at that point in time.  The environment just wasn't such that that was going to allow that to happen. And frustration and running into a few bad apples and running into some brick walls and glass ceilings really forced me to really take a strong look at whether or not I was going to be able to do the things that I felt I needed to do or could do in that environment. So I left.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that you have not yet done in your present business that you really would like to get involved in?  I need a short answer and we'll finish it on the next tape.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes I think so but I'm not exactly sure what it is.  I had a friend tell me the other day that because I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to do when I grow up, that I want to do something else in my business, I've done the same thing for a while now and I really would like to do something different.  And we went to lunch last week and her recommendation was--she said you really ought to market the mentoring that you do.  You have a background that you've been in the corporate environment, you've been in the nonprofit environment, you've been on non-profit boards where I'm still very active in the community and what I do, but there are not a lot of black women in particular who have the training or comfort level to move up or to participate in boards and to do those things.  And you really ought to look at that as part of your practice as a next phase of what you do.  Write about it for one, she suggested and as a part of your business really look at offering mentoring services to black women who are in corporations today and who want to get involved more in the community today.  So that's a piece I'm just now starting to look at.
Story_ID: 331329
Speaker 1: Mrs. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith]?
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: Is there anything you have done already that you would have liked to have done differently in your career?
Speaker 2: Is there anything I would've--you know I might have--I think the experience with Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] I might have looked at staying longer.  For me considering my background that was the first time I ever worked in a black environment--an African American environment with African American women and I think in the nonprofit environment so I come out of corporate working with all white men and a background that really didn't allow me to have a lot of historical perspective on being African American and I think that got in the way of my adjusting to that experience.  So I might have tried to look and stay in that experience longer but to honest with you had I done that I probably would never have taken the path of going off and starting a business on our own.  I really had never intended to go into consulting.  I was a corporate person, I was going to stay in corporate forever and honest to goodness it was lot of prayer before I really step out there.  But I had my first client before I even left the company so at least I had some comfort level with doing that and because we don't really advertise that much.  All of our business is word of mouth so I think I would have--I don't know I would have looked at that.  Career wise with AT&T [Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company; AT&T Inc.] I think I had a good run, I think I had some good mentors there that led me along the way in terms of what I was doing.  I don't know that I would have done that differently.  I would love someday to go back to the university environment.  I liked working with college students, I think probably now as an elder if you will, I have a lot more to offer to college students in terms of experience and time so at some point I think that's something I'd like to do.
Story_ID: 331330
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I have a concern for black males.  I look at the ratio of our females to males.  We [Smith and her husband, Stephen J. Smith] were very blessed with our children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith] that they both stayed on a very good path.  That they were both self directed in terms of--my son more than my daughter.  She was eventually, but in terms of what he wanted to do and his goal to really do something for other blacks.  But I have a concern that--I'm trying to figure out how to word this.  It's tough to have an appreciation for what people had to go through to get us to the point we are and I understand these days that black youth have a whole lot of issues than they had.  There is not a singular cause that they are fighting for.  They are really more individualized in terms of their fight and the self esteem.  I think self esteem is my biggest concern.  I see especially for our black men that they don't have as many of the role models as they need to have to support them.  I feel very strongly about the fact that it's tough to imagine yourself being something that you can never see for most people.  For people, for others it doesn't matter.  You can envision something and if you envision it then fine but for an awful lot of children especially and for teenagers they need to see a model of what they can do so that they can focus on that and my concern is that they might not see the models as much as they want to.  I'm not sure that our generation pays as much attention to them as we should in terms of giving them role models for them to see.  I think the music and the images of today for African Americans is tough for our young people in terms of what they see and what's popular and what's important and I do think being the old fashion person I am that that's detrimental to them.  I don't think parents regardless of race are able to be as strict as they need to be.  I don't know that they spend as much time with their children as would be good for them to spend because of our lifestyles that we have today and I think there's much more of a negative impact on that than we realize.  I think of my kids and how much time they talk about the things we did when they were young and the time we spent together and I think of their other friends who spent that time with us who weren't with their own parents and the impact that that might have.  Do I have a concern for--I know I'm beating around the bush 'cause I'm trying to come up with a real good answer for it.  Do I have concerns?  I have concerns; I have concerns that we may lose our identity as we mix with each other and as we spend time with each other.  I think it's important to be proud of your heritage so that you know truly who you are.  I think the richness of the African American race, the stamina it took to get where we are, the courage that it took and the self esteem that it took.  This past generation to get to this point isn't as strongly engrained in this next generation but it's a different generation and they see and do things differently and there are an awful lot of our young black people today who are doing an incredible, outstanding, phenomenal job and doing things we couldn't do.  My daughter got married recently.  The caterer, the graphic artists, everybody we used in her wedding was thirty or under and they did the most incredible job.  The creativity and the talents that those kids had are just wonderful.  I just hope they are supported in what they're doing.  That banks will give them the money they need, that lending institutions and people who could support them as venture capitalist will see that talent there and support them in what they're doing so that they can continue to be as strong as they are 'cause they are incredibly strong and talented.  I just don't know that they have the support they need.  That's a real long drawn out answer for--
Speaker 1: It's a good answer.
Story_ID: 331331
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: My thoughts on the Civil Rights Movement.  The first thing that comes to my mind is to say that it's not over.  It's different and then my mind goes to a concern I have for the values that we have in the United States and our desire to impose it on other cultures and other countries.  I think we have to have the same kind of respect that we expect others to have for the way we do things, for the way others do things.  So I think civil rights are still an issue, I just think it's a broader issue than it was.  If we get so homogenized that the richness of different cultures is taken away then I think we have lost something that we had as a world and it's now a world civil rights culture that we're dealing with not a United States culture anymore.  The kids fight today is not the same fight that it was before.  I think they still have a fight because I think people see differences and still hold differences against each other.  I don't think we'll ever get past that.  I think that's a part of being human which is part of being something that's flawed and that all we can do is to continue to fight for respect because I think that's what civil rights really is.  Respect for each other and respect for someone's position and allowing them to express themselves or to go to places so that we have equal access to whatever is out there.  So civil rights concerns and issues are still there, they are always going to be there, we're always unfortunately going to hold our differences against each other.   The best we can do is to educate and bring out the best in each other as individuals I think.
Speaker 1: Your thoughts about education?
Speaker 2: Extremely important, extremely important.  I don't think education is one dimensional though.  It used to be that if you got educated you had to go to college; you know everybody wants you to go to college.  I think education takes different forms and it's different for individuals whose talents are different.  I get concerned that we force young people into college when they aren't meant for college but they're meant to use their skills and talents in art school, in culinary school, in a technical institution.  I think that education is important and there is such variety of education, I think the danger is that we continue to still look at education as one dimensional when it's not.  If people get the opportunity younger and they do younger these days to determine what their skills and talents are and then can take those skills and talents and really honed them somewhere where education is right for the individual then I think we have a very, very strong society.  We just can't push it all one way but you can't do without it, it's a key.
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts Ms. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverley E. Smith] about affirmative action?
Speaker 2: This one is tricky for me, affirmative action.  I don't believe in quotas, I do believe in opportunity.  I realize that sometimes you have to have a quota to get to an opportunity.  I think that's the sad part about it.  If you don't make a way to put people in a position so that they can in fact prove themselves and move up.  The issue with affirmative action is I do not believe in putting a person in a position to meet a quota if they're not qualified for that position.  I think you do them more harm than good because what you wind up doing is putting someone and let's say it's a female or an African American you've got a quota, you've got to get one there or several there and you take people and you put them in that position and they don't have the skills or talents for it and they fail.  You've have set them up for failure.  So I think affirmative action is sometimes a necessity in order to open up opportunity but how you manage it and when you manage it is really important.  I think we can do--do I think we can do it without it, do we have enough education and background that we should be able to put people in positions, yes.  Unfortunately we're still in the situation where you have some segments that won't give anyone an opportunity to show what they can do unless you find a way to make that opportunity there for them by forcing the issue, so it's a double edged sword I think that one.

Speaker 1: You have thoughts about the role of religion in the African American community?
Speaker 2: It's a very strong role.  I think--you know as I mentioned with my dad [Louie Evans] he would not have any education if it weren't for the church.  That's where he got his--that's where learned to read, that's where he got his skills because the church took it in.  As someone said and I can't remember--the most segregated place in the world is the church.  The church that we belonged to now--we've been members there for maybe ten years--is the first black church I've ever been to and it is a different experience but it's a very comfortable experience.  I'm not going to say it's not, I enjoy it.  My children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith] both go to black churches.  They did not grow up in a black church; they grew up as Episcopalians and where there might have been a few other minorities in the church; they liked the music, they liked the comradeship, they liked being with other African Americans for that experience, so I think it's still a strong part of us.  You know, it will probably continue to be a segregated part of us.  I think that's where people at home. But we still rely as a people on ministers and pastors as leaders, not only in church but politically as well, and I don't know that that traditionally will end.  So there's a lot of strength there.  Your concern has to be--at least my concern has to be those leaders like any race who tend to abuse that ability and use that power for themselves rather than for people.  But we are a spiritual people, I think that's in our makeup and I think that will always be that way.

Speaker 1: When you look back on your life what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: My family I think, my husband [Stephen J. Smith] and my children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith].  If--I think like any parent, if you're going to leave a legacy that legacy is going to be your children and their children and so on and you hope you spend time raising them well so that they can be a contributor also.  So I think if anything stands out as important to me-- there's a lot of awards and all that--and they are all in boxes downstairs somewhere and I know there's a bunch of them, I know they are in boxes, I don't really have them out.  I really look at my value, my contribution as what I'm able to do to make someone else better what I can give to the other person that can help them grow and what my children hopefully--what we've done with them so that they can continue on with that as well.
Speaker 1: What are one or two of the more important values to you and why?
Speaker 2: Important values--integrity is extremely important to me.  As a consultant that's all I have, all I have is my integrity and my culpability.  Also it's funny; when I was manager at AT&T [BellSouth Corporation; AT&T Inc.], I used to--I think it's real important for your employees to know you not necessarily personally 'cause that gets in the way sometimes in a work relationship; but I think they need to understand the person that they're working for and what they value.  So I always tell them I have three hot buttons that are really important and you've just got to be careful and not press and one of those is taking credit for somebody else's work.  I absolutely--I feel very strongly about that and I think because it happened to me sometime in my career that it's important that there is some integrity in terms of what you do and how you do it.  So integrity I value as real important.  What other values do I--I mean that's really--I think other things come from that.  I value faith, I think having a strong spiritual foundation is important and having religious faith and belief in God to me and having that kind of system is real important because I think in the bad times and bad times do come you can't do with them you need them that's kind of what keeps you going in those times.  So having that stamina and something to hold on to. Because in the end no matter how many loved ones you have and how many people you have around you, we are in fact each and every one of us, by ourselves. And at some point when things get tough or when things are good, you in the end still have to live with yourself and there's got to be something inside that keeps you going when nothing else around you can.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered, Mrs. Smith [HistoryMaker Beverly E. Smith]?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: What do I want people to say about me?  That I gave something that helped that person in their own life.  That I was able to offer myself and provide something that helped someone else.  That I could, in fact serve as--I have a mission statement for myself and I keep it downstairs and a part of it says that I served as a light bulb for someone to be able to see what in them made them shine.  I think as I've worked in my career and worked with young people and even executives, if I'm able to offer something to you that allows you to see yourself stronger or better or given you something that has allowed you to learn something or grow, then I think I've--if I can do that and if I can be said to have been a lightbulb for people that helped them to see, something in them that allows them to shine then I'd be happy.  I want to be a good mother too but I'd be happy with that--
Story_ID: 331335
Speaker 1: What message or lesson do you have for your children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith], your grandchildren and the world?
Speaker 2: You know I think I would--I think it's the same message that my parents [Willa Mae Dumas Evans and Louie Evans] gave me; you can do anything that you want to do.  You can be whatever you want to be that belief in yourself is extremely important that self esteem will carry you through whatever happens.  Not everybody is going to like you, somebody is just going to downright hate you for something you may have not even done but if you can at the end of the day feel good about who you are and what you are then I think that's--you can do what you want to do.  There is nothing material around that can really stop someone if in fact they have a goal and a vision in mine.  As long as they feel they can achieve it they can find a way to do that and I think you just have to keep trying.  It might not turn out exactly.  You might not get there and the path that you thought you were going to take--this is not the path that I thought I was going to take in terms of what I'm doing.  That little teacher with the two kids who just did that and retired was really where I had intended to be and there are days when I really get tired of the things that I do especially when I was in a corporate life the time that took and the effort it took is a lot.  But at the end of the day I don't think I've done what I want to do yet and hoping I still have some time left to do that.  I don't know exactly what that is, I'm in the--what is it they say, the late fifties, sixties is the new--hopefully it's the new thirties; it's probably the new forties, but anyway--.  I think there is another life left in me and I'm not exactly sure what that is and--but whatever it is I'm pretty comfortable that I will be able to pull that off.
Story_ID: 331336
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Oh, mainly because you'll make the same mistakes over again if you don't know history or learn from history--not that ever seems to do anybody any good, I don't know if anybody pays attention; but history is valuable for a lot of reasons.  Knowing your own personal history obviously helps you to understand who you are and what you've made of and where you come from. If for nothing else but for health reasons if forever asking family history on health information so it's important from that perspective so that you know how to live to not to make those same mistakes.  From a perspective of history in general, I think an individual and countries learn from history--not that they pay attention as I said so that they don't make the mistakes again.  I think history gives you roots, history is education and without a history and a past it is really tough to make a future.  So I think it's important from that perspective; it's a learning process, it's part of learning.
Story_ID: 331337
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know at the end of the day, for me, I think that my legacy really lies in my children [Brian Smith and Stacy Smith] and what they're able to accomplish and pass on and teach.  I think for a mother that's always the case.  Your legacy is your children and the future.  I haven't stayed any place long enough.  I moved from job to job and from life to life in terms of what I do and I sometimes feel I haven't stayed any place long enough to leave a legacy in any one place and because of that I think that's why I focus on the one thing that's been stable through my adult life really is my family.  So I can only leave a long standing legacy through them.  I've done--I've left a lot of programs in companies, created some things that some companies are still doing, it's always good to see a client who says the process you taught us or the appraisal system you had or the way we do this we're still doing it and it's ten years later; that's always worthwhile. But you know that's liable to change when a company changes.  So legacy-wise I do think for me it really is life lessons I hope in my history that my children can learn from and pass on.
Story_ID: 331338
Speaker 1: You've mentioned your children several times. I don't think we've called their names. Let's back up just a second and tell us again how you and your husband met and about the children, anything you'd like to say.
Speaker 2: My husband [Stephen J. Smith] and I met in 19- actually in 1969 I think.  I was a summer intern in a retail store on a summer program from Bowling Green [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio] in Dayton, Ohio and he was also on an internship program.  I was engaged to somebody else at the time but we met.  I remember him giving me his card and saying call me sometime and I said and went on back to school.  After I graduated the school offered me a job, I had decided that relationship wasn't really what I wanted and we met in the department store, in Rike's [Rike-Kumler Company] department store in Dayton where we worked.  That of course doesn't exist anymore.  As I said he proposed about six weeks after we met and started dating.  I went to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] for school and that was thirty-five years ago this year, we've been married thirty-five years this year.  My children are Brian [Brian Smith] and Stacy [Stacy Smith].  Brian is thirty and Stacy is twenty-eight.  Brian is a teacher he teaches high school and middle school and he's a football coach.  He was a football player and an all star in high school so he was pretty well athletic; but has always been a bit of a rebel when it comes to civil rights.  I really don't know how that happened, I don't know if it's the environment that they grew up in.  We've always lived in this environment, then we moved to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  When we moved to D.C. we moved in area that was extremely diverse.  We had some ambassadors who lived there, he went to a school that was I think 50/50 for the first time and he really got caught up and excited about being a black male.  We were there for two years and moved back here [Georgia] and we thought we were doing the right thing by putting back in the school that they'd left, so they'd be with their same friends but he never was really happy because the socialization with black children that he had he didn't have any more.  So he started creating his own circle.  One unfortunate teacher--the year we moved back they were having an English class and they were studying authors in the 1800s and Brian asked the teacher of a black author in the 1800s that he didn't see in the book, a black author of the 1800s.  This poor teacher said that there weren't any.  Okay so Brian unbeknownst to us decided to do some research on it so he did some research and I never thought anymore about it.  He mentioned that to us but he never said anything about it.  That fall when school started he was going to be a junior I think, we went to the open house and one of the English teachers came up to us and said, "Please let Brian know that the teachers have read the reading list he gave them."  I said, "What reading list?"  Brian had prepared a reading list for all the teachers and gave them all a homework assignment (laughter) to school the English department, all these black authors that he thought that they should get to know.  So this is the first inkling we knew that something was a little different here and then they told us he started teaching black history in the library.  So he was making his own way even then but he did become a teacher and teaches history and the football coach and he's also a fitness trainer for athletes and is getting ready to start his nonprofit firm for minority youths.  He's very focused on children and got married about three years ago.  He is married to a young lady who is in the media, Rashan Ali, she's on the radio in the morning and she does some film an actress and they're doing very well.  Stacy, my daughter is working on her Ph.D. She's in almost the last year of her Ph.D. in psychology.  She got married this past summer, she's married to a med student so they are poor but someday they'll be okay and she unfortunately has also marched on the steps of the capitol.  So they kind of are very independent, very strong thinkers and have very strong beliefs in what they believe in.
Speaker 1: Sounds like your ancestors left a wonderful legacy behind and sounds as if you have already left your legacy.  We certainly wish you a continued successful life.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: But it sounds like the future is in good hands.
Speaker 2: Thanks, I hope so.
Speaker 1: Thank you for being so gracious, thank you for the life you have lived and thank you for being one of our HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're very welcome.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: God bless you.

Speaker 1: This is my [maternal] grandfather, Preston Dumas.  He is at home.  This was taken in the summertime when were down visiting.  This was probably back in the 1950s back in Lafayette, Louisiana.  This is my Grandmother Dumas [Edna Hiem Dumas], my mom's mother back in, I think she's actually visiting in California.  She was visiting my cousin and that's my cousin that she's holding in that picture.
Speaker 2: This was back in the 1960s, this was in about 1961.  This is my sister and I, my sister Joan [Joan Evans] and myself. Gosh I was probably--Joan had to be about two years old then; that would make me probably seven years old.
Speaker 1: This is Massillon [Ohio] and the house where we originally lived at 22 Rossen Avenue [ph.] in Massillon.
Speaker 2: This is my first baby picture; I suppose I was probably just a few months old.  I am sure my father [Louie Evans]--one of my father's friends took this picture but that's when I was a baby back in Massillon where I was born back in 1948.
Speaker 1: This is my husband and I.  This is during our first year of marriage and our very first apartment.  We had no furniture and that pillow we're laying on is our couch.  We were on the floor.  My husband Stephen [Stephen J. Smith] and I back in 1970, 1971 timeframe, 1971 I think.
Speaker 2: This is my high school graduation in 1966.  I had just graduated from Central Catholic High School [Canton, Ohio].  This is our living room in our home and my dad took this right before the graduation ceremony.
Speaker 1: This is my mother and her sisters.  Her sisters Joan [Joan Dumas], Matil [ph.] and Vervon [ph.], my mother is in the striped shirt with a necklace on, smiling at the camera.  This was taken in 19--when my uncle died; so this was probably taken around 1990, '91 [1991] timeframe.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and she's in the black and white light colored outfit and her sister Joan.  They're holding a picture of their grandfather John Dumas and this picture was taken at the Dumas Park in Houma, Louisiana.  A park named after him and it's a recreation center for African Americans and a swimming area for African Americans that was first opened up back in the, I want to say 1960s.
Speaker 1: This is my daughter Stacy [Stacy Smith] and I on the day she graduated from high school.  This was in 1996; Stacy graduated and went on to Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and is now finishing up her dissertation in psychology.
Speaker 2: This is my fortieth birthday.  My staff at AT&T [AT&T Inc.] decided to surprise me in my office with an office full of blue AT&T balloons and black balloons celebrating the day; so this was in April 1998.
Speaker 1: This is my sisters and I.  This was--I'm obviously the oldest in the family so I'm on the end.  My sister Michele [Michele Evans] who is the youngest is in the middle and my sister Joan.  This is when we moved to our home on 123 26 Street [26th Street].  This is after--this is the house where my dad integrated the neighborhood so this is back in the early--late 1950s. I'm not exactly sure of the date maybe around '60 [1960] or '58 [1958], '59 [1959] time frame.
Speaker 2: This is my graduation from kindergarten in--I was four years old.  My mother sent me to school early.  I'm in the first row there; can't miss me.  So this would have been in 1952 I believe graduating from St. Paul's Kindergarten [Massillon, Ohio].
Speaker 1: This is the day I made my first communion.  We were at St. Barbara's [St. Barbara's Catholic School, Massillon, Ohio]; I was probably in the fourth grade I think around that time at St. Barbara's elementary school so I was probably about ten years old then.
Speaker 2: This is my husband Stephen and I on a cruise.  We used to take the kids on cruises.  This is back in 1990s when we went on a cruise together.
Speaker 1: These are my parents and I.  I was about probably three or four years old so this would have been back in about 1953.  My dad, Louie Evans, my mom Willa Evans [Willa Mae Dumas Evans] and this was our first family portrait together.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my--this was when I was in grade school.  Our elementary school went through first grade to eighth grade.  This was my seventh grade picture at St. Barbara's.  I integrated this school and this was taken in the spring of 1961.
Speaker 1: This is a picture when I was at Georgia State University [Atlanta, Georgia].  This was back in 1977, '78 [1978].  We had moved to Georgia, my husband Stephen got a transfer and I had been at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], I had taken a leave of absence to have my first son Brian [Brian Smith] and this is a picture when I began working again as a dean at Georgia State University.
Speaker 2: One of the problems of being in corporate America was you never got much chance to spend time with your family.  I traveled a lot but one of the good things about Corporate America was I had a lot of frequent flyer miles so we used those miles to take the kids to Hawaii for Christmas one year and had a great time and a chance to spend some family time.  So this is in Maui [Hawaii], Christmas of about 1985 I believe just before we went to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] right?
Speaker 1: This is my wedding day.  This was August 28, 1971; my husband Stephen and I, Stephen's parents, Florence Smith and Al Smith and my parents, Louie and Willa Evans.  It was a great day.
Speaker 2: This is a family portrait when I was in high school of my sisters Joan and Michele, my parents Louie and Willa Evans.  In the background is a piano that I played.  My dad played in a jazz band and used to have jazz band practices at the house; every Thursday night the jazz band would practice there and that's the piano I learned to play as I was growing up.
Speaker 1: This is my dad's parents William Evans and Julia Dunson Evans.  This is probably--this had to be shortly before my grandfather died so this would be back in about 1949.  They are both from Tallapoosa, Georgia and the family migrated to Ohio in the 1920s right before the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 2: Actually this is a picture of myself and my daughter Stacy; didn't know that at the time but I was a dean at Georgia State then and this is an event.  I was assistant dean for student affairs.  The students were having an activity outside and I was participating along with them so this was back in 1977 when I was still at the college.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Did you want to identify where your daughter is in the photo?
Speaker 2: She's actually in me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh okay now I get it, okay I'm a little slow.
Speaker 2: She's not visible to the world there.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Stacy's graduation.  There is my husband Stephen and my son Brian and my mother is standing next to Stacy and my husband's mother Florence Smith is standing next to her.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of an awards program.  I received an award as the woman of the year in business in Cobb County [Georgia], the county that I live in back in 1985.  I've always been very involved in the community and on a lot of boards in the community.  This is one time when there was some acknowledgement of that involvement and participation.
Speaker 1: From 1988 to 1990 I was executive director for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  The executive director is the chief operating officer who runs the headquarters staff and the staff operations of the sorority.
Speaker 2: This is my high school graduation picture.  I was named one of the student leaders and received the leadership award at school.  I was also named most likely to succeed at Central Catholic High School.  This picture was taken back in 1966.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my sisters and my mother and I.  My sister Joan is in the blue, my mother, myself and my sister Michele.  This was taken at my son's wedding in 2002.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of our family on a cruise.  We used to take the kids on cruises when they were growing up.  That's my husband Stephen and I, my daughter Stacy and my son Brian.  This was probably taken in about 1998.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my husband and I, my sweetie Stephen Smith.  This was taken last year 2005 at a social event.
Speaker 2: This is a picture at my son's wedding.  My son got married in 2002.  That's myself, my son, his bride Rashan [Rashan Ali], my mother, and my husband, Stephen.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me from my college yearbook.  I was a member of Mortar Board, an honor society, but I was also a student body vice president and president of the sorority at the time.  I also was the student member of the university's board of trustees and the commencement speaker.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is my senior year in college, 1970.  I had been named--had received the distinguished service award and was named outstanding senior woman.  The young man with me was named outstanding senior man so this was in 1970 in June.
