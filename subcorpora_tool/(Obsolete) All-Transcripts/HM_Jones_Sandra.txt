Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind her first name?
Speaker 2: There is not. She--at least she never shared it with us. My father [Robert Miller] always called her Lucy because he, he couldn't get with that Luther (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lillington, North Carolina, on May 1st, 1912.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of how far back you can trace them and where they were living and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: I only know as far back as my grandmother [Mary Hill].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they were living in Lillington, North Carolina. My grandmother was a farmer, and she was not a farmer's wife. She was a farmer. She was there, had her own farming place, so she was the first entrepreneur in our family.
Speaker 1: So she had her own place.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And was she married? (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: She was married at one time, but she was--she raised her children without her husband.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he, did he pass away, or did he--?
Speaker 2: I don't know whatever happened to her husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he's not discussed in the family?
Speaker 2: He's not discussed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a--any--a story of any other place that the family lived in besides Lillington?
Speaker 2: No. My mother came straight from Lillington to Winston-Salem [North Carolina]. And her family is primarily in Lillington still, the descen- descendants of her close family are still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. So, so your, so your--did your mother finish school in Lillington, or--
Speaker 2: She came to Winston-Salem to go to nursing school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she finished high school there, and then came here and went to nursing school. That's where she met my father.
Speaker 1: Okay. So her--so--was, was she able to finish and become a nurse?
Speaker 2: She did become a nurse, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was also a cosmetologist. She used to do hair, as we say, in the basement of our home, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was she affiliated with any of the Madam Walker [Madam C.J. Walker] or Annie Malone, or any of the other--
Speaker 2: She was not, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. She was just a North Carolina hairdresser.
Story_ID: 657559
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side. Can you give, give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it's R- Robert Miller, R-O-B-E-R-T, M-I-L-L-E-R. He had a middle initial A, but he wasn't sure what it was--stood for, so neither did we know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Robert A. Miller.
Speaker 1: And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Lewisville, North Carolina, and it was in 1912 also, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, once again, how far back can you trace your father's side of the family, and what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Again, just to my grandmother, and her name was--did you ask, did you ask the name for the grandmother? I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back and get your mother's mother's name--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --too. What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary Elizabeth Hill [Mary Hill].
Speaker 1: Okay. And what was your paternal grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Bessie Mae Miller [Bessie Miller].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a maid.
Speaker 1: And did she live in town?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah. She lived here in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], and she worked for a family called the Trotmans, T-R-O-T-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did she, did she actually live at their place?
Speaker 2: No. She had her own place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she would commute back and forth to their home.
Speaker 1: Now, that was an issue in the early part of the century for, you know--there was this big struggle over where a maid would live.
Speaker 2: I did not know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: There was many families that they never saw their families hardly because they couldn't get, you know, away from the family they were working for.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: To get home, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At any rate, there's a, there's a book about it somebody wrote about ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd love to read that.
Story_ID: 657560
Speaker 1: Your father [Robert Miller] was raised by his, his--she had her own place in town, and he--what were--what did your father say about growing up? Did he have any stories, or--
Speaker 2: Well, he--when he grew up, Lewisville, North Carolina, which is now a very upscale suburban community, was the country, and he had came to Winston-Salem [North Carolina] because he did not want to be a farmer. He didn't want to live in the country, so he and his, his mother [Bessie Miller] came to Winston-Salem and brought him when he was young, and so he grew up largely in Winston-Salem, so that he could do some other things. He went to Johnson C. Smith University for a couple of years. Then he had to stop going there to college so that he could earn a living.
Speaker 1: Now, Johnson C. Smith is in Charlotte [North Carolina] or--
Speaker 2: In Charlotte, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. What were his aspirations, what was he--did he want to be a teacher, or a, or--
Speaker 2: I don't know what he wanted to be, but when he left school, he was a chauffeur for the Trotman family, and he did that for many years until he became a janitor at the newspaper here into Winston-Salem. At that the time, it was the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel. Now it's just the Winston-Salem Journal. And he was a janitor at the newspaper until the one African American journalist that they had onboard moved away to Boston [Massachusetts], and so they tapped him to be the journalist. So he was a janitor one day, and the next day, he was a journalist.
Speaker 1: That is something.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Interesting. So he went back to school, went to Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem Teachers College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and studied journalism. He didn't get a degree there, but he did do--did--made good grades in quite a few classes, and so then he was a journalist for the rest of my--for the rest of his life until he was sixty-five and retired, and then came to work with me [at Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: How, how old was he when he made the transition from janitor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to journalist.
Speaker 2: To journalist. He was--let me think how much. If he came to work for me when he was sixty-five, so he was probably forty, forty-five.
Speaker 1: That is some story. Now, ironically, we were at the Journal yesterday.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: We interviewed [HistoryMaker] John X. Miller--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --who is the new managing editor.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. I had recommended him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Lafayette [Jones' husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] and I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Any, any relation at all, the Millers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no. I've not even met him, but I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew--yeah, we knew that he had--
Speaker 1: Yeah. We interviewed him yesterday (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't that something?
Speaker 1: So he's a, he's, he's--I don't know which--well, he's not the first black Miller who--to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --be a journalist there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm going to go and meet him. I'm going to go down and sit--yeah, go down and make sure that I say hello, and--
Speaker 1: Because he grew up in Winston-Salem [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Did he?
Speaker 1: He did. And, now, his, his father [John X. Miller, Sr.] was an assistant coach under Big House Gaines [Clarence E. Gaines].
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's interesting how the world works. So, so your father was--what, what sort of--did he write a column, or did he do reporting, or, or--in, in the black community or what?
Speaker 2: Yes. He had a column.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when he took the column, the name of the column was Activities of the Colored Peoples [ph.] and he changed the name of the column to Around East Winston [Happenings Around East Winston], and East Winston is where most of the blacks live in, here in Winston-Salem.
Speaker 1: Okay. Activities of the Colored Peoples (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Colored Peoples (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah. Now, this is a--it's interesting. A lot of the major papers, north and south, had a section like that in those days.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he did that until he was sixty-five.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 657561
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there's not (laughter). Yeah. There's no--they never told--
Speaker 1: But they did meet in, in school or when your mother [Luther Hill Miller] was in school--
Speaker 2: My mother was in school, and--
Speaker 1: --in, in Winston-Salem [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. And my dad [Robert Miller] was probably working for the Trotmans at that time, and so they met. They never told me how they met. Yeah. That's interesting that I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. When you--but they started courting, and they--when did they get married?
Speaker 2: So it was eight years before my sister [Bobbiette Miller Phillips] was born. My sister was born in 1944, so it was eight years from 1944, nineteen thirty--
Speaker 1: Yeah, '6 [1936], '36 [1936].
Speaker 2: Thirty-six [1936], 19--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --um-hm, 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you consider their personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walked and how they talked, what they looked like, their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, from an appearance standpoint, I take after my mother. From a personality standpoint, I take after my father.
Speaker 1: Okay. Explain.
Speaker 2: Yes. My father was a calm person, and he was a very progressive person. He knew how to, to manipulate computers before I did, and he was a creative person, and he thought about--he had unique ideas, and, and tried to make them into realities. He was the founder, for example, of the--one of the founders, of the Victory Credit Union [Victory-Masonic Mutual Credit Union; Victory Credit Union]. It's a credit union, an African American credit union in Winston-Salem. He, he was a member of the lodge, Salem Lodge Number 149--139 [Salem Lodge No. 139]. I can't remember--can't forget that. And the year I was born, he convinced them and a number of people to found that credit union. And he was the chair of that credit union probably until he died, so that was like twenty--well, yeah, about thirty years he was chair of that credit union, so he was an involved person and an outgoing person, but calm in terms of his demeanor.
Speaker 1: Yeah. A credit union is a--can be a tremendous asset to a community.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. And it was, in fact. When Lafayette [HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] and I married, Lafayette became chair of the board for the credit union, and he moved that credit union, Lafayette did, into another entire level by joining a majority credit union here, but I'm sure he'll tell that story.
Story_ID: 657562
Speaker 1: Tell us about your siblings. Do you have any siblings, or--
Speaker 2: I, I had two siblings. I have one sibling now. One of my siblings, Bobbiette Miller [Bobbiette Miller Phillips]. My--
Speaker 1: Is that the oldest?
Speaker 2: She was the middle child. There were three of us. My sister is the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Bobbiette was the middle child, and I'm, I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: What, what your oldest sister's name?
Speaker 2: Camille [Camille Miller Allen].
Speaker 1: Okay. So Camille, you--
Speaker 2: Camille, Bobbiette--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and then me.
Speaker 1: All right. And what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: Camille, you want to start with Camille? Camille, Camille was a teacher for many years. She taught in Washington, D.C., and then in Norfolk, Virginia, and she never taught here in Winston-Salem [North Carolina]. So now Camille is working with SMSi Health Insurance Solutions [Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. She's a partner in that company.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and your other sister Bobbiette (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bobbiette. Well, Bobbiette died when she was a student. She was twenty-one years old. She was married and had a child that was three weeks old, so she never got a chance to have a career.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was she a student at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] as well, or--
Speaker 2: Interesting, interesting. Bobbiette was a student at that time at, at Wake Forest [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. She was the--one of the first, probably the first African American woman to go to Wake Forest 'cause she was there with Ed Reynolds, who was the first African American male, so she had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, okay. So, I mean, to die so young, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in that situation, did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she sick or--
Speaker 2: She had a blood clot in her lung, and it may have been as a result of the childbirth, but at, at that time, there was--there's a long story about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Was it, was the integration at Wake Forest met with a lot of opposition, or was it fairly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --easy, or--
Speaker 2: No. It was quiet. Yes. She just went to school and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah. There was no, no--
Speaker 1: I don't know if I ever read about it--
Speaker 2: --fanfare about that.
Story_ID: 657563
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory was when I was maybe five years old, and I caught a train with my aunt who was going to New Jersey, somewhere in New Jersey, to work, and I had a little purse with some caramels in them. I can remember that, and going on that train to New Jersey, so that's probably my earliest.
Story_ID: 657564
Speaker 1: You named the community, and I forgot it, in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] that, that you were raised in.
Speaker 2: I was born and raised in what--the community called Boston [Boston-Thurmond, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Boston, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that community. Was this a--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a working class African American community and still is, as a matter of fact, after all these years. It's not the community where the majority of African Americans were raised. That was in East Winston [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--in Boston, we were all pretty poor, but we didn't know we were poor 'cause we, 'cause we had plenty to eat and, and clothes to wear, and, generally, a mother and father in the home.
Speaker 1: So what sort of house did you--were you raised in? Were you raised in the same house the, the entire time you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I--bef- we moved into our home which my father [Robert Miller] built with some of his friends when I was five years old, and prior to that, we lived in an apartment building, and so when I was five, and I can remember, kind of remember daddy and his folk out there building this home that my nephew still lives in, so, yeah, that was, it was a home of our own.
Speaker 1: I've heard these kind of stories before, but, you know, I'm always fascinated when, when a man builds his own house.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. That was quite amazing. Another example of my dad having a vision and making it happen, you know.
Speaker 1: So was it a large home, or--
Speaker 2: No, a three bedroom. Let me see if it was three at that time 'cause I know they did expand it. Let me see, one, two, yeah, there were three, three bedrooms with three small bedrooms, small. I don't know what footage, small kitchen and living room, one bathroom, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's, that is something.
Story_ID: 657565
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy. The smells were the best things. My mother [Luther Hill Miller] cooking some wonderful food. She could make anything smell wonderful. I can remember her cooking toast once, and it just smelled so good, I had to get out of the bed and go get some. And sights and sounds, rain. I always loved the rain. And we didn't have a tin roof on our house, but one of our neighbors did, a friend of mine, so I used to go to her house to listen to the rain on the tin roof. That was lovely. I still love rain very much today. Birds, lots of birds singing, which was a lovely sound for me growing up, so those are some of the things.
Story_ID: 657566
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Kimberley Park Elementary School [Winston-Salem, North Carolina], Kimberley Park.
Speaker 1: And so was this all, all-black school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Public school?
Speaker 2: Yes, all, all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --public school always, and always all-black.
Speaker 1: All right. And was this located in the Boston community [Boston-Thurmond, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, still is. As a matter of fact, now a friend of mine is a principal down there.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject of the school?
Speaker 2: I loved everything at school. Just every subject was a good one. I so--
Speaker 1: Favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Many. I can remember one in particular but many. Ruth B. Lewis was the--one of my favorite teachers. She took a class in the third grade, and kept that class because she chose to do so for three years, so third, fourth, and fifth grades, we all were together in Ruth B. Lewis' class.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So you started school in 1952, I guess, or--
Speaker 2: I guess so. Let's see--
Speaker 1: Did you start in the first grade or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First grade, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then I guess--and so you'd be six--
Speaker 2: Four to six.
Speaker 1: --years old.
Speaker 2: Six years old. That's right.
Speaker 1: This was about 1952.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. All right. So were you, you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was a very good student. I was a--not a good student (background noise) as I can recall during my first year in, in school, so I, I had to do some catch up, but after that, I was a top student.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Probably the top student.
Speaker 1: Most people that like school are good students, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's true, um-hm.
Story_ID: 657567
Speaker 1: What was going on in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] when you were growing up in terms the black community? Were things fairly stable here in--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because the industry--we had both R.J. Reynolds [R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and Hanes [Hanes Group; Hanesbrands Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] were thriving at the time. So while blacks did not make as much as their white counterparts, they did make a decent living. The, the majority of the African Americans in that time had jobs that enabled them to have homes of their own, send their children to college and just have a decent life, so that was one thing that was going on. There was some stability, but it didn't encourage entrepreneurship.
Speaker 1: Okay. So let me ask about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There, there was a black business district and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, there was.
Speaker 1: What kind of businesses was the community engaged in?
Speaker 2: They--I could only remember cafes and beauty salons. My mother [Luther Hill Miller] had a beauty salon downtown. My dad [Robert Miller] worked at--there were medical professionals, other professionals in the area. I don't remember black clothing stores and other kinds of businesses there.
Speaker 1: Okay. So beauty salons, barb- barbershops.
Speaker 2: Barbershops (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What about the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the undertakers, the black undertakers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes, there were quite a few black undertakers, yes, absolutely, um-hm. They were not in that district, but there were quite a few in town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think Winston-Salem suffers from a lack of entrepreneurship as a result of there having been such a broad base of factory employment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: So R.J. Reynolds was a huge employer.
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: And Hanes--
Speaker 2: And Hanes.
Speaker 1: --makes underwear, socks--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So it was a good place to find a job--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: But it doesn't--it didn't really encourage you to start anything.
Story_ID: 657568
Speaker 1: Did you go to a junior high school?
Speaker 2: Junior high and high were the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Paisley junior high and high school [John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Paisley?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, P-A-I-S-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Paisley High School, and that was, was this in the Boston area [Boston-Thurmond, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], or was this in--
Speaker 2: Yes, in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, in Boston again. I used to walk to school as I did to elementary school [Kimberley Park Elementary School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay. So were you engaged in activities in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Mos- mostly academic activities. They wouldn't let me be a cheerleader 'cause they said I was too skinny. (Laughter) I wish it were true now. But I was editor of the, of the yearbook and the newspaper that we had there. And YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], I loved the Y. I just completed two years as chairman of the YWCA here [Gateway YWCA, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I thought that was so, so ironic because when I was growing up, the YWCA was integrated--or segregated, so there was a black Y and there was a white Y, and you couldn't go to the white Y except on special occasions, but the black Y was just a haven for us to learn how to swim, and it was a social activity area, and so I was the head of the Y Teens there, and I guess some clubs and activities, other kinds of things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, I know we interviewed Togo West [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you went to school with him, right?
Speaker 2: No. My sister did.
Speaker 1: Oh, your sister did.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. But he was a local--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's a nice guy. I remember Togo very well. He used to come to our house. He dated one of my sisters. It may have been Bobbiette [Bobbiette Miller Phillips], one of the two of them he dated for a while. Could have been Camille [Camille Miller Allen]. I'm not sure. Yeah. So--
Speaker 1: Okay. He became secretary of the army.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he sure did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 657569
Speaker 1: Paisley High School [John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and you're the editor of the yearbook and the newspaper, school newspaper, and I was going to ask you about the Safe Bus Company [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. That was quite a wonderful thing to have in our community where the--there was a bus company that was owned by African Americans, and they--the owners of the Safe Bus Company lived in Boston [Boston-Thurmond, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], so we're--not too far from where we lived, and the--it was a source of pride for all of us.
Speaker 1: Right. Especially, you know, after, you know, Montgomery Bus Boycott in '56 [1956], and all of the--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --tension around the Freedom Rides and that sort of thing. Here's a town that actually has a black bus company.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah, that serviced the whole town, not just--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --African Americans, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, interesting. So everybody rode, rode Safe Bus--
Speaker 2: That's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Company buses.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you didn't have to go to the back of the bus.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Safe Bus Company (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.

Speaker 1: What about church? Was church--how much influence did church have on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, great influence, as it does on so many African Americans. Again, we went to church all my life from the time I was born until, still now we belong to the same church, even that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: It's Goler--
Speaker 1: Is the name of the church?
Speaker 2: --it's Goler Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Goler Memorial A.M.E. Zion, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have like, you know, defined roles for youth at, at Goler where--did you participate in youth activities there and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. We participated in everything that they had. That's where we learned how to be public speakers because we would get up and say our poems and, and perform for the audience, and it's always a greatly appreciative audience. No matter how you did, they thought you were great (laughter). And so that made you think you were great as well. So I was involved in Sunday school, and then the youth organizations, yes, there at church. When I graduated from college [Howard University], I moved to--well, well, first, Washington [D.C.] to go to school, and then to Chicago [Illinois], so even though I was away in Chicago for twenty-one years, I always still maintained my membership at Goler and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, make donations there.
Speaker 1: So the--it was a real bond with, with Goler church, you know, that--
Speaker 2: It con--
Speaker 1: --lasted.
Speaker 2: --it continues. We, as a matter of fact, are getting ready to open a compu- community outreach center for our insurance business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] at the Goler Enrichment Center [Goler Family Enrichment Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], so that relationship continues.
Story_ID: 657571
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school [John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], did they have activities like Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] or, or any business activities for the high school students, and did you--
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) participate in them?
Speaker 2: --I don't remember business activities with the high school students, and so, no, but honor roll, and that sort of thing, you know, that honor society [National Honor Society].
Speaker 1: Okay. I know in some cities, they have like Junior Achievement where the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, students actually manufacture a product, or they market a product, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They did not have that with us.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now, you were in--you started high school in 1960, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I guess that was during '60 [1960], '64 [1964], yes, high school--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: All right. So this is a time of--this is a, this is a--one of the real intense periods of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, did you--did--was your father [Robert Miller] involved in civil rights activities in Winston-Salem [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Not as much as he was involved in other activities. He did have some involvement there, but it wasn't a big impact on our lives. I remember when I was, oh, I guess I was fourteen or fifteen and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to town, so we were--all went over to, to see Martin Luther King, and he was wonderful, of course. Everyone was enthused and really excited about what was going on, and then there was a march that was going to go from the church [Goler Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] down to downtown somewhere, and my father says, "Yeah, well, I think it's great for us to be involved, but I don't want you marching. I don't want you to be out there endangering yourself. Let's look for some other kinds of ways that we can help." So he was all--I guess with three girls, he's--felt he had to be extra protective, so he was always conservative in that regard.
Story_ID: 657572
Speaker 1: Now this is the age of Motown [Motown Records], I guess. It was starting to become popular and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) other music. I mean, what was your association with the popular culture in those days? What, what kind of things did you like to do as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have all those many options, you know, not like the teenagers have today, so we would go to dances at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] again. And, and, of course, there's the--it was the house parties where we'd have parties in our basement and play all those great songs and dance. Our basement, our home, was one of the favorite places to come 'cause there were three girls, you know, so that meant that you had a lot of boys who wanted to come there (laughter), so we'd have--and then my mother [Luther Hill Miller] and father [Robert Miller] were encouraging--always encouraged us to bring people home, so we had lots of basement house parties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was our main thing.
Speaker 1: So you were always a host. You were (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, so often. More often than not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then they knew exactly where we were, what we were doing (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were already at home, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, already home (laughter). We don't have to worry about it.
Story_ID: 657573
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers or mentors in high school at Paisley [John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Again a, quite a variety of just outstanding teachers who all were concerned about us. We had our fiftieth high school reunion, recently had a dinner, and three of the teachers were there. Doc Farabee is one, Walter Farabee [Walter Farabee, Sr.], and we used to call him Doc. He, he was probably maybe five or six years older than we were when he was teaching us because, yeah, he had just gotten out of, of college, really, and he taught us chemistry and biology, I believe, both subjects.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: Farabee, F-A-R-A-B-E-E, Walter Farabee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His son now is--works for the--his name is Walter Farabee [Walter Farabee, Jr.] as well. He works, works for the city, and he's head of the, the minority business division for Winston-Salem [North Carolina], so he's continuing so--you know, Doc Farabee was there and some other teachers as well.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was he, he was one of your favorites then?
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: Doc?
Speaker 2: Yes, one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: All right. So, so your sisters [Bobbiette Miller Phillips and Camille Miller Allen] had been able to go to college, and so you were thinking to go--about going to college, too, I'm sure. So, so where, where were you--what were you aiming for in those days in terms of college?
Speaker 2: Well, all of us knew that college was the next step for us, and there's so many fine universities here in North Carolina that that was probably my first thought because I had to go somewhere that we could afford; however, when I was a senior, I got a half scholarship to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and it was--and Howard, of course, was the pinnacle university for African Americans during that time period, so I was elated. I didn't know how I was going to get the other half of the money, but, as usual, my parents [Luther Hill Miller and Robert Miller] said, "Don't worry. We're--somehow we'll make it," and so I went on to Howard.
Story_ID: 657574
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask this question, but what role did Winston's, Winston-Salem State Teachers College [sic. Winston-Salem Teachers College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] play in, in the community when you were growing up? Was there--you know, was it--did it play a significant cultural role or political role in the community?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I know culturally. I don't know so much politically because there were lot--not a lot of political activities going on in which the college was involved to my knowledge. Of course, I was a child growing up, so I wouldn't have known that, but I know from a cultural standpoint, it kind of let us all know that you can, you can go to college, and then, of course, it had cultural activities on campus that we could go to. Perhaps the biggest impact was the athletic department because they had such outstanding athletic teams at that time. And my sister [Camille Miller Allen] went to Teachers College as--as we called it then. That's where she got her degree, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know everybody talks about Clarence "Big House" Gaines [Clarence E. Gaines].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. He was--
Speaker 1: Was he a friend of the family or did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah. We knew him and my father [Robert Miller] knew him well. I, not so much again. His widow, Claire Gaines [sic. Clara Berry Gaines], is now a friend of mine because we're in a couple of organizations together. She's both an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], and she's a Link [The Links, Incorporated] and so I am in touch with her often now.
Story_ID: 657575
Speaker 1: All right, you're preparing to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. What are your career aspirations as a senior [at John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, all I knew about was journalism. I had been a junior reporter for the Winston-Salem Journal, so my thought was that I was would be a journalist, and when I got there, I got more exposure and knew about other things and then switched to sociology when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, so what persuaded you to switch to sociology, and, you know, instead of journalism? Seems like journalism is a more glamorous occupation in some ways than maybe sociology (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But sociology, I thought it was really quite interesting. It--sociology and psychology were my favorite subjects in college, and as I learned about it, I thought, I thought I wanted to be a social worker, and that--I changed my mind in my senior year, well, my junior year of college when I did a--worked there for some, a social service organization and, and saw how little influence and power they had at that time, that particular organization. We did a big study and took it to [U.S.] Congress or--for approval, and found out that it wasn't even being considered because we didn't have any political influence, and so I said, perhaps we--I better look at something else.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the chair of, of the sociology department at Howard when you were there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember. I don't remember.
Speaker 1: But was E. Franklin Frazier still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He surely was, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He may have been chair of that department then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have any courses from him?
Speaker 2: I may have had--
Speaker 1: Or was he still teaching then?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I may have had one. I, I really don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So sixty- this, this would be at the end of his career.
Speaker 2: His career (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --towards the end of it. Yeah, but he's--who were some of your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: At Howard, I cannot remember, not one person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't. I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 657576
Speaker 1: Now, this is a time period, too, where--was '64 [1964] when you started the--it was Freedom Summer. We just had the fiftieth anniversary of Freedom Summer this year, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know Stokely Carmichael, or Kwame Ture?
Speaker 2: I remember his, his being in our cafeteria standing on the tables doing his lectures, yeah, being an advocate. It was very interesting, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a sense then at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that this was a particularly politically charged, you know, period of time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was at Howard when the riots occurred after Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death, and the National Guard were on campus, and we were barricaded in our dorms, and, of course, this was at a time when [HistoryMaker] Ewart Brown, Ewart Brown was a good friend, and he was the head of the student organization at that time, and so between Ewart Brown and a group of us, we closed down the administration, and we went into the administrative building and closed down the administration and barricaded ourselves in there for quite a while. I don't know what we were asking for.
Speaker 1: This is in, what, sixty--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], '67 [1967] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sixty-six [sic. 1968], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And Ewart subsequently became premier of Bermuda.
Speaker 1: Right. I've heard about him before. People have--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mentioned him before, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And Ewart Brown is E-W-A-R-T.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Brown.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay. So you don't remember what the demands were at--from the Howard administration. You don't know what you all were demanding?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, we were demanding. But we were demanding something.
Speaker 1: Now, I talked to the former dean of students, or the man who was dean [HistoryMaker Carl Edwin Anderson]. I can't think of his name right now, but he was dean of students during this period of time, and he was telling me that, that his priority that he said--this is what he, what he pushed also to, to the rest of the administration was to the safety of the students.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So whatever they wanted, or whatever they said they wanted, don't hurt any of them--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was the attitude of the--did you, did you see that--do you think that was reflected in how the administration dealt with it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. They were very caring. I don't know that I would have been as tolerant (laughter) of us as they were of us, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: The president then, who was it, James Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right. You know a lot more about it than I can remember.
Speaker 1: Well, I've interviewed a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from Howard, but, you know, so some of this kind of lines up, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's--okay. So--but--so nobody was arrested or anything or--
Speaker 2: No, none of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think we finally gave up and went home.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I would imagine that the sociology department would be, you know, proactively change oriented, you know, just by the pure nature of what it teaches and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --stands for.
Speaker 2: Right, right, yes.
Speaker 1: And this is also--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the age when President Lyndon Baines Johnson started the anti-poverty programs, you know, the War, the War on Poverty.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And Model Cities and all the other--some of the other initiatives.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So were those initiatives discussed in the sociology department at, at Howard?
Speaker 2: To some extent, yes. I can remember our talking about whether or not the African American culture was a subculture. Was it a real subculture of the general population? And somehow I was offended by thinking it's a subculture, and so I had to grow into that, grow into that understanding that, yeah, indeed, there is a real sub- subculture that, that exists among African Americans. We, we are not exactly like the general population in our thinking and our cultural habits.
Story_ID: 657577
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968] is a pivotal year for a lot of people in--black people in the United States. This, this is the year that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated, and it also is a year when Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders], you know, publishes, you know, a study of what happened during the riots and, and a lot of the findings are--have sociological implications.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And economic implications--
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as well.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. The first year that majority universities recruited at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was 1967. That's when Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] came in and some other major Ivy League schools to recruit, and a group of, a group of seven or eight of my classmates went to Harvard the year before I, and then a group went to Northwestern University [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]. They're business schools, the B schools there. I didn't even know about business schools until that time, and it was one of my friends and, and classmates who went to Northwestern who then came back and told me about Northwestern, and I was going into my senior year, and why I should be going there to get my M.B.A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the first time that I knew about M.B.A.'s. I was a junior in college and knew about those schools.
Speaker 1: I think the degree as such was somewhat new then (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was it relatively new? Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: But they, they had other degrees that had--they were similar, but they, they hadn't really come up with an M.B.A. until the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Hm, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But they certainly didn't reach out to black colleges [HBCUs]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --until the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: That's for sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know that the degree was relatively new at that time.
Story_ID: 657578
Speaker 1: Now you're an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you joined that earlier I suppose, in your college life (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah, uh-huh, when I was a sophomore.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the--did being a AKA help, help you matriculate through, through Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, it helped me to have lots of good friends, friends that I still have now, and that's always a help, but that was the extent of the contribution that AKA has made to my academic success (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then you were involved with the black student organization--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or the student organization because at Howard, they're all mostly black students anyway.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: So I don't have to call it--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --black.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was involved with student organization. I headed the women's organization--I don't know the name of it now--for the university, undergraduate and graduate when I was a senior.
Speaker 1: So this is a women's organization that was--so, and this like presaged the women's rights movement that--you know, I mean, it was--or, or in sync with the women's right, rights movement that was going on in those days with NOW [National Organization for Women].
Speaker 2: It was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, you know, we weren't great women's rights advocates. We were so intent on advocating racial equality that we weren't too big, women feminists at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So there's no chapters of NOW on campus or anything like that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, none of that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This was women's student government. That's all I can recall.
Speaker 1: And what were the issues that, that women's student government dealt with?
Speaker 2: Academic primarily. You know, at the time, things that related to being outstanding students, and the things that we wanted the university to, to do or change or add to the curriculum. Those were the primary things about women's student government. They were internal more than anything else.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Wha- was the ratio to male and female students at, at Howard about equal in those days?
Speaker 2: It was about equal in those days, as opposed to now. I understand that like 60 to 70 percent of the students are women now.
Speaker 1: Right. I was--we were talking to somebody yesterday who was remembering a time when most of the black college [HBCU] students were men.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --and now, of course, most of them are women--
Speaker 2: By far.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, by far.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's concerning, I think.
Story_ID: 657579
Speaker 1: So as you're on the verge of graduation, you, you decide to go to Northwestern to try to see what the plan is at Northwestern.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. I wanted to go to Northwestern. I applied and I was accepted, but I didn't have the money to go, and so I worked for a year in a little town called Drums, Pennsylvania. That's not too far from Scranton [Pennsylvania], not too far from Scranton, down in a valley. I worked for a Job Corps center, RCA Job Corps Center [Drums, Pennsylvania], and I stayed on campus at the Job Corps center. Twenty-five cents a day, that's how much my rent was, and I saved all the money that I could make and worked as much overtime as I could, and got enough money to get to Chicago [Illinois], and went to Chicago, and went to Northwestern and explained to them that I was here, but I didn't have the money to go to school. They sent me to First National Bank [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] who had some scholarships available, and I got a scholarship from First National Bank to pay for my M.B.A., and I worked at First National Bank as part time in addition to the scholarship.
Speaker 1: That was a job downtown in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Downtown Chicago.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--now, what did you think of downtown--of, of Chicago in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a big city. That's, that's exactly my primary thinking. How do I navigate in this big city? And the business school was down on Lake Shore Drive at that time. They've since moved it to Evanston [Illinois], but down on Lake Shore Drive--
Speaker 1: Okay. So everything was down--okay. So North- Northwestern's business school was, was on Lake Shore Drive, too, and (unclears) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yeah, yeah, at that time. So I had this great address on Lake Shore Drive, and because I did have this great address on Lake Shore Drive, it wasn't denoted as a dormitory, which it was (laughter), that I was able to get credit cards because people thought I lived right there on the Gold Coast [Chicago, Illinois]. I got the great American Express card (laughter), so that was a good experience, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So First National Bank, and, and--so how did you like--now, when they--was this called the--was it the Kellogg School of Business [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was called Kellogg [sic.], and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was the first African American woman to graduate from Kellogg, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular mentors or teachers that stand out in--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) At Kellogg.
Speaker 1: --when you were in school?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did--were there any African Americans there that could shepherd you through?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That was the--that, that--we, we were the first--we were the second class of African Americans to come into, to Kellogg. It was the first class that had come, most of him--whom had come from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that helped us through the process, and so they were the first class of African Americans, and we were the second, and then they asked us to go out and recruit additional African Americans, and so we went out and recruited. Now, I had twenty-two new students, African American students, and we were saying we could offer all of them an opportunity to come. That's what we told the administration because all of them are not going to be able to come 'cause they're not going to be able to afford it, and instead of that happening, I think twenty of the twenty-two did manage to, to come, so that's why--that's probably the largest class that they had in many years. I don't know how- what the ratio is now. Must, must be pretty good because they've got a pretty strong student organization.
Story_ID: 657580
Speaker 1: Here you are at Kellogg School at Northwestern [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]. Now, what were you learning at Kellogg School that really informed your later activities? Did you do anything really significant there?
Speaker 2: I think the most significant thing I learned at Kellogg was that I was just as good as everybody else there because I had not been in a integrated school situation all of my life with the exception of a class in high school [John W. Paisley Senior High School; Paisley IB Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] that they let us take, the top students, two or three from each black school, they let us take at the white high school. That was my only integrated experience, and so when I went to Kellogg, of course, I was the only black female in the school, and I, I got to see that my foundation was just as good as everybody else's, and, of course, I learned some, some academic things as well; understanding what marketing is all about. One of the things that they emphasized at, at Kellogg--and I, I suspect that they did it in most of the business schools. They, over and over again, told you how outstanding you were to be there to start with, and what a leader you should be in your community, so it was encouraging in that regard as well. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And was there any crosspollination between sociology and business? And--I mean, did, did your studies in sociology inform any of your business studies or vice versa?
Speaker 2: Ah yes, absolutely, because understanding and--people and cultures is a big part of being able to be a successful businessperson; especially, an entrepreneur, as you probably know. And so, yes, there was a--quite a bit of a carryover from my college education [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] into, to the M.B.A. situation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. I mean, so in terms of being able to--now, you've been involved in marketing, you know, I guess most of your life, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so in terms of marketing and understanding the black community from a sociological standpoint, standpoint, you know, can be useful, I guess, in terms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely. It's been essential, especially since our business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] focuses on reaching and motivating African American and Hispanic consumers, so knowing the culture and--from both a intimate personal standpoint, as well as from an academic standpoint, is extremely important to, to our current business, and it has been throughout my career.

Speaker 1: When I worked at Quaker Oats Company, Quaker Oats is the only professional job that I ever had. I've worked at many jobs getting through school, but Quaker was the only professional job that I've had. And working at Quaker, of course, again, being the only African American woman in management and very few anywhere in the company, I was always considered to be the authority on what black people are thinking and (laughter) and knowing, and, and since, certainly I couldn't be that without having some deeper understanding than just my personal experience, it gave me the, the reason and the impetus to, to learn more about African American culture and African American thinking in general. Yeah, so it was important.
Speaker 2: Was there, was there a sense in the, in the larger business community, in the white business community that the African American population was a niche that could be mined for, you know, more sales and, you know, successful introduction of products that hadn't been previously popular in the black community?
Speaker 1: Not as much as it is--growing as it is now. It wasn't at that broad base understanding that, that was a different culture and a highly viable, a viable one. It was just emerging, the--this sense of understanding that this was a real market. For example, I worked on the grits, managed the grits brands during part of my time at Quaker, and 92 percent of the instant--I introduced Instant Grits [Quaker Oats Instant Grits], various flavors of them--92 percent of the Instant Grits products outside of the Southeast were bought by African Americans, 92 percent, and it was just (laughter) a little--
Speaker 2: That's, that's even astonishing to me on some level. I mean, I, I would guess we, we'd be a large percentage of those who ate grits, but to--90--
Speaker 1: Ninety-two percent outside of the Southeast for African Americans, and we--it--I couldn't convince Quaker to do an African American targeted campaign, so--
Speaker 2: They just didn't get it.
Speaker 1: Didn't get it.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. But also it was a--and they got--you say, "Well look, we've got this 92 percent, and we, we're not even doing anything, so why should we do anything?" So--wasn't--not--that wasn't the best kinds of thinking, but that was the thinking, so we weren't able to do an African American--
Speaker 2: Yeah. They--
Speaker 1: --targeted campaign.
Speaker 2: So you're suggesting that they could increase the total market, you know, of--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Grow the market.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Beyond, so the, the total market would be larger than the--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --the percentage of the present market, correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't know why they--I even know that. I'm not a businessperson.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah. How do I know this? So they couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 657582
Speaker 1: The other big factor here in--during this period of time, this is 1969, '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So this is--Chicago [Illinois] is known as the mecca, the, the black business mecca with, you know, [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] George Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think there's another George Johnson [sic. HistoryMaker Albert W. Johnson] that had a Cadillac dealership.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And the Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company] Johnson (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Cadillac dealership Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So many--I mean--
Speaker 2: Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.] and--
Speaker 1: Soft Sheen.
Speaker 2: --the Gardners, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had the Gardners. You had like Vince Cullers' ad agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Vince.
Speaker 1: Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor].
Speaker 2: Barbara.
Speaker 1: All those (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got like a lot of, you know, black people involved in real estate, Dempsey Travis [HistoryMaker Dempsey J. Travis].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: You know, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just--it's full of black folks doing all kinds of new and exciting things in business. So did you start, you know, meeting some of the people, the black movers and shakers in business?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. I was able to do that and do--when I was in school [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], I was more observing than meeting, but I did get a chance to interact with Tom Burrell and Barbara and Vince because they were in the area that I was studying, and I joined a organization, National Association of Market Developers [National Alliance of Market Developers]. I think it's changed the name now, but NAMD was then Market Developers, so they would come and, and talk with us.
Speaker 1: So was this a student association of (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. This was a--this was the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --primary association. They--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. But they did let us become involved, and that's how I became involved in that community there.
Story_ID: 657583
Speaker 1: In 1970, I have a note here that you were--that you attended a conference and was one of the founders of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --National Black--
Speaker 2: MBA Association (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) MBA Association, right.
Speaker 2: Right, yes, yes, yes. I was the only woman there, of course, because I was the only woman in business school at that time, so there was six men and myself. We were at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. We went to--went over there, and we started the national MBA association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Now, what about--so this organization is still--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's big now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a powerful organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's--yeah, it's big now. But there were just the seven of us when we started, yeah.
Speaker 1: And these seven were from all, all over the country?
Speaker 2: No, we were--
Speaker 1: Were just from--
Speaker 2: --from Northwestern [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] and University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just the two--from the two schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was a local Chicago [Illinois] conference for the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it wasn't even a conference. It was just a meeting. It was just, just a meeting at, at University of Chicago. We talked about we really ought to have a student organization, so let's make it the National Black MBA Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was the purpose of the organization? I mean, you know, the standard goal?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted to let people know more about--especially other students, undergraduate students, know about the opportunity, and then to provide some mentorship for the people who were coming in because we knew how much the mentorship of the people before us meant to us, so those were the two major things, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: I was just thinking one of the other members was a guy named Jim Hill [HistoryMaker James Hill, Jr.] who had an accounting--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, accounting company [Hill, Taylor and Company] in, in Chicago, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah. We interviewed him in 2002 [sic. 2003].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, he was a classmate of my brother's at Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Okay, business--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But account- yeah. He has a huge accounting firm.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, yes, he sold it by the way.
Speaker 1: James Hill, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Did he talk about the Black MBA? You can't remember all of these people.
Speaker 1: I, I believe he did.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm sure he did or--
Speaker 2: About being a founder of the black MBA association?
Speaker 1: I'm sure he did (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause every time I see him, he reminds me of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 657584
Speaker 1: Now, what about the Chicago minority purchasing council [Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that something later, much later than--
Speaker 2: Yeah. That was later after--I--yeah, I had started my business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] then.
Speaker 1: Okay. We won't worry--
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: --about that right now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But, now, one of your classmates that, that you've consulted with, you know, subsequently is Chuck Curry [Charles H. Curry], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right. Well, tell us about him because he pops up, you know, all through the history of--
Speaker 2: Well, there are two Chuck Currys, was one--I'm not sure which of the ones that--
Speaker 1: This is like the--he was at Northwestern [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] around the same time as you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, so, yeah. Chuck is deceased, you know. Don't know whether you know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, I didn't--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Yeah. Chuck was a good friend, and a coworker in, in several instances. He worked--of course, he went to Northwestern with me. He was--the year--he was in that class a year ahead of me, and, and then Chuck worked with me at Quaker [Quaker Oats Company] for a while, then he became head of Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois]. You're--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. So he was at Burrell for some number of years, and then went out west in, into the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area and worked with an insurance company. A, a great person, very spiritual person and an activist in a quiet way. He encouraged people to be politically active and socially active, but he never really took a high profile role in that regard.
Speaker 1: I know I was reading online that he founded a--there was a not for profit he founded in L.A.--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --to mentor youth and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --among other things.
Speaker 2: Yes. And then his daughter still maintains that, Carrie, Kelly, Carrie [sic. Kelly Curry]. Something about love [Living Love Foundation, Inc.]. I can't remember the foundation's name.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Okay. So these connections made at--how, how many black students were at Northwestern with you? Was you--you said it was you and six fellas founded the organization [National Black MBA Association].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were these all the M.B.A. students in Chicago [Illinois] at the time--
Speaker 2: No, there were more.
Speaker 1: --the, the seven of you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. There were--at Northwestern, there was--they were, oh, I think about probably fourteen there because there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --were probably seven in each of our two classes, and then there was a class that came behind us as well. I remember that. Well, that's the one where all those twenty people came in. Yeah, so during that time, there were probably thirty, thirty African American M.B.A.'s between Northwestern and University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So did, did most of the students, you know, network with each other over the years and--
Speaker 2: To, to some extent. Perhaps as much as I, and of the fourteen that were at Northwestern, I'm still in touch with maybe five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there was not a lot of networking, professional networking, going on or social networking for the long term. That has not been going on all this--all these years. That's been some years ago now, you have to recall, Larry [Larry Crowe] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 657585
Speaker 1: I think I di- I did ask you if there were in particular mentors or professors that stand out--that stood out at Kellogg school of business [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], but you said--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --no.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they--we've heard, you know, bad stories--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --about, you know, all kinds of--well, different kinds of graduate schools from graduate schools of physics to history, anyway, where, you know, administration really were worse than indifferent. They actually made things tougher for you. Is--what was Kellogg like? Were they--if, if not, you know, mentors, did they--I mean, were they helpful? I mean, or were they--was it tough to kind of connect with them or what?
Speaker 2: I didn't find it particularly difficult, really. I thought they were as helpful as--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I would have expected them to be, as--and they weren't a big factor. Administration was just not a big factor in my matriculation at Ho- at Northwestern. It was, it was pretty, pretty much stay focused on get the-- getting the work done, and we did work together. The black students did work together while we were there, very closely, to help each other, so our focus was on getting this degree and getting it done.
Speaker 1: About the business, right, yes.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: The business of getting a degree in business.
Speaker 2: Exactly (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Story_ID: 657586
Speaker 1: You were finished in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you were the first, as, as you said before, the first African American woman to graduate from the Northwestern Kellogg school of business [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, so you have this M.B.A., and you were hired by Quaker Oats [Quaker Oats Company]. Now, did they recruit you, or did you go seek employment at Quaker Oats?
Speaker 2: Yes. They recruited, they did recruit me. I had several job offers when I graduated, and I had to make a decision between whether I wanted to go to an advertising agency or go to a company, and Frank Mingo [Frank L. Mingo]--I don't know if you remember Frank Ming- you remember Frank Mingo? So Frank Mingo was desperately trying to get me to go to an advertising agency, and--but when I found out that the advertising agencies were the clients of the companies, then I decided that I would rather be on the company side, the corporate side, rather than the agency side.
Speaker 1: It does seem like a more powerful position--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to be in.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, so, so you were hired, and you, you became like a brand manager for Quaker Oats.
Speaker 2: Yes. I started off as a marketing assistant, and then when I left, I was a product group manager, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, what does that--explain to us what that means.
Speaker 2: One runs a brand or a franchise as though they are an entrepreneur because they are responsible for all aspects of the, the brand; supervising it, as opposed to actually having to do anything, supervising the creative people and the manufacturing folk and the sales folk as it relates to their brand, their particular brand; developing the strategy, and the long term and, and short term execution plans and then managing the execution of those plans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I--
Speaker 1: So what particular brands did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did I work on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As a marketing assistant, my first assignment was on Captain Crunch [Cap'n Crunch], so I worked on Captain, Captain Crunch as a marketing assistant, and then when I was promoted to brand manager, I managed the Quaker Oats franchise. And I, I remember at the time, Robert Stuart [Robert D. Stuart, Jr.] was the president of Quaker Oats, and the Stuart family had some long connections with Quaker Oats. I don't know whether they were founders, but they--very long connections, and one of the sons was also a brand manager at the time, and I remember his saying that his grandfather would turn over in his grave if he knew that a black woman was managing the Quaker Oats business (laughter) 'cause we had that kind of relationship. Jim Stuart [James Stuart] was his name.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I wonder, you know, I, I suspect then that--well, I don't know if any Quakers were actually involved in the founding--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of Quaker Oats. They were all--well, several Quakers were outstanding abolitionists back in the slavery days. It's interesting. I--you know, which made--as a, as a student of history as a young man, I, I embraced Quaker Oats because of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of that (laughter).
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, as I recall, Quaker Oats dealt with Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor] in terms of advertising and the marketing.
Speaker 2: We, we did do some work with them, but most of the Quaker Oats brands were managed--had agencies that were majority white agencies. We did some work with Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] and some work with, with Barbara. I don't know if Vince [Vince Cullers] ever did anything with us, unh-uh. Yeah, yes. So--but I did not work with them. We had an internal advertising agency, too, Grey Advertising [Grey Advertising, Inc., New York, New York], so most of that was--most of my interaction was with the internal agency.
Story_ID: 657587
Speaker 1: And would you--how--now how did you--were, were you able to--well, how much of your job had anything to do with, you know, marketing the products to the black community specifically?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did connect with the black community only because I had an interest there and did some outreach to the community, and that's why I knew all of the African American advertising agencies. I worked very hard to get agencies both advertising and promote and marketing research agencies at that time. I didn't know of any black promotion agencies, but marketing research, yes. Tried to get them contracts with Quaker Oats Company. I brought them in and introduced them to the powers that be who could make those decisions, and whenever I was able to make a decision that would enable me to work with a black supplier, I did that, so I was quite aware of the need to, to bring more blacks into the marketing world, to the--
Speaker 1: Were they working with any black or, or contractors before you started?
Speaker 2: Probably not. Probably not, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I would guess. Just--
Speaker 2: That's what I would guess at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I figured I would ask.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you ever criticized for, for bringing in too many black people?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, never was. I, I think it was quite a fascination for them. We brought groups in to, to do things with us, and, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good because there's some many times I hear the story that someone gets into a position to hire black contractors that have never been involved before in, in the--that--in a particular business, and then they criticize for you're, you're only, you know, you're trying to make our organization--make all the contractors black and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah. No. It wasn't that.
Speaker 1: But, but you never did get that.
Speaker 2: Never that problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis who started UniWorld advertising agency [UniWorld Group, Inc.] recently had a tribute to him in New York [New York] and invited us to come and speak at--to be one of those people who talked about him. And, oh, he always credits me with saving his agency, and that can't be so, but he credits me with that. He says that his agency was on the skids, and we came to Quaker Oats Company. And I was able to help them get a major contract to do a black soap opera ['Sounds of the City'], as a matter of fact, that was what they had proposed, and that contract he maintained saved his agency. He was able to go on and build from there, and so I'm always pleased about that.
Speaker 1: Right. Well, that's, you know, heretofore, and I guess, prior to '68 [1968] or so, there were very few blacks in business that had--that got any contracts from major corporations.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: For any reason, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so this is, this is all ground breaking at this time, so Byron Lewis, okay.
Story_ID: 657588
Speaker 1: Now you were at Quaker Oats [Quaker Oats Company] from '71 [1971] to '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you, what, what would you consider the highlight or some, some of the highlights of your, you know, work at Quaker?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Well, I--the introduction of many of the brands that I was involved with or led the introduction for. Quaker Oats Natural Cereal [Quaker Oats 100% Natural Cereal] was one of the brands that my team introduced. We introduced Instant Grits [Quaker Oats Instant Grits], and we introduced several flavors of instant oatmeal, introduced Captain Crunch Crunch Berries [Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries]. That was (laughter), that was one of our, our team did that, so those were really the highlights when we were introducing those brands. I considered one of my key mentors in my entire career to be Bill Smithburg, William Smithburg [William D. Smithburg] who was chairman and CEO of Quaker Oats of many years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bill graduated from Northwestern [Graduate School of Management; Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], so he was particularly interested in bringing in Northwestern grads and mentoring them, and I fell in that category, so he was a great mentor for me.
Speaker 1: How did Quaker do in terms of black employees? I mean, did--in those days--did they have a significant percentage of--
Speaker 2: I think they did about as well as the average corporation in that time. They weren't outstanding, but neither were they under par because there were quite a few blacks as--within that seven year period that came into the business, and that--at a level that was quasi-management if not management. We had, oh, I, I can only recall one other black woman coming into the marketing management arena during the time that I was there, but there were quite a few black men that did come in, so I think we were as good as the average company.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. All right. All right. And so, so in this--these--this seven years that you're there, were, were you the highest ranking African American employee?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Story_ID: 657589
Speaker 1: You left in '78 [1978]. What, what was your thinking as you were approaching that?
Speaker 2: Left to start my own business, and Quaker [Quaker Oats Company] was my first client and gave me the chair that I still use today, the chair and the desk, and so it's, ooh, it's been a while, so, yeah. And, as you mentioned, we've got--we had so many outstanding African American entrepreneurs in Chicago [Illinois] that it was easy to see that you could do it, too. That was grand. So I left and, and started, at that time it was called, oh, something else, but, anyway, it evolved--the company evolved into Segmented Marketing Services [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so you're thinking at the time, was it--at the time, it was like, why not you? Why, why not start your own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --business.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was looking for a way to, to build a business, and I wasn't anticipating a big business. I just wanted to have one that would support my modest lifestyle and to give me the freedom to, to do some things that I would like to do without having the restrictions and regulations and to employ other black people. That was a big goal of mine, to be able to provide some employment for other black people.
Story_ID: 657590
Speaker 1: Quaker Oats [Quaker Oats Company], you left Quaker Oats in '78 [1978] to form Segmented Marketing Services, Incorporated [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there an acronym for that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: SMSi.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So you don't have a SMSi or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, just SMSi (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) SMSi. Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And so Quaker was your first client.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You said. You know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my first client.
Speaker 1: --you kind of left with the blessing of the Quaker Oats people.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes. I was--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --grateful for that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so were you encouraged by your mentor, Bill Smithburg [William D. Smithburg]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to do this?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. He didn't encourage me to do it, but he was supportive of my doing so. Yeah, so that was excellent.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, now, what does the--what does SMSi mean? Segmented marketing services? I've, I've heard, you know, hearing about it. I don't know what it means, you know, but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. It means that we're going to be focusing on various sub segments of the general population, so that we're talking about marketing to groups that are well defined and not the masses.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: So, segmented marketing services.
Speaker 1: So almost like niche marketing services (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Niche, uh-huh, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay. All right. So, so, for instance, then, Quaker then, what--well--what did you do for Quaker when you--as your first client?
Speaker 2: I did what our base service was, and that's distributed free product samples, and that's--grits brand was one of the things that we--that was the first targeted marketing effort that they did with the grits brand. We distributed Instant Grits [Quaker Oats Instant Grits] to--our first effort was to put together a gift bag of various brands, and then distribute it to opinion leaders in the African American community, and we were going to reach opinion leaders as if--that we did reach opinion leaders by going to national association conventions; the National Association of Market Developers [National Alliance of Market Developers] and the, and the Urban League [National Urban League], NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. As a matter of fact, my father [Robert Miller] and I went to fifteen conventions and distributed a hundred thousand gift bags of Quaker Oats products and other brands ourselves (laughter). That's when we knew there must be a better way to do this.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is--so convention goers when they go to a convention, they--during this era, and they, they saw the SMSi table--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you would have the samples (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Quaker and other--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --clients.
Speaker 2: Yes. And a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --gift bag, and we would hand them to them and tell them to please try these brands. They're supporting our community and we would like to support them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That was our first thing, and, and brainstorming about how we could do this broader and easier, we decided that--to develop a network of churches.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Cause going to conventions is really labor intensive, right? In terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Labor in--
Speaker 1: --time intensive.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, labor and time intensive, and--
Speaker 1: How far--
Speaker 2: --that's--
Speaker 1: --did you range, all over the country?
Speaker 2: All over the country.
Speaker 1: Where--
Speaker 2: Wherever they were, we went, so.
Speaker 1: So whenever w- there were national conventions where African Americans who were educators or professionals would gather.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: Or community leaders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like we went to a lot of lodge conventions, Masonic conventions or people who were, you know, grassroots leaders in their community, so we distributed those samples like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you started thinking about the church network (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the church as a, as a way of distributing samples, and so we broadened our reach to include--at first, it was the fir- the top ten African American markets based on population, and we identified managers in each of those markets to go out and organize or recruit the churches to become, to become a part of our outreach networks, and so now we got ten thousand churches and managers in thirty-five markets, but that was the base, those first ten markets. And these were--we recruited people who were friends and relatives and associates, people that we knew, and that's still our basic recruitment approach, outreaching and, and hiring people that are friends of friends, people that we know, for the most part that has been, been our track record, so we did that, and we went out and we did those--after we did those convention, we started to develop gift bags for broader reach, more penetration in an individual market as opposed to opinion leaders. We were looking to penetrate the--each market in which we went, and so that meant more local executions than reaching national people.
Story_ID: 657591
Speaker 1: Something almost got away f- away from me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --was that fact that your father [Robert Miller] was helping you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at these conventions.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a--your overall philosophy on the micro level, you're, you're doing with your--so your--the first--one of your first business associates, associates, is your father.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was one of the very first, and he traveled to--with me to many of those conventions, and he was right out there giving those samples. He was the best sampling person you would ever want to meet 'cause he, he would--he was interacting with the people and enjoying it, and they enjoying him.
Speaker 1: Now, was he excited about the, the fact that you started your own business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Very excited, yeah, yeah, yeah, so. Everybody around was. My whole family, my sister [Camille Miller Allen], and my mother [Luther Hill Miller], and nephews, they were all quite excited about it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did anybody ever tell you, "You got a good job [at Quaker Oats Company]. What are you doing"--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --"leaving this good job to," you know--
Speaker 2: Nobody that ever mattered (laughter). Yeah. We heard it once in a while, once or twice, but not from the people that mattered to me.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think it was important your father was really--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) excited about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was, too.
Story_ID: 657592
Speaker 1: All right, so you're changing your strategies, your strategy for outreach to, you know, the community. When did you found Urban Call?
Speaker 2: Now, that's Lafayette's [Jones' husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he really was the founder of the Urban Call publishing [SMSi-Urban Call Marketing, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: So we better ask him.
Speaker 2: We better ask him (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right. Did, did SMSi [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] found any kind of inter- organ for outreach, you know, like a newsletter or--
Speaker 2: No. Urban Call--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --has been it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No. We did not have one prior to his founding it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So Urban Call is founded much later--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear). Okay. But during this period of time--well, in 1978, so, well, you know, I guess, I don't know what order they came, but you were dealing with Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company] at some point.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Procter and Gamble, it took us five years to get Procter and Gamble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we started in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Well, who, who came in after Quaker [Quaker Oats Company]?
Speaker 2: Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company, Revlon [Revlon, Inc.]. Who else was in that initial gift bag? Brown and Williamson, Revlon, Quaker, oh, I can't remember who else was in there, but I know there was--
Speaker 1: Warner-Lambert [Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company], were they in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Warner-Lambert.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You got it.
Speaker 1: Well, we have some notes here, but I'm not sure--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what same first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what came first.
Speaker 1: Was, was Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.] or General Mills [General Mills Inc.] or--
Speaker 2: Oh, not in any food gift bag.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it was category exclusive, so if Quaker--
Speaker 1: The post office [U.S. Postal Service], were they involved?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --involved in that. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So Warner--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Lambert was one of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So how did things pro- progress then over the years, did you--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Like all businesses, they were ups and downs, and but it was going, in the end going forward, moving forward. After we did the first gift bag, then we did a couple of others, gift bags like that, as we started to build our networks, and then we started working very heavily in, in the tobacco industry, because there was a need at that time to do some outreach with the tobacco industry, and so we worked with the tobacco industry a lot, and at the same time, though, we were building our business with Procter and Gamble. We did a tremendous amount of business distributing product samples for Procter and Gamble.
Story_ID: 657593
Speaker 1: As the business progressed, it became obvious that we would like to be able to--let's see--when did--Lafayette [Jones' husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] joined our business, our businesses were put together. He had his own business [Smith, Jones and Associates]. I had my own business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina], so about 19--oh, 1989 or 19--around that period of time, we put our businesses together, and--
Speaker 2: When did you first meet Lafayette?
Speaker 1: I met him when I was in--let me see. If we were married in '86 [1986] probably in 1980 because I was doing recruitment for Johnson Products Company, and he was working out at Hunt Wesson [Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.]. They asked me to find someone to be vice president of marketing and sales, and they were looking for top marketing people across the country, and Lafayette was it, so he--I met them then, that's when I met him and worked for him as a consultant at Johnson Products Company for a while. Later even after a good while, four or five years later, we started to date. That was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --our transition.
Speaker 2: So you say you got married in 1986.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, got married in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --eighty-six [1986]. Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so Urban Call was a magazine that he had already started.
Speaker 1: No. He started it after we had put our businesses together. This--so this was--I don't know when Urban Call was started. Probably '93 [1993] or '4 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so--yeah.
Speaker 2: Three [1993] or '4 [1994], all right. So was it easy to, to put your businesses together, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, nothing is easy (laughter). But, but it was so worthwhile. It was certainly worthwhile, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. I just--you know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So what were the--I mean, or what, what were the major challenges of trying to mesh to businesses together?
Speaker 1: I think to--blending our management styles. We have different management styles and different approaches, so to blend those was--it was a challenge, but we had to focus on generating clients and revenue and meeting payroll, so that had to--all those things, any complications there, had to take a second seat to our primary objectives and needs, is--which was running the business, so it wasn't so difficult knowing that we had to focus on--
Story_ID: 657594
Speaker 1: So you were both [Jones and her husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] in Chicago [Illinois] when--in the early '80s [1980s] when the black community, you know, exercised its greatest political control ever over the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --City of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yes, when--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Harold Washington was (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so it seems ironic to me that Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] who was being shepherded to Illinois Bell [Illinois Bell Telephone Company] by Vince Cullers basically, is the person that kind of launches the search for a black mayoral candidate into gear.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So if it wasn't for the black ad agencies (laughter), we probably wouldn't be on air, and then we wouldn't have this call (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --on the black radio stations for, you know, every day, twice a day--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for a black mayoral candidate.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I thought that was--it was fascinating. I was really--we were very heavily involved in, in that whole process of helping Harold to get elected, and he appointed me to be on the board of the McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois] as a result of the efforts that we made.
Speaker 1: It was a tremendous effort made by the black business community in the Chicago to elect Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From Ed Gardner [HistoryMaker Edward Gardner], you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who funded the big voter registration campaign.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: To--I mean, but there were--there was a lot of people that played a role. What, what role did, did S, SM--
Speaker 2: SMSi [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --SMSi play?
Speaker 1: Yeah, play.
Speaker 2: Well, we did some outreach to the black community at that time using our networks of churches and organizations. We couldn't be--because the churches could not be politically vocal, but they could certainly be vocal about voter registration, so we helped, helped Mr. Gardner who was one of our first clients. He--Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.] was a big client of ours. We helped in that whole process of trying to get people registered. I was in the streets, actually, and knocking on doors during that time period, so--
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's been--do, do you have an assessment of what it was like doing business as a black entrepreneur prior to when Harold Washington was elected as opposed to afterwards?
Speaker 2: Well, for me, there was no change because the corporations--most of my corporations are not--our, our clients were not based in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know. (Unclear) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--but just in general, I, I know that there was a tremendous improvement in African American business during that time for those who had a connection or had a service that could be sold to the city 'cause I know the Washington administration did a lot to try to increase black business as far as their municipal capacities would allow them to, so I could see that happening.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I know. I was gonna say that--
Speaker 2: A lot of good stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) his administration tried to make the process for--of minority contractors' process for, you know, getting a contract more fair than it ever--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --had been before.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. And I know a lot of people in construction did quite well as a result of the changes that he made, but for our business it was no impact.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did the, did his mayoralty like raise the profile of the black community in the eyes of some of the--of your clients? Did it, you think?
Speaker 2: I don't think they were thinking about it at all, not my clients.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so, yeah. If they were based in Chicago like Quaker Oats Company, then it certainly may have had some social impact on them but not in general.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Cause I was wondering if they, you know, if they would, some of those businesses would start thinking about the black community in a different kind, kind of way, you know, once there was a black mayor (unclear). I mean, the--and with--you know, along with Harold Washington, came a number of black professionals and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --high profile administrators and--that hadn't been in the public light before.
Speaker 2: You're right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, people didn't know about some of the--I mean, and then some of the stories of some of the--some, some of the--so some of their stories about a person like Gray- [HistoryMaker] Grayson Mitchell, or, or, you know, I mean, they, they were unknown--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --before he became mayor.
Speaker 2: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 1: So I just wondered if--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell the--these corporate managers didn't care. It didn't, didn't matter, and this--just another consumer, so, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 657595
Speaker 1: I believe there was a, like a small recession in the early '80s [1980s] around the country when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was president in his early first term. I think--did that impact your business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] in--
Speaker 2: We were so small and continue to be that the broader economic environment didn't impact us tremendously, so, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you look back at this early period, were there any--what was the--what client were you most excited to attract?
Speaker 2: Qua- Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company]. That was the ultimate client that I was so excited about being able to work with, and it was a client that really was our major client for many, many years, so working with Procter was really the highlight of our executions during that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is that because of the size of the--or their--
Speaker 2: Yes, because of their size and because of the spending level that they had, and the brands, and so many of the brands skewed high toward the black community, so it was really an opportunity to, to give free products from the Procter and Gamble to our community and--at no cost to them, and, and so we were doing good for the community as well as for the company.
Speaker 1: Now, if I know anything about the black community, people like free things.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, uh-huh, and we get so few free products in the mail as most general market people--to lots of people; especially, in big cities where we live in housing developments, and large apartment buildings where the delivery is not likely, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we're there to provide.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any rivals?
Speaker 2: Not really. The--there were major sample distribution companies like Donnelly [R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, Chicago, Illinois] and--who was based in Chicago [Illinois] and some others, but they weren't focusing specifically on African Americans, and then the advertising agencies did promotions, too, but, again, samp- for sampling, there was not specific rivals focusing on African Americans at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So no African American company popped up to try to do the same thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, there are lots of local companies that do it now and popped up doing the same thing, but they didn't have the national reach and capacity. They would do it within their own local cities generally.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what, what--how many employees did you have to hire--I mean, to handle a company like Procter and Gamble?
Speaker 2: We hired people on a project by project basis because we could not afford to maintain this big staff all the time, and we were averaging like fifteen hundred to seventeen hundred folk doing something at some time during the year. That's how many 1090s or 1099s [1099-S] or whatever it was (laughter) that we were distributing because I remember that so well in order to, to get those executions done.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a lot of people.
Speaker 1: --in the course of a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: And they, they would be doing everything from like--
Speaker 2: From collating the product to driving the product from place to place, to doing telemarketing, to letting the people know that, that the products are coming and managing all of that operation, so to get that done in twenty cities, it takes a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you have to maintain an office in twenty different cities?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. Our managers worked at home, and we had our offices in, in Chicago, and maybe at one or two other cities, they had some kind of office facility, but for the most part, it was everybody works at home as they do now, yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay. So the magazine publishing really begins when [HistoryMaker] Lafayette Jones kind of comes on the scene.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did that enhance your--
Speaker 2: Oh, tremendously, yes, 'cause lots of people did not have samples to distribute, but they have messages to distribute, and it started to kind of change our focus from just consumer packaged goods companies to a broader base of clients, and it--people could have custom publications instead of samples now, and that made a big difference.
Story_ID: 657596
Speaker 1: You've been involved in various civic activities and boards for a long time. What are some of the ones that are--I mean are--I would suppose that being involved civically also informed your business acumen in terms of, of what's going on in the black community and what, what the trends are, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's very true. So while our clients [at Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] don't come from civic involvements for the most part, but our understanding of what's going on does, just as you say. That's so true.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have any stories about that at all?
Speaker 2: I--not in, in terms of how it enhances my understanding. But I guess my best story about my civic involvement is the two years that I just finished as chair of the YWCA here in Winston-Salem [Gateway YWCA, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I'm chairman of the board there, and I've been on the board for a while, and to be the chair of the board and after having not been able to even go to the white Y [Young Women's Christian Association] when I was growing up shows what a transition the South has made in terms of our, our development in relationships and our understanding of, of people and our need to be inclusive, so that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay. Now, you are called upon as a public speaker quite bit, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what, what's your message usually then?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes it's a message of motivation and encouragement. That's often what, what it is, telling my story and encouraging other folks to be their best, and then sometimes it's a marketing story talking about--there are three things, too. There's also--it's business--being an entrepreneur, starting a business and then running it and some of the challenges there. And then sometimes it's just about understanding when, when I'm talking to professional organizations, understanding the African American community and what is segmented marketing. Why is segmented marketing--why is it important.
Story_ID: 657597
Speaker 1: What was the toughest period of time that you went through as a business? Or was there ever a time when you, you thought you might not make it?
Speaker 2: I never thought I might not make it because I always knew that I could make it. Just like a black hairdresser, like my mother [Luther Hill Miller] was. Business might be slow, but somebody is going to need their hair done eventually (laughter). So if you just hang in there, somebody is going to come. But there have--of, of course--there have been, as I said, ups and downs, and I suspect the very toughest was when I first started my business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and nobody was coming to ask me to, to do anything for them, and I didn't understand how to, to go out and solicit clients as I do now, and so that was--it was, it was really tough. After that initial push where we had the, the first gift bag. Then what next? I--that was a very tough time.
Story_ID: 657598
Speaker 1: Tell me now, well, something you said before we broke was--you were talking about how you--your spiel to clients [at Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina], how it's improved over the years, and what, what is your message to a client today? What, what's your best message?
Speaker 2: The best one is that we have the capacity to reach over half the African American and Hispanic households in any given city with your message or your product, and we've got a track record of having done this and resulting--and, and the results being increases in sales. And that's what our clients are looking for. How can you help us increase our sales, increase our awareness and our penetration? We can do this, and we can show you that we've done it successfully for other Fortune 500 companies, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Sounds like an irresistible message to me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: If you're trying to make money, that's sounds like the way to do it.
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 657599
Speaker 1: Oh, 1999, you launched Shades of Beauty. Now that, that's--is that again Lafayette's, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Lafayette's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But--okay. And how is that different from Urban Call? Did it have the--did it focus on the cosmetology industry?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a Lafayette [Jones' husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] question, so--
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. All right (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) All that is his--all that publishing stuff is, is his area.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, then I'm going to jump way ahead, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Past the election of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and everything else to 2013--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to the founding of SMSi Health Insurance Solutions [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is an affordable health--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. When we found out that the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] was coming into existence, we knew that the message was not getting out to our community, African American community especially and Hispanic community secondarily, because we weren't hearing anything. All that we knew was what we heard on the media, and that was so often very negative, and we knew that there was--that, that having people insured was a good thing, so we had to find a way to get that message out. We wrote to the president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina], Brad Wilson [J. Bradley Wilson, Jr.], and asked him if we could come in and talk to his people about sponsoring an outreach effort, and we were able to get that done, so we went in, and we talked to Blue Cross Blue Shield about starting an outreach effort to inform African Americans throughout North Carolina about the Affordable Care Act, and although our business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina] is national, to be able to focus on North Carolina, we had to build territories that--just as though they were in some other part of the country or part of the world, so instead of our territory being the Chicago [Illinois] market, now we built a territory that was the Greensboro [North Carolina], High Point [North Carolina] market, and the Durham [North Carolina], Wake [Wake County, North Carolina] market until each one of our markets in North Carolina we treated as a separate market as opposed to just a part of the--of one whole state execution. So we built teams in each of those markets just like we have in our other cities, and these teams of people went out and developed relationships and continue to do so now with the gatekeepers in churches and community organizations; beauty salons, barbershops, to help us get the message out about the Affordable Care Act. We were able to do this. We were able to reach about a half million households in North Carolina with a message and face to face presentations to over three thousand opinion leaders, and, as a result, we were part of the movement in North Carolina that enabled us, as North Carolina, to be the fifth largest state in terms of number of people signing up for the Affordable Care Act in the nation, and by far, the largest state in the nation that did not accept Medicare [sic.]. North Carolina--the Medicare expansion that was offered as a part of the Affordable Care Act, North Carolina was one of the states that didn't accept that Medicaid expansion. South Car- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With a Republican governor [Pat McCrory] or something or--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And South Carolina, for example, right next to us, North Carolina did about 350,000 enrollments, and South Carolina did about thirty-two thousand enrollments, so you can see the difference between the efforts that were made here despite the fact that we didn't have the support of the government here and the results. One of the things that we learned as we were doing our executions is that there just are not enough agents servicing our community to even sign up or enroll, help the people to enroll, into the Affordable Care Act, so that's why we decided to start an agency, and that's SMSi Health Insurance Solutions, so that we could; one, provide this excellent job opportunity to people in our community to be their own boss because that's what an insurance agency is, their own boss. They're an entrepreneur. And to--to develop some residual income while also being of such a significant service to the community at large.
Story_ID: 657600
Speaker 1: SMSi Health Insurance Solutions [Winston-Salem, North Carolina] is now an agency that's, that's growing. We've got about fifteen agents now that are ready to be appointed by Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina] so they can help. And we look forward to having about twenty-five by the time open enrollment comes. And then we partner with other--in addition to people in our agency, we partner with other agencies throughout the state to assist in the enrollments and help them to identify people who need insurance, and so we're, we're feeling good about where--what we can do this year, even though last year was, was quite successful and impactful, we think we can do even better in terms of outreach and enrollment.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you also monitor the--how people feel about the, the medical services they give in the--
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, you know, they're--that the services are from Blue Cross Blue Shield or other major providers, and so they are going to the same doctors as any private insured--privately insured person, so they're getting adequate insurance. The big problem--good care. The big problem is getting that initial appointment. That seems to be a problem for everybody if you're not already a patient, and you're trying to get an appointment with a doctor, then it takes months to get that done, one to two months sometimes, as many as three, to get your initial appointment, so after you're a part, a part of the patient roll, then it's not so difficult.
Speaker 2: So you think that, that the country will stay with some version of the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010]--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) going forward?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes. You can't take this insurance away from any of these people now that they have it, and over 8 million people have insurance, many for the very first time, so I think it's--you know, it's just like Medicare, when--great opposition to it when it started, but now you, you couldn't take it away no matter what, be a big battle to make that happen, so I'm feeling quite confident that some version of it is going to continue.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. I thought that was an important question for this 'cause it's been threatened so many times.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: But, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I--but I just imagine that it's something that, you know, since everybody needs it--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --it's not--I mean, even though they think (laughter)--half the country is denouncing it, you know, people need it anyway and so--
Speaker 1: That's right, yes.
Speaker 2: All right. So, so this is a business that can only grow.
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 657601
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done to this point in business, is there anything major that you, you wish you could go back and change or do over or--
Speaker 2: I wish that I had been in the health insurance business earlier. If I understood it a little better, that's what that side--I think the biggest wish that I have. We started working in the health industry about, oh, maybe I'll say ten years ago, when our corporate mission shifted to work with clients who had a vested interest including--in improving the health of our community, and so we, we work with McNeil labs [McNeil-PPC Inc.], and help to educate people about the pros and cons of aspirin therapy, for example. And we work with Mrs. Dash to talk about the benefits of a low sodium diet, and other clients. Then we started working for Aetna insurance company [Aetna, Inc., Hartford, Connecticut] to talk about Medicare, educating people about their Medicare options and now this [SMSi Health Insurance Solutions, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], so it's very gratifying to be able to talk about things that we know are going to be beneficial, short and long term to the community.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any opportunities out there that you wish you--that you would take, take advantage of if you had, had greater capacity or something else was there?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I would have done more of what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If we had more salespeople and more, more chances to, to generate clients, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. I mean, the--
Speaker 2: More of the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are lenders enthusiastic about trying to fund, I mean, or trying to lend money to capitalize the kind of businesses that--businesses you have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. Enthusiastic, no. (Laughter) Can you convince somebody to lend you some money? Probably (laughter). I remember having an SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] loan when I first started the business [Segmented Marketing Services, Inc., Winston-Salem, North Carolina], but I think that's the only incremental funding that we've ever had. We've just kind of made do with what we were able to generate with revenue. Yeah, and a line of credit.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the SBA loan was--
Speaker 2: Was a good (unclear).
Speaker 1: --was good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Start up.
Speaker 1: But it did make the difference, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it probably made a difference at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. When I was just starting, yeah. That's, that's when we had the SBA loan during our initial business activities.

Speaker 1: Now, do you have a business philosophy?
Speaker 2: Most basically, it's like a life's philosophy, and it works espec- especially well in business. Do what you say you're going to do, period. If you're not gonna be able to do it, don't say you're gonna do it. If you say you're gonna do it, do it. And then try to deliver more to the client than they paid for. Give them that impression. If it's not true. But try to deliver more than they pay for. And then, that's it.
Story_ID: 657603
Speaker 1: And when you look back on everything you've done to this point today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think this insurance thing [SMSi Health Insurance Solutions, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] is going to be my legacy, really, yeah, because I--it's going to impact so many people. To date I would, I would say being able to help so many other folks start their businesses. I can think of at least five people now that have worked with me and have started a business of their own and are still doing well, so that's, that's what I would think would be my legacy if I, if I stopped now, but I think this insurance company thing is going to be it.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young entrepreneurs, black entrepreneurs today?
Speaker 2: Same advice everybody else: don't give up, you know (laughter). Hang in there. That's the, that's the main thing. Do your planning and try not to overcommit financially, as well as personally, overcommit your resources nor your time 'cause that prevents you from doing what you say you're gonna do, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you're overcommitted.
Speaker 1: And, okay. I got another question and I can't think of it. But in terms of credentials, does a--is a, is an M.B.A. necessary?
Speaker 2: No. There's so many entrepreneurs that don't even have an undergraduate degree or haven't even finished high school and are doing great. With--I, I say--with African Americans, you need to have all you can get, so if you do have an M.B.A., then, sure- surely it's helpful, or whatever degree, it's always helpful, but certainly not necessary, not to be successful.
Story_ID: 657605
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Sighs) My hope is that we can be even more unified than we are in many instances on a consistent basis. I hope that we can unify and, and work on issues that are, are so vital to our growth as individuals and as a group. Most important for me is education, you know, it's always been a key thing. I'm so afraid that public education is going away. Charter schools, that's the one thing that I don't agree with on, with the Obama administration [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]. I don't think the charter school concept as it is designed now because I can see the public school system suffering so much as a result of it, and not everybody can go to a charter school even if they're subsidized. Some people don't have the money to do the part that's not subsidized, so you need to have a strong education system, so that's my, that's my biggest fear and my biggest hope that the education system, the public education system, gets strengthened rather than weakened as we move forward.

Speaker 1: Now, I've been, I've been advised I need to ask you about Bridgette [Bridgette Miller Jones], and, of course--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --so we, we always ask you about your family, to tell us about your family--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and what your children are doing, so--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, Bridgette. We adopted Bridgette when she was five months old, and she's just been the delight of my life and I'm sure Lafayette's [Jones' husband, HistoryMaker Lafayette Jones] as well over this twenty-five years. She's twenty-five years old now. She's a--just a beautiful person and a great student, education is something she reveres. She's now a final year dental student. This is her last year dental school at ECU, East Carolina University. She's in the inaugural class, so she--and she's the only black woman, so she will be the first black woman to graduate from East Carolina University's dental school [East Carolina University School of Dental Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina], so she's--yeah, a delight.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't talked about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I cannot think of anything. I think you've been very thorough.
Speaker 1: All right. Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a Christian woman who loves her family and tried to make a contribution to the broader community.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you. All right.
