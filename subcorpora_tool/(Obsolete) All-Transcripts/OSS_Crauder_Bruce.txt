 Finchum Today is February the 23rd, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum, and along with me is Dr. Charles Abramson. I   m with the OSU Library, and Charles is with the Department of Psychology. Today we are in Stillwater, on campus, to speak with Dr. Bruce Crauder, who is the Associate Dean for Arts and Sciences as well as professor of mathematics. Thank you for letting us visit with you today.  Crauder Thank you.  Finchum Let   s begin with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Crauder I was born July 20, 1954, in Beirut, Lebanon.  Finchum Is there a story there?  Crauder Well, first, the main reason I was born there was because my mother was there at the time. That was the main consideration. (Laughs) No, my dad worked for the UN. Until I was about four or five, we were in the Middle East, and they were in Beirut for most of that time.  Finchum Then when you came back, where did you grow up basically?  Crauder Well, I don   t know about the growing up part, but I spent until fifth grade near West Chester, Pennsylvania. That   s just west of Philadelphia, and then from fifth grade through high school in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which is just a small college town.  Finchum What was your father doing there?  Crauder My father was working at Wilberforce University, which was the oldest historically black school in the United States. 5  Finchum What did he teach, or did he teach?  Crauder He was doing business management. He was the Joe Weaver of a very small school. (Laughs)  Finchum Some math, maybe where you got your math?  Crauder No idea, no idea.  Finchum In high school, did you have a favorite subject?  Crauder There was math and science, mostly physics.  Finchum What year would you have graduated from high school?  Crauder Nineteen seventy-two.  Finchum Was it Yellow Springs High School or called something     Crauder Yellow Springs High School. Maybe it was called Yellow Springs Public High School, I   m not sure. It was the only one in Yellow Springs, though.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Crauder I have a sister, a younger sister, two years younger.  Finchum Once you finished high school, what did you do?  Crauder I finished high school. I went to college. I went to Haverford College, which is a small liberal arts school in the Philadelphia Main Line.  Finchum How did you choose there?  Crauder I was looking for small schools. Actually, I was looking for a number of possible schools. I was looking at the stronger Quaker schools, which are Swarthmore and Haverford, since I   m Quaker, and Haverford just hit the right note with me.  Finchum Having been in Pennsylvania, it was a natural fit, instead of somewhere in Ohio? You had spent some time in Pennsylvania prior to Ohio?  Crauder Yeah. I would have gone somewhere else, too, yeah. It   s a nice little school. At the time, though, I remember the faculty talking about how impersonal it had become since it   d gone from 600 students to 800 students. (Laughter)  Finchum Pretty small. (Laughter) 6  Crauder A small, all-men   s college, and it became co-ed in the years since.  Finchum Did you have scholarships, or did you have to work your way through?  Crauder I had a scholarship that was given to me in my hometown, but my parents had saved so I was very lucky.  Finchum During high school, did you work part-time?  Crauder Let   s see. I was a lifeguard. I also worked in, there   s the Feth Memorial Laboratory. I did a couple projects there. They had a really interesting project where they were doing longitudinal studies, but unfortunately they had taken x-rays. They were looking at physical growth in families, and they had taken x-rays of folks, of each of their bones. We classified the bones on the film, and we   d write on the film. I have very poor handwriting. That was actually rather painful, but it was very difficult because the x-ray doses had been large enough that, in fact, there was a lot of genetic mutation and damage in subsequent generations. It was an example of, perhaps, less than careful science or perhaps unintended consequences. You got to sort of see the inside of science with human beings.  Finchum Learned a little bit more than you expected.  Crauder I did, I did. I also learned that if your handwriting is bad enough and your job is to have good handwriting, it   s not a good fit and you get in trouble on the job. That happened.  Finchum Well, besides school and work, what did you do for fun back in those days?  Crauder I spent most of my time out in the woods. There was a wonderful nature preserve, and I used to take long walks in the woods or just spend a lot of time observing pond life and just sitting, sitting quietly in the woods.  Finchum Pondering     Crauder Pondering things, yeah, just being out in the woods.  Finchum While you were at Haverford, were you aware of Phi Beta Kappa?  Crauder Vaguely.  Finchum Did they have a chapter?  Crauder They did. Oh yeah, they have an old chapter. There   s an odd story with this. This is at least my understanding of the story, which is that my good friend Bill Gouda, who was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa the beginning of his 7  junior year I think, approached me about being a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and I wanted nothing to do with some sort of elitist, Greek-type organization. I said,    I don   t think so.    Many years later, when I was here, I contacted Haverford to say,    By the way, I made a really juvenile mistake. I   m thinking better of this and was just wondering if you had any records that would back this up,    and they had none. They said,    You   ve done fine work at Haverford, but we don   t base things just based on grades and courses taken but also on interviews and so on.     There was no official records of my having been nominated or anything. I have a nice little letter from them, but that was my exposure to Phi Beta Kappa at the time, which was that I thought it was some sort of an elitist thing that one wouldn   t want to be part of, but you have to remember, also, this was the early    70s. I had purposely gone to a school that did not have fraternities and certainly no sororities. It was a men   s school. It had no fraternities, and I thought that fraternities would be a very bad thing because they separate out people and they create a different culture. That was just a different time, and also I was young and immature. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, while you were there, were you involved with any activities outside of the classroom?  Crauder Oh sure, yeah. I did theatre work, doing a lot of set building and set designing. I did a lot of folk dancing, an awful lot of that, probably five nights a week. What other things did I do? I was a busy kid. I was thrilled to be at a place where I could do all sorts of things. I read all of Hawthorne and all of Poe my first year, because I was so happy to be at a place   It had a library that had all these books, and I was going to work my way through.  I remember being very excited on the Poe books because some of these were, not first editions but close to it. They had the wonderful leather bindings and so on, but on some of them I had to cut the pages because no one had actually ever read this particular one before. I was thrilled to be able to have that and also because I could stay up at night and read as late as I wanted, which was something. I   d always had to hide with a flashlight under the covers in high school because, for some reason, my parents thought I should get more sleep. (Laughs)  I was so happy to be in college. I could stay up as late as I wanted, read as much as I wanted. I read the things I wanted to read. It was great.  Finchum What was your major there?  Crauder Mathematics.  Finchum You graduated from there in    8  Crauder Seventy-six.  Finchum Then what did you do?  Crauder Then I went to Columbia University...  Finchum    for a master   s in   .  Crauder Well, you sort of get a master   s on the way. If you   re applying for a master   s, they won   t accept you. You apply for a PhD and get a master   s along the way.  Finchum From a small school to a rather large one.  Crauder Rather large school. I remember that the classes were, of course, larger than my classes as an undergraduate, my graduate classes. Also I noticed quickly that I was not the smartest person in the room, which, I mean, previously, obviously faculty excepted, I wasn   t necessarily the smartest person at Haverford, but I sort of felt I might be. I knew that not to be true when I got to Columbia, and that was a really important thing to realize, that there were people who were amazingly bright.  Finchum Made better on tests than you?  Crauder Oh, no, just plain smarter. Their brains just worked just that much better. They had wonderful backgrounds, and often, annoyingly, they were actually really nice people, too. You couldn   t go and say    Well, yeah. They   re really bright, but   .    There was often no    but.    That was an important thing to learn.  Finchum Well, did you spend much time in the library there?  Crauder No. Well, there was a separate math library in the math building. I spent time there, but at that point in graduate school, that was the first time I really had to study. Also there were many topics that didn   t just have some nice, modern textbook in it, that you had to plow through lots of things in order to find the information you needed. I spent a lot of time in that separate math library. It was a wonderful library, but of course the Columbia, the library, I   m pretty sure it had closed stacks then. It was not so interesting because I just love browsing in general, browsing in libraries, bookstores, and so on, but the separate math library was wonderful.  Finchum You didn   t have as much leisure time there, either, it sounds like.  Crauder I found leisure time, but it wasn   t as much, yeah. 9  Finchum You graduated from there with your PhD when?  Crauder That would be in    81. Yeah, 1981.  Finchum Then what did you do?  Crauder I had a post-doc position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. It was a wonderful year because it was a year for people in my field, which was algebraic geometry. Anyone who was everyone, I mean, all these people were there who were really quite amazing, and there was a group of us young folks who we got to know each other. We wrote a book together. Well, it   s really a collection of articles with a lot of,    This person   s working with this one.    We had a lot of collaborations, and in math since most articles are written by only one person, these sort of collaborations are just something really quite special.  Finchum Then from there?  Crauder Then from there I went to the University of Utah. I had a four-year post-doc, and I interrupted that in the middle with a year at the University of Pennsylvania, because it was just a nice opportunity.  Finchum I should back up. Along the way, did you get married at some point?  Crauder I did get married in 1982.  Finchum After you finished your PhD?  Crauder Oh yeah, yeah. I think my mom had made it very clear that you should not marry until you   ve finished your education.  Finchum You always listen to Mom.  Crauder Well, I did then. (Laughs)  Finchum Even under the covers. (Laughter) Well, then take us how you came to be here at OSU.  Crauder Well, when I was leaving Utah, I was looking for jobs. I was looking for tenure-track jobs. I was looking for places in smaller towns. I   d lived in New York. I   d done New York City. Salt Lake is a small city, but I was looking for universities in smaller places. I was looking for really good math departments, and OSU has a really quite outstanding math department and the way that they approached hiring. Frankly,  William     Bus    Jaco, who   s now the department head, was then the department head. There was a time 10  in between when he wasn   t. He just had a way of approaching hiring and the role of faculty that was really quite intriguing.  I was looking for places where they would have   for example, at Columbia there were seminars, maybe four or five seminars a week. These weren   t credit things. These were for graduate students and faculty to go, and they   d invite speakers in or someone would talk about their own research. This is what I was used to. At Utah, they had that. At Penn, they had that, but I noticed some other schools that I applied to would have a weekly seminar and that   s it and just have one invited speaker instead of having many. Here, there were four or five seminars. It had the feel of the same type of schools that I was used to, which were very research intensive and where you didn   t stop learning just because you were now off doing your own research. You were still learning in community.  Finchum That was in 1980     Crauder Eighty-six, I came here.  Finchum Thirty years.  Crauder Thirty years, that   s right.  Finchum Was there other competition at the time?  Crauder Yeah, there were some other schools.  Finchum OSU won out for that particular reason?  Crauder Actually, yeah. I was really pleased that I had a choice, not because I was thinking of going to someplace else but because it made it easier to say,    I   m here. I   ve chosen this among other choices.     Finchum Campus was pretty nice at that point, or different     Crauder Didn   t really notice the campus, didn   t really care about the campus. I cared about the type of university, because I wanted a university where I could make a difference, and some of the other schools were a little more elite. I felt like anyone could do those jobs, and I didn   t need to do that. I like the fact that I live about a mile from the math department and I could go into work anytime. In other words, it was easy to do research. It was a great group of people, and it was, to my mind, a very nice teaching environment.  Finchum Where was your first office?  11  Crauder First office was on the fourth floor of Math Sciences, but I don   t remember the number. I don   t remember numbers very well. That may seem funny. I can tell you exactly how to get to the office. I   m a geometer. You remember that. What   s my office number? I don   t know. How would I know that? I know how to get there. (Laughs)  Finchum That building is still standing, too.  Crauder It is, yeah.  Finchum Well, then take us through your career here at OSU or your thirty years, just hitting the highlights.  Crauder Well, let   s see. I left for a half-year to go to UNC-Chapel Hill because, basically, I was invited to go. It was just a nice opportunity, and that was nice. I think my kids were really small then. It   s a good school, good environment, and I had good colleagues, particularly at Duke just right around the corner. That was good. I took a sabbatical for a year at Colorado State University to work with a really great colleague there, who   s actually now the provost at Colorado State and is just one of the smartest people I know, both smartest and wisest, which is, I suspect, why he   s provost there. I mean, he has these incredible   both people skills and just a really bright mathematician. Remember I talked about people who are brighter than you are? Yes, yeah, (laughs) and then after I came back, I guess the position of associate dean was open. I think Rick Rohrs had been in this position and was sick of it, I suspect. (Laughs) You   d have to ask him. That was 1997 that I started here as associate dean, and I   ve been in that position or interim dean since.  Finchum Any highlights? I mean, any major books or     Crauder There   re many.  Finchum    solutions to problems that no one else had solved? (Laughs)  Crauder I don   t think the solutions to problems are ones that are easy to describe, but there   s some nice textbooks that came out as we thought about different ways to engage students, because the favorite thing was to say,    You students, you can   t use calculators.    Then some of us turned this around and said,    What if you said, actually, you have to use calculators? How would you change what you   re teaching or what you are testing or how you   re testing?    When we thought about that for a long time, we realized that we could put students in a position where they could quickly learn some really nice things that would previously have been inaccessible. We were able to skip, basically, a year of college algebra and allow them to replace that with use of a calculator, to get to some really nice questions about rates of 12  change, and basically do calculus-type problems that were way more interesting and that were actually real problems instead of the artificial problems that are often presented in college algebra textbooks. That was a really, really fun project, and it got a group of us. I like working with other people.  There were three of us who worked together, and we   re still working on, I forget if it   s the fifth or the sixth edition of that textbook. Then we started writing other textbooks, and that   s been a source of a lot of joy. There   s no point in writing a textbook for the same thing, just done by you instead of somebody else, but doing something that   s really different, that embodies the way I like to teach and really allows students to engage better with the mathematics, particularly the liberal arts students who maybe really good in other areas but think they   re very bad in math. That   s a wonderful population.  I like to think of one course that we developed, which, I like to think of it as math for good poets because you want people who can think. They believe that they   re not good in mathematics, but if you tease them with certain types of questions and certain types of problems, they   re willing to put far more effort in. If you can have them just ignore all those terrible things that happened in fourth grade when they were learning fractions and so on, and have them focus on    Okay, forget all that. Let   s talk about this now.    They   re able to realize that they can say things, and they can be successful in mathematics.  Finchum Well, if you had to choose between administration and classroom, which would you choose?  Crauder Well, the classroom, but that   s misleading because I   m here in this office.  Finchum Do you teach today?  Crauder I do, not today, but I usually teach one class each semester. Just recently I started not teaching in the spring because the tenure/promotion and all these things, basically, I was not doing anything well. When you have too many things going on at once, that can happen, but that was very difficult. Last spring was the first semester that I had not taught since, I was going to say, I was on sabbatical, but actually, I taught then. I was gone for the year, and I had a reduced teaching load at Colorado State. That   s the first time I   d not taught since 1982. It was actually not pleasant to not teach, and now I   m appreciating what you can do in terms of other things that I need to do. Some of it is writing in mathematics. Some of it   s getting the job done administratively, but there   s a cost. I do love being in the classroom and I like teaching.  13  Finchum We need to get to the topic of the day.  Crauder This is a lot of background.  Finchum Well, we   ll be getting into Phi Beta Kappa. How did you get involved with this endeavor?  Crauder Okay, the Phi Beta Kappa endeavor I got into it originally administratively because, of course, Arts and Sciences is the place that captures the vast majority of the liberal arts disciplines. We were going to be applying, and I forget what year this was. Perry Gethner had been applying for many years, that is had been leading the application process for OSU. He wanted help. I think this was about three cycles before we actually got it, and there was a question of generating data. There was a tremendously painful set of data that were wanted for the application itself,    List all buildings on campus. List when they were built, out of what materials, and when they were last renovated.    I know what they were looking for.  They wanted to know if your school consisted of four double-wide trailers, but it   s painful because then I went to the buildings people and said,    Could I get a list of buildings on campus?    There are about a 1,000 buildings. This was all property owned by OSU. There   s a cow barn. There   s all sorts of things that I thought,    Well actually, those really aren   t to point.    There was going through a lot of data and finding financial data, and I was pretty good at knowing who might be able to help find information. I mean, Perry was leading this, but I was getting data is the way I remember this.  Then that continued, and I was more and more involved with trying to find the right information. I guess I insinuated myself into the process. (Laughs) That   s the way I sort of view it, because at some point I was like,    Okay. We need a cover for this thing. We need this. Who   s going to do this? How are we going to find   .    I just thought of myself as a facilitator in the process.  Finchum Each time with the previous cycles, when it didn   t work, how did you react or respond to that?  Crauder Well, I think we were kind of used to that. It was disappointing, as we realize that eleven of the schools in the Big 12, at that time, the Big 12 had twelve schools, as it ought to have instead of, I think it has ten now. I don   t really know these things. It seemed absurd that we would be, I mean it was one thing when at one time Phi Beta Kappa was basically the elite schools, the small liberal arts schools, but once they opened themselves up to the larger public universities, it seemed that we certainly had a place. I mean, there were really good advocates, such as Burns. Burns Hargis was a big advocate and was very helpful, and then we had at least one provost who 14  was very helpful, maybe two. We eventually, I think our application process became more and more refined. And I think we learned some things from the   the Phi Beta Kappa people were very encouraging. I didn   t get the sense that they wanted us to apply repeatedly and never get it.  It was tricky because there was the professional staff of Phi Beta Kappa, but those aren   t the people who actually make the decisions because they are the staff and not the deciders. We would really make the case to the staff, and there were lots of really lovely things where, for example, the application was delivered in person by Burns at least one time of the, maybe for two cycles. I   m not sure, but we were convinced that we were getting closer and closer, although it   s unclear. I mean, when you don   t get something, you do get it or you don   t get it. It   s not so clear what    close    means. You get to apply, I guess it   s once every four years or three years. I   m sorry, I can   t recall that exactly. We   d start again and try to see what possible deficiencies, if any, we could find. I don   t think we got a lot of feedback. We got some informal feedback from the staff. I seem to recall that.  Finchum Do you recall a major deficiency, a primary one?  Crauder There were the concerns   at one time Arts and Sciences was viewed as sort of very much a less-than part of the campus. We were to provide the gen-ed classes for the   that we were basically a service college for the other parts. That changed dramatically under Dean Smith Holt when he started in the early    80s, but I think there was a reservoir of ill feeling about the, well, compared to other schools, the diminished role of, particularly, the humanities. There were, I think, some faculty members who were members of Phi Beta Kappa who were unhappy with OSU and who thought that we really didn   t deserve a chapter. People are welcome to their own feelings, but that sort of thing doesn   t help in an application process.  Then I think, over time, things changed. Things changed very positively in terms of support for humanities and the arts, social sciences, basically the disciplines that are so strongly represented in Phi Beta Kappa. There was just a few of the faculty were better treated than they were at one time, and then there were things like the strength of the library, really basic things. I think the library is, for example, much stronger than it once was, and these basic questions of support, what kind of institution are you and whether the institution would value membership in Phi Beta Kappa. That required a clear demonstration at the top. Then we had, really, some wonderful people who were cheerleaders on the side. You   ve already interviewed some of them, I think.  Finchum Well, if you hadn   t got it the last time, do you think you   d have tried again?  15  Crauder That would   ve been really painful. Yeah, but it would   ve, I guess, depended on where in the process we would   ve been turned down. I remember we were getting very close, and there was a small number of schools. It was something like five or six maybe, and then all you were hoping for was that we didn   t have some scandal on campus. At least one of the schools had an on-campus scandal, something that would make the Chronicle of Higher Education and would clearly tilt things the wrong way in the eyes of the Phi Beta Kappa general assembly. I used that term, but I think that   s not the proper term. You   d just hope that everything would just go just so.  I remember having to answer at the last minute a tremendous number of questions that would,    Well, what if they ask this? What if they ask this? How would we respond to this?    and working through that. I also remember, late in that process, being asked    Well, what do you think our odds are?    I thought,    Ah, I don   t know. I don   t know.    When there are processes that are out of my control, I tend to be very cautious about suggesting that it   ll turn out positively. That   s just my nature there.  Finchum Were you involved with site visits?  Crauder Oh yes, yes, and we talked through what the schedule was. Then Gary Clark was extremely helpful, in the president   s office, just at some point when we realized,    Oh actually, we haven   t really done the groundwork that we need to for this site visit. Let   s get that in gear. Let   s arrange a really good schedule.    The president   s office has some amazing people who are really good at making things happen on campus. If you really need something,    How do we do this?    Yeah, it   s done. That was very helpful.  Finchum Well, did you travel to Florida for the time when they voted?  Crauder I did, I did. We stayed in a really fancy hotel because that   s where the meeting was, and we just waited. There was a wonderful reception where I saw the   I had a personal connection with the, I guess, then-vice president of Phi Beta Kappa whose father had been on faculty here in Religious Studies. I had worked closely with him and just a wonderful person, but there we were. You just hoped it   d all work. There was the little plane. It   s apparently very exciting and exotic to fly in these little personal planes for a short time, but flying from here to Florida on one of those, yeah, I thought,    This is actually not that great.    (Laughter) It was very effective in getting us there in short order. It was exciting. We flew down.  I vaguely remember us sitting around, there was some sort of cafeteria, some sort of little restaurant, and waiting. We had an advocate who was the, I think he was the provost at the University of Tulsa and who was a very, very nice guy and very helpful and pleasant, but he would ask,    Okay, what if they ask this?    There were tricky things because at some point, they ask 16  hard questions. They said, for example,    Your average salary for female assistant professors is less than for male assistant professors. Explain.    Actually, it   s an example of Simpson   s paradox. It   s a paradox that says you can   for example, in every department female assistant professors could be paid at or more than male assistant professors, but overall, when you aggregate the data over all of Arts and Sciences, it can be the other way around. People go,    What?    Well actually, it depends on the average pay in the disciplines. We had to explain these sort of things.  Finchum Good to have a mathematician with you?  Abramson It   s also common sense.  Crauder I was going to say. You look at physics departments and computer science departments, and then you look at English departments and art departments and what average salaries are. Then it makes complete sense, but if you just cast it in the abstract, it   s like,    What?   , which is, of course, why it   s called a paradox.  Finchum They asked these questions while you were there at the convention?  Crauder I think it was primarily our trying to be prepared for any question.  Finchum They were verbalized questions? They weren   t written ones that came back and forth?  Crauder No. Actually, they were being sent to us by email, I think, if I recall. I just remember having to type a tremendous number of answers in my phone, because I remember Burns being very impressed with my iPhone skills, which was really silly because lots of people are a lot faster than I am. (Laughter)  Abramson At the site visit, at least at our table, they asked the same questions about the salary difference. We were able to answer them pretty easily. You mentioned earlier you were gathering different types of data. Can you mention some of the people that helped you gather that? I know there was Xeroxing people. There was a whole range of support.  Crauder Oh dear, I   m trying to remember all the names because I sent thank-you things. Well, of course, every time someone gave me data, I thanked them for the data, but all the Institutional Research people, that whole office was great at providing names of faculty, for example, the comparative salary data. There were people, I think Brenna Dixon and folks, who were, I   m throwing out names that I   m not sure which go with what, but there were all sorts of areas that I didn   t know anything about like    What is our plan for continued operation in some sort of major emergency?    I thought,    What?    17  (Laughs) In fact, we have such things.    What sort of backup systems do we have for data?    That would be something about how well prepared you are as an institution. I looked at   either before or after I was at Colorado State University, there was a flood, and it flooded the library. The question is what to do with all these wet books, and the answer was they   re trucked    some place in Texas does freeze-drying, very largescale freeze-drying. They freeze-dried them all, until all the moisture sublimated away. There were questions of certain plans, and also the questions changed from cycle to cycle. We have these three-year cycles, and then they   d have slightly different questions. You   d go,    Oh, oh, kill me now    because it just seemed very painful. I don   t know if you   ve seen the applications themselves, but they   re pretty thick. It   s not data that you just,    Oh, that   s something we always   .     We have certain institutional data that we   re always preparing, and then there were others where apparently we were also preparing. I just didn   t know that. I had to learn, yes, the percentage of people who get Pell grants, which is an important indicator of, to my mind, your purpose as a school because that means these are people who are below certain income levels. It says how elite you are in terms of socioeconomic status or just economic status. The fact that we have a fairly high percentage compared to some other schools, I thought, was a source of pride, but I didn   t realize,    Oh, that number   s out there in a certain report, but there are other ones that are not out there.    We had to go in and generate them, or we had to generate the data. To find the person who   d generated that data, I   d say,    Now could you run the same thing but restrict it only to the following majors?    because they wanted data for Arts and Sciences and not for the university as a whole, that sort of thing.  It wasn   t just all of Arts and Sciences. There were pieces that were included and pieces that weren   t. For example, biochemistry, which is in ag, it   s a Phi Beta Kappa discipline because it is a liberal arts discipline. There might be other ones. For example, communication sciences and disorders in Arts and Sciences is not. It   s more of a pre-professional discipline. We had to shape, and we had to make some decisions on that to be consistent with Phi Betta Kappa expectations, albeit not necessarily written expectations. It was a long process.  Finchum Putting all the pieces together. It   s like a puzzle, isn   t it?  Crauder Yeah, and there was a committee. I mean, that was the key, and it wasn   t me just running off by myself doing things. There were pieces where I would gather that, but there were other ones, particularly when we do the ones that had real prose in them. There were many, many data that I have never worked with since and don   t see any reason why I would. (Laughter) I think Phi Beta Kappa by having   I mean, they had a very general process, and 18  part of it was, I think,    Are you able to actually complete this application?    I think that was sort of their first bar.  Finchum Endurance.  Crauder Endurance. I think the one on the buildings, really, it was to look at schools that are a little more fly by night and so on. We   re obviously a solid university. We   ve been around a long time. We have more than adequate facilities, but they said    Well, how would you define that?    They   re clever enough to actually put that out there, but it was like,    When was Morrill Hall built, and when was it last renovated?    Oh, turns out you can find out such things. There are people who know such things, but they   re all over campus. Many people from all over campus, areas that I don   t normally work with at all, were engaged with this. In some sense, that was a very nice aspect, although it was stressful at the time.  Finchum A team effort.  Crauder Oh, very much so, very much so.  Finchum Do you remember where you were and how you reacted when you heard the news that it was a yes?  Crauder Well, of course I was in Florida then, and they had the vote. It was more relief than anything else. There are various times in your life where you   re sure that there   s something very important that needs to happen and the consequence of it not happening makes it seem as if it   s impossible for it not to happen, and yet, and yet, you need to find out if it   s going to happen or not.  Abramson Do you happen to remember who was the person that put the information together for the application because I remember all the committee members, we proofread it. We had different parts. Was there one person that put everything together? I don   t remember that.  Crauder I think I assembled most of it as pieces and then Lori Scanlan, out here in the front office, did the making sure it was bound and that it would have the correct separators. We got a pretty cover with a really great picture of the library. I love the fact that the central building on campus here is not the administration building but is the library. I thought,    That speaks to me.    We had a really well-done photograph of that printed on fancy paper, and then that needed to be incorporated in. I think Lori set up all that and created those booklets. Then we used some binding service that I   d never been to, but I discovered where it is. It   s out way on the edge of campus, and she knew of such things. Yeah, Lori   s the one who put it together.  19  I wish I had known to think of all the people who were involved because somewhere I have, in a file, which, I think I gave all the files related to this to whoever   s now keeping these things. For each area, I had who was my contact person because in some sense, I did nothing, but I asked things of other people. Then I put it together, and some of it was just interpreting, okay,    What do we do?    Some things were for the whole university, some things just for the college, or some things were for the college and other things were the college as defined. They were very careful to say. Well, anyway, it was a quite rigorous application process.  Finchum Well, once you heard the news that it was yes, did you call anyone immediately? Who was the first person you told?  Crauder I can   t remember. I think there was this group of us in Florida, and we were all just very happy and lots of people. There was a reception then, I think is it, and then there were lots of people who were congratulating us. I just remember being really tired. (Laughs)  Abramson How does getting Phi Beta Kappa compare to your other achievements?  Crauder Phi Beta Kappa   s a pretty awesome achievement. We had a wonderful ceremony for certain people who were considered founding members. For me, there was a   that was a poignant thing because remember I had rejected even the notion. Again, this is just my memory of that, but now it was like,    Oh yeah. Now I get to actually be a member of Phi Beta Kappa. This is kind of cool.    That was very meaningful, that celebration. It felt very good to be one of the first people who was a member of the OSU Phi Beta Kappa chapter. I was very proud of that. I   ve had lots of high points in my life, but that was definitely one of them.  Finchum Have any of your students become members? You don   t have to name names.  Crauder I usually teach introductory courses because the math department   s thrilled to have me teach large introductory courses, particularly in something, for example, where I might have written a textbook. When other people teach it, they say,    Oh, it   s so hard to teach.    I go,    No, it   s really easy to teach.    (Laughs) I   m not really watching people go through that, but I have notes on the Phi Beta Kappa people. I usually go to the induction, and I recognize people there. Sometimes they   re people I   ve just known through other things, watch them through student government or this sort of thing. Yeah, we   re really proud.  I mean, one of the points of Phi Beta Kappa, while it   s a good honor for the institution, because it reflects that we do things in a certain way, the key was that we kept saying,    We have some really great students here who deserve 20  to be recognized, and you, Phi Beta Kappa, should look forward to having such students counted as among your members,    which was the way we viewed this, that who was it for? It   s for the students, and we have some great students here. We have many, many great students here, and we certainly have some who are worthy of Phi Beta Kappa membership. It   s a very pleasing thing to see, that each spring we   re able to induct a medium size group of people who have been very carefully selected by the quite rigorous standards of Phi Beta Kappa.  Finchum Since you were successful with getting OSU   s, have you been called upon by other institutions who are trying to get a chapter?  Crauder Oh no, oh no. If someone were to ask me, I would happily give them advice, but no. My role is very quiet and I   d like to keep it that way, which is why I   m nervous about all this being public. (Laughs)  Abramson I think it would be fair to say that without Dr. Crauder   s help over the years, this would never have happened, because just gathering that data was very, very difficult to do.  Crauder Yeah, I don   t know, maybe. I do know that I worked hard on it for certain intense periods of time just trying to get,    How do we get the names of every athlete and what their scholarship money is and what their grade point is and so on, and can we get this? Are we allowed to release this? How can we do this?    That sort of thing. It was just data, and people would say,    What are you doing? Why are you doing?    Then it turns out,    I think we can do this without naming names.    Not that there were bad names or anything, but in the interest of student privacy. Some of the questions,    What could we do? What could we present?    We could present what the major was and what the grade point average was.  Phi Beta Kappa looks upon having members at many, many institutions. Academic higher education is an imperfect enterprise, and occasionally things happen in ways they shouldn   t happen. The various membership committees are very careful to try to look at areas where they   re   they start to look with a jaundiced eye at certain types of data to make sure that we are staying true to the long-term mission of what it means to be an institution of higher education that truly values the liberal arts.  Finchum It was on your radar for a good part of your career here.  Crauder Oh, yes, but it was much, much   I mean I can   t remember when Perry Gethner first started. That antedates me considerably. I think he did the first application. It was in, somehow I think, the late    70s, maybe    76.  Finchum Around in there, wasn   t it? 21  Crauder Then he continued with it as a lonesome pursuit. I mean, Dean Stringer was just critical. I remember Marvin Keener talking with me about    Well, Dean Stringer says we need to do this,    and I thought,    I like Dean Stringer a lot.    (Laughs) I have tremendous respect for him. Funny first name because if he were a dean, he   d be Dean Dean Stringer. (Laughter) He   s just a very, very genial   and really smart. The sort of student who you think    Yeah, you would have been Phi Beta Kappa had you been here.    It   s sometimes hard to get him to admit that he went to Harvard Law School, like I think every Supreme Court nominee in the last twenty years.  Finchum I think he   s an honorary member. Wasn   t he made an honorary member?  Crauder Yes, yes, he was. He was with the same induction, the little crowd, as I was, and I was very proud to be with him. I   ve gotten to know him over the years, I think, from when he was chairman of the Board of Regents. I always thought of him as a wonderful supporter of, and you can see from various funds that he   s endowed where. It   s the Library and Arts and Sciences that he   s put his support into, and yeah, I   ve got tremendous respect for him.  Finchum Well, that late day in the fall of 2011 or 2012   it was 2011, wasn   t it, when they finally said yes? When was the first induction?  Abramson It was three years ago.  Crauder Okay. You   d know better. I can usually know about yesterday, and by sometime in the evening, I   ve got to figure out what might happen tomorrow.  Finchum That was a very good day for OSU and a good day for you, too.  Crauder Yes.  Finchum Do you have any other questions?  Abramson Actually, I could spend another couple hours with you.  Crauder It was a real honor for me to be part of this, and I got to work with some wonderful people. Charles was very much there, and the whole committee. I mean there were the people who did the yeoman   s labor of actually gathering names. For example,    Who are all the people on faculty and staff here who are Phi Beta Kappa members?    Well yeah, this is what Charles assembled. This is not easy to find because you could just ask. You would think that you could go to Phi Beta Kappa and say,    Could you please give us the people who live in Oklahoma?   , for example, but no. It   s not so simple. (Laughter) 22  Abramson Most were very surprised that we never had a chapter because I think everyone on that committee was very,    How can we not have a chapter here? This is a great university.     Finchum Tulsa had one before OSU did.  Abramson Yes, yeah, way before, way before.  Crauder Oh yeah, and OU was the first. We   re the third, I guess.  Finchum Saved the best to last. (Laughs)  Crauder Well, I won   t go there particularly. OU is a fine university.  Finchum Yes, it is.  Crauder The University of Tulsa   I mean, it   s very different because it   s a private university, but I think it   s top one hundred research universities. At least that   s what they said at the Tulsa Airport when I was there. (Laughter) I   m assuming so. Yeah, this was something I was very proud to be part of. In the middle of it, I was not always pleased that I had agreed to do this because it was just,    How do I get this information?    It would be something, and it would be just not exactly what we normally produce and so something special had to be done to figure it out. Then there was the getting everything formatted the same way so it looked nice. Actually, I think that   because I do work with books and I do editing. It   s an unfortunate aspect of my personality that I actually enjoy things like that.    Yeah, that font   s not matching that font. We   ve got to fix that.     Finchum Attention to detail.  Crauder Well, there   s attention to detail and there   s also just   There are certain DSM conditions that are actually considered academic virtues, and obsessive compulsive would certainly be one of them, (laughs) as well as the ability to hyper focus.  Finchum Looking forward to the next ten years, what   s your next challenge?  Crauder Oh, I have no idea.  Finchum You don   t?  Crauder I   m just doing what I do but much better than I   m doing it now. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, where do you consider home? 23  Crauder Oh, home is here.  Finchum Stillwater?  Crauder Yeah, very much so, yeah.  Finchum Not Pennsylvania or Ohio?  Crauder No. I was in Philadelphia this past weekend, but that   s a place to visit.  Abramson We   ve asked this to almost every person we   ve interviewed. Were you ever given the secret Phi Beta Kappa handshake?  Crauder I was.  Abramson I guess you can   t say it because     Crauder I was going to say, the nature of secret is that   . (Laughs)  Finchum Is it different for everyone, or is it just the same?  Abramson Don   t know, because it   s so secret.  Crauder We can   t even talk about it, yeah, the alleged secret handshake.  Finchum You were given it once you were an honorary member.  Crauder I can   t even tell you that.  Finchum (Laughs) Well, that   s no fun.  Crauder For you, but for me, it is. (Laughs)  Abramson Where   s your Phi Beta Kappa key?  Crauder I have not gotten a key yet. There was a long gap between when I was officially a member and when Phi Beta Kappa realized I was a member.  Abramson Would you like a key?  Crauder Yeah, I can buy a key.  Abramson I don   t mind. I   m sure we have the money for it.  Crauder I think I do, too. (Laughs) I have my plaque. That   s awesome. 24  Abramson It   s all good.  Crauder It   s all good. That   s exactly correct. That   s exactly correct. It   s good. I   m proud of that as that opportunity. There are great faculty members here, some of whom are members of it, some of whom are not, but again, it   s something about what your disposition at a particular university at a particular time as an undergraduate. Of course, what you do in graduate school is what tends to make you a faculty member, but it has to do with a certain well-roundedness that we look for in the liberal arts.  Finchum That   s a good foundation moving forward.  Crauder Yeah. For those of us who think the liberal arts are the thing, this is very nice.  Abramson In the end, the good guys won, which is not always the case. (Laughter) The good guys won.  Crauder The good guys won. (Laughs) That   s funny.  Abramson It was just a thirty-year struggle.  Crauder It was, wasn   t it? It was about that, yeah. It was about thirty years, yeah, maybe more than that. I can   t remember. Yeah, I mean, Perry really, a lot of work, and for something that a committee found difficult to do. Man, I think of how much more difficult it   d be as an individual, and particularly since, I mean, for the longest time, there he was, a faculty member, professor of French, doing his research and so on. I had much easier time having access to people who could generate data or to think about, and frankly, the staff support, to put things together and to say,    Okay, we need this and such,    and then when we   re arranging visits for people, all the details of that, that requires more than just what one person does but it requires the staff and the team and so on. He was trying quite valiantly for a long, long time. Greatly indebted to all the people who were part of that. Again, as you said, it   s very, very much a team effort.  Finchum Reflects well on the university and those involved.  Crauder It worked out.  Abramson It worked out. (Laughter) I do remember that discussion that if we didn   t get it this last time, there were many people were very, very depressed, and there was a real issue of whether we would continue. I think, in the end, we would have     25  Crauder Yes.  Abramson    but there was   .  Crauder In fact, I think the time before the one where we got it, we put that one together, and then when we didn   t get it, I remember people saying,    Well, we   re going to do it.    I think it was maybe Bob Graalman that said,    It   s time to go again,    and you go,    Oh no. (Laughs) It took a little time to get geared up, and then as we got going, we just said,    We   re going to put the best effort we can into this.    There was a real sense of by gum, this shouldn   t be a long shot, that really it was high time. Well, once we got that sense of indignation, that was helpful. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, over those years, too, the university itself did improve in all sorts of areas.  Crauder Yes, very much so, very much so.  Finchum Maybe this encouraged that or, I mean, you don   t know which came first.  Crauder Arguably, Phi Beta Kappa was right all those years in rejecting us, but I can   t really go there. (Laughs)  Abramson Having our first Rhodes Scholar made a big difference, the Honors Program, and all that. It was just at the right time. Everything was in our favor.  Crauder That   s right.  Finchum Everything just clicked, finally.  Abramson Everything just clicked.  Crauder Oh, we became a Truman  Honor  Institution. We just had a lot of things that indicated,    See, these are the types of students that you are not allowing to be in Phi Beta Kappa    because Phi Beta Kappa really isn   t about the Phi Beta Kappa faculty. That   s a nice part because it says you   re the type of institution that attracts these sort of people, but it   s really about the students and what we provide to the students. In other words, are we capable of sustaining a Phi Beta Kappa chapter year after year? The answer is yes. (Laughs)  Finchum Anything else?  Abramson I think that   s it. Again, thank you for your time. It was a privilege.  26  Crauder Thank you. This was fun. (Laughs)  Finchum Thank you very much. You were great.  Crauder It   s a pleasure.  -------  -------
