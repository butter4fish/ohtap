Speaker 2: I was born November 8th, 1936--
Speaker 1: It's coming up, that's coming up.  Today's date is November 1st, 2007 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  It's coming up; that was my--that's right, I was my father's [Clinton Rosemond] birthday present, little late 'cause his birthday is today; he's long left us but hi, daddy.
Speaker 1: That's pretty close, that's pretty close.
Speaker 2: Yep, and 1936, so I have a birthday very soon.
Speaker 1: Today is, again, the 1st of November in 2007.  We're at the Cotton Club on 125th Street in Harlem, New York [New York].  What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I like the way you said that (laughter).  I'm a freelance musician, really.  I mean that's what I have to call myself.  I also do some teaching.  I have done a lot of different kind of teaching over the years, but now I am a freelance musician, and I am a composer, and I'm still teaching, but a lot less teaching right now than I have done in the past.  And I'm teaching a music course to young children, hoping to get them really interested in jazz at eight or nine so they can grow into understanding that jazz is something that's valuable and needs to be understood at, at an early age.  That it is an American creation and a--and I want them to learn how to appreciate it, if I can do that at an early age so they can integrate it into all the other musics that they are bombarded with all the time.

Speaker 1: Okay, to start the interview--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I'm gonna ask you five People magazine-ish type questions, okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna ask a question, and whatever pops into your mind that's your answer.
Speaker 2: Just kind of stream-of-consciousness?
Speaker 1: This is just to loosen you up and get, get you ready.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the audience warm-up.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?

Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Autumn, which is disappearing in New York (laughter).  There isn't much autumn anymore, but I love the wind in my face, I love the sound of leaves in, in the park and (unclear) being blown by the wind, I like walking through leaves--yeah.

Story_ID: 673813
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother.  What's your mother's name, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother was born--(unclear) well, her name was Corinne Meaux, M-E-A-U-X.
Speaker 1: And Corinne is--
Speaker 2: C-O-R--one R, two N's, C-O-R-I-N-N-E.  She was born in a little town in Kentucky, Lebanon, Kentucky.  They moved when she was very young to Nashville, Tennessee, and then the family moved once again to St. Louis, Missouri, and that's where she went to high school, and the two years of college that black youngsters could go to then, I think called normal school.  And it was from St. Louis that she left to go to Europe.
Speaker 1: Did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, dash that; then she came to New York [New York] to dance.  She wanted to go back to St. Louis and open up a school, a la [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, that kind of flavor.
Speaker 1: So, did she, as a student, get an opportunity to be trained in dance?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a ballet dancer, actually when she came here, and then she was--she danced in the second--I think the--probably the second Cotton Club [New York, New York].  I've never really gotten that straight, which Cotton Club by the time she--let's see, it would have been around 1920s--in the 1918s, 1920, '21 [1921].  Whichever Cotton Club that was, she was a pony, she was ninety pounds and about 4'11" or 5'--little tiny dancers that were all the same color, cafe au lait color, like the Rockettes are now, they were, you know--
Speaker 1: Show girls.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Chorus girls.
Speaker 2: No, ponies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Called ponies.
Speaker 2: The show girl was--
Speaker 1: Didn't walk around.
Speaker 2: --the 6'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --statuesque.  That was the show girl.  The chorus girls--I--they may have been interchanged with the ponies, I'm not sure, but I remember her telling me they called--that was--they--that's what they called these little dancers who moved really fast and did all the fast toe and tap stuff.
Speaker 1: We spoke with [HistoryMaker] Elaine Ellis, and I think that she told us the same thing, and I thought she said horse in my memory, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ooh (laughter).  Well, it could be, but I mean that--
Speaker 1: But I think--no, but I think you're correct, and I think that they were the same kind of dancer because she talked about the women who walked around versus they who had the routine dancing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, then my mother danced.  They danced a routine and they were all about the same color, all about the same height, so they were all little.  And then there were these statuesque girls that walked around with these costumes and they just pretty much did a fashion walk, and then--I'll have to check my own resources again to see where the chorus girls were in there; I think chorus girls and ponies are interchangeable terms I think.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: But I know the show girl was--
Speaker 1: --from this group of interviews, we'll--we will learn.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--yeah.
Story_ID: 673814
Speaker 1: So you said that your mom [Corinne Meaux] was a ballerina.  Do you know anything about when she was being raised?  Like could you tell us, you know, do you know how early she started dancing and how she managed to get herself some training, and what--why she was interested in dancing at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know that there was--yeah.  No, I think--but she was--whatever happened in St. Louis [Missouri], she was part of a group of artistic people.  One of the cartoonists that does the--I mean I don't know if we even know of him today; his name was E. Simms Campbell.  He was a black cartoonist.  I think there's one cartoon that he did in Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  And so there was this, this group of people who are artistic, and I, I don't know where she got her really early training, but I know, you know, we--she had all of her costumes and her ballet slippers, and I could never get my feet into even when I was a kid and interested, but she wanted to leave the rigidity, I guess, of the Midwest, and so she left teaching after maybe a year or two, to come to audition at the Cotton Club [New York, New York] and to be--get a flavor of what that would be like--what it was like, and she wasn't here very long before--she wasn't dancing very long, I don't think, before she ran into Florence Mills and to an opportunity to go to Europe with a show.  My father [Clinton Rosemond] had already been over there for about twelve years or thirteen years.  He went over in 1915, and then he came back and forth to put shows together, so they were putting together 'Show Boat.'  Paul Robeson was going to be part of it, and they were auditioning for dancers.  My mother auditioned, and got the part, and so she was on her way to be a part of that show, and that's where she met my father--on the boat (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Actually, or--on the--
Speaker 2: He auditioned--he was the stage manager--
Speaker 1: --on the veritable show boat, on the way to 'Show Boat' in Europe.
Speaker 2: So she met--they actually met here, but they romanced, I think, on the way over on the boat, I mean that's where they met, the Queen Mary [RMS Queen Mary] or the--
Speaker 1: I see. And it, it sounded initially like she had a plan to go to Europe.  Was she already interested in being European (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--she was already interested in dancing, and I think she knew she had to get to New York [New York] in order to fulfill that. St. Louis wasn't going--wasn't happening, I know that much.
Story_ID: 673815
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you get an opportunity to meet your parents--your mother's [Corinne Meaux] parents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  When I was a little girl, yeah, we went to St. Louis [Missouri] actually maybe twice, so I did, but I didn't get a chance--I was really little, you know, 3, 4, 5.  I remember the trip and I remember the train ride.  I mean that was when I was three--I know I was three, and, and I remember being up on the top bunk, on the, the Silver Streak [Silver Streak Zephyr] or whatever that train was that went across from New York [New York] to, to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And I think at one point my, my father [Clinton Rosemond] would--had a summer job or something as a Pullman porter.  He was working the train, and so I did get to meet my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandmother, my mother's mother's name was Bertha [Bertha Pope Meaux].  I'm named for her--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and her last name was Pope, P-O-P-E.  And my grandfather was Fredrick Meaux, M-E-A-U-X.
Speaker 1: I like that name, Meaux.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's on a mustard jar [Pommery Moutarde De Meaux] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's got moxie.
Speaker 2: You know, there's a town in France called Meaux, and I think it's where they do the--there's a mustard that comes from there that they manufacture there.  (Unclear) or one of those.
Speaker 1: And do you know where your mother's parents were from?  Are they from Kentucky themselves (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so.  My mother's mother--I mean my grandmother's mother was from Kentucky, and I don't know much--I--there's a tree.  Somebody has a family tree on the--but I think it's my, I think it's my father's [Clinton Rosemond] side of the family.  I can't remember names 'cause there's some very interesting names like Joseph and Mary Early  (laughter).  I love that name.  Joseph and Mary Early, last name was Early.  I don't know much about my grand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Great-grandparents.
Speaker 2: --father, yeah, on my--on the paternal side of my mother's family; I don't know about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you know a little bit about your great-grandmother on your grandmother's side.  You know a little bit about your grandmother's mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I just know that they were from, from Kentucky.
Speaker 1: --from Kentucky.
Speaker 2: I didn't get to know them at all.
Speaker 1: And what did you know--did you have a sense of what your grandmother, Bertha Pope, did?  Like, what was her lifestyle like?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, she was--actually, she was really a housewife.  I mean she took care of the kids.  She had six girls and my grandfather was--my grandfather was like one of those really self-taught intellectuals, you know.  He read a lot and we don't--I mean he was kind of clouded in mystery but he could pull off a conversation about anything any time.  He read all the time, and he became the first postal carrier, I think--first black postal, you know, postman--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in St. Louis, which must have been quite an achievement at that point in time, you know?
Speaker 1: And so we're talking late 1800s.
Speaker 2: Well, he was born in the--he, he was born in the late 1800s.  He was, he was born in '82 [1882].  My grand--we're talking my grand--my mother's mother--mother's father.  Yeah, he was born around 1882 or something, so by the time--I mean maybe he had had other--several other jobs too, but I think this is like we're getting into the '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s] when--ye--look at what segregation and how long that had been; you know, a product of not producing anybody in the government that was visible up to that point 'cause he--that was--he was the first (pause) in the city.
Story_ID: 673816
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His, his name was Clinton Rosemond.  Clinton, C-L-I-N-T-O-N, Rosemond, R-O-S-E-M-O-N-D.
Speaker 1: And where is he from?
Speaker 2: He was born in Seneca, South Carolina on the northeast part near Georgia, the northeast corner of the state in the Indian [Native American] part--what they call the Indian plain, and he was part Blackfoot.  And he--they, they moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, and from there they moved to Los Angeles [California].  I mean eventually it was my--the father's side of my family that--I think they homesteaded.  They moved out west and homesteaded.
Speaker 1: Well, my next question was gonna be do you have any sense of why they moved there, but it sounds like they could get some space (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I would love to know how they got there.  Did they go in a covered wagon?  What did they do?
Speaker 1: That was my next question.
Speaker 2: How did they get--I don't know, it's--
Speaker 1: Did they walk out there?
Speaker 2: --it's one of the things that sits on--none of the family really knows.  And my father was six months older than my [maternal] grandfather [Fredrick Meaux], okay?  So he was old, you know?  Remember, it was--it's just--it's something that I really should make a priority to try and trace just to find out.  I do know that my grandfather [Henry Rosemond] on, on my father's side was a preacher and a mason, so he went--he--I have a feeling that he sort of--they sort of worked their way west, and then maybe preached and, you know--west to earn a--earn their passage, and then when they got to California, they could homestead, they could, you know, land on a piece of property and, and claim it under the Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so when you lived in Los Angeles with your parents, did--the space that you lived in, was that all related to your father's family?
Speaker 2: No, they had a--they, they lived in the older part of, of the city; they had a home over there.  When my father moved there, they bought a home on the newer part of the city out where blacks were now moving into.  You know, my mother--my grandmother's [Ella McClure Rosemond] house was in the black community, Vernon [Avenue] and Central [Avenue], Vernon and Avalon [Boulevard], over there where the Alabam [Club Alabam, Los Angeles, California] and the Dunbar Hotel [Los Angeles, California], where all the show people came.  There was only one hotel where they could stay and it was the Dunbar, and in it were the shoe shine guy and the woman who did my hair was upstairs on the mezzanine, and the, the show room was downstairs and the whole--I mean the congregation was in the bar.  People came and met everybody from Marian Anderson to Jack Johnson, to--whoever you were--came to the Dunbar Hotel.  If you didn't stay there, you stayed with a friend, you know?  So, the other house was--their house was like an old wood frame with the little spindles and the gingerbread on that side of town which was like the east side.  That was where, that was, that was where everybody went when their--when their parents moved to somewhere else, the kids always wanted to go back over there and hang out (laughter) because that's where the music was, that's where everything was.  So there were two separate locations with--I think my mother may have stayed when my sister [Eleanor Rosemond]--who is eight years older than I am--they stayed with them for a while until they got, got themselves situated with enough funds to buy a house on the, on the Westside [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 673817
Speaker 1: And was your house a modish, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] one-story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was like a redwood bunk--no, it was--.  Yeah it was, yeah it was a one-story, six rooms just straight through with a patio, big, long lot, big backyard, and--
Speaker 1: And you say it's the west--where is the west?
Speaker 2: West?  Well, west is--oh, where is west?
Speaker 1: Well, I haven't heard--I don't know Vernon [Avenue] and the street--
Speaker 2: Oh, you never heard of--?
Speaker 1: What street, what street are you on in the west?
Speaker 2: Central [Avenue], Vernon and Central, Vernon and Avalon [Boulevard]--those were sort of like your safe--125th [125th Street, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard] and Seventh Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard], 125th--you know, it's like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the west was near the USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, that's the best way I can describe where, where--and I'm trying to figure out what it was that divided east from west.  I don't really remember the street, but it was close to USC.  That's, that's the western side going more toward Western Avenue, and what the ru- the--I'm trying to think of a landmark.  Well, USC's probably the closest landmark I could give you, Exposition Park [Los Angeles, California], the museum, the L.A. Museum [Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California]; those are all on the Westside [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 673818
Speaker 1: So you said ultimately that your father [Clinton Rosemond] was working in Europe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell--uh oh, I don't have my mic on. Can you tell me a little bit about your father's career?  You know, he moved to Los Angeles [California] with his parents [Ella McClure Rosemond and Henry Rosemond] and then, you know, do you know anything about his upbringing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he didn't move to ca- no, he didn't move with his family.
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't go to Los Angeles with the--
Speaker 2: No, he--he has quite a story, and I'm still trying to figure how to write--research his story, too.  Okay, my father--remember I told you he was six months older than my [maternal] grandfather [Fredrick Meaux]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was--he joined the [U.S.] Army.  He joined the Army when we were in Cuba, that little short war.  The Spanish American War, my father was a veteran of that war, so he was a Rough Rider.  He was in Teddy Roosevelt's [Theodore Roosevelt] cavalry--the 9th and 10th [Buffalo Soldiers]--those two black battalions that Lena Horne's daughter wrote about in the book?  He was one of those, okay?
Speaker 1: Tell us more.
Speaker 2: And I'm gonna try and find the picture, if I can, of them sitting on a horse.  I grew up with that picture in the living room and I used to just stand there and say, "What?  Why is my father in a uniform on a horse?"  It wasn't making any sense to me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two black battalions in the Spanish-American War.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the 9th and the 10th--yes.  You have to read that book if you don't know about 'em; it's a great book, very good book--a Gail Lumet [Gail Lumet Buckley], and it's called 'American Patriots' ['American Patriots: The Story of Blacks in the Military from the Revolution to Desert Storm,' Gail Lumet Buckley] or something like that.  And he--so--and he went--and he ran away and joined that--joined the Army when he was fifteen or sixteen, because he had had an altercation with a white man in Little Rock [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he and his brother [Garfield Rosemond] confronted a white man over how they had spoken to the--how this white man had spoken to their mother, and my grandmother packed 'em up and had them leave, because they were gonna get lynched.  So they split up, and one side of the story says that they split up and left, and the other side of the--another version of the story is that they doubled back and bushwhacked the guy that came back to kill them, and we don't know which version is correct.  At any rate, my grand- my father went to the Army, and that war was very short.  When he came back, he was stationed in Montana and a friend of his--my last name is Rosemond--that's my father's name, R-O-S-E-M-O-N-D, very unusual.  So there was somebody there who, who was a neighbor of my grandmother's and said, "You have got to be related to these people who live--that I know in L.A. that's the same last name.  Could they be related?"  He said, "They could be.  I've been looking for my, my parents.  I don't know where they were," because these--the situation because they lost each other.  Sure enough, it was his mother.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He wrote a letter--the guy who--and he used to sing in the barracks.  He used to, you know, sing and, and that's how he got friendly with this other sergeant or private, or whoever it was, who said, "Wow.  You have a great voice."  And they got to talking and he introduced him and he said, "Rosemond?  I know some Rosemonds in Los Angeles."  And my father said, "Well, I'm looking for my family."  He said, "Well, I'm gonna write a letter and see--and tell them that I met you and find out maybe it's your family."
Story_ID: 673819
Speaker 1: What are your [paternal] grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: My grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My gra-, okay, Henry--
Speaker 1: We were talking about your grandfather being a preacher and a mason but we didn't actually talk about his name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, Henry; his name was Henry.
Speaker 1: And we talked about them moving.
Speaker 2: He was also a Garveyan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My great--that grandfather had a--he was a card-carrying Marcus Garvey-ite, Henry Rosemond.  And my grandmother's name was Ella McClure [Ella McClure Rosemond].  I mean before she married him, she was a McClure.
Speaker 1: So, I'm not sure if I should go back to your father [Clinton Rosemond] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  We should talk about your, your grandparents (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, I just wanted to--
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's, let's stay on your father for just a, a little bit longer.  So, your father's now in Montana, he manages to hook up with his--back with his family, and what does he do after he completes his [U.S. military] service, or does he complete his service?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he completed service, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he hooked up with his parents and he--I mean he had this wonderful talent for singing, so he--they exploited the talent.
Speaker 1: And did--were they able to find his brother [Garfield Rosemond] also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did, but I don't know if they found each other but they--he did find his mother in California and, you know, a lot of this they probably talked about over dinner a thousand times.  Was I listening?  Not really, you know (laughter).  My brother [Clinton Rosemond] and I were like, "Oh, this all sounded so fantastic, phantasmagorical, magical kind of--we have heard it," you know?  It was like--and then later on it was like, "Golly, what a story."  You know (laughter).  It's, it's, really, it still gets to me a little bit because he really--I mean they were--they didn't have anything and he ended up with his wonderful career in Europe, you know?
Speaker 1: So, does your father go, you know, straight to New York [New York] from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think he--no, I don't know that part for real; I would be making that up.
Speaker 1: But he starts singing and ultimately ends up in show business--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and New York and in Europe.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then he came back to do movies with Micheaux--Oscar Micheaux and--
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: --and Ralph Cooper and he got into 20th Century Fox [20th Century Fox Film Corporation] and he did--he's got about twenty-five movie discography.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: You know, during that era when they was doing all the things that black people did in movies--opening doors and, you know, wiping people's brows and, you know, that whole--he did actually get to do some defining parts.  He's mentioned in James Baldwin's 'The Price of the Ticket.'  They spelled his name wrong, but it's my father.  They spell it Clinton Rosewood, but he's talking about my father.  He was in a movie called 'They Won't Forget' that Mervyn LeRoy did.  It was Lana Turner's first movie when she was sixteen.
Story_ID: 673820
Speaker 1: So, in Los Angeles [California], your father's [Clinton Rosemond] career was in show business also, just slightly different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said he was in Lana Turner's first movie ['They Won't Forget'], and many others.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was still singing; I mean he did the whole Chitlin' Circuit in, in this country, but he traveled to all the countries where, you know, heads of state and the command performances for all the heads of state from 1915 to about--'til the crash, 'til, 'til the banks failed, 'til a little before the--like 1927 or twenty--.  He and my mother [Corinne Meaux] got married '27 [1927], '28 [1928].  They decided they would be better off with crashing banks in this country than in Europe, because it was gonna be way worse for artists over there, so they came back.  My sister [Eleanor Rosemond] was born in '29 [1929], and then he did the circuit here.  And he also was a German lieder and Italian bel canto; he trained his voice--he had a beautiful voice, and so he did that work.  And then he added the black spirituals, the spirituals, to those.  So he always ended a program (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hold on, please.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so my father sang German lieder and Italian bel canto art songs, and he did those concerts and, and he added the, the, the spirituals to that singing program, but being in Los Angeles was sort of an aut- it was almost automatic that since he was already in show business that he should look into, you know, some movie work, so, yeah.  So--I, I mean he, he was in a movie with Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson where I'm sure they just wrote the part in, because the director wanted him to really get a chance to act, because his part didn't have anything to do with the plot.  It was almost like the movies that they used to drop in--you know, they'd do movies and, and when they sent the reel to the South, they took out all the, all the numbers that--or any part of the plot that had to do with black people because they were mixing on stage, so they wrote these things to drop in a song with Lena Horne leaning against a pole, and when they sent that south, Lena Horne came out and the movie got put back together again if--you know I'm just using that as an example.  So he, he was really a very good actor, just born way before his time to be able to get any ma--many roles, you know, any real roles.  And he did do maybe one or two where you could really see that he was a, a good actor--very good actor, and with a wonderful speaking voice, and he had that speaking voice, I guess, 'cause he had a trained, you know, singing voice.
Speaker 2: How many siblings do you have?  I know you said--you mentioned your sister.
Speaker 1: I have a sister and a brother [Clinton Rosemond].  I have a brother who's younger.
Speaker 2: So, as kids, did you get an opportunity to see your father perform?
Speaker 1: Or in movies or, or anywhere (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we--in a cup--in some church concerts, but we saw some of the movies; I mean we were young and we--and he also sometimes came home with all his makeup on.  You know, it was like, "Who is that?  Who is that?"  (Laughter) Yeah, we did; we did get a chance, and I--then--we have--my brother has an archive of almost everything that he did that we could get our hands on.  I think there's one that Ted Turner owns, and we haven't been able to get that, and also the one that he did where he played George Washington Carver ['The Story of Doctor Carver'] that was all over the school system.  I must have seen it ten times in every science class I ever took, about the peanut--George Washington Carver and the--and--hit the many uses that he put, put peanut--the peanut to.
Speaker 2: And when that--when you would end up screening that movie, does your father look like you?  And everyone in the class say, "George Washington Carver looks just like you!"
Speaker 1: No, what they did was I would say, "That was my father."  And they would say, "Yeah, right," (laughter); that's how that went (laughter).  They made him up to look as much like the man as he could, but he had a very thin, thin--you know George Washington Carver had high cheek bones and a thin face from here--pointy chin.  But they just put a white coat on him and put him in a lab and, you know, he just--it was really funny because there was a person--this was not a--this wasn't fiction, you know.  He was do--it was sort of like that kind--that--the documentary of the time narrated over with no speaking part; he just did the action and the voice narrating, and every time I saw, "That's my daddy, that's my daddy."  "That's not your daddy."  "Yes, it is."  "Oh yeah, get outta here."  (Laughter) It was only the kids who were our friends who had been in our home and who knew who he was, and (laughter).

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When your mother [Corinne Meaux] and father [Clinton Rosemond] were in Los Angeles [California], was she also dancing there?
Speaker 2: No, she became a homebody.  She hung up her dancing shoes.  She wanted--she, she stayed home.  She didn't like show business.  She loved to dance; she didn't like the treatment, she didn't like anything about it.  She didn't smoke, she didn't drink, she didn't like hanging out, so the whole other part to show business just bothered her.  She wanted to really dance and just, you know, dance and, and, and, and have a hou- have a home.  So, so that part of it really didn't appeal to her.  So when my--when they were able to buy a home, she just decided to stay home and be a, be a housewife.  Well, she traveled with him before my sister [Eleanor Rosemond] was old enough to go to kindergarten.  She was on the road with him, so that they could save the money and buy a house rather than spend money with, with her alone--with my--well, with my sister and her renting.  They decided that they would save the money--she'd stay and they'd all stay together until she was five, and then they came home and started, you know, saving money.  I think it was one or two movies that bought the house, you know; one role in a movie and--just like it is now; just a lot less money but just kind of--it was pretty much the same, and the way that, you know, going to Hollywood just changes people's lives.
Speaker 1: And did your mother have a problem with your father's love of show business?  Like was she okay with the fact that he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, yeah, she traveled with him; she took care of him on the road. I mean no, she didn't have--
Speaker 1: It worked out.
Speaker 2: --a problem with that--no, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 673822
Speaker 1: So, before we leave your parents [Corinne Meaux and Clinton Rosemond], we've gotta talk just a little bit more about your grandparents.  So, once your grandfather, Henry Rosemond, is in Los Angeles [California], is he still preaching?  And you said he was a mason.  Do you mean like he does masonry or that he was in the Order of Masons?  He's a mason with bricks (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no I mean. Yeah, he was a pra- and he may have also been in the Order, too--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I--but he, but he was also a carpenter and a masonry; I mean he built--and my father also could do that.  I mean he just did kind of, I guess, learned by doing.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about your grandfather's existence as a Garvey-ite?  I mean you could just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I wish I did.  No, I really don't.  I just know we ran across the, the certificate.  It was like, "Oh, my god." You know, it was like, "All right."  Here was a person who was really for progressive thinking about, you know, unity, and about people needing to stand up, and so we ran across it, in his hand--you know, that he was a--that he was a card-carrying member of, of that--of--and I think he may have even had some shares in the steamboat company.
Speaker 1: And the Black Star Line.  I mean it sounds like your grandfather--your father--all of your family are pretty independent, so I mean this homeowner who's moved cross country.  I think, you know, these sound like people who would be pro-independence.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely; yeah, they were--they had to be, they had to be to do what they did.  That was a hell of an undertaking, I would think, at that point in time to, to, to g- move west.
Story_ID: 673823
Speaker 1: If you had to describe your mom [Corinne Meaux] to someone, how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Political, more, more--I mean she was the one that taught us to open your eyes and look around and see what was really going on without--most people did--they wanted to mask whatever they had moved away from in the South without really saying so, you know?  I mean they wanted--they didn't wanna--as, as 'Roots' showed us, you know, that people had hidden a lot of their history from their--from the next generation.  But she was--she wasn't--she was kind of like a nester.  She was the kind of person that would--wanted all the kids' friends to come to the house.  She didn't want her kids out running around, so everybody else's kids came to our house, and there was another house a couple of blocks away where people just--they knew that they could go.  My mother formed--my, my brother [Clinton Rosemond], rather, had a car club, you know?  Everybody works--lives to get a car in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] by the time he was gonna get a driver's license after you pass your driver's ed [education], you know, stuff in high school, it's like babysitting, whatever you're doing, in my neighborhood anyway, whatever your job was was all geared to buying a car.  So they had a--they, they had a car club and the car club rotated, you know, where they were gonna sit out in front of somebody's house and turn on the radio and polish the whitewalls and fix the car and, you know.  So those, those kids always came over and had--my mother would have something for them to eat, some--something for them to drink so that they would, you know, just be encouraged to--after you deal with the car, come in, it's okay, you know.  And then they'd formed a little unit where they rotated them.  Each boy's mother, you know, had hosted--host them hanging out 'cause it was no place to put the car except in the street, or you lined up your driveway with the cars, and everybody worked on their cars and shared information and stuff, you know.  And then when I got interested in jazz, you know, my house was where we drug all the instruments over.  All the drums came over to my house and all the neighborhood kids that wanted to practice being in a jazz band, they were in my house.  So she was very community-oriented that way.  You know, we had a garden in the backyard.  We had--we grew a lot of our own food, and whatever we couldn't eat, my mother gave away to the, to the neighbors, and she was sort of like the neighborhood watch, you know.  During the war, she was the first-aid warden and the air raid warden and the one who gave the all-clear at the--when the lights went out.  I don't know if you know about that.  During World War II [WWII], the--there were blackout periods when--to ensure that the--if there were German bombers flying over, they couldn't see anything, so the whole neighborhood went dark, and then there was a big siren sound to, to, to let you know that this was the beginning of the dark period and then however long it lasted, then the siren would sound again and then there was the, you know, an all-clear and you could turn up--back on the lights.  So she was very, very community-oriented kind of person that would have made a good district councilman or a leader, which she didn't 'cause she wanted to stay home, but she did everything else.  She was very--his- were aware of history and, and aware of how the history had been distorted, and how, you know, what came first.  She was really clear about that.  Very, very loving; she wasn't, she wasn't like an affectionate, but very loving, very interested in keeping the idea of community in people's homes, keeping kids outta the street, yeah.  She was--and she was very--you know, for the time she was interested in what we were interested in, you know?  I wanted to be a musician, and she didn't stop me. I wanted to be a jazz musician, and she didn't stop me, you know.  So she invited people, she--my--the teacher where--when I started taking lessons from Richard Powell [Richie Powell], he played the piano 'til midnight almost whenever he came over to give me a lesson.  The lesson would be over at 7:00.  She invited him to a dinner and then he would sit there and play for another three or four hours, so.
Story_ID: 673824
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Clinton Rosemond]?
Speaker 2: My father was more, more a kind of a hands-on, you know, and affectionate.  He was the person who was more affectionate in the family, to all of us, not just me.  He was my hang-out person.  I mean he took me to the Dunbar [Dunbar Hotel, Los Angeles, California] that I talked about earlier to meet all the musicians, and when they came into town.  He was a proud father.  He was older now, he was--he took a lot of harassing, I guess, from other members of the family because he was so much older than my mother [Corinne Meaux], but he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a cradle-robber?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they went through that, yeah, they sure did.  But he was a very loving father, very--but he loved the outdoors, he lo--he had a great flower garden and, and a vegetable garden, very attentive, very romantic, and very inclusive, you know.  He was a--he, he, he made friends with people all up and down the--I mean just people who would stop and admire the garden.
Story_ID: 673825
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your parents [Corinne Meaux and Clinton Rosemond] growing in that garden?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What are your parents growing, like, specifically (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he--well, roses.  The, the rose bushes were spectacular, basically, really.  They, they--and then the--he had gladioli; he had wisteria.  Those were the main flowers, and then, you know, he had really, he had really fixed the front with chrysanthemums, hydrangea, and the hedgerow, hedge, they were always really spectacularly clipped, and the grass was spotless.  It was a, it was a--he, he, he kept himself outdoors a lot.  And then he built a chicken coop in the back.  We rai- he raised chickens and rabbits and squab.  We, we raised almost all our own food in a big vegetable garden (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you said food, I pictured a vegetable patch, but I didn't realize there was meat also, so what kind of vegetables are they growing?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, he--we raised string beans and corn; those were together, you know, the string been goes up the corn stalk pretty much, tomatoes, squash--three or four varieties of squash, cabbage, kale, mustards.  I don't remember collard greens, I don't remember 'em.  And then he did strawberry mounds, we had strawberries.  And then we had fruit trees on each side of the property; there were--there was an apricot tree, an avocado tree, a guava bush, carrots.
Speaker 1: This is serious.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a serious garden.  He had a serious--and whenever we had anything left over, it went to the neighbors.  And my mother put up stuff.  She canned, she canned peaches, and I didn't even pick that up, I didn't even go near that.  That's something that I guess--I don't know if my sister [Eleanor Rosemond] got--I don't think she does any canning; that was (shakes head, sighs).  And she baked.  I did pick up the baking. I did bake (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You sigh when you talk about the canning; is it big work?
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was work.
Speaker 1: It's a lot of work?
Speaker 2: Labor-intensive work--boiling the mason jars--
Speaker 1: What do you have to do?
Speaker 2: --and sterilizing them and making sure that there is no air in there so that you didn't get botulism, and fixing the, the, the peaches and the pears and, you know, cutting them just so.  Oh, no, it was--I mean I was (laughter), I knew while I was helping her do it that I would never do it; I just knew--I could tell.
Speaker 1: But, but you did in fact bake, and she was also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did bake, yes, she did--yeah, I did do a lot of that.
Speaker 1: --pretty prolific with the baking.
Speaker 2: And make all my own bread until my diet totally changed.  I used to bake croissant for Christmas gifts and put them in the coffee can in tissue paper; little, little--the small croissant, and bread.  I baked bread every week.  I paid for my first pictures with loaves of bread (laughter).  I mean, no, the baby pictures I--the photographer who took the--my kids' first professional baby pictures, I said, "What's this shoot gonna cost me?"  He said, "Just bake me some bread."  So, I baked him about six loaves of bread.
Story_ID: 673826
Speaker 1: How'd you get interested in jazz?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.  How did I get interested in jazz?  Okay.  Well, you know, by talking about my mother [Corinne Meaux] and father [Clinton Rosemond], you can see that we grew up with a lot of different interests.  My mother loved--she, she used to turn on the Metropolitan Opera from back here [New York, New York], you know.  We used to listen to that on Saturday, and we listened to all the jazz programs.  I went to a high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] that had a great jazz program.  They had a great music program, and I, I started to, to branch out in the kind of music I was listening to, and a friend just gave me some records one day.  I was listening to the, the music from the West Coast, I was listening to a lot of Dave Brubeck and Shelly Manne, and--
Speaker 1: And is that categorized as West Coast jazz?
Speaker 2: That is; that's what they used to call it.  I, I hope they don't call it that anymore, but that's what they had identified it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's funny 'cause I said, "I wonder what they call West Coast jazz?"  I said, "It must be cool."  And then I looked it up, and it's called West Coast jazz or cool jazz (laughter), and I thought, "Okay, that makes sense" (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) West Coast jazz or cool jazz.  Okay, well I don't know what cool jazz is today because it's got--you know, the, the truth of the matter is that the market place has just put all these labels on so much stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and they subcategorize it all to make money, you know?
Speaker 1: Music, music.  So--
Speaker 2: But there really was a difference in the sound.
Speaker 1: Well, that's my next question.  What's the difference in the, in the Brubeck that you're listening to versus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a harder--it's just the rhythm is--it's a different concept of where the music emanates from.  You know, it's the--
Speaker 1: Is it more compositional?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in a way because it is--that's--a part of it is that it's really more composed than the music that was indigenous that's, that, that's really at the root of jazz, and that's blues, and that was about making it up as it happened.  It was really more improvisational.  I mean even the blues.  You know, John Lee Hooker blues, he's talking about, "I had a woman," you know, and, "Oh, you know, ran out on me, and," you know, "I'm going to kill her, I'm gonna put my head down on the railroad track and I'm waiting for the 3:09 so I can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Die.
Speaker 2: --leave this place."  Yeah.  You know.  Or, you know, "I'm gonna hire me somebody to watch my woman while she sleeps."  You know, those kind of things were really made up out of, you know, anguish and--or out of laughter, whatever.  They were, they were part of a life.  I think the West Coast jazz was really--it was composed.  A lot of it was taken right out of the European tradition and with a little bit more--without the African tradition.  Jazz is European and African; it's the marriage of lifestyles, it's the marriage of slavery and ownership.  It's the marriage of European harmony and, and African rhythm, you know.  So, I don't know; I may be getting myself in a lot of trouble with a (laughter) lot of people.  That's my, that's my take on it.  And then, I mean, and if you listen to one side-by-side, you can hear; it's almost like a difference in the sand and, and the sea and brick buildings (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The grass or the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and brick and the sidewalk; it's, it's a harder edge, a harder cut, and a little bit more respect.  And actually, what it's made out of is more African, I think, and that could be, you know, a lot of what happened on this coast.  The movement over here is not like the movement on the West Coast of where the music went, and where it came from, and the direction from the islands to the East Coast.
Speaker 1: So, perhaps a--more of a blues--what do you call it?
Speaker 2: Well, the blues was--
Speaker 1: Sort of basis on the East Coast, and then more of a compositional melodic basis in the West?  You have--maybe have more control over it?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't even put it like that because there was a lot of influence from another part of the region, I mean the southwest part, the Texas part (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Country music?
Speaker 2: Texas--Los Angeles [California] is loaded with Texans, and that music has a different sound, too.  A lot of Texas tenors, they call 'em, you know, that helped to form the music that, that has a, a different like regional sound, but you could--if you like--and like I said, if you put on a Dave Brubeck record and then put on a Bud Powell record, it would just--you, you will hear how different they are.
Story_ID: 673827
Speaker 1: You grew up, you said, with a sister and a brother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my sister's name is Eleanor [Eleanor Rosemond].  She was named for my father's mother Ella [Ella McClure Rosemond].
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Oh, my brother is the--younger.  He's the--so my, my sister's eight years older and my brother is three years younger.
Speaker 1: What's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Clinton, but he's not a junior.  All of his middle names are different (laughter).  My--'cause my father's [Clinton Rosemond] got a long name; it's like Eliezer and like Crescent [ph.] Clinton Rosemond.  I have no idea who he was named for except Eliezer from the bible.  And then my brother's name is Clinton Fredrick Henry Rosemond [Clinton Rosemond], and that's for his two grandfathers [Henry Rosemond and Fredrick Meaux], but he calls himself Clint (laughter).
Story_ID: 673828
Speaker 1: When you guys [Hope's siblings, Eleanor Rosemond and Clinton Rosemond] were growing up, you know, how was it, the three of you together?  Did you have chores?  What was your--I mean, you told me that your mom [Corinne Meaux] had everyone over from the neighborhood [in Los Angeles, California], but in terms of the three of you, what was your relationship like?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had chores.
Speaker 1: What'd you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, we--the house had an added-on front porch with a million windows--panes, you know, divided into nine, two squares in the corners and a little rectangle, and then a little piece of wood and then two strips of glass and a big pane in the middle, so there were nine sections with this--divided by wood, and we had to clean those.  We had to clean all the windows in the house every Saturday, with Bon Ami and newspaper.  We had to vacuum all the ru- we had to vacuum the whole house from the front porch all the way to the, to the dining room and the bedrooms.  The kitchen didn't have a carpet.  We had to scrub the kitchen floor.  Well, that was--we mopped it in-between, but we had to scrub it every week, every, every Saturday, but we, we had to mop it down every night.  But my mother did a lot of that.  She didn't do anything--she didn't have us do anything that, that she didn't do with us.  Laun- the laundry--I had to iron all my father's [Clinton Rosemond] white shirts with no crease, no--or do it over, with--and that was with the dipping starch, and then we had to cut the lawn and rake any of the leaves that, that were falling on any of the garden part to keep it from becoming compost on top of something growing.  We had to keep the--we had to turn the compost pile (laughter), yeah.  We had to collect the eggs, we had to keep the chicken coop clean.  That was a nasty job (laughter).  He raised more chickens than he did rabbits 'cause I guess, I don't know, both of those were not pleasant.  But there was an indoor coop and then an outdoor place for them to run and get worms and, you know, eat from the, from the earth.  So, we had a lot of--we, we, had a lot of chores.  I mean we all had chores to do.
Story_ID: 673829
Speaker 1: Sounded like you had one thought in between about maybe something you and your brothers and sisters did?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was just thinking about the fact that my sister [Eleanor Rosemond] was eight years older, and usually that means that that child becomes the caretaker, like a babysitter.  That didn't happen in my family 'cause my mother [Corinne Meaux] never worked after she had my sister, so my sis- it was never a question of my sister being the res- being totally responsible, you know, for us, and so she was just my big sister.  She didn't--I didn't have to answer to her (laughter), and I grew up with other kids in the neighborhood where that wasn't the case, you know, it was really interesting.  The oldest daughter had total charge of the kids because both parents worked and--or there was only one parent in the house and there were, and there were maybe only two families in the community where there was a divorce or a missing father.  Everybody else was an intact family and, and a lot of them were--and what I mean by intact is, you know, the husband and wife were together raising kids.  And so--but that was the case.  My mother didn't--she had a couple of summer jobs but she was always home to open the door, you know.  She got up in the morning and fixed lunch--breakfast and a bag lunch to take to school, and my sister was never--we--I was thinking about chores and, about chores, that it was never a situation for my sister that she was our babysitter or our caretaker or, you know, "I'm gonna tell mama on you," (laughter).
Speaker 1: And did you all treat your brother [Clinton Rosemond] with the same respect?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, he was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh was he (unclear)?
Speaker 2: --you know, the apple of everybody's eye.  He was the boy, he had--well, he, he didn't get, he didn't get--he wasn't farmed out to anybody, you know what I mean?  My mother was really a stay-at-home mother, and--who didn't--well, I remember maybe one or two babysitters.  You could hardly get her to go out anywhere, you know.  She really wan- she was very content to be at home.
Story_ID: 673830
Speaker 1: Today, do you come across any sights or sounds or smells that take you home?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Like, does anything ever sort of jar your memory where you go, "Oh, I'm in Los Angeles [California]" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, night-blooming jasmine.
Speaker 1: Night?
Speaker 2: Night-blooming jasmine.  That flower always takes me--it's a smell that, that I just associate with really the best of what L.A. was about.  What else?  Well, the sound of the sea.  The sound of--I mean sometimes I just--I go to the--Staten Island [New York].  I, I don't drive.  I can take the ferry and take it back and forth across (laughter) because I like the sound of the water, and I like being on the water and I like where the water--where the image of the water takes me, or I go out to Coney Island [Brooklyn, New York].  I don't go in the water, I just walk the, walk on the boardwalk or I sit on a bench and, you know, eat a, eat a meal or something and listen to the water, and those things always take me back to my childhood because I spent a lot of time--I did my homework at the beach a lot, you know.  A friend and--we were about a--twenty minutes away, half an hour away; and then when I went to City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], we were close and we would just go.  He played flute and he would play his, do his flute lessons on the beach, and I would do my homework.  So the sound of the water, sound of the sea, the--that--the--anything like that takes me back to childhood.  Fresh--I guess when I really get a good salad together, that takes me back to going out into the backyard and just picking--oh, radishes was another thing that we grew, and I loved the little red radish; we didn't grow the white radish.  But whenever I put together a salad, that's always, there's a link with the backyard.  Wisteria blossoms because we had a wisteria vine over a trellis and a stone bench, and that was my wishing bench.  I used to go out there and dream about what I was gonna be or do, so those are the things that take me back, yeah.

Speaker 1: Where'd you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: In L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?  It was called 36th Street School [Birdielee V. Bright Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].  I think they renamed it now for the sixth grade teacher [Birdielee V. Bright].  It was a neighborhood in flux, and there--at each end of the, each end of the school district, there was one black teacher and she was in charge of the sixth grade, and they were sisters.  Their father was a doctor and they were two sisters who were both--neither married I--oh, no, one of them was married.  But they took it upon themselves to make sure that every kid who got to the sixth grade and was gonna graduate into a school that was a white majority and black minority, that they, that they were brought up to standard with all the teachers that they'd had before them who may have slipped past--let them slide, and that's what they said.  She closed the door when you got into her room and she had a ruler--and halitosis.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their name (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You better take that out if I'm gong give you her name; I can't talk about her having stinky breath (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, bad timing of the question.  Okay, back to--she had a ruler and halitosis.
Speaker 2: And she used to take that ruler and said, "Nobody gets out of my room unless they know all of the work that's required of you to know in order to pass this grade.  I don't pass anybody through, and nobody fails in my class."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Whack (demonstrates) (laughter), you know, for emphasis, she'd take the ruler and then on the other side of it, "Nobody fails this class." Bam (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said--
Speaker 2: "Do you understand that?  So you're gonna get whipped into shape in this classroom or you're not getting outta here, and nobody fails in my classroom."
Speaker 1: You will be getting out of here.
Speaker 2: You will be getting out, and you will be knowing all the things that you need to know requisite to the seventh grade with this heavier competition (laughter).
Speaker 1: You said the neighborhood was in flux, so--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, because it was Italians and--
Speaker 1: So, were the majority of students at your school black?
Speaker 2: No, they were white.  That's what I'm saying, they were white.  They were white and there were, and there were maybe a third black, but that third, that's the third she was talking to.
Speaker 1: I see, and then her sister on the other side of town, was she dealing with the same kind of demographic?
Speaker 2: Same kind of--yeah, yeah.  She and the janitor in the school, the one I went to, they were the only black people on the staff, the sixth grade teacher and the custodian.  And her sister was at the other end of the district doing pretty much the same thing, a little less forceful, a little less--little less forceful personality in delivery, but the same kind of commitment.

Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of what you wanted to be when you were in elementary school [36th Street School; Birdielee V. Bright Elementary School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: I think I always wanted to be a musician.  I played all the instruments.  I play--I was in a really, it was a really lush time for music and art, unlike here in New York [New York].  I mean we--there, all the instruments were free.  I was in a choir in the fifth grade, and then in the sixth grade and up through junior high [James A. Foshay Junior High School; James A. Foshay Learning Center, Los Angeles, California] and high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] I, I played--I learned how to read viola clef, I played violin, viola, clarinet, cello, all the, all the symphonic classical drum set.  You know, the triangle, the timpani drum, the snare drum--it's a snare drum; I--and then I got in the marching band to, you know, to march, to be part of the crowd.  But I, I learned how to read all that music.
Speaker 1: So how early in your elementary school career did you start music, or did you start before?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started playing the piano when I was three 'cause I had perfect pitch, so I was sitting down playing Brahms [Johannes Brahms] by, by hearing it, you know.  Things I heard on the radio, I was going over to the piano and they were going--my mother [Corinne Meaux] was going, "Woo, wow. We gotta get her to a teacher," you know, sort of like that.  So, so I--and, and I was in the church [Westminster Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and I sang in the church choir and I sang solo in the church.  My father [Clinton Rosemond] was starting to help me develop my voice.  So I think I've kind of--I didn't--I, I, I think I always wanted to be--I wanted to play piano too.  I had to make a choice between being a tomboy and breaking my fingers playing baseball (laughter), and being able to play the piano 'cause I banged all my knuckles out playing hard ball with no glove, you know (laughter).  I was left-handed so I was the pitcher of choice because that was a good thing to have as a left-handed pitcher with a bunch of right-handed batters on the other team, you know?  But I was, I was throwing my knuckles out and I had to look at my hands and say, "Do I wanna play piano or do I wanna keep this up?"  So, I think for (background noise)--I think I always knew that I wanted to play.
Speaker 1: And how early--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: I'm just rolling the tape back in mind.  So you said you were--so how early did you begin piano instruction?
Speaker 2: I think I was about maybe five or six.
Speaker 1: And was Richie Powell your first teacher, or he came along later (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no.  No, that was after I heard his brother [Bud Powell] play; I mean that was after I got interested in listening to--
Speaker 1: Jazz specifically.
Speaker 2: --jazz, yeah, yeah.  The first was a Professor Gray who was the, the neighborhood professor, who turned his living room into, you know, the studio where kids in the neighborhood took piano lessons.  And I think I took lessons from him for about four or five years.  Then I got--I had some sort of--I mean it was just a little bit too pressured, too much pressure to study and get good grades and keep up the piano, and I started to have these nervous kind of attacks, and so my parents decided I should stop taking lessons for a while.
Speaker 1: About what grade were you then?
Speaker 2: I think I was about--just, I think I was about twelve, so I was about seventh grade or something, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventh grade?  What's your sixth grade teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Bright, B-R-I-G-H-T, Birdielee Bright [Birdielee V. Bright].
Story_ID: 673833
Speaker 1: Where does your family attend church?
Speaker 2: We went to a Presbyterian church, Westminster Presbyterian [Westminster Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: You said you started to develop your voice there?  What kind of activities and concerts did you participate in?
Speaker 2: Well, they had--it, it was a, it was--I call it an anthem kind of church.  I mean it didn't have anything rocking going on in the, in the choir, that's for sure.  But I did--I was part of the junior choir and, and they always had Christmas, had a heavy holiday, every religious holiday they would celebrate.  There was always a pageant or two, three days of, of, of concerts and children's programs and, you know, you recite a long poem and you sing a song, I mean, the whole junior choir would perform, and I would solo maybe, or I would just be part of the, the, the choir.  But I did have a great voice and I did always sing maybe 'O Holy Night' for Christmas, and something else for Easter.  So I did--I--and I was active as a junior Sunday school teacher.  I was in it.  And the church pastor was the father to one of the jazz musicians that I was listening to.  His name was Hampton Hawes, and he was very prominent on the West Coast as a pianist, one--a very interesting life.  He wrote a book called 'Raise Up Off Me' ['Raise Up Off Me: A Portrait of Hampton Hawes,' Hampton Hawes and Don Asher].  He was one of the people who was caught up in the whole heroin thing, and spent time in one of the federal, you know, institutions, but his father was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which one, the, the minister or the--or Hampton Hawes?
Speaker 2: The son, junior--Hampton, the son, the pianist, the jazz pianist.  The father was one of those Adam Clayton Powell kind of fire and brimstone ministers, you know, in a Presbyterian church, but one of those, you know, like expansive, very, very charismatic and very dramatic--big congregation--nice church, but he didn't like jazz.  He thought jazz was the devil's music.  And I was listening to his son play, going out at night and listening to his son play, coming in Sunday morning and teaching in this minister's church while he was talking about the music his son played was the devil's music, so I was having serious inner conflict about that, so I eventually left the church over that issue.  It just wasn't working for me.
Speaker 1: And did you do that on your own, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, pretty much by that time, you know, I grew up in one of those households where my mother [Corinne Meaux] didn't care what church we went to.  She just wanted some, I think, of an idea that this is part of the human existence, you know, your humanity involves some spirituality.  Not necessarily really join--to join a religion, but to acknowledge that there was this part of you.  So--but I went to, I think it was a Mennonite day camp.  It was just, it was there and they were two blocks up, and then they have to cross a big street to get there, you know, but it, it didn't matter to her, really.  And she didn't go to church with us very often.  My father [Clinton Rosemond] went to church.  My mother sent us to church but she didn't really go, you know?  And it wasn't until much later when she was a widow herself, and she got involved in church and church activities again, but she--it wasn't really about the organization or tithing or any of that for her.
Story_ID: 673834
Speaker 1: But I got a lot of--there was also a, a choir in the community run by Jester Hairston.  You know that name from 'Amen.'  He was Rolly [Rolly Forbes] on the TV show, 'Amen.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, he's a very prolific gospel writer.  That's, I mean, before, before his role that we--that a lot of younger people know him in, he, he performed all over the world.  He went and taught, you know, gospel in twenty-four hours and go to Germany and have a gospel sing, you know, and people singing gospel on--at least knowing what it was in two sessions, you know.  So he ran a community choir in the local junior high school, and I was a part of that.
Speaker 2: And what was your junior high?
Speaker 1: Foshay, James A. Foshay Junior High [James A. Foshay Junior High School; James A. Foshay Learning Center, Los Angeles, California].  And oh, we did the 'Hot Mikado' [Rob Bowman and David H. Bell], we did 'Carmen Jones' [Oscar Hammerstein II], we did 'H.M.S. Pinafore' [W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan], we did a lot of light opera stuff, and that was a great experience to have him be a--to just have him take on that, and give the kids that knowledge.  So it was, it was really great.  We learned all those lyrics to all the songs--to 'Carmen Jones,' you know, the story of Carmen, but in the English and with the--that Dorothy Dandridge made famous in the movies.  Yeah, so I was--I felt fortunate.
Story_ID: 673835
Speaker 1: And then in high school was the equivalent of Music and Art--of, of a music and art high school.  It was called Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], and it didn't have the title music and art, but that's where everything was going on, and one of those really dedicated high school teachers that opened the band room at six in the morning and he kept it open 'til five at night, you know, really committed, dedicated.
Speaker 2: What was that band teacher's name?
Speaker 1: Farrar--Mr. Farrar.  I can't remember his first name but his last name was F-F--F-A-R-R-A-R.  Those are the people you really remember, you know?
Speaker 2: By high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California], what kind of a student were you?  I mean--and I don't just mean student, I just mean what kind of a personality were you?
Speaker 1: In high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, were you well-behaved?  Did you--were--you know, were you good--did you look good from the outside but in fact had quite a bit going on, like exactly--even what was your, your steelo?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I think--I mean I was pretty--I was really shy, and I did a--I used to play for a lot of parties, you know, because I learned all the music.  I wasn't that po- I didn't feel like I was really popular.  I feel like a lot--I had a lot of distance between me and the social stuff, but I had really good friends there.  I had a network of friendships, you know, a net- a group that, that we all kind of hung out together and they knew where I was as a musician and they, you know, were proud of me and then we were proud of each other's accomplishments.  The guy who ran track, we all went to the track meets throughout to root for him, you know?  I was pretty studious.   I wasn't a really spectacular student, but I didn't cut class.  I was, you know, I was committed to doing homework and getting through class and being, being there, you know?  I can count on my hands how many times I cut a class, you know, and it was usually music-related (laughter) to go hear Dexter Gordon (laughter) or something like that.
Story_ID: 673836
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that next.  I mean you said your dad [Clinton Rosemond] would take you to the Dunbar Hotel [Los Angeles, California], so talk to me a little bit about that institution, and then just about the jazz that you were able and privy to while you were, you know, a youth, or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, the Dunbar--I mean the Dunbar was, was an experience for me when I was younger, because, as I said before, it was sort of like a hub of activity in the black community.  I got my hair done on the mezzanine, and that same woman did the, did the manicure and the, you know, a, a pedicure--whatever was going on.  There was--the barber shop was there; it was kind of a hub of activity, and that's where all the people stayed who came to perform somewhere else.  So, the Dunbar for me was where I met--where my father would--if I was getting my--let's say if I was getting my hair done.  You know--and we got our hair done (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pressed (laughter).
Speaker 2: And the Lionel Hampton band [Lionel Hampton and His Orchestra] was coming into town, he would say, "Meet me--when you--after you get your hair done, I want you to meet Lionel Hampton; I want you to meet the guys in the band."  That--so that--it meant that for me.  And then, you know, they were gonna stand around in the bar and drink, so he'd say, "Okay, I'll see you when"--or, "I'm going to get on the bus to go back home."  So the Dunbar represented that for me; I mean he took me there to meet Marian Anderson when she came into town to do concerts, and I met--who else?  Oh, Roland Hayes I met; I met Paul Robeson.  I met all the people that were important in his life or who came there, and I met them on the--what I call, you know, on the floor of the Dunbar Hotel.  And later, the Dunbar--I, I don't remember going there to hear music, you know?  I don't think that there was a performance room in there; I think that that was just where people were.
Story_ID: 673837
Speaker 1: My own experience in the city [Los Angeles, California]--I can't remember this man's name.  I don't know why, and may--and I can't remember anybody who would remember how to remember him, but he was a blues player.  He--and I used to go to this club, and he was playing there.  I sat in one night, and he asked me if I would be interested in working with him.  I was underage for one thing (laughter).  I wasn't supposed to be in there, but my mother [Corinne Meaux]--but I had told my mother that I had, had been there, and he came home with me to ask my mother if I could work with him on--I think it was--it wouldn't interfere with anything that I was doing, but like one night a week, Friday night, and, and I could--and I wanted to because here was a chance to work with a blues person, but I didn't have any business in this bar.  So my mother said to him, "You know, I'm not supposed to let this child do this, so I'm, I'm putting her in your and God's hands.  If anything happens to her, do you know you're going to jail?"  (Laughter) And he said, "Yes, ma'am."  He had his hat in his hand.  "Okay, so we'll try it 'cause if she comes in here with liquor on her breath, or smelling like cigarettes, you going to jail.  I know she wants to play this music, but you're going to jail."  And she didn't say, "I'm coming with you," either.  She didn't say, "You can do it but I'm coming with you."  She told me I could, and she told him if anything happened to me, he was going to jail, so (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: And he was hiring you to play piano?
Speaker 1: (Nods head)  And he did.  Boy, he--as soon as I got off that piano, he had a little place for me in the back, and he said, "Don't you move, don't you move," (laughter).  But my mother let me do that, and I got a lot of ex- I mean it was a lot of experience. I guess maybe I was, I was about to graduate.
Speaker 2: Were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was maybe fifteen, sixteen, you know, but I wasn't supposed to be in a bar, that's for sure.  And then--I'm trying to think of one of the first people--well, my father [Clinton Rosemond] was the first person to hire me away from the jazz scene, but I played church concerts for him, and the very first one was he, he paid me seven dollars to play 'Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho' and 'Balm in Gilead' ['There Is A Balm in Gilead], and all of those black spirituals that were arranged by Hall Johnson.  Then I was hired by--now, I'm getting a little closer to be--to graduating from high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California]--Teddy Edwards, who was a tenor saxophone player, and a woman named Vi Redd, who's still active on the West Coast.  I think she's teaching now, but she might even be in administration, but she's still, she's still playing.  Vi Redd hired me, and--who else?  Vernon Slater was another tenor player, and the rooms that I played in were like--there was the Root Yacht [ph.], the Oasis--the Club Oasis [Los Angeles, California]; I worked with Johnny Otis Big Band, with Little Esther Phillips, in the Oasis, and she must have been about--I guess we were both about the same age, maybe 14, 15, 16.  There was a room called The Purple Onion [San Francisco, California], and then there was another room owned by Kenny Dennis.  Kenny Dennis--I think he was married to [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson--real pretty room.  I played solo piano in there, and I can't remember the name of that room.  It was a real pretty room up in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  Where else?  Oh, the club, Troubadour [West Hollywood, California], was another room that I worked in, and it was kind of like a coffee house that was a little--maybe '52 [1952], '53 [1953], '54 [1954], and I can't think of any more rooms that I worked when I was a kid.
Speaker 2: Did your folks--clearly, your friends probably weren't supposed to be in the bar either, but did your folks ever come and see you play?
Speaker 1: My mother [Corinne Meaux] never came to see me play until she came to New York [New York].  She didn't come.  She didn't like bars.
Story_ID: 673838
Speaker 1: I remember when I met Marian Anderson.  She was tall--at least I remember her as being tall, and I guess maybe it was because I was so small, and in comparison I don't know if she was really, really a big tall woman or not, but to me she was huge, and my father [Clinton Rosemond] introduced me to her and she took my hand, and her hand covered my hand, all right?  She--so that's why I thought--and I looked up and it was like she just kept going up and up, and her hand was so big around mine.  She said (imitates Marian Anderson), "Hello, Bertha Jean [HistoryMaker Bertha Hope], how are you?  Your father tells me you're going to be a great musician one day.  I'm so happy to meet you."  It was just so--her voice was so resounding, you know?  It was just--I just felt, oh.  Like that--just sort of, "Oh, my goodness."  And I had already been listening to her.  I knew who she was, you know.  The other person that I met was Dinah Washington, and I was working in a club.  I think it was the--oh--oh, it might have been the Oasis [Club Oasis, Los Angeles, California], and so it was a large room, I can't think of it, and one of the publicists, like a photographer--I think she was also a musician but she was hanging out with the photographer and she said, "Oh, I want you to meet Dinah because Dinah should know you.  You're a young person coming up, and I want her to know who you are."  So Dinah Washington was walking into the room with either a chinchilla or a sable, I don't know, one of 'em, but really, really expensive fur coat, wasn't mink--I knew what that looked like.  It was--and it was big.  It was like--almost like cape like (unclear), and she came walking in like, "Here I am."  And this woman stopped her and said, "Oh, Dinah, look, I want you to meet this young lady.  She's just getting started and we gotta nurture her, you know, like--and her name is Bertha.  This is Dinah Washington, this is Bertha Rosemond."  Dinah Washington took off the coat and made a sweeping gesture with it and laid it out on the floor in front of me and bowed like (curtsies).  I mean she didn't speak; she just took off this fabulous coat and swung it around like this (demonstrates), and laid it down on the floor, and made a little curtsy, and I was going, "Oh!  So nice to meet you."  (Unclear).  What was I supposed to say?  "Oh, it's so nice to meet you," (laughter).  I don't know what that was supposed to mean, but I thought that would make a good little story anyway.  Ten years later, you know, my, my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --second husband's drummer mate--you know they played for all these people as a pair--Jimmy Cobb and, and Walter Booker.  He was married to her and so he told me more stories after that.  I said, "You're kidding."  He said no, he was married to her for--I guess he got married to her when he was a--maybe nineteen or twenty.  He was obviously--
Speaker 2: Had she been as fabulous at twenty, or in her earlier years?
Speaker 1: I, I, I don't know--I don't know, so I, I don't know where to put that together unless he got--I must have met her around '52 [1952], or something else to--I mean I was a kid--fifty--I'll give it--yeah, yeah, '52 [1952], and he's maybe--what, thirteen years older than I am, and he was nineteen when she married him, or they got married.  But it, it was very interesting, that introduction.  I've never been introduced to anybody who's done anything quite that flamboyant (laughter) again.
Story_ID: 673839
Speaker 1: Were there any other girls in your--in a similar position as you?  Did you know other young women who were becoming singers or pianists or played other instruments (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there's a big difference now, you can't compare people becoming instrumentalists in 1954 with singers, 'cause singers have always been the only people that were ever recognized.  And they, and they still don't always get their just desserts even now, you know.  But singers would get--you'd hear about a woman singer because though that was the jazz entree in, or even blues all the way back to Mamie Smith or, you know, Bessie Smith are the people who are really big record sellers and people who got all the attention.  None of them were instrumentalists, and I didn't know any other in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  There were others, and I think Dorothy Donegan was in L.A. but she's a little older than I was.  I didn't--our paths or a lot of people were in L.A. who I didn't meet.  They were like ten years--there's enough difference for me to not be on the same place of socialization, you know.  I'd have to have met them somewhere at a party or--but not to play with or work with.  The trumpet player--there was a trumpet player there.  Clora Bryant was there.  I'm trying to think of women, but the others were singers--Joyce Bryant, Dorothy Dandridge, those were all singers and they--I didn't cross paths with them.
Speaker 1: And what about male instrumentalists who were about your age?  Who was coming with you?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see.  Around my age, there was a [HistoryMaker] H.B. Barnum who ended up being Aretha Franklin's musical director and still might work with her, I don't know.  Ornette Coleman, those were people that were in L.A. around the time.  Billy Higgins the drummer; he and I were really very close friends.  He and I listened to a lot of records together, we had a little band together--Billy Higgins and Dave Pike, the vibist [vibraphonist], we had a trio.  Carla Bley, Paul Bley, those people were all around at the same time that I was.  Carla Bley and Paul Bley played in the Troubadour [West Hollywood, California] in that coffee house.  Who else?  James Clay, I don't know if you know that name or not.  He's a Texas tenor; he was from Texas.
Speaker 1: You said Janice?
Speaker 2: Janice?
Speaker 1: What--just now you said someone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) James.
Speaker 1: James?
Speaker 2: You were asking me about instrumentalists, male or female--
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: --and I think that he, he--golly, I don't know where he ended up.  Well, everybody went through the Lionel Hampton band, you know, but I'm trying to think of people--
Speaker 1: What's a Texas tenor?
Speaker 2: Tenors who were in Los Angeles from Texas (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where'd you--
Speaker 2: As opposed to tenor players or other horn players who grew up somewhere else.  There's something about the Texas sound, and I don't really know it--it's a swing; they have serious rhythm and are kind of distinguishable.  I mean Fathead Newman [David "Fathead" Newman], Hank Crawford, Harold Land, they all come from Texas.
Story_ID: 673840
Speaker 1: Where'd you get your music?
Speaker 2: Where'd I get my music?
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean were there--was there a record store, or did you all sort of get it from--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the mail from New York [New York], and then you shared it amongst one another?  Like where was your--where were your new records coming from?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess we got 'em from just, you know, from the record store or from hearing them, or hearing them usually out of somebody's collection.  That's where I first heard Bud Powell, somebody gave me--they loaned me the record; they said, "Why are you listening to all this West Coast jazz?  Listen to this."  And that led me to Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], that led me to Elmo [Elmo Hope].  The Bud Powell record led me to [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, to all these other East Coa- to, to what was then being, you know, this big division between hard bop and West Coast cool jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's focus on that incident a little bit.  You said someone said, you know, "You been listening to Dave Brubeck.  You need to hear Bud Powell."  So can you just tell us a little bit about that experience for you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  This was an artist, his name was Danny Johnson [Daniel LaRue Johnson].  He worked a lot in, in acrylic on wood eventually, but he was just one of these people that was--you could see he was going to march to the sound of a different drummer even then, you know?  There were about seven or eight kids that, that loved jazz, that did things that didn't have anything to do with what the regular crowd was doing, and he was a visual artist and, and, and he was--he--I think he was--he and Billy Higgins were probably the most progressive out of my friends.  Billy Higgins was then getting ready to work with Ornette and Don Cherry and Charlie Haden, and that's how I got to just hear that band 'cause I was friendly with Billy and we were both listening and playing together in our own little band.  So he--so that was like a revelation for me when I took this record home, and put it on.  It was just--it just turned me on my head.  It was just, just--I had never heard anything like it.  And the combination of the rhythm and the kind of--the way he--the, the harmony was applied was very--it was--it didn't--it had--it didn't resolve.  It was suspended, you know, and it was going somewhere else, and your ear was continually not able to rest yet.  No, West Coast jazz was not like that, yeah.  So, it just turned me into another direction of hearing and being involved in music that--more music like that, more music that had those kind of parameters to it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you know--?
Speaker 2: So it was a big moment for me when that guy gave me that record--big, big mo--I just--I went home, I took the record home, I put it on the box, and I sat up and listened to it and played, played it 'til about 3:00 in the morning, 'til my mother [Corinne Meaux] said, "When are you going to bed?"  (Laughter) "You going to bed any time soon?"  They were very tolerant but it, it really did turn, turn me around.
Speaker 1: And did you know immediately that, that this was your genre?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or did you feel that way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did; I really felt that way.  I didn't know if that was going to happen but I knew that this was--it was all part of the same music, but this was a different aspect of it that I--that definitely needed more exploration from me--by me.
Speaker 1: And so you indicated you kind of came with a list earlier when you discussed getting the record and, you know, you said Bud Powell led you to these other folks, so could you slow that down a bit and just tell us sort of your trajectory from--and what's this first album?  I know it's a Bud Powell album, but do you remember what it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--oh, I think it was called 'Something Else' [sic. 'The Amazing Bud Powell, Volume I'].
Speaker 1: So after 'Something Else,' what was some--what else (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Bud Powell.  Yeah, what else?  But we had the CD--it had the record--it had the cut with "Un Poco Loco" on it, and I may be getting it mixed up with an Ornette Coleman album called 'Something Else!!!!'  Now I can't remember what the name of it was, but they had had that cut on it, and that was the cut that, that tweaked my interest the most.
Story_ID: 673841
Speaker 1: And so when I heard that ["Un Poco Loco"], I took that record ['The Amazing Bud Powell, Volume I'] and we were still dealing with Heathkits and the LP [LP record], you know?  I put that LP on and I played it all night, and I played it all night and tried to play the song along with the record all night.  It was so jarringly different, and it really--I listened to--I, I can't re- I think it was before I went to college.  So I mean the harmony, the, the, the studies that I took meant a lot where--I looked at them a lot differently after having heard that application, you know?  Because it was a very progressive first class that I took at the City College, LACC [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], along with Eric Dolphy. He was my buddy, and we went to school together pretty much.
Speaker 2: What year did you go to City College?
Speaker 1: Fifty--like from '54 [1954] to '56 [1956].  So the first class was something that you wouldn't ordinarily expect for a music major to start with that kind of harmony.  It was a Hindemith--a Paul Hindemith, which is kind of a very, more avant-garde than the, the classical--the more classical approach that would deal with Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] or Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Brahms [Johannes Brahms] harmonies and re-harmonizations rather than that particular composer, so--but it's--the whole idea of studying the harmonies meant a lot more to me after hearing Bud Powell than before.
Speaker 2: So after Bud Powell, what, what, what person did you learn about next?
Speaker 1: I think it was Thelonious [Thelonious Monk]. I think I heard Thelonious at--it was the piano players, and Elmo was the last (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I see.
Speaker 1: And--well, they, they were all very close, and how they harmonized and how they treated the music, and in how they all came from Bach, pretty much.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that a little bit?  My next question was gonna be, you know, what was unique about these bebop players and their attitude you're saying.  Talk to me about how it comes from Bach.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean their, their dexterity, the lightness and the, the counter-point, the, the interplay between the left hand and the right hand.  They--first of all, they all studied classically, and Bach was pretty much the, the point of entry, the repertoire and be- and there's a lot to be said for that because it's not, it's not so much the chordal approach as it was a, a melodic approach that was really very appealing to, I would imagine to jazz, to any jazz player was for me, too.  And so there was a lot of interplay and interlocking and counterpoint, one melody against another, and a fast right hand and a slower chordal left hand, that was very much the Bud Powell style, the way he sounded.  That was Elmo Hope's style, you know?  Thelonious had--was a little bit more angular, and played with his hands flat to the keyboard like that (demonstrates).  Instead of curved, you know, his fingers were flat, and he played scales with his fingers out, flat, and got a different sound because of that, too, very striking bell-like sound from, from a good piano, you know.  So, I think that I learned--I think I heard Thelonious next, and then Elmo, and then I started listening to the horn players--

Speaker 1: And how do you find Richie Powell out of this album like physically?  Do you start going to see him because you recognize (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I just kind of stumbled onto Richie because he was part of--he was the pianist with Max Roach's band [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet], and they were all on the West Coast putting that band together for tours and for whatever their projects were, and they were practicing right around the corner from my house because Eric [Eric Dolphy] lived right around the corner [in Los Angeles, California], so I had easy access to that band's rehearsals.  You know, I got invited to just, you know, come over and listen to them play.  So after school and after homework and stuff like that, I would go over and stay there all night, and then--and Eric would walk me home, two blocks, at one, two o'clock in the morning when they finished.  It was fabulous; it was a wonderful--it was really a wonderful way to absorb, you know, un- undisturbed, just to absorb the music.  And it doesn't happen so much now; you sit in a--you know, you go to an insti- these kids do, anyway, and they practice five or six hours whether they practice somebody else's solo.  They transcribe.  What do they transcribe?  Something that somebody else wrote, and they play it over and over and over and over--five or six hours they do that all day long, so they all sound alike.  How, how else--how could you not, if your assignment is to go home and transcribe a, a John--transcribe a John Coltrane solo and, you know, you perform it with the quintet on Friday (laughter)?
Speaker 1: This was not happening (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, not then.  You'd listen--you had to hear, you had to listen.
Speaker 1: And people were creating their own music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean nobody wanted to play anybody else's solo.  Nobody wanted to play anybody else's solo, you know.  Everybody was--that's why we go all the way back to the horn players and their sound and you start to be able to individualize what they sound like, and what it was that they did to make the music their own, you know.  And I pick the saxophone players now 'cause they have great proliferation and they've all been listening to somebody else, or they all took lessons from--let's say let's start with Joe Henderson.  All those white guys that took lessons from Joe Henderson all sound like Joe Henderson, but they don't sound like themselves, you know, because it's not required for you to sound like that anymore.  You just need to play quick, fast, slow, Latin.  I mean this is how, this is how they teach, so--
Speaker 1: And how did your over-night rehearsals with the Max Roach--
Speaker 2: They weren't rehearsals; I didn't play anything with them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No-no, no-no; I thought you were visiting while they rehearsed.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was there, yes.
Speaker 1: How did you develop that, and how did that develop into your teaching relationship with Richie Powell?
Speaker 2: I just asked him if he would give me lessons as long as they were in town.  I just, just asked him if he would; I mean I could hear where his, where hi- his--a, a lot of what he knew had come from, you know, and he listened a lot to his brother [Bud Powell], too.  But he, he was a, a lot more lyrical.  I mean he had his own style, and so I just, I just got up enough nerve to ask him if he would give me lessons after or in-between, or whenever he had time if, if we could work it out.  Their--'cause their rehearsals usually started late and they ended late, you know, and when they weren't rehearsing--for a whole period of time there when they weren't, when they weren't rehearsing from like maybe six to midnight, but that--he would come over and give me a lesson after class; six to seven, he would write out a lesson for me, and then he would sit there and play because he loved the piano.  He loved the piano and he just played it 'til, 'til my mother [Corinne Meaux] said, "You have to leave," (laughter).  And she never would--she never said that either, she would just say, "Isn't it--it's about time that we, you know, it's about time that you--?  You gotta go to school in the morning; you gotta"--'cause she loved it, too, you know.  But--so that's how that happened.  I just--it, it didn't seem like it would be a bad idea or hard to accomplish because they were so close.  The house was so close to the rehearsal space, you know?  So it turned out to be a great benefit for me.
Speaker 1: How long did you study with him, and what were the benefits?
Speaker 2: Well, the benefits were that I got to be able to get a hands-on lesson from a real player in a real band.  You know, it wasn't (unclear); I wasn't--it wasn't twice or three times removed.  It was going on now, he was playing with that band now.  I was getting that, and I got really solid harmony.  He, he gave me--what I got from him were harmony lessons, I mean harmony in theory.  He wrote it out--where the chords should be and what the relationship of this chord was to the next chord, and to play that through all the keys.  He didn't--he wasn't very--it wasn't complicated, it was just a lot of work to be able to master that.  I think maybe I took lessons for the length of maybe eight months.

Speaker 1: You and Eric Dolphy are at City--
Speaker 2: College (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) College of L.A. [City College of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Do you have a particular major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ma--I was major--I was a music major.
Speaker 1: And do--and piano is your instrument there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And are you doing quite a bit of performing while you're in college?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, not a lot, but I did--yeah, I did work on the weekends.  It was mostly working on the weekends 'cause I was also working.
Speaker 1: So you don't have a B.A. in early childhood education, or you have that also (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I do, but that--yeah, I came--I finished that here.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: I mean I--it's Antioch [Antioch College]; the degree comes from Antioch in Yellow Springs, Ohio, but I did a music major for two years at LACC, from '54 [1954] to '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: And what did you do after you finished your music major?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I didn't complete that major. I didn't--
Speaker 1: Oh, it would have been a four-year program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been a four-year program; City College (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry; the way you described the LACC I, I, I switched it in my mind and made it in a--sort of an associates or a--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was a four--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: No, I just didn't complete it, yeah.  I just--I didn't, I didn't complete the, the years.
Speaker 1: So you went for two years, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I was playing--let's see, where was I playing then?  I was playing, I think, with Johnny Otis, with that band [Johnny Otis Big Band].  By '55 [1955]--was it '55 [1955]?  The--that--the Max Roach band [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet] was tragically, you know--came to an end because Richie [Richie Powell] and his wife [Nancy Powell] and Clifford Brown were killed in an automobile accident, and that band was just like (shrugs).  I didn't--that was sort of like the end of that part of my--that era for me that I wasn't able to--it was just the end.  It was devastating for everybody that--that, that was such a tragic loss, and it changed everything.  So I gotta go back to there (laughter), and figure out where I was.
Speaker 1: You were--
Speaker 2: Fifties [1950s].
Speaker 1: --talking about where you were performing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the fact that you did two years at L.A. City College, and that's--
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to figure out what other gigs were in there.
Speaker 1: Oh, and you said that--you expressed that you had played with the Johnny Otis band.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--I think that was--I know that was on the weekend because I was work--I was, by then I was working to my--working at the same job that I had before I started college and I was kind of working my way through college.
Story_ID: 673844
Speaker 1: Then I had--I got--I was, got married in '57 [1957], very--a very--
Speaker 2: Well first we--did--first we want you to meet your husband.
Speaker 1: Oh, we didn't meet him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you meet him?
Speaker 1: Okay, I met him at the l- the cl- the Troubadour [West Hollywood, California].
Speaker 2: And he's--
Speaker 1: The, the club where Paul Blay and Carla Blay--well, actually Carla Blay was--Paul Blay was working there, Carla Blay was a waitress, and he was the bass player.  Not the bass player--not this latest bass player.  This was like a very early and tragic and a mistake of a marriage that didn't last very long.  I was trying to figure out where was I between--that's where I was.  And then I--and, and it didn't--that marriage did not last very long. It was almost sort of like a--it, it just shouldn't have happened, you know what I mean?  It was like a, a--just my first experience in the--really independence, you know.  It was something about a marriage made in hell.
Story_ID: 673845
Speaker 1: So, Eric Dolphy was your neighbor [in Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You've spoken a little bit about him but could you just--could we start off today by you telling me who he is, and maybe giving a few anecdotes about living and practicing together nearby?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, he was a pretty amazing musician, first of all.  Very well-prepared, classically trained, audition material for the L.A. Philharmonic [Los Angeles Philharmonic], and he auditioned for that group and of course he didn't get in, because he was black.
Speaker 1: About what year did he audition for the L.A. Philharmonic?
Speaker 2: I, I have a--I feel--it had to be after '54 [1954] 'cause I think he came home from the [U.S.] Army around that time, and put his veterans benefits to immediate use so--and I, I don't know when Henry Lewis, who is black, became the first black conductor of the L.A. Philharmonic, but the two things may not have even had anything to do with each other, since, especially in the '50s [1950s], one person, one per, per-category.  This, this climate was not conducive to letting a lot of black people in anywhere; it was the first black this, first black that, only black.  So I, I'd have to really go back and check my timeline about when Henry Lewis got that position when Henry--and when Eric Dolphy applied and was turned down.  That was very heart-breaking for him because he knew he was well-prepared for it.  So he belonged to musical community organizations that my sister [Eleanor Rosemond] belonged to.  They were really in the same age group.  He and I got together and decided that we would carpool since he was going to Los Angeles City College [Los Angeles, California] also, had decided to take the music program which was really very good, so in order to save gas and to also study together and talk together, we carpooled.  He would drive two days a week and I'd drive three, and then we'd switch it the next week.  He was very disciplined, and we talked a lot about scales and different scales, and different scale patterns.  He was really more interested in get--being prepared so that he could master the instrument and be able to improvise, but to be able to know your instrument upside down.  So he would always tell me, "We have to practice these scales and we have to get them faster and faster."  So we did a lot of that; we did very little playing of songs, or compositions, or material; we played scales together.  And he--around that time, Clifford Brown--the Max Roach band [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet] was in town and somehow they connected with him because he had this free rehearsal space, and Eric was also very close to Clifford and Harold Land and Max Roach, and so they rehearsed in Eric's space.  So Eric would come over my house and tell my mother [Corinne Meaux] that this great band was rehearsing at his house, and that I really needed to--it was part of my musical education to be there and to hear them play.  I mean I was just thrilled that he would do that and he, and he promised my mother that he would walk me home every night, that, you know, in other words, ain't nothing funny going on.  I was really there to hear the rehearsal.  Well, the rehearsals were unbelievable because they would go on all night; I mean really all night.  I understand that fervor and that drive now because I have done that since, you know, with my own band and with, with people in the neighborhood where we would just get together and play until 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 'til the sun came up.  But I didn't know that intensity then with my own--in my own musical world, so it was amazing to go over and watch them rehearse and fall asleep in their clothes, and get up, and they didn't really take a shower.  They would just throw some water on their face and wake up again, eat a little something, drink some coffee, and go right back to work, and maybe by that time I really had to go home, and he--we both had 8:00 classes so--but it was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 673846
Speaker 1: So, do you remember any of those sessions with Clifford Brown and Harold Land and Max Roach (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, those are the ones I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: No, no, but I mean specifically like can you tell us--we were asking for some Eric Dolphy anecdotes, like can you tell us some of their nuances, some of--just, you know, take us to one particular evening.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Eric talked a lot.  I mean he--when he had a high voice and a very breathy voice, it was like, "Yeah, I been trying to get that B-flat on my horn that's--it's like outta range, you know?  But I'm gonna struggle until I can really get it."  Clifford was--while the band wasn't rehearsing Clifford was very quiet, and a shy guy.  He might put the horn--point the horn down toward the floor and play to himself a few bars, and be very contemplative, you know?  Harold was much the same way.  If they weren't working on a song, they were usually practicing to themselves, you know?  It was all very intense.  I don't remember them ever breaking down to do a lot of laughter or joke-telling or anything like that.  I, I remember that in--but I--no, I don't remember that in any band that I was in, or that I ever watched rehearse at that level of intensity.  They would take a break, you know, and maybe smoke, you know, but--and get something to drink, but it was hard work and, and they were really focused and concentrated on what, what the work--the night's work was, if it was one song, or if it was to get one passage clear.  And they did a lot of the beginning and endings of songs.  It was very, very rarely that they practiced at night and everybody took a long solo that they--that work, I guess they worked out at some other, some other space and some other time.  Sometimes they did--after they were really comfortable with something, then everybody would do what they call go through the changes so that everybody could--so that each person was familiar with the improvisational content of the piece, but mostly, the hard work was about intonation, about phrasing, about the front line playing the song together and breathing together, and interpreting the music that was the written portion and, and then sometimes figuring out an ending for, for an arrangement.  I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: And what about Max Roach?
Speaker 2: Well, he was sort of--how can I put it?  It was his band, but I mean the, the real, the real work was to get Clifford Brown and Harold Land to sound as one, you know.  He was a leader who was there.  I mean, I don't remember that he contributed music to it, but he would--always might have a--he was just always there to be--for somebody to--if somebody would say, you know, this was what--the, the kind of a beat that they expected, or that--or the flavor, not to really tell him what to, to bring to it but--because he also read and, you know, wrote himself.  But I don't remember how much of that band was his writing; I, I'd have to go back really and look at what they recorded.  It was very short-lived; it wasn't a band that lasted very long because of the tragic accident that took Richie [Richie Powell] and Clifford, not even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: --two years afterwards, yeah.
Speaker 1: Very soon--very soon afterward.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I consider myself really lucky in having heard the embryonic stages of that band and--
Speaker 1: And what did they call themselves at that time?
Speaker 2: I think it was Clifford Brown--Clifford Brown Max Roach Quintet [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet].
Story_ID: 673847
Speaker 1: And were they [Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet] playing bebop?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean they were playing what I came to know as bebop, and there are so many different definitions of--oh, are you gonna ask me for a bebop definition (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure am; I wasn't gonna worry about it because you were just gonna parlay right into it.  I mean are there particular notes or chords that you're using when you're playing bebop?  Or, you know, what defines the space?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I think the relationship of the notes to one another.  I don't know what the definition of the space might be between swing--between the construction of a chord and a whole sequence of chords that would in the swing tradition.  The, the architecture of the--of the chords if the--if we're talking about chords, and the fact that the real bottom of the chord would be what we'd expect to hear the bass player play, and that the stack of chords would have a certain mathematic relationship in swing.  And also the rhythmic derivation would be changed, and in bebop, those chords would be turned on their head, or they would be spaced a little differently; the notes are spaced in a different way.  The bottom of the note would be on the top, and also the, the rhythm's regularity would be altered.  And, and there was a space in time when--you know, the musicians that played--that played bop were, before that, playing swing, and before that they played rhythm and blues, you know.  I mean Elmo [Elmo Hope] and Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], Coltrane [John Coltrane], all of those people played rhythm and blues.  Elmo spent months on the road with a, a, a rhythm and blues band, and that was--which I will get to later, was one of the reasons why he was out of town during the Minton's [Minton's Playhouse, New York, New York], kind of fulminating period of jam sessions and the open jam session, and the sharing of material that sounded different.
Story_ID: 673848
Speaker 1: And I think economically and historical factors had a lot to do with it, too because it was the--it was after World War I [WWI], you know.  I'm talking about the break between swing and something else.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, excuse me, there are a lot of big bands who kept a lot of musicians employed and who were on the road, and a lot of that came to an end as the war effort dried up and the soldiers came back, job--the job and economic market changed, and so smaller band--the, the big bands that played for dances were not economically viable anymore, and so this new music was part of a trend to find other solutions from--for, for those situations.
Speaker 2: And so how do you think that social time period (background noise) produced that sound?  Like how is it that the--those social con--that social time flipped that swing note from the bottom--by being bottom to being top?
Speaker 1: Well, I think it was a big part--there was a lot of experimentation going on, and I, and I think there was some genius involved in it, too.  Charlie Parker found out mathematically that if he played ahead of the changes, he could get a different sound, and he also found out that he could extend, you know, the movement of, of the numbers that the, that the notes had all the way up to the thirteenth, which is as far as jazz goes in numbering in terms of math--what the notes are called, by numbers.  When he--he found that when he played those in a certain way, that there was a--some tension and release that didn't happen, so it got--it was--it had a lot to do with the math of where the phrase started and where it ended in order to end unresolved, to end with suspense, to end with apprehension, and with, with what--that's actually called a suspension.  And, and it was also unplayable if you didn't work at it, you know?  You had to find some way to make the music work through--work for yourself.  I think that individualism had a lot to do with that, too, that they all sound so different.  Now, it's so formulaic but the, the laws were laid down at a time when people were eager to experiment and to find ways to have a palette that, that other people couldn't just step into, other, other people could not come and sit in with.  White musicians could not come and take these jobs away because they didn't know this formula.  I'm sure that all of that was part of the fabric, so they were mysterious on purpose.
Speaker 2: But a white musician could access swing--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah; well, yes.
Speaker 2: --very easily.
Speaker 1: Much more easily.  It took a while.  You had to stand next to somebody, or you had to have extremely big ears, you know.  And you had to play--I mean people who played this music wore these records out, you know, when they were recorded.  But remember, the, the recording of--to my best knowledge anyway, was around the '40s [1940s], in the middle of the '40s [1940s], with Blue Note [Blue Note Records] and Prestige [Prestige Records], when the, when the bop era--people started to put this music down.  I, I don't--there may be some earlier than that but I know the Blue Note and Blue--and Prestige were the major labels that gave this music an opportunity to be recorded, and they were mostly small groups, if I'm not mistaken (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Trios and quartets and
Speaker 1: --quintets, sextets and, and there were a few people, like Coleman Hawkins, who played tenor saxophone who bridged, very successfully, the gap between what was considered the dance music, the swing, and what wasn't so danceable, which was--had a little bit more definition and mystery and--or, or a different concept, different concept; all very highly individualized, I think.
Story_ID: 673849
Speaker 1: Did you perceive a difference in--I mean clearly there's a difference between bop and swing, because you're not dancing, but did you perceive a difference in the audiences, or did the swing audience flow into the, the bop arena?
Speaker 2: Well, now, I wasn't present really for the swing audiences.  I mean I'm about ten years--I always say I was born in this little strange place.  It's ten years too young for, you know, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt--that crew that were coming right out of--out of the swing era and, and went right into, you know, a, a bop sensibility, and ten years too late (laughter) for, for the next group that, that came along who--let me think of who.  Well, people like--who are in their sixties now, and who are holding down--I can't think of who, but I just know that I grew up feeling like I was really sort of in-between the--that group of people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You caught the gap.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Not that there aren't a lot, but I think, you know, if you look now, our masters are in their eighties--a Jimmy Heath, James Moody--those people that--those are saxophone players.  Hank Jones, who plays piano, he's in his eighties. I think Oscar Peterson is a--right around there; they're in their, their, their eighties for the most part.  Clark Terry--the people who are really innovators who are still with us, but who bridged the gap from swing and from the bands that traveled and did the, the circuits to being able to have their own music imprinted and published, and who are still traveling, who are still tent- as tentative as they might be, they are still on their feet and they are still working.
Story_ID: 673850
Speaker 1: Now you said bop had a fantastic element of individualism.  Do you think that individualism affected its listeners?  And could you also talk a little bit more about that individualism protecting the music, in particular, from a white influence?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they had to come to hear it.  I mean I think that the audiences grew along with the music, but I think it was--it grew up before, before bop could be exposed and have a place to live in a commercial sense, because nobody knew what it was, and people were--it was foreign to the club owners and foreign to the audiences, too, and you didn't dance to it.  I think that it, it first caught on in people's houses.  Whoever had a piano and who--and people who really enjoyed the music had these people over to help create this sound, and I think a lot of the early listeners heard it in the neighborhoods where these people--from the stories that I've heard about Elmo [Elmo Hope] and Thelonious and Bud [Bud Powell] going from house to house to all the people where they--that they knew who had pianos, and this crowd that followed them, you know, while they worked out their music, and shared with each other what they were working on, what they were writing on--what they were writing.  Minton's [Minton's Playhouse, New York, New York] was one of the first to hire Thelonious Monk as a soloist when I, I have to think that the club was half empty, you know.  So, it changed--the music changed how people heard, I think, how they listened because it was a new palette.  I guess it's sort of like looking at a Rembrandt and then now you're looking at a Renoir [Pierre-Auguste Renior], you know.  It's a different interpretation of somebody's idea of reality, you know, or unreality for that matter, but it's--it has a different disposition, and you take it in in a different part of your soul, a different part of your brain.  You know, you look at a Rembrandt and it says one thing to you and a Renoir, or a Jacob Lawrence or a, you know, a tissue paper collage by Romare Bearden, they all speak to you in different ways.  I think that it's very much the same, and I don't know if audiences could speak to it, you know?  People say to me, "I love jazz, it's so relaxing.  That's my cool-out music."  Jazz is intense to me (laughter), it's--furthest thing.  I would not put on a Charlie Parker record to relax; it's too intense.  I'm listening, I guess, in a different way.
Story_ID: 673851
Speaker 1: Well, how do you listen?  Do you think that you listen differently than others (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably, because I'm a musician.  Yeah, I think all musicians listen differently, and I think they can't help it.  I don't think I can act like a layman and listen to a piece of music without listening for certain nuances, listening for discord, accord, listening for what I'm used to in terms of how the music is strung together, and if I hear it and if I'm not hearing that what is it, I'm hearing instead what is that voicing that's on the top?  What are the horns--who are the horns in the middle?  Yeah, I'm tearing the thing apart as I'm listening to it.  I'm, I'm--I, I am constantly--you know, it's like a--maybe tearing it apart so that I can--and then I'd put it on again and then put it back together again in my head, you know, and finally, on the seventh or eighth hearing, maybe just sit back and close my eyes and try to listen to the piece as an aggregate, as a whole, yeah.
Speaker 1: You told us about the first time that you heard bebop.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your listening begin to change then?
Speaker 2: Right then. Yeah, absolutely, because I was listening to, to a configuration and a rhythm that I had never been exposed to before, and the use of harmony and--yeah, harmony--the use of harmony.  The, the--where the, where the chords resolved and how long they stayed in a, in an unresolved form.  It just carried me away.  It--yes, I think as soon as I heard that I knew that there was something else to hear, and that I had to start listening to that in order to train my ear to hear that differently.  And I don't think I was so technical about it; I was just thinking, "Well, the more I listen to Bud Powell, the more I'm going to hear this dissonance, this different way to resolve the melody set into a different rhythmic situation."  It was--it took my breath away.  I guess I was fifteen, and I stayed up all the way.  I know that is that I stayed up all that first night after having had this LP [LP record] loaned to me because the person who, you know, put it in my hands said, "I'm not giving you this," (laughter).  "You can borrow this," he said, "but I think you need to hear this and you're going to hear something different," and he said, "and get back to me, I wanna talk to you after you, you know, after you listen to it."  But he, he was really right because he knew what I was listening to.  There were, there were a group of maybe three of us who were, who were attempting to stretch ourselves and so he had a pretty good idea of what I was listening to, so he was sharing with me a little bit--things that he was getting exposed to, you know, and "Un Poco Loco" was the name of the first piece by Bud Powell on a CD that I think was called, 'Something Else' [sic. 'The Amazing Bud Powell, Volume I'] but I'm not sure.  I know Ornette Coleman has a 'Something Else!!!!.'  I just can't remember, and I meant to do a little research but I couldn't get a hold of the person that I--and I didn't look it up on the Internet, but I'm sure it's there.  But that's the piece that opened my ears to, to new ideas about what else there was to learn.
Speaker 1: Now, you and Eric Dolphy were studying--you said you were studying music at LACC [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What kind of classes are you taking?
Speaker 2: Ah, let's see.  He and I took an ear--an ear training class.  We took a harmony and a theory class together.
Story_ID: 673852
Speaker 1: Tell us about LACC [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California].  We were, we were just talking about if there were any influential teachers or anything memorable about the experience.
Speaker 2: I don't remember any of the instructors, I remember some of the classes.  One of them was the fir- this was first year theory and harmony, and we sort of started in the middle with Paul Hindemith, which I would have thought we would have started with, you know, something more like being up towards Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] (laughter), which I, I gravitated to later in my piano studies, but it was a very modern approach, and they had a very good music department, but no, I really don't remember--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --who the professors were, but I remember the Hindemith class was really difficult stuff to grasp, and hostile also to, to, to the ideas that I was working through--with the jazz theory that I was absorbing.  There were so many rules about--that you had to apply in order to get the theory, and I was just (laughter) really bad with them, because they struck down all the things that were possible to do in jazz, and the way--and the orchestral ideas, you know, so I had to really get my discipline self together to get through that class.
Speaker 1: And was it useful to, to, to be doing both (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes, yes, yeah, it did turn out to be useful, too.  It did.  I just thought it was a little premature for a, a beginner, but that was how the class was set up and I don't know, I guess I was too naive at that time.  I learned a lot better to go to the head of the department, and, you know, put your two cents in or ask for some--you know, ask for a defense of way--why is this harmony--why is this beginning harmony (laughter), you know, but I didn't and I'm stuck--I stuck at it; I stuck through it.
Story_ID: 673853
Speaker 1: So, after you're at LACC [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] for a couple of years, do you meet Elmo [Elmo Hope]?
Speaker 2: No, I was out of--I was finished--I mean I had--
Speaker 1: You had finished your time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And there, before I met him--I think he came in 1957 with Chet Baker on the road, and I--and they did a lot up and down the coast of California, but I think traveling from the east, Elmo made that decision because he had run into trouble with his--with sustaining his cabaret license with his cabaret card, and at that time, you couldn't work around alcohol if your cabaret card was revoked for any reason, and many musicians had their cabaret cards revoked and had to find ways around that.
Speaker 1: Why would those musicians tend to lose their licenses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think because of an involvement with drugs or drug-related situations or--because they were always misdemeanors that I remember.  I mean there was not any--it wasn't like large drug dealing.  Most musicians, by and large, only had enough drugs for themselves (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were users.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But if you were--if you had a misdemeanor on your record, or if you were arrested and you were in possession of drugs or any drug paraphernalia, they called it, then you were--
Speaker 1: And was that true for white musicians also?
Speaker 2: I--yeah, that was--as far as I know, that--I--but I--it seems to me that maybe there was a little bit more leniency.
Speaker 1: Or perhaps maybe they weren't getting as arrested as often for their personal drug use (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they probably may have gotten a little slap on the arm.  That would not be--surprise me at all--to know that.  And there were even others that I think were being chaperoned, or who were being sponsored by other people who didn't seem to have as, as much difficulty getting their cabaret licenses reinstated as other people who had to struggle, you know, without any legal help or, or clout from somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody.
Story_ID: 673854
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about Elmo [Elmo Hope] and your meeting him in 1957, but I realized that we only briefly mentioned the car accident with Richie Powell and Clifford Brown in 1956, briefly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Might you tell us a little bit about that, since it comes before Elmo's move and your meet, in time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that was really tragic 'cause I think that--well, first of all, I was taking lessons from Richie Powell, and that was kind of one of the really joyous periods of my learning at, at that point in time because I had easy access to him because he was always at Eric's [Eric Dolphy] house and that was three blocks away, so he--so I had maybe lessons twice a week for maybe four or five months in that period like after I was going to City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California], and he would come over and practice because he loved the sound of the piano.  I don't know if I talked about that before (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did, and you said your mom [Corinne Meaux] would graciously kick him out--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah, so--
Speaker 1: --which sounded great.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was the--just fabulous for everybody; we--everybody in the house loved the way he played and it was a bonus for everybody.  He loved to play the piano and we loved to listen, and I learned as much just listening to his application of the lesson he had just given me, you know?  It was just--it was really wonderful.  So, I don't know; did I stray from the point?
Speaker 1: Not at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were on a road trip, I think.  Clifford Brown had gone to Elkhart, Indiana; I think he had ordered a new horn, and so he went to pick up the horn and I--they were on a straight turn but I think they were on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  Richard had terrible eyesight.  I wore glasses, and his glasses were maybe four times thicker than mine.  He was really near-sighted.  I think his wife Audrey [sic. Nancy Powell] wore glasses, too.  Everybody believes that Audrey was driving the car--that he was tired and that--and he was--it was his shift, I think, to drive but he let her drive and, and she either fell asleep or was not that good a driver, and driving on a straight road.  If you're not that used to it, you know, it's pretty tough, you know, falling--being blanked out by on-coming headlights and all kind of things that happen to people who don't drive that well--to happen to people who do drive well, and I--and that's--and so that's what I--that's what came down the musical community, you know?  And it was just a double tragedy; it was just really sad that the three of 'em were gone just like that.  And I mean I cried for days.  It was just a big hunk out of my life at the time.  But I--you know, I, I re- I resurrected myself and kept the, the lessons that I had and I, I didn't look for another teacher; I just continued, 'cause he gave me really solid chord structures and, and chord inversions--very--not complicated at all, just that you needed to master them and know when you're in what position and how to get certain sounds based on the positions you have put your, your notes it, you know; and he did that, and the chromatic exercise and the--and it was really to do them in all of their, their characteristic configurations in all the keys.  And that was, that was pretty much what I did for those--for--we didn't even--we hadn't even gotten up to my improvising across chord structures yet, you know, but it was really solid--and, and the other part of that was to--he didn't give me a list of song--of material to listen to but it was keep your ears open, you know, and listen to as many live musicians as possible and, you know, he--well, he loved his brother so it was, you know, "Listen to Bud [Bud Powell] and how he puts things together."
Story_ID: 673855
Speaker 1: And you never met Elmo [Elmo Hope]--
Speaker 2: Not then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) during any of this period.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: And Bud [Bud Powell] is Elmo's childhood friend, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Bud is Elmo's childhood friend, yeah.  And Thelonious [Thelonious Monk] comes in, I think, a little later because--
Speaker 1: They're a threesome.
Speaker 2: --Bud and Elmo studied at the same--from, from the same teacher, also, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who that was?
Speaker 2: No, it was somewhere in the Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] build- or the Nola Studios building [Nola Rehearsal Studios, New York, New York].  No, I don't know who it was.
Speaker 1: Not exactly?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  It's funny, when you go back in time and realize all these little details that you really don't know that it would have been helpful to know when you get interviewed forty years later (laughter).  But no, I didn't, but I know that they studied together and they practiced together.  They started--I mean when they were taking lessons, they were into Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] and Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Brahms [Johannes Brahms]--a lot of Bach, a lot of, lot of, lot of, lot of Bach.
Speaker 1: So they were doing the same thing on the East Coast that you all were doing on the West Coast basically.
Speaker 2: Pretty much, in terms of--you mean in terms of when and where they began (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I just mean you living close, your, your--I'm at a loss for words, but you're congregating around the music, you're practicing together, you're going--traveling to school, you're trading records and so it sounds like, you know, those in the community are doing that with their cloches.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I think that because there was no--the most formal way to be introduced to jazz was to be in a band and not in a school, you know.  The school--wherever you got what you got from a school or high school--a very, very dedicated high school instructor, was all classically oriented.  You might do some pop tunes for graduation or something, but there were no jazz charts, to my knowledge, that were, that were in high schools.  There may have been.  I can't say that for a fact, you know, because there are these pockets of people in Chicago [Illinois] and in, in Kansas City [Missouri] and in Texas and Los Angeles [California] and in New York [New York], and then you hear these kids who come out and say, "My high school instructor, you know, turned me on to this, and he used to keep the band room open 'til 8:00 at night, open it up at 6:00 in the morning."  That's the same thing that happened to me in L.A.  Roy Hargrove, of this generation in time, went to school in Texas and he was exposed to one of those dedicated high school teachers just like that.  And there was a--somebody in Chicago.  So, everywhere you run into high school--maybe frustrating musicians that wanted to be musicians, but they became dedicated committed teachers and they wanted these kids to absorb as much as they could; they opened the classroom two hours before homeroom and they closed it, you know, the custodian would have to run them out of there.  (Background noise) And there'd be crowds of kids from other schools.  There'd be a jam session going on in the--and it was usually in the basement, you know.  The band room was in the basement and they, they were--that's--that was the beginning, so--you know--and--but none of it was jazz based.  None of it was jazz based so, so Elmo took classical piano lessons, Bud took classical piano lessons.  I just heard a tape of Thelonious Monk playing Chopin [Frederic Chopin], Cho-, you know.  They took classical piano lessons and, and this music evolved.
Story_ID: 673856
Speaker 1: And you've mentioned Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] several times.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Would you say that Bach is subconsciously in bebop?
Speaker 2: Bach, well, Bach is the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or all of the classics are essentially--
Speaker 2: No, I say that--
Speaker 1: Bach.
Speaker 2: --Bach is the jazz guy of that era--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and I'll bet that there--I'd have a lot of company, 'cause he played counterpoint.  He played--he--first of all, he was a church musician with all these kids, and there's lots of controversy over, did he really write all that stuff?  But he had to come up with a different cantata, a different something for every church service.  So he didn't play the same thing to--this Sunday that you played last Sunday, and then you--it was a transcriber--somebody to capture it and write it down, but if you listen to some of the bodies of Bach's work, they're the same song, just elongated by a--and done over again for the cello, but it's the same melody with some things turned over around on their heads, inverted the way you invert jazz chords.  He played--he, he played jazz.  I mean Bach is the jazz guy.
Speaker 1: Amen. And what would you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I think that might be why the, the affinity--I, I don't know.  I mean--but he also--the, the--that was some of the best technique you could get also, because you, you learned--you know, it--very, very independent fingering and the use of the whole arm in terms of how to produce sound, and how to be legato move--in, in a movement with all of the fingers down and every part being legato like an organ.  You know, very good technique that you, you got from a Bach technician, so I think that has a lot to do with it also.
Story_ID: 673857
Speaker 1: You were drawing parallels around musicians nationwide who were exposed to dedicated teachers.  When did jazz charts become a part, you know--as far as you know, not a specific year--like when does it become, you know, when do--when can you go to a high school and find the jazz charts and find a formal--presentational classes or a small section of the classical class?  Like when does it sort of become legitimate?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Quote unquote.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, I think it's very--it's very late, but I mean I'm not that good on the literature and I'm not a formal teacher either, so I haven't been, you know, I'm not--I'm not really aware of where that, that began, but there--but there are a lot of high schools now that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That have--provide that?
Speaker 2: That have--yeah, that have really good high school ensembles, and they go right into colleges or they try--they, they look to get into places that, you know, are emphasizing having jazz institutes--institutes of jazz studies now at colleges and universities, and more and more slowly but surely getting working jazz musicians into their departments, so that it's still a living music, you know.  And then those musicians contribute what they know to the curriculum and, and that's what's happening now, you know, and they're more and more institutes of, of jazz.  The biggest problem is that to get into any standardized situation then that's what you do.  You take away the oral traditional part of it, or the part that makes my experience different from yours and you kind of homogenize it, and, and then what happens is that the--you know, you get to some kind of core curriculum and everybody does that, and then they graduate in four years and they all sound the same.  So that's about where we are now, that I can see.  There are some places that are really mightily looking to change that.  And The New School [New York, New York], I think, is one here because they have a diversified curriculum and they have a, a lot of different points of view on the staff, so that, that really helps.  And they are--I don't think they're as play-driven as some of the other places are that the curriculum demands practicing Charlie Parker solo forever or, or playing, you know, these ensemble pieces written by other people so that, you know, the piano players all sound like whoever the piano player was in that band, and the saxophone player sound like whoever the saxophone player was, you know.  So you don't know who you listening to.  It gets harder and harder to be individual--to, to find your own voice and to sell it because the music industry--you know, kids come to you and they tell you how many different kinds of ways they can express themselves, but it's less and less important to express who they are, you know.  "Oh.  That's Tom Jones; I, I know who that is."  The way you--you hear Coleman Hawkins and you listen to him enough and you won't forget that that's Coleman Hawkins, and then listen to Dexter Gordon and you know that's Dexter.  You listen to Charlie Parker and you know that's Charlie Parker, and then you hear Sonny Stitt and you know he listened a lot to Charlie Parker, but it--he--he's still different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it's still Stitt.
Speaker 2: You know, but now you just listen to these kids run up and down the scales and they don't miss a lick; they don't squeak, they don't spit, they play every note pristinely calculatedly right where it belongs and it's--that's what it is but it's not jazz--not to me; I mean it needs to have some grease on it, it needs to breathe.  You need to know a little bit about who you are breathing through that horn or through the piano or whatever, you know, not who Coltrane [John Coltrane] was and that you can execute what's on the page.  I have taken away so much music from kids on the bandstand who tell me that they know the song; I mean it's something that should be held to a standard--I mean that, that students should be held to a standard of some body of material that says--
Story_ID: 673858
Speaker 1: I think there's a body of material that all people who profess to want to know this music, and who are studying it in a formal setting should, excuse me, should know.  And so a song--well, let me just take, 'Take the "A" Train.'  Let's just say 'Take the "A" Train.'   That is a solid standard from the swing era that's played now, today.  You ask a kid if he knows it, he says, "Yes," and then he pulls the music out.  Well, for me, that's not knowing the song.  That's knowing how to read the song, but it's not knowing what the song says with--so that you can now interpret the song and then your idea of the song, your improvisation of the song without reading it so, you know, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it sounds like even those who are memorizing material it's still very pristine, as you say.
Speaker 1: Well, you have a better chance of finding out what you're made out of--
Speaker 2: If you can--
Speaker 1: --if you've memorized the song and then you put that away so that--because this is not a written--like a long Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] concerto or a, you know, Brahms [Johannes Brahms] symphony.  It's not--those people have to memorize what's on the page--all thirty-two pages of it, you know, in order to play that.  But jazz--the, the--that's not the expectation for what we used to celebrate as, as a jazz sensibility; it's to know--it's to learn the song and then put that song in your head and your heart, and now play your possibilities about the song over and over and over again.  That's what separates that music from something written.  So the more it's written and the more you see wonderful bands and hear people just playing the music that's written, the less impact improvisation has on the music, you know.
Story_ID: 673859
Speaker 1: How do you meet Elmo [Elmo Hope] in 1957?
Speaker 2: Oh, I met him--I went to hear--I think I went to--oh, I went to hear him in a club in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. Sonny Rol- I went to hear [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, and he was the pianist with Sonny Rollins, and he had--now how did that happen?  Oh, Sonny had a gig offered to him, and they did this very often--they, they, they--the promoters or whoever, would only send out the primary person, and they'd have to pick up a rhythm section wherever they went.  So they wouldn't send Sonny Rollins with his piano, bass, and drummer from New York [New York].  That was way too expensive, so he would have to pick a rhythm section.  Well, Elmo was in the top pick of rhythm sections for any single person coming from the East Coast.  He was the first one called while he was out there, so that's what happened.  Sonny called Elmo, and I think prior to that, they had done some recording early on together for either Presti- Prestige [Prestige Records] or Blue Note [Blue Note Records] or both, and they had written a song together, so they had a--you know, they had a prior relationship (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think Prestige.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And that's--so that's how I met him.
Speaker 1: Did you like him?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I loved it--I really thought--I just--the band--it was electrifying.  First of all, the band just electrified me.  I was just--I was there with my mouth open and I thought, "That's Elmo.  Oh, my god."  By this time I had listened--by this time now, because I had listened to Bud Powell first, now I listened--the second pianist in that group I heard was Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], and then I heard Elmo.  It was really funny; that was the order that I heard them in, and I was trying to learn something from each one of them, you know, from the recordings that I was hearing, and all of the music was still--it just had a different take on, on my jazz sensibilities.  So one of the songs that I thought was fairly simple, I was learning of Elmo's, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, when you look at the research on Elmo today, you know, he's purported to be this--not as well--not as well-known as he probably should be, and not terribly well-known anymore.  During this time in 1957, is he well-known by everyone in the community?  And is my assessment incorrect?
Speaker 2: Oh he's known by--well, no, it's not incorrect in how he, how he was--how, how fate treated him in terms of, you know, what was happening with him when he was alive, and for one thing, he didn't like interviews and he didn't grant them, because the first two or three that he did grant, he said all the facts were wrong and he really got upset at the fact that an interviewer turned things around, or made it the way he wanted it to be, or may have not gotten facts right, and didn't give him an opportunity to edit it, and when he saw it in print, he would just be livid.  So he didn't--he didn't give interviews; he just did--there were maybe one or two.  And why his drug life put him in the, in the position that it didn't put Bud and, and the others in is more than I--I, I can't answer that--I don't know.  I would love to find out.  He did marry early, he did have a child to support, and he stayed on the road with a working rhythm and blues band that made money and that had regular work while Thelonious [Thelonious Monk] was working at Minton's [Minton's Playhouse, New York, New York], and while Bud Powell--while--they were about--while Bud Powell and, and Thelonious were about to get offers from Blue Note and Prestige to record the music that they were writing and working on, Elmo was still writing his own music but he was playing rhythm and blues with Johnny Griffin, with Philly Joe Jones, with Matthew Gee, with a band called the territory band [Joe Morris Band].  I can't remember the bandleader's name [Joe Morris], and I think they did some recordings for Atlantic [Atlantic Records] and for Decca [Decca Records] in the '40s [1940s], so it was a good six years before Elmo came back to New York and was able to do any recording of his own, by which time I understand that he changed his style a little bit from what had been closer to Bud Powell's style.  And people that I talked to said that he was, you know, the funny one, the witty one, the, the one that was the ringleader, the one that when they were looking for pianos, he was the one that was first with a list of people's houses they should stop.  He was, you know, the, the innovator--the one that, that suggested for good or bad, whatever they did; he was kind of the one that, that put the, the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Itinerary together.
Speaker 2: --together, there you go.
Story_ID: 673860
Speaker 1: So, you've heard Elmo Hope before you actually meet him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you meet him at this [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins date.  Now, we also wanna hear just like what happened when you met him.  The show was over and you went--I mean tell me--let's get the anecdotal--the real deal (laughter).
Speaker 2: The real deal?  Well, the real deal was that I was pretty awkward and shy, really, really, but I knew that I was gonna figure out a way to meet him without looking too awkward and silly, so at the end of the first set, I went up to the bandstand.  I got my nerve together and went up to the bandstand and I introduced myself and I told him I really loved his music and I had been taking lessons from Bud Pow--from Bud Powell's brother [Richie Powell], and he was sort of looking at me askance, you know?  Oh, yeah--you know, sort of (laughter).  And that I had been listening to his music and Thelonious' [Thelonious Monk] music and that I was trying to learn a little bit of all of it, and that I had picked this one song of his that--to learn on the piano.  So then he went, "You trying to play my music?"  And I said, "I really am."  So then he told Sonny 'cause they were all at the table together.  He said, "Sonny, this young lady says she's trying to play my music, you know?"  So Sonny was polite, and I was getting more and more nervous because now I, I was really sorry that I said that.  I should've just sat there and, you know, had a drink (laughter).  I didn't drink, actually.  I didn't drink at that--I think I was having a Coke or something.
Speaker 1: Do they give--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --and I--so they went back on the stand and I think they had another set to go.  I had a car.  In L.A. [Los Angeles, California], that's the--that was a--that was big among the musical community 'cause I had another job at that time--I was a kid.  And, and so I--I al- I always took musicians home if I was at the club, as long as I didn't have to get--you know, as long as it wasn't gonna take me too far out of--I would take them home but I didn't wanna have to wait around 'cause I had to get up early in the morning and go to work and school.  I was going to school and work.  So (laughter)--so, I offered to take him--I--first of all I, I wanted him to hear that I was really playing his music, so I offered to take him home if he didn't have a way home, but I wanted him to come by my place because I wanted (laughter) to play his music for him and I thought--I didn't think about that 'til years later how bold that was to ask him to come to my house to play the piano, really play the piano.  So, he--I did, not that night; I think it was the first night that I went, but I went every night to hear them, and at that time they came out for like six--when it was either one-week engagement or two, and it was six nights a week.  So the last night--and I went every night.  On the last night, I, I offered to take him by my house first to--so--because I really wanted him to hear that I was not kidding, and so I did.  So I brought him by my house and I had a Wurlitzer Spinet at the time, and I played this piece for him.  He used to smoke Pall Mall cigarettes and he had this cigarette hanging outta the side of his mouth over here, and he said, "Oh, you're not kidding; you really are serious.  I didn't believe you, you know."  And I was--I mean that just really vindicated the whole thing--that I had really worked hard enough to, to get the song played and to convince him to come over my house and hear it, you know, and then take him home you know (laughter).  So--so that was the beginning of, of our--of my seeing him more and more.
Story_ID: 673861
Speaker 1: So that was the beginning of, of our friendship really.  We were friends for a long time.  I mean I went to hear him everywhere he went.
Speaker 2: And did they give you that polite treatment because you were female?
Speaker 1: I think so; I think--and that--and he said that in front of Sonny [HistoryMaker Sonny Rollins] because I was--I don't think he would've said that at--maybe he would have if a young guy had come up and said, "I love your music and I really--I'm learning how to play it," he would've repeated it for Sonny.  Sonny was right there; if he would have said, "Sonny, this guy is learning my music, how 'bout that?"  You know, I don't think he--although he was very reluctant to claim how good his own music was.  Other people had to say to him, "You know, this is a really good piece of music."  And then he'd say, "You think so?  You really think so?"  You know, so he was not pompous about his own--he knew it was good though, and he knew his capabilities, you know.  He, he really did know that he--his writing was in a different placement of the, of the instruments as even Thelonious [Thelonious Monk] or, or Bud [Bud Powell], because they both did a lot of things for piano more than they did for horns.  Yeah, I think he did a little bit more for horns.  Thelonious' music got transcribed because it got played very early on by, by a lot of horns, you know, but Elmo's didn't.  He wrote mostly for small--for sextet and nothing usually lar- I didn't hear--ever hear anything larger than eight pieces, and most of what he recorded was quartet, quintet, and sextet.
Speaker 2: Now, it didn't sound like the men that you were involved with in the neighborhood--Eric Dolphy, Richie Powell who comes to, to train you ultimately, you know.  Did they share similar sort of polite views of your being female and being a piano player?
Speaker 1: No, they were all business.  Richard--for Richard it didn't seem to matter at, at all.  I mean he was really very--first of all, he didn't see very well, you know, and I think he felt very awkward and--but he was--I, I had--I felt nothing like that; he was just--I was his student.
Speaker 2: And as you and Elmo developed your relationship, did--was the piano ever a source of competition (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ugh, no.
Speaker 2: I mean, how did he feel about the fact that you were also a piano player?
Speaker 1: No, no, I--there was no--I--there's no way in the world I could have felt like I was competing.  I always felt like I was a student, even though we did a recording together, which is now a collector's item, but I mean I was scared to death.  I was still very much his student, you know, when that was made, and I don't even have a copy of the original anymore.  It's about three or four hundred now.
Speaker 2: What's the title of that?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) 'Elmo Hope Plays Solo' [sic. 'Hope-Full: Solo Piano and Duo Piano with Bertha Hope'].  Riv- it's Riverside Records, and they're maybe two duo--two or three duo tracks.  And I have a new edition that was done in a limited undertaking from Japan, but I don't have the original.  But I mean I was just scared to death. I was--I can still remember feeling, you know, "What am I doing?  What am I doing recording with Elmo Hope?  This is ridiculous."
Speaker 2: How much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember that feeling.
Story_ID: 673862
Speaker 1: How much older was he than you?
Speaker 2: He was about thirteen years older.
Speaker 1: What did your family think about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, listen, my father [Clinton Rosemond] was--I thought--didn't I tell you this story?  My father was twenty-four years older than my mother [Corinne Meaux] so (laughter)--there was--.  We never went--my father was six years older than my mother's father--than my grand--six months older than my grandfather [Fredrick Meaux], so in my--in our nuclear circle, it was not a problem.  I think my sister [Eleanor Rosemond] is eight years older than I am; her husband--she married a man that was maybe six years or seven years, you know, older, but my father was considerably older and my mother took a lot of flak from her family about that.  So they--that was not a problem for them, for the family, and it never caused any problem.  The age situation never--never was a problem (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And when and how do you decide to get married?  Or--I mean I'm, I'm--you know you're gonna say, "I got married in 1960," but I wanna hear a little bit more anecdotal information about, you know, what the relationship was like and then your decision to get married.
Speaker 2: Well, he was--he was--we were really struggling about whether we would kind of, you know, like be together or stay together because he was having a hard time finding work and I was trying to wean myself away from the telephone company, but actually I got--I was pregnant before we got married, so that was really--that was kind of--that's what happened.  And--but he was thrilled about that.  That was not the problem.  He wasn't rejecting me based in that, you know, that I was--that I was pregnant, that was okay with him, and that was really deter--that's what really made us decide to get married in, in November.
Speaker 1: And while you're working and seeing Elmo [Elmo Hope] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean in January; the baby was born in November.
Speaker 1: In November?  You were also--were you also playing in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at this point, or are you--I mean because when we talked the last time, you were in high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California] and you were playing quite a bit--
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: --through that period.  From when you were in high school until after, I thought, 'cause you got the permission of your mom to go play gigs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm wondering, are you playing--are you still playing gigs while you're in L.A. during L.A. City College [Los Angeles City College] and afterwards?
Speaker 2: Was I still playing gigs?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, when--I played until it was--'til I was almost to term.  The baby--I mean Monica's [Monica Hope] my first child's name.  She's born almost (laughter) on the piano stool basically.  So I worked, yeah.  I was working, yeah. That was a solo piano gig, a little jazz gig up in a very elegant place up in, up in Beverly Hills [California].  So yes, I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so--
Speaker 2: I continued to work.
Story_ID: 673863
Speaker 1: And so before you had your baby, or before you decide--realize you're pregnant, was Elmo [Elmo Hope] considering perhaps returning to New York [New York] to, to do work there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think that he always wanted to come back to New York.  He, he didn't--there was a small group of musicians in, in Los Angeles [California] that he had grown comfortable with, and that he was recording with and that he was writing with and practicing with, you know, a lot, but it--he, he didn't like L.A. for probably the same reasons I didn't wanna stay there.  It was just a little too spread out.  Each little center was over here, there was another center over there where jazz was and you had to travel all day to get from one place to another.  He thought that the musicians there didn't share as much, and didn't, didn't get together and hang together and live the jazz lifestyle as much, so while I was with him, he was pretty much always ready to come back to New York.  You know, he was not excited about L.A.
Speaker 1: So you--also you--again, I'm starting the question with you said you were attempting to wean yourself from the telephone company.  Is that perhaps why you decided to start touring?
Speaker 2: Well, the job came up. I mean I had been--I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what it was.
Speaker 2: You know, musicians are doing something else during the day, or always looking for work, and I, I auditioned for that particular gig and got it, and it was for a three-month trip, and it looked like it would make--it, it was, it was my way out for that point in time anyway.  I was hoping that I could parlay that into something else.
Speaker 1: And who were you playing for on that three-month tour?
Speaker 2: That was for a dancer.  Her name was [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon, and she was taking a trip across--she was taking a [U.S.] Route 66 trip basically, and it was partly in nightclubs across the route and in officers--there was a part--officers' candidate schools or USO [United Service Organizations] tour.  It was a part USO tour and part club tour, and it was going along the famous Route 66, starting in L.A., and it was supposed to end--that part of it was gonna end in Florida, and the last trip was up--was up to New York.  So the last--the gig in Florida was--happened to be the last one that we did, and the New York gig was canceled.  So I had a decision to make about being in Florida, and which way I was--was I going to go all the way back to L.A. or, or now that I was dis- on the East Coast, I called up Elmo to see how he was feeling and what kind of progress he had made about finding work in New York, and he had two offers to record.  No movement on his cabaret license, but he did have an opportunity to come back and maybe write to get--write for a record day, write for his own record day, write for somebody else's.
Speaker 1: And this is with Riverside Records?
Speaker 2: That was with Riverside, yeah.  And he had also been talking, I think, to Contemporary [Contemporary Records], but I can't remember if that was done in L.A. or if it continued on into New York, but I remember it was an offer that sounded like it was--could be made solid, to come back to New York and record one and possibly two albums, and write for them in New York, with a New York rhythm section.  And so that's what he decided to do, so he--that was, I think--by then it was like what, May of '61 [1961], and after a really very revealing and exciting Route 66 trip, I took the bus up from Florida to New York, and he flew with Monica [Monica Hope] to New York, and we met in New York after that tour was over.
Story_ID: 673864
Speaker 1: Where did you live in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: And we stayed with his mother [Ida Gertrude Hope] while we looked around to get our own apartment and while he was negotiating with Riverside [Riverside Records] and practicing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His mother's in the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 2: And that was in the Bronx, yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you met her before?
Speaker 2: No, I just spoke to her on the phone.  She had known that we were, you know, married and we sent, sent pictures and all of that, but I had, I had not met her.
Speaker 1: And so, does it stand to reason that Thelonious [Thelonious Monk] and Bud Powell also live in the Bronx?  Is that where Elmo Hope was raised?
Speaker 2: No--well, yeah--no.  He, he grew up in Harlem [New York, New York].  He was raised on--he was born in the now closed Sydenham Hospital [New York, New York].  He was born there, and I think that's what a--it's an assisted living house or something now.  He was born in Sydenham and they lived on 117th [Street] and Madison [Avenue], and I think that Bud Powell's family lived around there.  I'm not sure where Thelonious' family lived at the time, but the--but his sister [Marion Barbara Monk] did have an apartment in the Bronx.  I think Thelonious lived in the Phipps Houses [New York, New York], and the Phipps houses were a, a, a, a social experiment to keep people during the Depression [Great Depression] in their homes and have them pay low or no rent, not part of the social service system as I know it.  It was like a landlord's decision to not have these people lose their homes and so the rents were really, really low.  And that was down in Hell's Kitchen [New York, New York], right around where Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for Performing Arts, New York, New York] is now.  Yeah.  But he had a sister that lived in the Bronx, and when some catastrophe happened to his apartment.  I mean he had one of those big, you know, like tub in the kitchen?  And the kitchen was huge.  The kitchen was like the biggest room in the apartment, and then there were--there was the--one or two small rooms off to the side, and I remember living on the Lower East Side [New York, New York] in a room where my tub was in the kitchen, you know, but it was a tenement.  I mean he had three times the space I had.  And then he had this Steinway piano right in the middle of the kitchen floor, so I'm not sure if he ever had any--.  Let me see, he, he had relatives in the Bronx 'cause he had relatives that lived right down the street from Elmo's mother, maybe two apartment houses down.  But as to whether Thelonious had, you know, real roots in the Bronx, I, I'm not--
Speaker 1: I like Hell's Kitchen as a place for Thelonious.  I mean we'll have to work that out, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, you like that?  (Laughter) Yeah, there's a street down there; I think Thelonius Circle--Thelonious Monk Circle.
Speaker 1: That just--that resonates with me.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  He, he definitely had an apartment there.
Story_ID: 673865
Speaker 1: I got a job with the telephone company in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: And did you do any club dates at all (background noise)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked up in the Bronx [New York] at a place called Sylvia's Blue Morocco [New York, New York], and it was owned by two people, Mickey [Mickey Baker] and Sylvia Robinson, who were--had big hits, I think, in the rhythm and blues, in the commercial more popular world.  Jimmy Castor was one of the people that worked up there; I worked with him for a long time.  I don't remember--I worked with--I think I remember working with The Moments, you know, a commercial group up in--I worked a lot up there while I was also working at the telephone company.  And then I did other little side gigs like with gigs that Elmo [Elmo Hope] may not want to do or that he--he would call up, he would say, "I'm sending my wife," to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], or to play with Sonny Greer--that was a big thrill, the drummer.  And some people were shocked, you know (laughter) that Elmo had sent me, but it was part of my training; I guess he considered it part of my learning experience.
Speaker 2: And once he heard you play and experienced it, I mean did he change his position on politeness?
Speaker 1: No, he thought I had a lot of potential and he could see that I had, you know, really good ears and that I picked up quickly, you know, and he would sit down next to me and play.  We would play duets.  That's how, that's how I got to be invited to play on the Riverside [Riverside Records] record ['Hope-Full: Solo Piano and Duo Piano with Bertha Hope'].  And somebody else had suggested--Johnny Griffin, the tenor player, said, "Wow, you should let your wife play with you on the--that sound--you know, it sounds good."
Speaker 2: You just said Sonny Griffith?
Speaker 1: Johnny Griffin (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, Johnny Griffith?  Who else do you meet when you come to New York with Elmo now, who you hadn't gotten a chance to meet, you know, who was interesting or thrilling--
Speaker 1: Oh, well I met Philly Joe Jones.  They were fast friends.  I met people like Matthew Gee, who he had been in the band with on the road--on the--with the rhythm and blues band, Johnny Morris [sic. Joe Morris Band] was the name of the band.  And--oh, I met a lot of musicians that I just--that I didn't play with necessarily, but that were, that were glad to see him back, you know.
Story_ID: 673866
Speaker 1: And did you live that jazz lifestyle?  I mean was there more hanging on the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Oh, listen, I got all the way into it.  I mean after not understanding any of it at all in Los Angeles [California] since I was really a kid, and as I said, you know, I was very generous with my car, and I used to take anybody home if I could, but there--I--in Los Angeles, I found this connection between people who worked in certain clubs and hung around, and then they were there forever and forever and I was saying, "You know, I would love to take you home, but I have to leave.  What's going on?"  There was a whole drug sub-culture going on that I did not know anything about until I got here, so I got--I just went right into that just head--just sort of like headfirst because I hadn't a clue.  I mean I wasn't exposed to anything like that in my neighborhood, or in the group of people that I was hanging with at that time, Billy Higgins, Eric Dolphy--certainly not Eric Dolphy, not Clifford Brown, not, not those people that I was listening to on a daily basis and not right out of school.  Nobody in my family--we didn't have any liquor; my father [Clinton Rosemond] smoked but he gave it up; my mother [Corinne Meaux] did--my mother left show business basically, I think, because she didn't like the life--lifestyle, so--and there was no marijuana.  I was just kind of green to the whole concept.
Speaker 1: No warning, you were green to the concept.
Speaker 2: And--of, of drugs.  And so they were--it was just kind--I had a toothache I think; it was something that casual that led me into trying heroin and liking it, and that was the beginning of about three or four years of my involvement in the--in, in drugs.  And I went to see--it's really funny. I went to see a movie--can I mention the movie?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: 'American Gangster' with Denzel [Denzel Washington], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, oh I knew you were gonna say that; I mean that's so--I said, "Is she gonna say that she saw 'American Gangster'?" That wasn't out that--'til last week (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I just went to see it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: --not too long ago, and thought, since he talked about the places that he, you know, "From up to 110th [Street] to, to 155th [Street] and river to river," that wherever you were in the Bronx [New York] or Queens [New York], or wherever you went--to Harlem [New York, New York] to get your drugs, and I thought--right around that period of time probably--that's probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is when you arrived?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And when there--I mean there was a real big influx of drugs into the community and the--you know, there were--
Speaker 1: So, we're talking 1961, 1963 now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're not really getting to New York [New York] until 1961 and you're staying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got to New York in 1961, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're saying there's an influx of drugs possibly in the community.  I tend to think those, those incidences are not by mistake--in the mid-'60s [1960s], you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that a lot happened that was a consequence of the settling of all these little warlord drug wars, you know, and drugs being dumped into the Harlem community for somebody to make a lot of money somewhere and settle a bloody dispute or something, you know.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I think there's some real evidence to--I mean some books have been written to document that kind of movement, but it was--I mean they were just everywhere.
Story_ID: 673867
Speaker 1: So you were telling me a little bit about the drug culture in Harlem [New York, New York] and in jazz in the mid-'60s [1960s]. Could you also comment on how you found New York [New York] different from Los Angeles [California]?  I mean, was it stunning?
Speaker 2: Oh. Oh, it was total culture shock.
Speaker 1: Did you make that face a lot (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I mean it was just--I went from--how can I describe this?  I, I lived in--if, if you know L.A. at all, I lived about a mile from the USC [University of Southern California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] campus--
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: --going west, I guess.  Very working-class neighborhood, I mean people--maybe some Ital- older Italian families, Filipino, Japanese returning from internment camps.  But my mother [Corinne Meaux] and father [Clinton Rosemond] bought the house in '39 [1939], and then--so--and I, the neighbors that I remember, you know I was born in '36 [1936], were, were a mixture of Filipino merchant-class, Japanese merchant-class, and some who have come back to reclaim or to move into that property, ver- a few older whites, and mostly being taken over by blacks.  Redwood bungalow and stucco homes, you know, with some space, deep yard vegetable garden, front yard grass--to the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: No grass (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I went, "Oh, where are--who are all these people and where do they belong?" is first, because there were so many apartment buildings in the space.  It was just culture shock just from--sort of as close to city suburban, I guess, 'cause it wasn't really suburban and they weren't bedroom communities; it wasn't that era yet, but there was space, you know, and nothing went up.  It wasn't a vertical city, it was a horizontal city.  You had to go a long way to get anywhere, you know, and so it was just a lifestyle living and space, spatial confinement was just--that was the biggest shock for me was, was the, was the confinement of, of an apartment building and tenement and that, and that you use the street in a very different way.  People were on the street, on the stoop, hanging out the windows.  There was a rhythm to it that was just--there wasn't that rhythm to L.A.  You know, you get somewhere in a car or on your bicycle or your--even your skates, you know (laughter), but you didn't walk too much, you know.  And I'd found out that, you know, the Bronx, you walked.  People learned how to walk the neighborhood.  You knew where things were by walking.  So, yeah, it was, it was--but I could--but it had a rhythm that I really grew to love, not just the Bronx, just the rhythm of New York, and the energy and the pace.  'Cause I think that--I think that one of the reasons that I didn't mind leaving L.A. was just that openness and too, too, too insular, people were too isolated, you know?  You go home and you go--you have a barbeque pit at home, you have a TV, you have whatever you have in your home, and there's no outreach to anybody else so you kind of--for me, it's a little different (unclear), there's a forced outreach because things are accessible in New York, you know, and it's--bad as this place has become in some instances, things are still accessible, you know.  That is that everyday life kind of style thing that, you know, if you did--if you forgot a loaf of bread in L.A., you're not getting it 'til tomorrow morning I don't think (laughter), you know.  In New York you can go ten different places at midnight.  That kind of feeling of, you know, commodity accessibility I guess, and just the energy of the people and the differences in people, that they crisscross each other, their cultures crisscross each other and that you have a better musical--for the, for the arts you have a little bit more to draw on.
Story_ID: 673868
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that the drug culture was a new one for you also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that affect you and how did that affect your music?
Speaker 2: Well, I--how did it affect me?  I became an addict--
Speaker 1: And your music?
Speaker 2: --that's how it affected me; I was--you know, that was the biggest effect is that now I--
Speaker 1: Does that mean that you sort of were taken out of your life or--I mean did your life continue on?
Speaker 2: In, in a way because I lost the job at the telephone company because of it, and I really didn't mind because I hated the telephone company but it was a very ungraceful way to, you know, to leave it, and especially since I had a lot of community esteem for having that job at that point in time.  On this coast, there were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah--very, very few blacks in that department or even in the telephone company, so I helped to get quite a few other people in it while I was there.  But it was really my inattention to my own, you know, behavior that, that caused me to, to have to leave, and it would've been better if I had resigned, you know, so it certainly wasn't my cup of tea at all.  I continued to write though, you know.  I continued to write and I didn't work nearly as much as I would have liked to.  I did take a few side trips.  I went to Nova Scotia [Canada] about two years after that, 'cause I was pregnant with my son, and I came back when I was about five months pregnant because I didn't, I didn't really wanna risk being that far away from home as I got--as I approached, you know, getting ready to have the baby, but I mean I worked during every pregnancy, it seems like, except the last one.  So--and I found work in clubs but not nearly at the level that I think I would have if I hadn't been, if I hadn't taken on this extra burden, you know.  So, Elmo [Elmo Hope] never did regain his cabaret license although he didn't--I don't remember him being--I think he did have one other time when he was caught with paraphernalia or something, and I think he spent maybe five or six (background noise) months in Rikers Island [New York, New York].  So that was pretty devastating, you know.  I--you know, I didn't--the--we, we had like a husband and wife drug addiction, and so, you know, I didn't sell drugs, I didn't work to get them, so he, he would do a--he was still working to some degree but it--you know, it slowed us both down and he--the thing that I didn't know was that he already had, you know, some exposure to drugs which had, you know, crippled him, possibly, you know, earlier, but he was still writing fabulous music and still, you know, producing records when he, when he could.  He was not brought--you know, the gifts of pa- having a patron of the arts did not come to him like a, you know, that made it so that other people were more easily given the lifestyle or, you know, given some opportunity to be heard.
Story_ID: 673869
Speaker 1: And would you say that it was that drug habit that eventually led to his [Hope's second husband, Elmo Hope] demise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not sure; I think--oh, yeah, it had a lot to do with it because that takes your energy away from anything that you would do on your own behalf, you know.
Speaker 1: Ah, so you're saying as he got sick it just was--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it's, it's--as you are using drugs, you know--are you saying that it contributed to his death?  Is that what you meant?
Speaker 1: I was asking--yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I--ask that again; I'm sorry, I missed that.
Speaker 1: Would you say that the drug habit con--was the cause of, or contributed to his death?
Speaker 2: I would say so, yeah.  It was--I mean he had a, a heart problem that I don't think he knew about 'cause he ended up dying from a heart attack.  He was supposed to come home.  We--and we were just together seven years, that's really kind of, you know, short time.  And then the heart problem was probably exacerbated by the use of drugs, and you know when you're using drugs you're not really paying attention to, to larger health issues.  Everything is forsaken for, you know, the idea of getting enough--keeping--not planning to be sick in the sense of, you know, having an addiction that you, that you have to take care of before you take care of anything else, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause heroin is an addiction you have to keep up with.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well any addiction--anything that you're addicted to you're gonna get sick if you don't have that thing that your body's craving, you know, so it's an ongoing process--an everyday, an everyday situation, you know, cut into it one day and, and when you do, then you start to get actually physically, physical withdrawal symptoms, and so that is--you know, then you're really getting sick.  And then if you're going to do that, then you're just going to continue until you're going to try and get all the drugs out of your system, which is what you eventually do if you wanna get rid of the habit, but that's a whole--that's, that's an undertaking, you know, that that's what you're, that's what you're going to give yourself over to and you make a full commitment to that, and just get ready for it.  So that's what I eventually did.  That's actually what I ended up doing.
Speaker 1: Committing yourself to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to giving the drugs up, and that was--that was just like self-imposed torture for about a month.  But it eases up as you, you know, as you--as the day brightens and you see you really don't need the, the--that the drug has physically left you, and then you have to really work on your mental state, you know.  A lot of people end up moving from one drug to another.  They go to alcohol, so they become alcoholics.  They're not doing drugs anymore but now they're drinking, you know; so it's a, it's a, it's a process--it's a process.

Speaker 1: So, overall, or perhaps a better term is in short, what do you think Elmo Hope's impact on bebop, or bebop and hard bop--bop generally, if you just were to art--were to articulate a, a short statement?
Speaker 2: Well, the music's being played more and more now; I mean I put together a band.  I've been playing it since 1991 in the duo format, and my second husband [sic. third husband], Walter Booker, Jr., was my partner in putting together duo pieces, and he loved the music (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he's a member of the Bertha Hope Trio and ELMOllenium?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, ELMOllenium is your tribute group, and then--but the Bertha Hope Trio is a trio of yours.
Speaker 2: The--yeah, the, the Bertha Hope Trio plays my music and other standards, but I mean I, I'm a composer too, and that, that trio plays the things that, that I write.  And I also keep alive Elmo's music in my--whenever I record, and whenever I, you know, play in that format.  Booker loved Elmo's music, and he had heard it before, but he hadn't really concentrated on it and he was out of the kind of soul jazz movement.  He came up through the Cannonball Adderley band, he played with Nat Adderley, he was Sarah Vaughan's bass player for eight years, he played with Benny Carter, he played with Thelonious Monk and [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, and just--he was one of those people who came to New York and recorded, who was first-pick of recording--of, of, of bassists for the recording studio, so he's on about, I don't know, four hundred albums as a side person, but he knew of Elmo's music.  He never had an opportunity to really play it, so he was the one who kind of spear-headed putting together all these wonderful musicians that were in New York [New York] who, who knew of Elmo and liked the music and wanted to play it, so people like Junior Cook and Clifford Jordan, Eddie Henderson--Dr. Eddie Henderson, trumpet player.  Who else?  Charles Davis, saxophone; Leroy Williams; Jimmy Cobb.  He put together different groups of people who--asked 'em, you know, if they wanted to be part of a repertory band.  So we, we had two or three different versions since 1990--I think one--'91 [1991], but we taught the music a lot--to a lot of musicians and made it available so that it could be through the publishing company which I don't own, unfortunately, but the music has become more and more available, other people are interested and now The New School [New York, New York] is interested in having a workshop with it.  Several people have re-recorded it.  Eric Reed, the pianist, did a--curated a, a concert that--through Columbia University [New York, New York] and he's recorded it; Rennie Roznis [ph.]; Ralph Moore, the tenor player.  So it's, it does--it doesn't have a big resurgence 'cause we don't have a big market and we don't have a big label saying, you know, that they're going to bring back Elmo Hope music and, and have it played in different configurations, you know.  But I'm working on putting together some chamber music kind of sounding things because there's a big market now for people who are playing chamber to want to play jazz, and some of Elmo's pieces are perfect for that.  So I have the thought for about three or four projects and I'm just tweaking one of them.  The other one is--none of them are really ready, but I have interest from the new school for a way in, so I'm working on that in addition to sort of, you know, recovering from my husband's death about this time last year.  So I have a lot on my plate.  Walter Booker died two days after Thanksgiving last year.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  I didn't know you didn't know that.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Sorry, I didn't--somewhere we missed that.  But he, he, he and I had a great time playing the music and introducing it to other musicians and I thought that was--said something about his larger self, you know, that he really could see the importance in this music having a life, and that he wanted to be a part of that.
Story_ID: 673871
Speaker 1: I also wanted to ask you a little bit about attending City College of New York [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What did you study there?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I kind of started all over again.  I majored in music in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and then here I majored in early childhood education.  The time was right for it and, and I, I could see at the early childhood level that--this wasn't the reason, but it was a good place to introduce young children to the music that we say is a national treasure, treasure, and the people who play it are in the national treasury, and that half of them are starving and we're, you know, saving them as, as we speak, you know, finding them living in the park, you know.  But these kids are hungry for whatever you give them, and I knew then, even then, that children are always gonna be exposed to that big curve in the middle of popular music, and classical music will be over here.  They give very little attention paid to that, and jazz will be over here and very little attention'll be paid to that.  So (background noise), I majored in early childhood education.  I got my degree, and when I got a, a spot to teach, which was a great place on the Upper West Side [New York, New York], with a teacher who was an art major, so we had music and art in the early childhood classroom (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that the Lucy Moses [Lucy Moses School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, that's way after; that's a high school.
Speaker 1: It's more recently?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the one that was--Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're on the West Side, and you got a great place with an art major (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that whole--I was teaching there as an assistant and, and that whole staff went back to school for whatever it was they were already doing--custodial science; the cook went back to school; the whole center went back to school to turn around this idea that, that, that the poverty programs were stealing from the community, and some of them were, but this was a grandiose scheme to make a poverty program that--from the director's point-of-view--to make this poverty program the envy of the Upper West Side.  So that Riverside Drive and West End Avenue parents would die to get their kids in it, and that was the goal, and that's what they did.  It's a garden.  It's a fabulous place.  I built into that a listening center, and made it part of a pre-reading, pre-writing, pre-math skill set to go into the listening center, deal with the tape by color code, put it on the tape recorder, put the earphones on, learn how to manipulate the tape recorder, listen to John Coltrane, put it back in the right box with the right color code, put an X by your name, recognize--recognize your name and leave the center the way you find 'em so two children at a time could listen to music.  So she had all these lush, artistic materials; it reminds me very much of what's going on now, this Emilia Reggio [sic. Reggio Emilia] phenomenon about the, the, the, the Italian garlanded classroom approach.  That's what we had then.  We had children's art all over everywhere, we had music streaming, we had wall, walls that were not ninety degrees, we had see-through glass (unclear), and it's there now.  It is free, and it is beautiful and there's always people who are trying to get in who are over income, who can't get in because they can't, you know?  So I had a wonderful experience teaching, getting those kids to listen to music that they ordinarily wouldn't have been exposed to, you know, at three and four.  And I see kids now, I mean they're thirty--in their thirties or whatever.  They say, "I never will forget that you're the first person to play John Coltrane for me.  I never forgot that.  I listen--I go to jazz concerts now and I always remember where I first heard that music."  That was--so I--so that was my CCNY experience.  I also did some classes at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], I did classes at Bank Street [Bank Street College of Education, New York, New York], I did classes at Yeshiva University [New York, New York], and then I consolidated all my credits and went to Antioch University [Yellow Springs, Ohio] and got my degree from Antioch with all of those consolidated credits from BMCC [Borough of Manhattan Community College, New York, New York], Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York].  I went to about six different places at night, while I taught during the day.
Story_ID: 673872
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts?
Speaker 2: New Jersey State Council on the Arts came through another person that I met who was also interested in Elmo's [Elmo Hope] music, and I think I met him when, when Booker [Walter Booker] and I were doing duo--duo concerts of the music, and they had a ten-day intensive every s- every summer at a place--at Stockton State College [Stockton University, Galloway, New Jersey] in the southern part of the state of New Jersey, in Pomona, New Jersey, and so I didn't involve doing, doing piano workshops with a whole series of musicians there: Rachelle Ferrell was there, Philly Joe Jones, Frank Foster--
Speaker 1: Dizzy Gillespie?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dizzy Gillespie and, and a drummer whose name I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it's listed in the research as Nat Adderley, but you seem to have indicated that you worked with him on some other projects.
Speaker 2: I, I worked with him later on in Washington, D.C. and in Connecticut, and actually I did some workshops with him in Italy--at a school in Italy, and I know his name is on that list and I'm trying to remember if I--I really don't--he wasn't--he, he wasn't part of the workshops that were on the Stockton State College campus the way those others were.
Speaker 1: And these were ten-day intensives where you would serve students also?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Mostly, it was teachers.  It was to teach teachers about enveloping jazz and the cause, and, and, and to keep it in their curriculum, to teach teachers about jazz.  And then they had a very full curriculum that involved movement and tai chi and all those other things that are ancillary to, to, you know, having--being a healthy person.  It was a very interesting workshop.  It was sponsored by the State Council on the Arts.
Speaker 1: Well, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my involvement with them.
Story_ID: 673873
Speaker 1: Now that we've talked about the kids that you end up serving through your education at City [City College of New York, New York, New York] and the other colleges and the New York State Council [sic. New Jersey State Council on the Arts] training for teachers, how does that tie into your idea that music heals?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that--I think it's one of the higher forms, first of all of, of the soul's need to be fed, you know.  There's other arts, but I think music is something that we carry with us in our bodies, in our speaking voices.  The, the first thing that you hear is your mother's heartbeat--that's music--when you're in the womb.  And then after you're born, all the gurgling sounds and things that the human body produces, I think that's music.  One of the earliest instruments is our body.  When you, you know, when you hit your body, it makes sounds with your body and all that--the ham bone that--all of those things are things that are sound effects, and--
Speaker 1: I mean that's really historical because that really puts you back into like a (unclear), you know, free spiritual spirit where all of your music is coming from.
Speaker 2: Right, because the voice is the first instrument and we all have that.  Every human being has, you know, a voice; we learn how to speak, but first we babble and coo and we do all of these other gurgling things, in all languages, before we come into whatever the mystery is of how we ec- acquire the language that we hear.  Because that's all--there, there seems to still be some real mystery surrounding, how do children acquire language from their native speakers, from--you know?  So I have the--now I'm gonna kind of go fast-forward to where, to where you asked me about the question about the healing properties of music.  I think that music soothes you, I think that--or if you are not feeling well, listening to music does something to calm you, I think that if you're a musician, especially, if you're not feeling well, something about playing your instrument or expressing yourself that way is a much better thing for you to be involved in than not doing it, and I hear people say, "No, you should stay home.  You should get another drummer, get somebody else to take your place."  When, really, if you can get out of that bed, it's better for you to play than it is for you not to play, and I--I just--I know I can put on a piece of music and change my whole mindset, and so the healing can also be about that mental place that you get yourself into, you know.  And I think that a lot of people feel that music has healing properties and healing qualities.  And now some research is being done on that--some serious research, and I'm anxious to hear about the--what the outcome of that will be because I think they're going to find that it has some real merit.

Speaker 1: I'll begin by slating.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole; I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Today is December 5th, 2017.  We are in East Harlem [New York, New York].  What's the name of this place?
Speaker 2: Manna House [Manna House Workshops, Inc.].
Speaker 1: In the Manna House, and we are doing a continuation interview with Miss Bertha Hope [HistoryMaker Bertha Hope].
Story_ID: 673875
Speaker 1: You were talking about moving from California to New York [New York] with your husband, and really setting roots here.  Can you talk--what year did you move to New York?  And set this scene for what was going on there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] had been offered some lucrative deals around making some records, and with some tours to follow, so we decided to come back from Los Angeles [California].  The move was really precipitated by the fact that I was on the road because work for him at that point was fairly scarce--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I had an opportunity to come across country on [U.S.] Route 66 and work from Los Angeles to New York, and part of that tour collapsed in Florida, so we ended in Florida with no job prospects in New York; they had collapsed.  At that point--
Speaker 1: Over what period of time were you traveling east?
Speaker 2: It was a three month tour.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were you touring with?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon, the dancer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Jeni LeGon with a dance troupe, and three musicians--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, about seven people, I think.
Speaker 1: And what kinda gigs were you doing?
Speaker 2: We were doing nightclubs across the country, and also noncommissioned officers' clubs and officers' clubs in the [U.S.] Air Force and [U.S.] Army bases between Los Angeles and, and Florida.
Speaker 1: And what year, again, was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1961.
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The beginning of '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you were touring, which is what brought the two of you back east.
Speaker 2: Right.  So--and, and by that time our daughter was born--our daughter Monica [Monica Hope] was born, so my mother [Corinne Meaux] consented to, to help him take care of the baby.  I really left the baby with Elmo.
Speaker 1: So you were on tour; Elmo was not with you.
Speaker 2: Elmo was not with me.  This was not a band that he was a part of; this was a dance troupe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I left on this tour and left my baby, at three months old, with her father and my mother.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And in Florida the job collapsed.  The, the tour ended really in Florida without the, the contract bein' fulfilled for New York, so I called Elmo and told him what happened, and at that point he decided--we decided together that might--this might be the best time to come back and take advantage of the offers that he had, he had on the East Coast.
Story_ID: 673876
Speaker 1: Now, he [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] had been, prior to that, banned from playing in clubs on the East Coast, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: He--yeah, he had no cabarets license; that was one of the reasons he stayed in California with Chet Baker's band.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, that band was touring the West Coast.
Speaker 1: The Chet Baker band.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that--so he came out after the cabaret license was rescinded, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, after he lost it, and at that point it didn't seem like there were any prospects for him getting it back.
Speaker 1: And so at this point now in 1961 when you're coming back, was he able to renew his license?
Speaker 2: Actually, not.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No--unfortunate.  But by then, he was doing a lot of writing, and he was working with several bands that he did some of the writing for.
Speaker 1: So he was working.
Speaker 2: He was working; yeah, he had work.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That time--and I mean he--it's been written about, but that--that time was a time where drugs were really rampant, and that was part of the--why he was--the license was revoked, correct? Because of heroin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I think--yeah, it had probably something to do with--either with drugs or drug paraphernalia--some reason that his--that, that the, the license was revoked.  Other musicians around him were able to get theirs back, but he, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Didn't work for him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Story_ID: 673877
Speaker 1: You come from Florida, he [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] comes from L.A. [Los Angeles, California]; he, the baby, and your mother [Corinne Meaux], too?
Speaker 2: No, my mother stayed--she lives in--she lived in California--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we came to his mother's [Gertrude Hope] house, actually.  He flew, I took the bus in '61 [1961] from Florida up the coast to New York [New York], and he and Monica [Monica Hope] flew.
Speaker 1: With this little baby.
Speaker 2: With--with--yeah.
Speaker 1: And where did--where did his mother live?
Speaker 2: In the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you lived with her in the Bronx.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what work were you doing as you settled in?
Speaker 2: Well, as the trio--I mean as the dance troupe sort of disintegrated, some--everybody went back.  There was one other dancer who decided also to stay in New York, and the rest of the tour ended and I left the band, so the first thing I did was get a job at the telephone company because I--I didn't have any musical contacts on this coast.  And I had to really consider the baby, too, now--how I was going to manage to try to find contacts and be a working full time musician.  I thought I needed to get a little cushion first, so I worked at--I think it was Bell Telephone Company [American Bell Telephone Company; AT and T Corporation] then still.
Speaker 1: And what did you do?
Speaker 2: I was a--I worked on one of the large computers.  As much as I hate computers now, I think about that huge computer doing very mundane kind of work.
Speaker 1: Like data entry?
Speaker 2: Or data delivery or something--yeah, probably.  I can't remember the terms now (laughter) even (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: But yeah, it was huge.
Story_ID: 673878
Speaker 1: And when you were with the dance company--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were you playing original music?  What, what were you playing?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, we were playing African rhythms, and songs that Jeni had put together for the, for the dance troupe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon was one of those dancers who was in Hollywood, and color--her color restricted her from a lot of roles but she's, I'm sure, documented in some movies.  And she was really active in Los Angeles [California] and then she put this tour together and I, I just dropped the idea of touring with them once I came east.  But she--I, I think they were mostly African rhythms because that--her dance troupe was very--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: African dance?
Speaker 2: African dance, yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you performed African rhythms before that?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  I, I learned them with that band--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --actually, yeah.
Story_ID: 673879
Speaker 1: Because I read--you, you talk a lot about the influence of Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in your work.  Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, Bach was one of the--I, I studied with a Bach specialist and--I mean that's some of the beginning classical studies that you do for finger dexterity and for the vol- voluminous material that he left behind and the kinds of music he--jazz musicians call him the, the jazz player of the--or composer of that classical period.  So I found that a lot of the people that I liked also, that I listened to, also were people who were enamored of Bach.  So Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] listened to Bach and played a lot of Bach; Bud Powell did it also, and I found it was one of the--it was one of the best things that could have happened to me for the technique that I was going to need, and I mean I still even now struggle with fingering, and my hands are small and I don't have a virtuosic technique, but I--for what I fashion to be my own voice, I think, it's just something that continues to be honed, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: As--and, and I--my technique still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of bein' able to really play a--velocity or with a lot of strength.  I've worked out my own technique for the music that I play and write.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so in terms of classical music and Bach--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you feel that a lot of bebop and jazz artists were heavily influenced by his work.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I, I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: What about it?  What about it translates into those art forms?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things is the counterpoint about it.  There's always a contrapuntal voice going on in jazz ensembles.  I mean there are all the multiple rhythms that, that the drums bring; there are the lines that weave in and out--harmony and melodic lines in big band music.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In the quintet format, which was one of the formats that was--that helped to shape what the sound of bebop was in the very beginning, the saxophone and the trumpet in front of a rhythm section, offers that possibility to weave one melody against another, and I think that's one of the reasons why he might have been so attractive.  And plus he was--he took one melody; Bach could take one melody and vary it a thousand different ways, and that's--a lot of the structure of jazz is to be able to take one melody on top of a--of a--of the architecture of the framework--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the changes--and just pull and push it in all these different directions, and that's--the improvisational quality of jazz has a lot of similarity to those contrapuntal lines that, that Bach was famous for.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 673880
Speaker 1: Your husband was known as a hard bop performer, correct?  Well, not just, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: Can you define--what is hard bob?
Speaker 2: You know, I--people say that--'cause I don't really deal with the definitions 'cause I'm not sure what it is I play.  But there are these academic definitions for hard bop, soft bop, neo bop, and bebop--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  I think that--oh, and then there's the, the--that whole--the, the blues influence; I guess that's hard bop which is Cannonball Adderley--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that, that would be one of the proponents of that.  I think maybe part of it is the statement; the statements have a use of, of language, the language which kind of changed from the swing era to more tension, more tension in the, in the, the delivery of the scale and the notes, more fluidity, more rapid fire, velocity.  I'm thinkin' now of Elmo's right hand against a more stabilizing kind of left hand; Bud Powell is another person that played like that.  I think Horace Silver--although Horace Silver, I think, was the one who really wrote a variety of material for the quintet format; he was a real master at that, I think.  But I've tried to define what bop is for myself, and I'm not so sure I play what I consider bop, you know, bop to be.  I listened to a lot of it when I was growin', like in high school, so I listened to people who played what they call bop; that was Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie], Charlie Parker, Miles [Miles Davis] at that point, and Bud Powell.
Speaker 1: And they were calling it bop; they weren't calling it jazz then?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what?  I never heard Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] call it--
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: --so that's my point--that the people who were playin' it- [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor made this observation.  I just heard him in some interview where he said that bop--the word bop came from the musicians describing to each other the sound of a phrase that they wanted articulated in a certain way, and they would say, "Well, it goes like this, (scats)," it's a sort of a scat language in order to convey to another musician what, what he--they were after--what he was after, and that that's where the name came from.  So it's almost not deliberately named that, and its usefulness came about as a result of necessity of, of trying to describe to another musician what you wanted this unfamiliar music to sound like, or probably an original song or a phrase that was unfamiliar was described that way.  So, I think that's--that, academia loves to go round and around in circles you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right. And to give names to things (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and to pigeonhole everything and label everything, 'cause if you can't label it, you don't know what it is, or you don't know what to put--you don't know where to put it if you can't label it, so I, I don't know, I think it's gotten pretty useless as a term, and because the music is so global now.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the term, jazz--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and what jazz meant to you.  When, when was that term in your consciousness?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Story_ID: 673881
Speaker 1: So jazz.  You were--when did that term--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --come into your awareness?
Speaker 2: Hm.  I think maybe when I was about twelve or thirteen. And then it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And what did it mean to you?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, first of all, I think it meant the possibility of getting away from the conventional things that I had to do and learn.  There was an element of space, and chances, and freedom, and exploration, and that there was some part of it that I could claim as my own to develop, and if I was willing to work hard enough, then I could develop it and it would be mine, based on some really basic information, but I would have an opportunity to carve something that was individual.
Speaker 1: So creative freedom--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Maybe not so unique, but to--but creating freedom.  And that all the different people that I was attracted to, to listen to right there in that age period, they all--they all had a different message; they all sounded--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Well, there was Art Tatum, Nat King Cole, Horace Silver, Hampton Hawes who was a California based pianist who had that energy and drive that I--that really fascinated me.  But those were the people that I was listening to.  I listened to a lot of--well, that was later.  About two or three years later, by the time I was fourteen or fifteen, I heard Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] and I heard Thelonious Monk.  And then I heard Bud Powell.  I think the order really that I heard them in was just the reverse.  I heard Bud first.
Speaker 1: And did you hear him on the radio?  Where--
Speaker 2: I heard him--a friend of mine who was an artist.  There were a group, maybe four of us, and one was a visual artist.  He was working, I think, in wood, by then--very creative.  And a drummer; the drummer Billy Higgins, and one--another drummer and I used to share our records because we didn't have very much money, but one of us would get a record and, and you could hold it for a week and listen to it and then we'd rotate around.  So, the artist gave me this record.  He said, "I know you've been listenin' to a lotta piano players, but check this out."  And it was Bud Powell's--'Somethin' Else,' [sic.] I think, was the name of the album, and there was one song on there that just--that I gravitated to, and I remember the first time I dropped the needle on the record it was--I--maybe nine or ten hours later I was still listenin' to that record.  So--
Speaker 1: And did you try to play like him?
Speaker 2: And I was tryin' to play--I was tryin' to find the voicings that I--that my ear was pretty unfamiliar with, and I would--and he was using them in a series, so that that same voicing he was moving all over the piano, so I was trying to find all of 'em.  It was really--it was an adventure--yeah.

Speaker 1: As you are growing up and now being exposed to this different kind of playing--different kind of creation, are you looking for classes where you can explore this?  You know.  How, how--what's happening for you as you're learning how to play?
Speaker 2: Well, that's really funny.  Well, I lived on the Westside of Los Angeles [California]; the best music was goin' on on the Eastside [Los Angeles, California].  That was almost--I, I didn't have a car, and it was the black community, and there was a high school there that was a magnate, really.  This was one of those people that seemed to have a mission to keep the school open as long as he could so that people could come and meet each other and play, so people like Dexter Gordon, and Wardell Gray, and--well, those are the two that I remember the most, though.  Lawrence Marble was a drummer.  They all came over to play in this--with this--with these high school kids.
Speaker 1: Which school was this?
Speaker 2: This was Jefferson High [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And that is on the East Side.
Speaker 2: And that's on the East Side.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you get there?
Speaker 2: The bus--the train--the trolley.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It would sometimes--oh, no, I don't think I ever really walked that far over there but, you know, nobody had a car at that point.  I didn't have a car yet.  But I would--I never really played hooky to get there, but I would have loved to because that--I think the band class was the last class of the day, and then the instructor kept the school open for these kids 'til five or six o'clock.  I went to school to what was the equivalent of music and art without being called a music and art school, but they had a great music program and a great art and design program also, and that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: --Manual Arts [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California].  And that high school band instructor was the same--of the same cut, you know, to keep the band room open, although that wasn't the jazz band, but I got a lot of exposure in that high school because I played a lot of different instruments.  Starting from junior high I played through the string instruments, and of course at that time, women--young girls weren't even offered saxophones, so as far as you could get was the clarinet; couldn't really make a leap to the saxophone 'cause they wouldn't let you in, so I played for them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What were some of the other instruments you played?
Speaker 2: Oh, I played clarinet, violin, viola, cello; I didn't play bass.  I had a really strong, good ear, perfect pitch, so if the teacher needed to supplement a, a--an instrument because somebody was graduating, she would just give me the instrument to take home over the summer.  The program was free, maintenance was taken care of.  If we broke something, you just brought it back to the school and they had it fixed; it was a totally free program.  And then I played all the percussion instruments.  I played the drum--a snare drum in the marching band, Glockenspiel, then I read all of the classical--you know, the traditional classical percussion section, so I learned how to play and read all of those parts, so that's the timpani--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the triangle, the tambourine, the--so, it's a whole--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So you were just curious about all of the instruments?
Speaker 2: I really did love bein' in that band playing everything.  I never got really, really, really good on any of them, but I learned how to read and I learned how to be part of an ensemble.  I learned how to, to listen and to be a part of something larger than myself, you know.  And then I played the piano for the instructor's son who was competitor--in competitions paying viola, so we went all across California to the competitions, so that was a good experience, too (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 673883
Speaker 1: I was asking you off camera about the cello.  So, you, you mentioned with the piano, having small hands, the reach is not always the easiest.
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Cello is a big instrument; was that difficult for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I remember it bein' a challenge; I remember it bein' a challenge to get my fingers in the right position and move up and down the neck, but I enjoy the--I love the sound of cello even today.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's a--just the mellowest of the strings for me, and has the most vocal--it reminds me the most of the human voice, you know.
Speaker 1: And you, you decided on the piano, though, right--as your instrument of choice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think because it was there, you know?  I can't--I've thought about this before, that if I had another--if there was another instrument.  I was attracted to the trumpet, but I'm really glad I didn't do the trumpet; every trumpet player I know is really (laughter)--I mean that instrument takes so much power and so much wind.  Medical science--many doctors say that you should play it lyin' down to take the pressure off of your lungs. So (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh.  So, a lot of trumpet players have had medical problems?
Speaker 2: No, they just have other problems; it's like the air--the wind is--it's--I'm not puttin' trumpet players down, I love the sound of the trumpet, but people make jokes about--because those high notes are really--they put a lotta pressure on, on the system.
Speaker 1: When you were a child growing up, you're exploring all these different instruments.  Were you dreaming of being a musician?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.  I mean I remember--well, first of all, my father [Clinton Rosemond] was a singer, so the first thing I--the--one of the first roles I played was as an accompanist to his (unclear), German lieder.  He sang that classical repertoire, and also the Negro spirituals (background noise), what were called and still are called, the Negro spirituals; and I learned to play for him, and that's--
Story_ID: 673884
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you learned to play for your dad [Clinton Rosemond]?
Speaker 2: Right, right, and to accompany him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then you met your husband [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] through listening to his music at first, is that right?
Speaker 2: That's--yeah, pretty much.
Speaker 1: And how long was it from your hearing his music to when you actually met him?
Speaker 2: Oh--wow, I never even thought of that.  Let's see.  Well, I think I first heard him when I was around maybe--a little outta high school [Manual Arts High School, Los Angeles, California]; I was in college [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] by then, when I first--seventeen--I heard him late.  I heard him--so maybe six years.
Speaker 1: You heard his music about six years before you met him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I think--let's see.  Yeah, I met him in '58 [1958]; well, yeah, maybe four years--four years; about four years before I actually met him and heard him play in person.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you've shared this story already of your meeting him, and driving, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right--oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So we, we have that.
Story_ID: 673885
Speaker 1: I want to go to New York [New York] again now.
Speaker 2: To New York?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you, you--you're in New York, you've got the job at the telephone company [American Bell Telephone Company; AT and T Corporation] with the big computer, you have a baby [Monica Hope].  Are you also performing?  Do you have time to perform in that, that space?
Speaker 2: I can't remember how long it was before I met Jimmy Castor from the Castor Bunch [The Jimmy Castor Bunch].  He was working in one of the prominent clubs; there were a lotta clubs in the Bronx [New York].  He was working at Mickey [Mickey Baker] and Sylvia's [Sylvia Vanderpool]--is that right? Yeah, Mickey and Sylvia's Blue Morocco [Blue Morocco, Bronx, New York], and I worked with them on the weekends.
Speaker 1: And what--so, what kinda music are you playing then?
Speaker 2: Oh, and then it was--we were playin' popular music.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And this was before his real successes; you know, the things that were really--put him on the map.  But it was--no, it wasn't bop, it wasn't--it wasn't what I had been listenin' to; it was just an opportunity to--even to get grounded or get some grounding in the more popular kinds of music that I listened to.  I had listened to a lotta that but I hadn't had an opportunity to really play it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I did a lot of solo piano in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I played with Johnny Otis big band [Johnny Otis Orchestra] in L.A., you know, as a kid.  Probably shouldn't have been in the band--me and--in fact, Little Esther [Esther Phillips] was in that band, so the two of us were surely underage, probably.
Speaker 1: And were you playing in nightclubs?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  We were playing the whole route.
Story_ID: 673886
Speaker 1: How were you treated?  'Cause there're a lot more men who were in the bands.
Speaker 2: Oh, there were mostly--I don't remember--I only remember one woman in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and that was Vi Redd, who played alto, and she had--she had her own band and she played with the other bands--very well respected.  How was I treated?  I, I didn't have a lot of experience, you know.  I wasn't on call or anything; I was just trying to learn, so the people that I--that I was surrounded by at that point were very generous, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I got a lot of sexual advances kind of--that kind of really was more annoying than it was outright.  I didn't suffer any really outright kind of sexual overtures, but it--but the catcalls, whistles.  I didn't get any, you know, inappropriate touching or anything like that.  And I had--I was always with somebody, too.  And I think that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did you ever--did, did you--as a female artist, did you feel that you were being paid on par with the men?
Speaker 2: You know, (mumbles), that never even--I don't even think I ever thought about that, but I'm sure that I probably was paid a whole lot less.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And in fact, I was probably hired because they knew they were gonna pay me a whole lot less, you know?  I, I do believe that, yeah.  I think that happens now, still; I'm sure it does.  And the older I get, the--then all sorts of different situations are creeping up now that are--that I'm really right in the middle of.
Story_ID: 673887
Speaker 1: So you mentioned the overtures from men.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how did you know how to--
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: --shoo them a way (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't.  I really--I really didn't.  And I was kind of awkward and shy, too.  I remember one really bad experience; that's the only one that I really remember. And I was--I was supposed to get paid at the end of the night, and I was the only one left there and I didn't get paid, and nobody came forward with the money, and the, the bandleader said that he would have the money in about a half an hour, and then--because the club was fairly close to the hotel--and he asked me to come to the lobby of the hotel, and then he asked me to come upstairs, and that's the closest I really came to bein' really frightened and thinking, how did I--how did I get here?  How did this happen that I didn't get paid, and why did I, you know, come upstairs?  So he paid me but he really did make advances, you know, and almost make it like the money was mine only if I would do something else.  That really freaked me--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How did you get out of there?
Speaker 2: I just opened the door and ran down the hallway.  I didn't report it, I didn't say anything to anybody.  So I--as I'm--as we're sittin' here now and see all of these things unfolding, it really take--takes me back to that experience and to others that I've had in New York [New York] that have--that have been inappropriate.  I mean--and I have been really--I--I've been adamant about sayin' somethin' about it now, you know, and I'm really very proud of the women that--especially the ones in the music world that normally know they're gonna be punished somehow by this male dominated world if they say anything, and they are coming forward, and the union is publishing their remarks, so that's, that's a good sign (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Which--now, we're talking about 2017 which is the moment of transformation, I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some--
Speaker 1: --or revelation, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, finally.  I don't know enough women--I don't know what came first, the chicken or the egg.  But people are speaking out and being heard, and it's a long time in coming.
Speaker 1: With that bandleader who you mentioned, did you ever work with that band again?
Speaker 2: No, I left--I left that band (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: That was it?
Speaker 2: No.  I left.
Speaker 1: You did get paid.
Speaker 2: I did get the money, but I had--it was like I had the money in my fist and I opened--snatched open the door and ran down the hallway to the elevator.  I did get the--but he didn't pay me, you know what I mean?  He didn't come forward to just pay me like he paid everybody else, and I did leave that band.
Story_ID: 673888
Speaker 1: What would you say was the difference or the differences between performing on the West Coast and then performing on the East Coast?  Was the music different?  Was the scene different?
Speaker 2: Oh.  That's interesting.  Well, you know, when I performed on the West Coast, I think I, I performed--I did a lotta supper clubs on the West Coast and it's a little different atmosphere.
Speaker 1: Is this mainly in the black community?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: One of the clubs was in Beverly Hills [California]; that was the last club that I worked in before Monica [Monica Hope], my daughter, was born, and that was not in the black community; then most of the other clubs were, like the Oasis [Oasis Club, Los Angeles, California], the Rubaiyat [Rubaiyat Room, Los Angeles, California], and the Adams or Watkins hotel [Hotel Watkins, Los Angeles, California], the Purple Onion [San Francisco, California]; I did rooms like that--the It Club [Los Angeles, California]. I didn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And these were nightclubs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were any of them like the afterhours clubs?  Did they have that in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--the late, late nightclubs?
Speaker 2: No, everything ended, that I was involved with, at two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Clubs were done at two o'clock, so I didn't get into any afterhours scenes there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But on the East Coast I find--I mean I've been here so long now, that's a question--that's a good question.  I think the pay is probably different.  The, the atmosphere--it's changin' so much now, I think, because of the technology.
Speaker 1: Right.  But stick in the--stick to the '60s [1960s] right now when you first came--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, the '60s [1960s]?  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: When you first came--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm not talkin' about now yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, you just--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Just back then, so--you know, when you were young, performing in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --and then you come to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause people often talk about big differences between style of music, the--the types of places where people go to hear music--what was the scene like here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  All right, well let's see.  I didn't play too many clubs in Manhattan [New York]; the clubs that I played were--
Speaker 1: In the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 2: --in the Bronx.  I traveled, I went to Boston [Massachusetts]; I didn't play too much in the '60s [1960] in, in the city.
Speaker 1: Was your husband [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] playing in the city?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was doin' some work in the city; he was workin' with Charlie Mingus [Charles Mingus] for a while.  Those--he worked in Brooklyn [New York] with, with that band.  But my work--I went to Boston, I went to Canada--where else?  I did some clubs in Long Island [New York].  I mean, I didn't do very much--
Speaker 1: In the city.
Speaker 2: --in the, in the, in the city in the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 673889
Speaker 1: You moved here in '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your husband [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] passed away in '67 [1967], right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Had he been ill?
Speaker 2: Well, he was involved with drugs--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so--but the--what happened to him was that he had a heart issue that I think he didn't really--was under- underdiagnosed, and so dealing with the drugs--dealing with drugs also had some effect on that issue with his heart, so he was in recovery from pneumonia when he died, and I think that the burden of, of his drug use and the inadequate hospital care, and the fact that--the way they handled drug addiction in the '60s [1960s], was not the correct thing for the human body, so it weakened his heart so he, he died.  Really he died from a heart attack recovering from, from pneumonia (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How old was he?
Speaker 2: He was forty-three.
Speaker 1: So for you, you fall in love with this man who's older than you, you have a child [Monica Hope], you're married, you're building a life, but what was it like for you, being married to someone who was battling drug addiction?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I didn't understand any of it, so that's the--the first thing was that I, I saw some of the dynamics happening that I put together years later, but to just know about drugs at all, and what they did or could do, or what jeopardy they put me in, I hadn't a clue.  I, I had no experience with drugs, my parents [Corinne Meaux and Clinton Rosemond] didn't use drugs; they didn't even drink.  There was very little drug activity in the neighborhood where I grew up [Los Angeles, California], you know.  I didn't see any--I didn't see anything that I could--that would give me a, a clue; I didn't know any people who were addicted, I didn't--I, I just walked into a situation that I had no--I had not a clue.  I--then I thought what is it about this drug or drugs that, that makes such a barrier between your life and, and what the drugs do to you?  You know?  So I just--I was wondering what is it that I can give to this man that would take drugs and make them a lot less for him than his life would--and a family would be.  So that was--and that put me in a position to not be able to, to have any information about how to stay away from them myself.  So--
Speaker 1: So when he was--when he was using, how did he behave?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was, he was--he had a great personality when he was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: When he was using drugs.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was a--he was, he was a lotta fun to be around, he was a--very generous to a fault--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know?  Just a--he had a lotta people around who wanted to just be there, you know.  I used to bake bread--I used to bake bread, and people would come by the apartment to get--not that it wasn't really a lesson because he didn't really give lessons, but he did share a lot with a lot of people who wanted to hear what it was that he did, and how he did it, you know?  He gave lessons in an informal kinda way.
Story_ID: 673890
Speaker 1: What was unique about his sound?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was ver- he had a very personal sound first of all.  And he had a--he was able to take the part of the music that's--that has all this velocity and put it together in, in ways that you hadn't heard before.  I think--although if you listen to him, you will also hear Bud [Bud Powell], you will also hear Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], you will hear some Duke Ellington, you know?  He wasn't a musician that had the--this background that kept him from being personal and unique, so you could hear him play a few cords and know that that was him; that that was Elmo's [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] style.  And from what I've heard from other musicians who were in his company, he was the one who had the forward thinking, he was the most aggressive, he was the one that Thelonious and Bud were listening to.  Philly Joe Jones told me that--I think Johnny Griffin was another one that told me that he really did have the most--he, he had a more--he had a wider scope, and shared it, shared it with, with them.  So, his music is difficult to play because it really has the--you're not going to expect something that you think you already know about a piece of his music.  You really--you think when it gets here it's going to be familiar to you but it's not, and every piece that he wrote that I've been able to play--'cause there a lot of them that I haven't even gotten to yet.  But every piece that I've ever played has its own--its own uniqueness and its own shape.  And part of what I'm doing now is trying to teach another generation the music.  And that's, that's just a kind of a labor of love.
Speaker 1: Now, you and he recorded together.
Speaker 2: One, one LP, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that called?
Speaker 2: It was called 'Hope-Full.'
Speaker 1: And, and how was it playing--describe that experience of the two of you playing.
Speaker 2: Well, it--I was--I don't think I knew enough at that point to even be in the same--on the same piano or in the same room, but we used to practice together.  We didn't have two pianos, but we used to go to a studio in downtown--in Midtown [New York, New York] and, and practice together.  It was kind of overwhelming, was what it really was.  It's a collector's item today because it's so different, I think.  But I mean people tell me all the time how beautiful it is, and I don't listen to it that much.  I, I, I just don't listen too much to things that I've already done. But I was shaking, I was nervous, I was like, "Are you sure this is--should I be here?"  It was--it was something I wish that I could have done maybe twenty years forward, and had some different information to share, you know; but I remember the feeling as--like I couldn't get myself together for about--I was just sitting there thinking, is this really gonna happen?  Is this really gonna happen?  It was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 673891
Speaker 1: After your husband [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] passed away, what did you do?  You have a young child, you're on your own.
Speaker 2: I had three.
Speaker 1: Three children--okay.
Speaker 2: Monica [Monica Hope] is the one that was the baby that--that had been born by the time I took the trip across country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But after that, I had a son Kevin [Kevin Hope] and another son Darryl [Darryl Hope].  I went fairly--some form of temporary insanity, I think (laughter), but I was surrounded by really, really good friends, and it's--there's the story there's so much more to it, but I have--I had a--such a good network of people around me.  There were some very, very dark days I think--more than dark, but I was able to--I--it took about two years, really, a, a period that I didn't play.  I went back to school eventually, and I--but at that point I gave away my piano and swore that I wasn't gonna play it anymore.
Speaker 1: Were you still working for the--
Speaker 2: Telephone company [American Bell Telephone Company; AT and T Corporation]--no, no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --telephone company?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I ended up actually going to, to work for the head--for Head Start for pre-K [pre-kindergarten], and putting a music and art program in, in the pre-K where I was teaching.  And then I ran a daycare center in Brooklyn [New York] for maybe two years, but that was after--in the--at the end of the '60s [1960s]--I think that was the two and a half year period--about--by, by '79 [1979]--I mean--I'm sorry, '69 [1969] to '70 [1970], I was ready to start practicin' again and retrieve my piano, but it took--it took at least two years, and it was some--not really soul--but soul searching two years--a lotta losses.  But I, I grew up a lot.
Story_ID: 673892
Speaker 1: So you are teaching music.  You added music to the Head Start program.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work there?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Let's see.  Maybe fifteen--fourteen, fifteen years as I was developing, studying here and putting together a band here to play in the tri-state--mostly tri-state area. Let's see; what year am I talkin' about?  So, '76 [1976]?  Seven--yeah. Seventy-six [1976] is when I, I graduated from school--went back and graduated from school.  So, '79 [1979]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to Antioch [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated from there in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in '82 [1982]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What did you study?
Speaker 2: I went back--I--actually I went back and got an education degree 'cause I thought I was gonna teach.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And then you said '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: So, '76 [1976] to--so '69 [1969]--oh, actually, it was '69 [1969] to '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Um-hm--was when you were at Head Start.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where?  Which one?  Was it--what part of town was it in?
Speaker 2: The Goddard Riverside [Goddard Riverside Community Center] on the West Side [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so that was your job as you're rear- rearing your three children [Monica Hope, Kevin Hope and Darryl Hope].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--that was where I was.  I worked on the weekends, I went back to school, I started a band [Jazzberry Jam].
Story_ID: 673893
Speaker 1: What was your band's name?
Speaker 2: I'm gettin' ahead of myself (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I joined a band.  I, I had been asked to join some bands, but I didn't have the time, so in '82 [1982], that's when I decided that I really wanted to see if I could just work as a full time musician and continue to grow.  So it was '82 [1982] that I decided that I would leave Head Start and start auditioning, and so I joined a women's big band, which was like the pre-runner, or I guess it grew out of the women's bands traditions that nobody ever talks about anymore.  They were around, but not nearly as prevalent, but this band was before the Diva Big Band, and it was a band that all those Diva people went through before Diva became Diva.  And (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And so, talk about the, the advent of the women's big bands 'cause I don't think a lotta people know about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there was a period there from World War II [WWII] on where all these women who had married or had--were working in separate places; maybe one woman in an all-man's band when the war came along, and these restaurants and hotels needed musicians, these women were recruited, and there were any number of bands that just nobody ever knew about, and women who then were introduced to other women and traveled the, the continent.  When the war was over, the women's bands ended pretty much.
Speaker 1: So you joined a women's big band.
Speaker 2: So I joined, but this is way later.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: This is in the '80s [1980s], I joined a women's band.  And we worked all over--all over the--all over Massachusetts, New Jersey; I think we even went to Boston [Massachusetts] a couple of times.  We did a lotta private parties, a lotta weddings; we did The Hamptons [New York]; we did a tour of Japan, well we did night club tours of Japan.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the band?
Speaker 2: The band--Kit McClure, Kit McClure [Kit McClure Band]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --big band.
Speaker 1: And were you the only pianist?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was--actually, I was the first vocalist-pianist; have no voice anymore, but (laughter)--she ended up with two vocalists, I think--a male and a female vocalist like the big bands of the '40s [1940s] had.
Speaker 1: And how did you all dress?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--well, we dressed--we had a little cleavage.  And she used to say--she was really funny--she would just say, "Well, look, you know we have got to give them a little bit of somethin' that they want."  So--it wouldn't be a lot, and the dresses were kind of short but not too short.  It was fairly conservative, actually, for what's--what people are wearing now (laughter).
Speaker 1: I bet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, were you all dressed alike?
Speaker 2: And we were dressed alike, yeah, for the most part.  And in fact, in some--I remember (background noise) we did some gigs--oh, my god!
Speaker 1: Pause.
Speaker 2: That's my phone!
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So, were, were there any other African American women in this band?
Speaker 1: There were two others--two other women.  In fact, I think the whole rhythm section was African American, and then later, one of the vocalists--the vocalist was African American.  The female vocalist I know.  I don't remember having a male vocalist while I was in it, but it was a great band (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: But--so were there males in this female big band?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, right?  It was all females.  So what was it like working with a big group of women (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Actually, it was interesting because it's a different dynamic; it really, really is.  I mean there's a little bit more--there's--that particular band didn't have a lot of diva-esqe kind of--there was one trombone player that I remember that had that feeling that, that she really didn't need to be there if she could be anywhere.  But there was a real spirit of, I think, cooperation.  I enjoyed it.  I mean I have a women's band now, and I find the level of cooperation--it's--and--I mean they don't give you nearly as much drama as the men give a woman band leader.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: That's been my experience, that I always still have to prove myself.
Story_ID: 673894
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well and you created your own band after that, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: When did you form your own band?
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see; I guess that was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: No, maybe late '70s [1970s].  There was a, a woman in New York [New York], Cobi Narita, who, who made it her business to put together women who--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And how do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Narita, Co- her first name is Cobi, C-O-B-I, Narita, N-A-R-I-T-A.
Speaker 2: Where is she from?
Speaker 1: She was from California, actually.  She's Japanese (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Japanese, yeah.
Speaker 1: She was a--but she was Japanese American, but born in this country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And so she was forming the female bands?
Speaker 1: And she was putting together coalitions and, and collectives for women to get together, to know each other, to know that we existed, and to be able to hire each other and work together.  And she also created venues for us to work, you know; it was--
Speaker 2: And that--this is in the eighty- in the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah; I think that's when I got involved, and I think it started in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Was she a musician herself?
Speaker 1: No, but she's just a very creative force--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and really stayed with it--put together an organization so that women could start to look for their own avenues of entry, you know, and she, she modeled herself--and she offered herself as a model, you know, and taught people a lot about how to start their own businesses, and how to incorporate, and--I mean she really, really--I think she's the force behind so many women bein' able to sustain themselves and have groups--people still--I think she still is mentoring, or she's still showing up, she's still creating venues and she stays in touch with women and how they're movin' through--
Speaker 2: And so she helped you to form your band?
Speaker 1: Oh, she put the band--the one--that particular first band was a band that she put together out of the women that she had brought together.  She just made strong, you know, suggestions that we meet and see what--see if it could work, and in most cases it did.
Speaker 2: And were you band leader for this band?
Speaker 1: I was like a co-band leader.  There were two of us who, who were--who really shared the, the leadership roles.
Speaker 2: And what, what style of music were you performing?
Speaker 1: We did swing and jazz, bebop--not too much, but we did some blues.  But the other band, the Kit McClure Band, was basically playing all the old band charts; pretty much a cover band, I would say--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so that we really did get acquainted with all the big band music of the eras that the man- that the music represented, but we--the, the band that I formed was a quartet, a quintet, or a trio, you know; it could, could go into a venue in any of those.
Story_ID: 673895
Speaker 1: And so who's hiring you at this point?  This is in the early '80s [1980s]?  Or mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the '70s [1970s] that--yeah.  Well, most of the venues were venues that she [Cobi Narita] created.  She was sort of like--she didn't charge a fee but she opened up a lot of different spaces in different places--a lot of college campuses.  And she had panels and--to ask people where they would like to see music, you know?  Where did they think that they could manage to support it?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it was really a, a, a--she opened up community spaces, you know.
Speaker 1: And so this--at this time, you know, as we're moving into the '80s [1980s], the music of the '80s [1980s] is disco, and (laughter), so, so as popular music becomes disco--I mean that's what it was in the '80s [1980s]--you're playing jazz and bebop in these kind of--the music which some would say would, at that point, be the music of yesteryear, how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  Still--they're still sayin' that.
Speaker 1: They're still sayin' that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Are you finding yourselves in competition with popular music, or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I think so.  Well, that big band actually did play a lot of venues that dealt with disco on one set, and our band on another set--deal with the flashing lights--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and all, yeah--very much so.  I got caught up in that; we all did.  It's hard to believe that we survived those years--yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: Well, perhaps because she was creating venues.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.
Speaker 1: That drew--
Speaker 2: And, and she created a lotta venues and spaces that--they made so much sense; I mean, you know, like she'd open up like small museums or art galleries, library spaces, community gardens--places like that where music--where we hadn't been before anyway.
Speaker 1: How did you earn a living doing this?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I mean that's what I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because you said she wasn't charging.
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't charging us a fee for booking us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't--she never charged a fee for--but she didn't have to, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think it was no--I don't ever remember payin' her a fee for a gig; that's what I meant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the gigs were paid, paid gigs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In fact, the--the big band that I joined [Kit McClure Band] was a--that band was a union band at one point, and only played, you know, bands paid--only played gigs that were either scale or above scale for any number of years that--I was in that band a while, before it became just an open shop; but at one point, everybody in the band was--
Speaker 1: Union?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 673896
Speaker 1: And so after that first band that you formed with the support of Cobi--Cobi--how do you say--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Na- Narita [Cobi Nartia].
Speaker 1: Narita.  You formed another band after that, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was that band?
Speaker 2: The first one was with a cult leader in Jersey [New Jersey]; that was--that was called, Inner Spirit [ph.]. That band played mostly in Jersey clubs.  The band that I formed was called Jazzberry Jam.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: When did you form that one?
Speaker 2: That was about, I think the middle '80s [1980s].  The middle '80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And is that the band that took you to Japan?
Speaker 2: That band--that band went to Japan, but I had gone to Japan before with the big band, the Kit McClure Band (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: The Kit McClure?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that band did go on--that band toured Europe, that band did two tours in Europe, yeah, and that band did the Mary Lou Williams Festivals [Mary Lou Williams Jazz Festival] here at the Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York], and that band did Dizzy's Club [Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola]; we did--we did a lotta venues in New York [New York]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --In Lincoln Center [Jazz at Lincoln Center]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, at--you, you went full time as an artist in '82 [1982].  Were you, were you able to sustain yourself?
Speaker 2: Hardly (laughter).  I mean it was rough.  I borrowed a lotta money that first couple a years (laughter) because I, I, I didn't have a, I didn't have a reservoir of money or a plan for how to make it stretch until I could really move into--and could get proficient enough to really be valuable, you know.  Yeah, well, they were rough because things were rough (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you had three children [Monica Hope, Kevin Hope and Darryl Hope].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I had good support with the--with my mother-in-law [Gertrude Hope] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: So you were able to manage traveling and everything, even--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't do too much travelin' in those early--
Speaker 1: When they were young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't move too far out of the tri-state area.
Story_ID: 673897
Speaker 1: When did you remarry?
Speaker 2: Well, I--we were significant others for years before we actually really got married, so that was like '86 [1986], '87 [1987]; it was a long time in between--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: When you met?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Eighty- '84 [1984]--I guess we met in '84 [1984], but we didn't get married 'til like really late, 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you were together for many, many years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your husband--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Walter.
Speaker 1: Walter Booker, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Booker, right.
Speaker 1: And he also was a musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about him.
Speaker 2: Well, he's the one that helped me decide that we should play Elmo's [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] music and to introduce it to a wider public, and to introduce it to--among musicians who could push it forward.  He was a gregarious--just a fun loving kind of person who did a lot for young people.  He had an underground studio, and that studio was like the place that all the kids who were going to music and art came to hang out.  And, because he was working so much, and had the means, he put together a group of young people that he said he wanted to have a really good studio experience where he could just put on a reel and work as long as you wanted to, and he--so a group of kids from music and art, who were part of that group, ended up almost livin' in his space practically.  He hired somebody to make sure they went to school while he was on the road, and it was one of those places where Richard Pryor went to practice his material, and Angie Bofill [Angela Bofill] came out of that studio; [HistoryMaker] Nat Adderley, Jr. came outta that studio--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Who ended up working with Luther Vandross for so many years.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.  At his--when he died, I heard one of the musicians there say that he could look around the room and spot at least a hundred musicians at the funeral who--that Bookey was really instrumental in their careers.
Speaker 1: And where was this underground studio?
Speaker 2: On 88th--87th [Street] and Amsterdam [Avenue] in--
Speaker 1: And he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Upper West Side [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --taught these young people how to produce the music and then record, and everything, right?
Speaker 2: He--yeah, he was a really good engineer, actually.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He spent a lotta time--actually, he built--he built his studio; I mean he hand built it and understood what the dynamics of the sound were, and he got great sound--terrific sound.
Speaker 1: And what was his instrument?
Speaker 2: He played bass.
Story_ID: 673898
Speaker 1: And you said he [Hope's second husband, Walter Booker] was on the road a lot.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, he was with so many bands, you know; almost like simultaneously he played with several bands, and he did travel.  Yeah, he traveled quite a bit (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people he played with?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god.  Well, he was with--he played with [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins, he played with Thelonious [Thelonious Monk], he played for Sarah [Sarah Vaughan]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And didn't he teach Thelonious' son?
Speaker 2: Well, Thelonious' son was one of the people who was going to Music and Art [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right, T.S. Monk [HistoryMaker T.S. Monk, III], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  They had a great relationship.
Speaker 1: Right; I read that.  So he played with the dad, Thelonious Monk--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he played with the dad.
Speaker 1: --but he mentored his son (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell the story?  Because I, I read a story where T.S. Monk, Thelonious' son, said that he really discovered a respect for his father's music as a result of learning that Walter Booker was going to be performing with his dad (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Could you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Well, Thelonious--I, I think--first of all, T--T.S. was really into the music of the day--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and he had a band called Natural Essence, and they added one big hit that was out one whole summer, so that's pretty much where, where his head was.  But he--his father was fairly distant in a sense; I mean Thelonious lived sort of in a bubble of his own, so he--I, I don't know what kinda contact they were havin' at that point, but he was in Booker's studio all the time, and so when Booker got the call to work with his father, he told him, he said, "Guess what?"  He said, "One of the greatest things in the world has just happened to me; I'm gonna be workin' with your father!"  And T.S. said, "Wait a minute.  You're gonna be workin' with my father?"  He said, "Yeah!"  He said, "I'm--I mean I'm really nervous."  He was really nervous about it, too.  But it just floored Thelonious, Jr. that the man that was mentoring him was about to work with his father, and then it made him step--take a couple a steps back to really understand a little bit more about what his father had to offer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And this underground studio that Booker had, he didn't charge the students, did he?
Speaker 2: No, umh-uh.  They were just--and people came in to make a (unclear)--an album, or he would, you know, start a reel for them and then there were charges, but often he was the engineer, and he was also the bass player on their, on their projects.  But it was a--it was tremendous.
Speaker 1: Did you ever perform with them?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, actually, and I, I recorded with him.  He was very, very supportive.  I, I would say he recorded with me (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is really what it--what it really was.  I mean he--when I told him that I wanted to continue to learn Elmo's [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] music and present it to a wider audience, he, he supported that idea totally.
Story_ID: 673899
Speaker 1: You created something called ELMOllenium.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: That band was to teach my colleagues the music, and to also be able to find places to introduce it--to take it to schools and to, to put Elmo's music in the place in history where it belongs because it got so badly neglected at that point.  And it's still hard to get people to incorporate it into their--into the music that they play and to pass it on because they talk about how difficult it is, but--
Speaker 1: How difficult to perform.
Speaker 2: How difficult it is to play, right.  All of it is not that difficult.  In, in, in other words, it's not unplayable; it is very challenging music--it really is.  There no pieces that have--that, that you can say are lightweight pieces of music.  They are really intricate, and take a lot of time.  You know you're not gonna pick up an Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] piece of music and just play through it unless you are really, really a virtuoso kind of reader, and interpret the music and/or make it your own.  But that band--it's in its third generation now, and I just call it Elmo Project 3 [Elmo Hope Project 3] now.  ELMOllenium was at the turn of the century; that's when I put it together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 673900
Speaker 1: So you were talking about how hard it is to play, but you know, you, you took up this torch in 2000 to, to get people to, to, to keep his music alive.  What kinds of challenges have you faced?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the biggest challenge is for me to command the music myself so I know what I'm talkin' about when I try to teach it to other people (laughter); that is something that teaches me something new that I've overlooked in almost every band I've put together, but I learn a lot also from the musicians that, that are eager to play it, and so the questions that they bring me, help me to, to help decipher that, you know, because a lot of the music was transcribed from the rec- from the record, doesn't always match what was on the page, or what I remember hearing, so it's, it's always interesting to work with somebody and have them understand that I'm trying to respect what's on the page, but I want them to be able to play it--to live with it, you know, just like any other bandleader, I think, wants the--wants the band to meld, to communicate, and to make the music their own.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I saw an interview that you did where you talked about the importance of improvisation with--the way that Elmo [Hope's first husband, Elmo Hope] played; that if there was a solo, he wasn't gonna practice the solo and memorize the solo because he would perform in the moment.  Did that, that sense of being in the moment is what's different on the albums, say, than in the music that he wrote up.  Is that so?
Speaker 2: That the music--that--
Speaker 1: Well, you've said that the, the music written--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: --on, on the paper is a little different from what was recorded (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Is that because there was improvisation included in that, or--
Speaker 2: Oh.  No, I don't think so; I think that, you know, the way things get edited they're not always the same, but, but there are some instances where what Elmo played, and what he wrote, may not necessarily match what, what got left on the record--let me put it like that--
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: --because records are manufactured, they're edited, they're spliced, they're--now they're punched, you know; they're shrunk, they're compressed, there's--you can do so many things with them now, so it's--now it's different, but now it's even more different.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But he, he had run across somebody who talked about practicing an improvised solo, I think; is that what you're getting at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So this is different.
Speaker 2: No--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: But tell me about that.
Speaker 2: That is a different situation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but, no, he felt that the moment that you were in was the moment you played, not something that you had canned or rehearsed, or maybe, you know, now you have it in your repertoire and you're gonna pull it out every time you get to this space.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That was--no, he, he never did that, and he thought that that was cheating sort of like, that you should practice what you're going to call an improvised solo, and what you're gonna lead people to believe you made up are not made up because improvisation comes from the body of knowledge that you have to give to it. Your story, it's your stor- what do you have to say about this, not what you said about it yesterday or two months ago; it's what, how is it affecting you now.  So, he was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673901
Speaker 1: In the '90s [1990s], what were you doing musically?
Speaker 2: I was writing, I--in the '90s [1990s] I recorded my own CD [compact disc] or two (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: What's it called?
Speaker 2: One was 'Between Two Kings,' which was really Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  People thought (laughter)--people said to me, "Are you talkin' about Elmo Hope or Walter Booker?"  That's--no (laughter); it was really about the death of--not so much the death of Martin Luther King, but the idea that this man of peace was--also had the same name as, as that tragedy in California, you know; that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Rodney King?
Speaker 2: That was what I meant by that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Rodney King?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wrote a piece that was dedicated to that, and that's what the title referred to.  And then I did another one that was called 'Elmo's Fire,' which was my first attempt at, at, at recreating, with some other musicians, some of Elmo's music.  And then I did one called 'Nothin' But Love,' which has some more of my writing on it.
Speaker 1: And who's producing these albums for you?  What, what--are you working with a label?
Speaker 2: Well, no, not now.  In fact, that last one was 'Reservoir,' and that was--I mean that album was done in the early '90s [1990s]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so I'm just about getting ready to do another album, but it's like an--it's self-produced; I still don't have a label.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.  And--well, in the early '90s [1990s] you were with a label [Reservoir Records], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--so did--were they good at distributing the music?
Speaker 2: No.  The distribution is always the biggest problem--always.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He [Mark Feldman] did have some European distribution but he wasn't satisfied with it and he snatched it, and I--that record--that C--it's a CD, and so I just keep them to sell at, at venues when I'm playin', you know, live, and mostly out of town, 'cause now everybody is listening to a file, or an MP3, or a--something that you drop, or something you kick (laughter); I don't--it's just--
Speaker 1: Technology has changed dramatically (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, technology--and I just heard some frightening stuff today on the radio.  I heard it about--that the catalogs--how much the--these catalogs that are bein' live streamed are, are worth, and that they're goin' public--unbelievable.  So, I know there's some money around somewhere because when I get a royalty statement, I get pennies for ten thousand plays, you know.  It's, it's unbelievable--the disparity. So, that's--
Speaker 1: But hasn't that always been true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but now it's like over the top, I think.  Yeah, there's always--the royalties for jazz musicians have been based on a formula for The Beatles, or for somebody who made platinum, you know, or millions and millions of dollars before the royalties were distributed, you know; so, those formulas don't work for very many jazz musicians.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.  But, but now it's really time to see what this new technology is gonna do to decimate you, and to get in touch with the forces, to get--try to get ahead of another curve that they've--they already let go with the hip hop community, you know, sampling.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I still get some royalties from samples.
Story_ID: 673902
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to a question I asked you earlier about jazz.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, as we move into the 2000s, and jazz--the art form of jazz is something internationally--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --beloved, and understood as an American art form, you know.  Wynton Marsalis would say it is the American art form (laughter).  But Americans are not necessarily aligning with jazz in a way that sometimes internationally we see it, and I know you've--we've talked about this a bit.  What is your--what's your perception of how jazz fits into the musical nomenclature now?
Speaker 2: Well, it feels--jazz feels like a stepchild to the--to what's bein' presented and called jazz, and because the definitions keep changing because the music keeps changing, it's--it's bein' defined by people who don't know it and don't care about it and don't understand anything about it or about what its genesis was, you know, and what it is that still speeds it--still feeds it, you know; it's still, it's still a music of the spirit, you know?  And it's a music of, of what your feelings are and what your perceptions of your life--it's, it's a way of living, you know, that you're reflecting with your art.  So, the schools now are in charge of what jazz is or isn't, and they are defining for us now what jazz is, and they are changing its structure.
Speaker 1: The schools--when you say the schools, what do you mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I mean the universities with institutes of jazz who left out the, the journeymen, apprentice piece of learning the form, learning what it was about from other people and other people's real live experiences.  They have handed--oh.
Speaker 1: You're okay.
Speaker 2: Am I okay? I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: They've formulated what this is and put it here, and what this is and put it here, and now the--you come out of school well polished to play.  I had one kid tell me, "I just graduated; I know what--I can play anything.  I can play quick, I can play slow, I can play as fast as you need me to.  I can play Latin, I can play pop, I can play--," this is, this is his litany to me of what he--the school have prepared him for.  I never heard him say, "I can create something out of all these techniques that I've been taught."  He--creation isn't even part of it, it doesn't seem.  That's--that's a blanket statement, and it sounds like it covers, you know, a lot, there are some brilliant students out there--but I think they're also bein' mentored.  The ones that I know are getting lots of experience being mentored by other people, and what they're getting from the school is the technique and the broadening of the base, you know, and they are going to be fine--you can tell already they are going to be the people who establish what happens next.  But--
Speaker 1: How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I--I'm, I'm--I feel good about the young people that I see out there who are stepping beyond; they're already beginning to take on the responsibility of bein' students and, and taking work, and workin' with older musicians and, you know, bein' inquisitive and getting their feet wet.

Speaker 1: You have a daughter who's a musician.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a daughter who's a singer.
Speaker 1: Singer.
Speaker 2: And playwright.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Monica [Monica Hope], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me about her journey in the arts.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Well, you know, she--when I said that I had some good support, her grandmother [Gertrude Hope], who took her to a gospel based church, and the fact that I think that just her DNA from her father [Elmo Hope] and me, and her--her father has left her with some--I mean she's really gifted; she has--she's anointed; that--that's what I see.  So when we were--when she was a baby, her crib was right--we had a really tiny apartment, and her crib was right next to the record player and the record player, when we weren't playin', was pretty much on, and I just feel like she got a lot of vibrations (laughter).  Not only that, she was right up against the piano because I played until I was eight and a half months pregnant--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, you said that.
Speaker 2: --and she was--she was right at the piano.  So, she's writing a play ['Ashes From My Wings,' Monica Hope] now about her journey, and it's getting--she's, she's in rehearsal now 'cause she's going to play the part herself; it's a one woman story.  She's written all the music for it, and she's a pretty gifted writer.  She won some heavy songwriting competitions, and about ten years a- the first John Lennon [John Lennon Songwriting Contest]; maybe it was $20,000 and a--
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: --and a home studio.
Speaker 1: And what style of singing?
Speaker 2: She's a--she is a gospel singer, she's an Aretha Franklin person (laughter).
Speaker 1: Powerhouse (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You know, she sings rhythm and blues, she has some really deep contralto, and she can belt.  She's--she has a great gift; she really does.

Speaker 1: And what are you doing now with your gift?
Speaker 2: I'm teaching in a community space.  I feel like I'm--that's a give back for me, in a way.  I've been affiliated with the school [Lucy Moses School, Kaufman Music Center, New York, New York] for a number of years, teaching children and adults, and I'm--I still have the band, Jazzberry Jam.  I am working on a documentary ['Seeking Hope'] with a bass player named Mimi Jones, who is--we've got about forty minutes done of what we hope is gonna be full length.  I'm writing music for a new CD [compact disc], which is--and I'm hoping to have some guests on it.  I'm going back to California to interview some more of my family for the documentary, and I'm, I'm looking to help people in communities, who have small clubs, to stay alive and to spread the music.  What--what's missing is music in the schools, and some corporations are now trying to make it possible that more children get exposed to, to schools so that we're not only trying to get audiences, but we're trying to also teach children that the music they're listening to today has all these other roots that they haven't been exposed to.  So, those are the--the, those are the projects that I'm doing as we speak.

Speaker 1: As you think about your life and your career, and the diversity of your experiences, what do you hope your legacy is that you're leaving?
Speaker 2: I hope people see me as a, a person who's--didn't--I--not perfect, not striving for stardom, but I just wanna be recognized as a person who did my best inside the music and out of it; somebody who fell into a lot of deep, dark holes, and climbed out to see another day and to play with--I hope people see that I tried to bring some joy into somebody else's life with the music, and to move it forward as a way to make a statement about who we are as a people.  That's what I hope people see.

Speaker 1: When did your husband, Walter Booker, pass away?
Speaker 2: He died in 2006--the end of that year--yeah.
Speaker 1: When you think about your life, do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I have regrets; yeah, I do.  But I feel like I've been blessed to still be here and to be relatively healthy--to be on my feet, to be participating, to be playing, to have colleagues that are of long- long standing, to have some diversity in my life.  I--yeah, there's some things that I might do differently, I think, but I'm not so sure that I would be so ready, at this age, to say that I really would have changed anything because then I wouldn't know who I would have been (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't know if I'd give anybody advice to follow the same--do the same things the same way I did, but I think you have to be brave enough to recognize whatever it is you've done can be salvaged, and you can start again on a brand new day; and I think that that's what I've been able to do.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give to young African American people who might want to go in the same paths, you know, to become a musician, to pursue that dream?
Speaker 2: I would say take advantage of all that you see around you that is--that will feed your fire to do it.  First, you have to have the fire to do it because without that, you will fizzle out very quickly.  Just be passionate, have your goals, study as hard as you can, stay involved with the community, remember where you came from, try to develop your story, get to know yourself and share that self with other people.  You are valuable; if that's what you--where you want your value to be, you will find out that you do have value; you have to appreciate it and be, I think, grateful for it--also gratitude.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's--you pretty--you covered a lot!  And I'm really very happy that we got around to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well, you were missing from your story.  We had to get you in there (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you so much for sharing.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.  Thank you for completing this.
Speaker 1: You are most welcome.  Thank you.
