Story_ID: 69634
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, let's talk about your beginnings and can, can you give us the names of your parents and spell them for us and give us their dates and places of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, my mother's name is Juanita Ramsey and that's J-U-A-N-I-T-A.  Ramsey is R-A-M-S-E-Y, and she just turned seventy-two yesterday, so I can't count what year that is, but I know she's 72 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and then my dad's name is John Ramsey, J-O-H-N and then R-A-M-S-E-Y, and he was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and he has pass--he passed at the age of sixty-five of prostate cancer and I forget his date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right did your parents talk about or did anybody else in the family talk about your ancestors and what they were doing in the 19th century and prior to the Civil War or if they--what they were doing during reconstruction or do you have any ancestral information you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically we were from down south, a lot of people from down south, Virginia, in particular.  The Ramsey family even had a colored school that they called for colored children, which the Ramsey family actually operated and owned, so I see us as having a history of being businesspeople, which was real exciting for me.  Educators, in particular, which I think is really important.  My mother's family was always from--her mother, my grandmother, Marjorie Pendleton, was from West Palm Beach [Florida], so she had a whole different environment where she grew up where her family was basically also educators, in, in education that kind of thing, taught school.  Those particular things and just real proud of who she was and what she's about.  And she was also one of the first African American licensed practical nurses on what we called the Main Line, which is the Ardmore-Bryn Mawr area right before you get into Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It's about twenty miles from Philadelphia, so she was always real proud about that and tended to talk about that, but always believed in education, both sides of our families.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you parents ever impart a story to you about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, ba, basically what I'm hearing is from a mutual friend that really hooked them up and then they got together and then six of us were born and two adopted.
Speaker 1: Now how, how did they--your--or wh, why did your mother move to Pennsylvania and why did your father move to Pennsylvania--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what it's basically, Larry, because one their parents were okay, were here first and then they were born, so they didn't have a choice, so--
Speaker 1: Oh, their parents moved here.
Speaker 2: --their parents, yeah their parents migrated from, my father's parents migrated from Virginia.  My mom's parents migrated from West Palm Beach and they ended up, my mother's parents at Ardmore and my father in Bryn Mawr, which is only like probably two miles, you know, that separates Ardmore and Bryn Mawr.  They're very two small communities and what it is, is very two small African American communities and so they're close-knit communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody's almost related.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother you said went to school at Bethune School of Nursing [now Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].
Speaker 2: My grandmother, Marjorie Pendleton.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Um-hum my grandmother.
Speaker 1: All right, and was, was she a nurse here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, she was, yes and then she came to Pennsylvania and became one of the first African American licensed practical nurses to actually work in the hospitals, which was really unheard of for the most part, especially when you're dealing in the Bryn Mawr area, very rich, affluent area.  And so for her to do that, that was real special for us and I think because of her that rubbed off some things on me as far as becoming a registered nurse.
Story_ID: 69635
Speaker 1: Now what, what did your mother [Juanita Ramsey] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mom was a domestic worker, did that for a long time, but was also very political in the community and to make sure that people in the community were taught about the whole political process.  Was one of the first African American committee women in the Bryn Mawr area.  People that ran knew that they had to come to our home, which I didn't understand for a long time, which meant it was basically white men that came to our house, so many at one point I said to my dad is she having an affair with some of these people, what's going on here because they would always come to her because they wanted to win and the African American vote put them over the top and they would become, you know, the winner of those elections.  So, she basically was--worked very hard as a domestic, cleaning very affluent people's homes like the Norrises, the Biddles, those type of folks and did very well with those families and actually brought up their children.  As time went on my mother only had an eighth grade education, at the age of fifty she said she really wanted to do what she wanted to do, which was become a nurse and we put her through nursing school, I guess about four or five of the girls put her through nursing school.  So, she is still a licensed practical nurse now and still works.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was a committee woman in, in the Republican Party.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 69636
Speaker 1: What about your father [John Ramsey], what did he do?
Speaker 2: My dad had several jobs and I guess that's what happened in our community with black men in particular where he was a milk man at one point.  He collected trash at one point.  Before he died, he was a school bus driver, which was real popular with the children and those type of things.  But, he pretty much worked his way up and then he also had his landscaping business, which was a very, very good business and did real well, even with the eighth grade education he was able to do that, which people wouldn't even realize that he did, he was not, you know, did not have a diploma.  But, he was really able to function and do what he needed to do to make it, to survive, you know, and help our family to survive.
Story_ID: 69637
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want you to think back.  Now you grew up in, in, in--
Speaker 2: Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: --Bryn Mawr, okay, and think back and tell us, I guess about what, some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in your community were, you know what did you see when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: It was a very unique place.  It was a very racist area, which was real scary sometimes to be honest.  When you're looking at and I'm thinking about as you have me going back through this process, which is interesting, as we grew up when we were younger going into first and second and third grade we didn't make an issue around the color thing.  We really didn't pick up on it as much because we had little friends that were white that accepted us.  We went to their house, they came to our house; we didn't see that as an issue.  As we got older, I noticed that things started to change.  When you're in that junior high level that whole thing after maybe sixth grade, seventh grade you started to see a change where you were no longer invited to those same children's home, there tended to be some issues with that.  In junior high and in high school at Haverford (and it was Haverford High School, a very affluent high school) I had 860 kids in my class there was only twelve African Americans.  That's something I really remember.  We had no African American teachers, which was real upsetting for me.  And I remember in eighth grade where Ms. Bates, I'll never forget it, came to me when I went to her--we were having a class and we were talking about what type of things that your ethnic group has really given to the country and when I was standing there with my little "Ebony" magazine, which my mom gave me, which I was very proud about, she let me know what African Americans didn't do anything for this country, all we did was pick cotton.  Now this was in 1964, I guess, or something like that.  I lost it.  When I realized that I had thrown a chair at Ms. Bates, ended up in the principal's office, they called my mother [Juanita Ramsey] who again, the school knew my mom because she was very active, not just with, with her children but all the kids.  They called her mom Ramsey on the street.  Parents respected her.  They called her and told her what happened, and she made it real clear that blacks did do things for this country, that I shouldn't be suspended, the teacher should be suspended because she should know better and why would she tell me, you know, those type of things in the classroom.  You know and even if it was individual that was still wrong. The other things I remember is my counselor when I went to her about three days later to let them know I wanted to be a nurse they told me that they did not know of any black registered nurses and I couldn't do that and I needed to go to Cheyney, which is nothing wrong with Cheyney University [of Pennsylvania in Cheyney, Pennsylvania], but I needed to go there and take home ec [home economics] because maybe that's what I needed to do be a cook, you know, so I could be hired by a rich white family--these were her exact words--and actually cook.  So, those are the things that are real poignant to me that I really remember and that really get me upset.  But on the other hand, I remember having a lot of fun with my family, my sisters, my friends, doing a lot of things, having a sit-in in the principal's office after [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated to say we want our rights, you know, we should be treated better.  That's what Martin Luther King was about.  Once again, they tried to suspend me because, you know, I was pulling all the African American kids, which was not many, into the principal's office, but also pulled in a lot of the white students, which was real interesting.  My mom just tells a story there was more white students in the black student union than there were blacks because there wasn't that many blacks in our school, in our area.  So, those are the things that I remember.  I, I always tried to get the truth out.  You know, to let people know, to educate people.  I always tried to be a leader, I guess.  Most people--my sisters would say I tried to take over, but I tried to let people know that there's a lot of things that we've done as people, but we need to brag a little bit more.  We need to let people know what we had really done and what we were proud about.  We need to let people know when we're not happy with a situation, but how do we go about it to resolve it.  We don't have to be violent.  We can sit in, we can do some things and really kind of mimic--cause I remember watching the race riots on television those types of things, and I tried to mimic that, not the violent piece, but let's sit in and let people know where we're coming from.  Let's pull everybody together, be unified not just black folks, but the white folks too, Hispanic, you know, whoever, Asians, to pull everybody together to say this is not right.  So, those are the types of things that I remember in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania].  I remember that we always had to eat Spam, which I hate to this day 'cause that's all we could afford, you know, or apple sauce and grits, you know, those type of things, but it was exciting and fun and I never knew we didn't have a whole lot of money.  You know, I knew my mom worked hard in particular and so did my dad [John Ramsey], but I never really knew if you looked at us and somebody else looked at us, our income would call us poor.  But, we didn't know such a thing.  All we knew is we had a good time, you know, and we were treated with respect at our home and we were, we were told that we needed to have other people respect us back.
Story_ID: 69638
Speaker 1: Now what kind of house did you all live in?  Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a three-story home with one bathroom, which I really remember because when you have all these people trying to use the same bathroom it's a little difficult especially in the morning.  It had a nice yard in the front and in the back where we had a little, a little bird fountain in the front and my father [John Ramsey] was like I said a landscaper, so I had flowers all over the place, roses, all different kind of flowers because what he would do is take some of the flowers that when he was working with people take some of their flowers that they purchase and put 'em in our yard, so our yard always looked nice.  And at Christmas time, we would have Santa going up the roof, so we'd always have the best decorations, that kind of stuff.  So, it was always a lot of fun.  It was a nice house.  My mother [Juanita Ramsey] still lives there and so she's still proud of her house.  She still has a wonderful nice backyard where she has a lot of barbecues.  Front is still filled with flowers.  It's still three flights to walk up, which is very painful now for me to do that.  I cannot run up and down those steps, but we were all there and had a good time.
Story_ID: 69639
Speaker 1: Okay, now you sound like you were really a pretty feisty little girl to throw a chair at a teacher you know.
Speaker 2: Well, that's the rumor.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you were, when, when that happened?
Speaker 2: I think that was like seventh or eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventh or eighth grade.
Speaker 1: You were fairly young yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A teenager, you're probably about twelve, I think about thirteen at the oldest, twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: You actually threw the chair and did you hit her?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--.  Did, did, you hurt her?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What happened to her?
Speaker 2: Basically she went to the hospital, you know they checked her out.  She had bruises, you know, it wasn't a lot of drama and trauma as far as I'm concerned as a nurse, but she had some bruises.  She had black and blue bruises that whole thing, because when the chair hit her it hit her on her side, you know, and it bruised it that kind of stuff, and she fell back, you know, and fell on the floor that whole thing.  And now as I look it her she probably got Worker's Comp[ensation].
Speaker 1: Wow, that is some kind of story.  And--
Speaker 2: Well I think you know--
Speaker 1: Have you--did you know--had you read a lot of black, his, history.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It's my favorite.  History was like my best class, and this was the history class, Larry, you know, and basically she was telling me after my mom [Juanita Ramsey] told, somebody who I trusted, who has credibility, she's telling me that black folks didn't do anything, and I was trying to explain my little presentation those type of things and basically she just took my paper and said well you can sit down now because that's not true.  And so, but it really, really shows you the type of racism that we had in that school district that really concerned me.  Because just what happened to me, probably been happening for a long time and nobody really said anything, nobody really called her on it, and yes I was probably wrong that I threw the chair, but it made a statement and it made people pay attention.
Speaker 1: Did it make a difference later on?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Then we, you know, we had parents' forums to talk about how can we get some African American teachers in the school.  How can we get different role models.  What kind of things that teachers should be teaching if it's, you know, you talking about history.  That's not appropriate.  And they also had teachers have training around diversity.  You know now they didn't use the word back then.  It wasn't the buzz word, but it was definitely now that I look at it they did diversity training for them because they really didn't understand my culture as an African American student.  It was basically everybody grouped together, you know, and that was it and that's how we were taught.  It wasn't really understanding or really showing what, you know, all culture or ethnic groups did, it was just about what white folks did at that particular time.
Story_ID: 69640
Speaker 1: Okay, so where you a good student in those days or?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was pretty good (laughter).  I think I could have done better because I--but I really was, really dealing more with the whole activity piece, you know, really looking at what we could do better to make the school better, so I was always focused on that piece.  I probably had like C's, D's maybe an F here and there now that you talk about, but I could of, I could of done better, but I think that also what happened was they had me so labeled as a child that had behavioral problems or, you know, because of what I did that I was labeled that I really didn't get the attention that I should have gotten and that was like earlier on.  I think as I got older and understood that I wanted to be a nurse my grades really changed because I wanted to show people that I could do it, so I went from like a C, D, F student to like a A, B student especially in the sciences because that was my favorite, which kind of shocked people too.
Story_ID: 69641
Speaker 1: Now, now when you were a smaller kid what kind of things were you interested in, what kind of things would you do for fun or what kind of things were you drawn to?
Speaker 2: A lot of times just a lot of family things, playing with my sisters at the playground.  Our parents gave us a swing set, so we had all the kids would come to our house 'cause we were the only one on the block that had a swing set.  We had tables and chairs for little people, so we always had tea parties, so that was a big thing.  I guess I was a party animal, so most of the people were always at our house because we had mostly girls there, so a lot of the girls would be there and we would just have a lot of fun, you know, playing with dolls and dollhouses, 'cause we were blessed to have that.  And we had bicycles too and other people didn't.  Now they may be secondhand bicycles from where my mom worked, people would give her these things, but we still had 'em.  So, we were some of the few kids on the block that had these things, so of course people would come over and want to use our bikes, our dolls, our tea set, that type of thing.  So, we had a lot of fun.  I was also in the Brownies.  That was real important for me to be in the Brownies, and then I was in the Girl Scouts until I was eighteen.  Because of that, we were able to do a lot of different activities.  We even--the Girl Scout leaders even drove us to Mexico, so that was something a lot of other black kids didn't get to do.
Speaker 1: From Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: From Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: We, we drove and we had a thing I'll never forget Mexico would burst, you know, that was the sign.  So, that was like exciting for us too, so I was able to travel, get to do some things.  It--to me living in Bryn Mawr was a good experience because I learned a lot in going to Haverford school district.  It taught me a lot.
Story_ID: 69642
Speaker 1: What was the ratio of black people to white in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Wow, it's really small.  It's very small.  Again, like I said Bryn Mawr is large 'cause you have Bryn Mawr College [Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], you have Haverford College [Haverford, Pennsylvania].  You have some very important colleges there, so you have a lot of students coming in.  You have Villanova [University, Villanova, Pennsylvania] is in that arena also, Larry, but what happened was you only have a small--in a black community it's a small area.  You have like one street, a couple of streets up in further Bryn Mawr like Prospect Avenue in Haverford [Pennsylvania] where we were from.  It was basically just a couple, you know, small streets of family.  And say there was maybe like I would say thirty families on each street or something like that.  So, it wasn't that high.  You know, and then when you go to school sometimes I was the only black in our class.
Story_ID: 69643
Speaker 1: Tell me about what high school, I mean what, what was your high, high school experience like?
Speaker 2: High school [Haverford High School, Havertown, Pennsylvania] was interesting for us also because then we started finding out more of who we are and what we wanna be, myself in particular, and that's when I really knew that I still wanted to be a nurse because when I was younger I was always carrying those little first-aid kits.  As soon as somebody fell, we were out to help 'em right away and give 'em a band-aid or, you know, a alcohol swab that might have burned 'em or something like that.  But, you know, by the time I got to high school in tenth grade that was like pretty serious, you know, what's the deal, what are you gonna do, and people kept pushing that and especially the kids in school and then too you start dealing with the junior prom, the senior prom.  And we had developed a band and so we had a band and it was like a mixed band.  So, at the junior prom and senior prom we were like the stars because we played for both of those proms.
Speaker 1: Now what did you, what did you--when you say we developed a band like was it you and your sisters or, or?
Speaker 2: No, they really didn't like me that much.  They fought me most of the time (laughter) or I fought them.  It was a really good friend of mine, Aleta Fitzgerald, who I grew up with, and we were just real close.  But, she wasn't in the band because I was like the singer, so she wasn't in the band, but she was always really supportive and would always help me when I wanted to do some of these crazy things like sit-ins and things like that.  But, it was an exciting time.  I, I had a really rough time in high school because again it was the racial issues.  On one hand, we were having a lot of fun.  On the other hand, unfortunately, a lot of the African American sisters ended up becoming pregnant and so we started out with six females and only two graduated, and that was Aleta and myself.  So, I found myself seeing kids that I really grew up with not graduating.  You know, that really upset me.  But, I also saw that the white kids that were supposed to really good friends of mine, not our friends anymore.  So, it was a dilemma, so what are you supposed to do about it?  So, you try to go around and, and, and feel like you're a part of the group, but we really weren't a part of the group, you know, we kind of like forced ourselves in and that's why I started the band with these white guys and stuff and we sang at, you know, we sang at the prom, that kind of stuff, but was always pushing my way in.  I felt like, you know, we had to be a part of this because I wanted to be a part of it even though you don't want us to be a part of it.  So, it was that struggle for three years to actually do that, but in the process I was able to get my license.  My uncle gave me a car, you know, so I was like really cool then 'cause we could go out to lunch and not have to eat in the cafeteria.  So, it was a lot of good positive things, but there was a lot of negative things too that helped me grow stronger in what I needed to be doing and what I was about.
Story_ID: 69644
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in high school, anybody that, that took an interest in you in school or in the community, you know, that helped develop you?
Speaker 2: I think it was more in the community.  Again, my mom [Juanita Ramsey], but then a lot of the other parents that were working with her and there's about three or four women that worked with her.  One, Ms. Fitzgerald who also was in our church who was real supportive.  And church was a real important base for us.  Taught us a lot of things.  Reverend Younger was our minister, and he like had been our minister for like fifty years.  So, he was older but very intelligent and wise gentlemen that you know you kinda listened to even though you were a teenager and sometimes you didn't, you know, pay attention, but still he was real innovative and creative and was really into business.  And because of him, we were able to build a church and I watched that kind of stuff as I was growing up.  And I was like, wow look, look at what we're actually doing.  These folks that are maids or housekeepers, you know, construction workers, people that maybe didn't have a job or able you know to put this amount of money together to actually build a church.  But, we were one of the largest churches in the Main Line when I was growing up and a lot of people used to come to Saints Memorial Baptist Church in Bryn Mawr.  Our deacon--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Saints Memorial Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Saints Memorial.
Speaker 2: Um-hum in Bryn Mawr.  And our deacon Albert Lee was one of my mentors who is still there and his wife, Vernice Lee.  So, we got a lot of mentors.  I've had a lot of mentors growing up in the church that really, you know, 'cause you have to go to Sunday school, you have to say your piece, you know during Easter time or Christmas time or any holidays.  So, it really made me be able to--it really helped me with my speaking, you know to stand in front of a group and for have people clap and you know, praise you for doing a good job, those type of things.  So, that was real important for us and that was--a spiritual component in our home was real important where we had to our time where we'd prayed and those type of things.  Our devotion time together on Sundays was real important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, those were the things that, you know, were important to me growing up.
Speaker 1: Did you have specific responsibilities in the church to perform--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was on the you--yeah as a youth I was in the youth group.  I was in the choir, you know.  We did everything.  We had meetings every Sunday night at 6 o'clock, youth fellowship, black, Black Baptist Youth Fellowship, so that was like an ongoing thing, plus we came because you can meet boys, so that was real exciting for us, you know, and they gave us little parties and dances, you know.  As I grow older now I'm even the youth leader and the director of the youth choir so those kind--at the same church, ended up.  Things come full circle.  Came right back from New York and ended up there back at the same church and doing some of the same things people gave me.
Story_ID: 69645
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, yeah that, that raises a question about, about your social life in high school.  You're in a all-white school basically and you're in a band and you went the prom basically as a--did you have a date for the prom or did you go as a--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I asked Roy Johnson.  I'll never forget it, and he said yes and he was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And if you went out with somebody from Philadelphia you were you were really cool in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], you know, to have a Philly guy, you know, come out to Bryn Mawr that was a big deal from Germantown.  I'll never forget it (laughter).  So that year--we had a social life.  My mom [Juanita Ramsey], again, you know is like the, the block mother and we had parties and things like that at our house so that we wouldn't be getting in trouble going somewhere else, and she didn't want us in Philadelphia, so she had things for us out, you know, at our house that kind of stuff.  So, that was really cool and then we started hanging out with Norristown [Pennsylvania] kids.  More, different communities, but African American communities like in Phoenixville [Pennsylvania], you know, 'cause we had cousins in Phoenixville, so we started dealing with Phoenixville.  So, then it was more like an outreach for me learning to meet other people, where they were coming from, what was happening with them in their community, other than just Ardmore [Pennsylvania] and Bryn Mawr.  And that was real interesting because socially the guys from Ardmore and Bryn Mawr didn't like that.  And that's when gangs were starting and stuff, and it was mostly in Philadelphia, so we didn't hear about that.  But, then we were blamed because these guys were coming into Bryn Mawr and Ardmore's turf, so Bryn Mawr and Ardmore started getting little gangs together and they'd fight the guys that were coming from Phoenixville.  Norristown in particular they hated and Philadelphia which was real interesting.  Several times police had to be called, all that whole thing, and people were would like call my mom why did you allow them to have these kids in, you know, but I think what happened was it was really like a lot of animosity, you know.  People really didn't know each other and they weren't used to people coming into their turf as they called it, into their arena, so it was new for us, but it was also threatening because it was a different group of people because we saw the black guys not paying attention to us.  They were dating the white women in school who had money who could treat them, who could take 'em places.  We could not do that.  We couldn't afford it.  So, basically we went somewhere else, you know, and when those guys came in it really was not--if they came in with more than one or two pe--if they came in two or three people that's when the problem started.  When they came by their self, it wasn't an issue.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did you ever witness any trouble, you know--
Speaker 2: At my sweet sixteen birthday party.  It was a big fight because I invited--we had it at a hall.  I was very excited and we invited not just the Ardmore, Bryn Mawr boys, we invited the guys from out, out of town, you know, and so at my sweet sixteen birthday party was a big gang fight.  And police had to be called the whole thing.  It was quite embarrassing.  So, it wasn't good.  I mean, nobody got hurt, hurt, but you know back then they weren't using guns and knives and you know that whole thing, machine guns whatever.  They were like basically punching each other, that kind of stuff, and people had to break it up.  But, to have that happen on Preston Avenue in Bryn Mawr that was a mess.  You know, people were like freaking out, and it was all my fault they told me, so I didn't feel good about it at all now that you bring it up (laughter).

Speaker 1: You were in the band now, you, you were the singer of this band--
Speaker 2: Yes I was.
Speaker 1: --and who did you pattern yourself after?  I know teenagers always usually--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh my God, Aretha Franklin.  You can't tell me I'm not Aretha Franklin (laughter).  So, we did like a lot of "Respect".  We did talent shows.  We were in the talent show all the time.  We made the talent show and all the time I had to be the lead singer.
Speaker 1: And you sang Respect--
Speaker 2: Yep, "Respect" (laughter).
Speaker 1: --Areth, Aretha Franklin, okay.
Speaker 2: All the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dionne Warwick, if you see me walking down the street ["Walk on By"], that one.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  That's an interesting mix of--(unclear)--(laughter).
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).  That's the only two I could do (laughter).  No, but it was fun.  That's was a good social thing, 'cause I liked to sing and still do, so yeah we had a band, but you know if you wanted to be in it you had to be background, 'cause I was the lead.  You see a pattern here?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 1: Okay, now on the verge of graduating from high school [Haverford High School, Havertown, Pennsylvania] what, what did you, were you still focused on being a nurse when you got out?
Speaker 2: Absolutely because people told me I couldn't.  So, I applied to places like Bryn Mawr Hospital 'cause my mom [Juanita Ramsey] said I had to, which was again an all-white school, you know, so different nursing schools.  'Cause back then nursing schools were the thing.  That's where you could really learn a lot versus the four years.  People didn't do that.  Plus I knew my parents couldn't afford the four year piece, so basically applied to a lot of nursing schools.  My doctor, I'll never forget, Dr. Jones, had told me about Harlem Hospital in New York [New York] and then one of our neighbors had went to Harlem Hospital and graduated and I always thought she was really cool.  So, I applied to Harlem Hospital and got in.  It was the happiest day of my life.  And so, I was ready to go to Harlem Hospital, re--you now had read all about Harlem but never experienced that, of course, but I was ready to go and you couldn't tell me anything, so that's what happened.  I was ready, graduating and got some scholarships 'cause I was also in the nursing club.  That was a big thing at Haverford.  They actually gave me a scholarship.  I couldn't believe that they gave me a $500 scholarship.  I was a happy little camper because I had worked for three years from tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade as a little nurse and did some candy striper things at our local nursing homes.  So, they did give me a scholarship which helped, you know, put me through school.
Speaker 1: So, this was 1971--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I graduated, yeah, in 1971, you're right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated from Bryn Mawr High School?
Speaker 2: Haverford High School.
Speaker 1: Haverford High School, okay.
Speaker 2: And then that September, really August, my parents drove me to Harlem.
Story_ID: 61327
Speaker 1: Now, where did you stay in Harlem [New York]. Did, did they have a re--a residence?
Speaker 2: They had a nursing residence, which was unreal.  Basically when my parents were driving me down Lenox Avenue I could feel my eyes filling up with water because I was like, what have I done, because I had never seen this many black folks in my life.  I had not seen that many people on the street shooting up in my life.  When we stopped at a light, somebody had a needle, you know, actually shooting up.  I was like, oh my God.  My mom [Juanita Ramsey] actually turned around--I'll never forget--and said are you sure that this is where you want to be?
Speaker 1: But just to put this in some kind of historical perspective perhaps, Harlem was experiencing a big decline in the '70s [1970s] and--but the Harlem Hospital is that in the cultural center of Harlem, 135th--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right Lenox Avenue.
Speaker 1: You had the Schomburg Center right across the street.
Speaker 2: Right across the street.
Speaker 1: The old Y's down the street--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the YMCA.  A lot of--it, it was historic--
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: --that site is historic--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Wonderful place, wonderful place.  A lot of history there.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--125th Adam Clayton Powell--(unclear)--they still have--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: The black market.
Speaker 1: Yeah--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: You could go shopping.  That kind of stuff.  But remember being eighteen, going down the street my head was spinning.  This was unreal for me, you know, and then we pulled up to Harlem Hospital and when we got out the car, you know, I'll never forget a gentlemen came running by my mom and grabbed her purse.  That was our experience and we're like oh my God.
Speaker 1: He ran and he took her purse?
Speaker 2: Yes, he ran up and grabbed her purse as we were trying to go in, and of course she was like that's my purse and she was starting to run down the street after him.  We were like come back, come back.  So, that was our first day in Harlem.  Pretty exciting.  And then the next step we went into the actual, the waiting room in the lobby of the hospital, because we didn't know where to go.  And so we got in there and you were just--I was just overwhelmed.  I was overwhelmed.  There was either people bleeding, either somebody screaming, you know, for help because they were in pain.  There was just so many different things going on.
Story_ID: 61328
Speaker 1: This is the Harlem of The Last Poets' poems.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a Harlem--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --junkies and--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I'm telling you, absolutely.  That's when all those things were happening.  A matter fact, there was one movie, I'll never forget that, I was able to go to a screening on 'cause it was at 125th street, I mean, so those were some of the exciting things I got to do, but again my first day it was just overwhelming, overpowering for me.  They told us after we were in the hospital to go to the residence, which was right down the street from--it was on 136th street.  The hospital is on one side and the residence on the other side.  We walk in and this building is absolutely horrible.  And I'm like I my God.  They say my room's on the fifth floor, you know, so of course here I am I'm feeling so good, I have a TV, I have this big stuffed purple elephant, you know, you know with purple curtains, purple carpet, you know, you just couldn't tell me anything.  I was like excited about that.  We get on the elevator and we start moving things and I see some of the students and the students have to be fifteen, twenty years older than I am, and it really freaked me out 'cause I didn't understand that a lot of people coming to Harlem Hospital there wasn't a lot of out-of-state students, okay.  I'll never forget Missy.  Her name was Jamise (ph.) Jones.  I called her Missy 'cause she was real short.  We were the only two out-of-state.  She was from New Jersey.  I was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] outside of, you know, right outside of Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], so I just told everybody Philly 'cause nobody heard of Bryn Mawr.  Philly sounded really cool and at that point I wanted to be real cool when I saw the other students.  The students were in their 30s, early 30s, late 30s, early 40s, which was amazing to me.  Some of the students had been prostitutes, had changed their life, you know, and now in the nursing school.  Some of the students were parents, you know, and had this opportunity to come to Harlem Hospital.  So, you had a very diverse group.  You even had some white students in the school.  I guess there was like two or three maybe in each class.  So, it was, it was just really overwhelming, you know, when I got upstairs and stuff and then people really did not accept me because here I am coming with all this stuff, you know, and they're just coming with just what they have, having new lives, change of lives, doing all these different things, so, but I'm the only one on the floor that has the TV, you know, the colored TV, you know, all the curtains and the carpet to match, you know, so they're like, you know, who do you think you are, you know, where are you coming from.  So, it was a culture shock for me.  I thought I was black and all that and knew what I was about, that kind of stuff, and understood the black experience, but I had never seen anything like this in my life.  And as I went to nursing school for the three years I learned a lot and realized that I didn't understand the black experience and what was really going on, and these people really taught me to understand the real deal with this whole nursing school experience and the friendships that I made and the different types of socialization, those type of things, which we never experienced in Bryn Mawr, and so it was real different for us.  I remember the first day, the first night, the first day that we were there that evening Missy and I who became my best friend there quickly decided to go to Lenox Avenue.  Well, we weren't supposed to do that 'cause Lenox Avenue was real dangerous, but we wanted to show everybody or these older folks that we could handle the situation.  And when we went on Lenox Avenue, we never ran down the street so fast in our life back to the residence because we couldn't handle it, you know.  It was just amazing what we saw, prostitutes 'cause I had never seen that, you know, in Bryn Mawr, you know even in Philly when even if I saw I didn't know what I was looking at.  You know, then we saw things like the Schomburg [Center].  You know, that was a whole different thing.  And we went down to the Y where they accepted people.  Homeless people were living there, whatever, but they also had activities there.  And then you had huge churches that were there.  Then you saw people in the street preaching and talking about economic development or racism; those type of things.  Then you go to 125th street where you can buy anything you wanted.  So, there were so many different things that were going on that I really had to try to adapt to and to try to understand if I was gonna survive there.  But, I know as my parents drove off I bust out crying.  I do remember that.
Story_ID: 61329
Speaker 1: So, did you make friends there?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I would say like, probably after the first month when I started to really settle in and feel comfortable.  And basically people were like challenging me like, you know, who do you think you are?  You think you're rich, you talk white.  And I would what does that mean, you know that I talk white, you know 'cause I don't use your slang.  You know, whatever you think your smart and then basically this girl and I had a fight and then after that it was all right.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the fight about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I knew you were going there with the fight.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.  It was basically she had went in my room and that was my area, you know, that's my personal area and I'm funny about my space, my personal space.  And she went in my room and she stole some money, and I confronted her about, you know, and she's like I didn't take your money, you know that kind of stuff and one thing led to the other.  She pushed me, I shoved her back, you know, that kind of stuff.  But, then I realized when people saw that I would stand up for myself then they didn't bother me anymore.  So, I really think it was a test, you know, to see what I would do 'cause it was like only a dollar.  It wasn't like it was something real big, but I think because I wasn't saying a lot to people in the beginning, you know, I was just maybe with Missy or whatever we were, you know, hooked up and in each other's room watching TV.  It was a way to bring me out and people didn't know how to do that.  You know, I would have--it would have been wonderful if people would have said you know come in our room and watch TV.  They didn't do that, but soon as we had the little fight, then it was a whole different thing.  I was accepted, oh come in my room girlfriend, you know, those type of things.  Let's talk, you know, let's help you with your homework or whatever, we'll walk you to Lenox Avenue, we'll take you to 125th street, we'll take you, you know, to some of the places we're not supposed to be going.  There was the speakeasy, those kind of places, so it was interesting, you know, and then I felt accepted.  I think I had done what they wanted me to do that I could stand up for myself.
Story_ID: 61330
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, who was the director of nursing at Harlem Hospital and what was the program like and did you really think it was a--when you--did you like the program?
Speaker 2: I loved it, I loved it.  You would not learn anything better, you know, good anywhere better than Harlem Hospital for nursing.  You saw everything.  It was a teaching hospital.  Nowadays the students go to a four-year program.  They're not on the unit like we were in the unit.  We started on the unit at 6 o'clock in the morning.  We left sometimes at 10 o'clock at night.  Unit, I mean, the actual unit, different units of the hospital, whether it was pediatrics, Med-Surg, intensive care, the operating room.  We went to every area, the emergency room, and we were there all day.  We were there four days a week and so there was a lot of work.  You had an attitude about it, but you learned.  Okay, you actually learned and understood what the whole biology is about, you know, the anatomy and physiology of your body 'cause we had classes.  And not even that, we went downtown to Manhattan Community Colleges [New York City, New York] for our science sources.  So, they integrated a lot of things.  We were in Harlem, you know, in an urban area during the day and then we went downtown to Manhattan Community College, you know, later on in the evening and took our afternoon or late evening courses.  So, we--it was really integrated, but it was real excited 'cause you met a lot of people from all over the world 'cause people came back then from all over the world to come to Harlem.  You had tremendous different cases.  After one year, if you did what you were supposed to, you passed everything, you were able to get your license for your practical nurse, so that meant you could work and make $36 an hour.  I'll never forget it.  And you know still get credit for that, you know, so that was something exciting for us.
Speaker 1: You made $36 an hour.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  That's back in the day in the '70s [1970s] again when they needed nurses.  Just like they're going through that right now where they need nurses and then before they had an abundance in nurses and it wasn't a big deal.  Well, back then in the '70s [1970s] they really needed nurses, so that's why we were able to go and take our license, you know, our test for our license for practical nursing.  And we made some really good money.  My shift was the 4 to 12 shift in the emergency room.  My favorite place was the emergency room.  It's faced-paced because I'm energetic and hyper.  People come in and out.  You don't real attached to them like you would in intensive care on a, on a regular unit like Med-Surg, so that was a really good place for me.  But, I also saw a lot of people die, and I saw a lot of people come in that was DOA, dead on arrival, so that was, that was a little upsetting, but it was able--it helped me to really endure those type of things and be able to work with the families afterwards.  So, you were like a nurse and a social worker or a parent if they had the kids in there waiting, you know, those type of things.  I was able to ride in the ambulance and do ambulance calls, and I loved that, the excitement in that going down Lenox Avenue, running upstairs to roofs, to, to, to revive people that had OD'd, those type of things.  Those were things and opportunities I know that I wouldn't got to in the nursing school here at Bryn Mawr Hospital for, for example or a university.  They were really challenging experiences, but they were really educational.  So, I think it was an excellent, excellent school.  When they--we were the next to the last class before it closed because they couldn't afford it, and back then nursing schools were starting to close, and people were going into the four-year programs.  But, I would tell anybody the three-year programs, the diplomas programs were the best because you were on the unit for the most part.  You weren't in the classroom all the time.  You actually dealt with human beings, not an orange, not a mannequin.  You actually dealt with people, on the unit people.  And it was really death, you know, death or dying situation.  You know life or death situation I mean where you know you could make or break a situation, and you better know what you were doing.  So, the instructors were absolutely wonderful.  They really cared about us.  We had diversity with our instructors, black, white, Asian, the whole thing, Hispanic, which was exciting for us; and it taught me a lot.  Where I, I will never forget a lot of the medical things because we were always doing it.  They would let us read x-rays.  I put in stitches.  We did a lot of things because we were short-staffed.  I was the triage nurse, you know.  It was just a very good experience.  Norma Benoit (ph.) was the director of the nursing school.  She did a really good job, but it was a real good school too and good students.  They made us, you know, really want to learn and really want to be there.
Story_ID: 61331
Speaker 1: Was there a high level of discipline there--
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: --in terms of what you looked like, how you dressed, and how you conducted yourself?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Your uniforms had to be starch.  You had this little cap on that was so difficult to iron and fold.  I still don't know how to do it right.  But they were wonderful caps.  You like the flying nun, but it was a nice little cap.  And you had like a white uniform with an apron, so you had to so all those things.  You had to--you know it was a lot of discipline.  You learned to discipline, you learned to be on time, you learned to respect yourself and to respect others.  You wanted to look good because you wanted that patient to feel better, and when you looked good, that made them feel real good too.  When you were pleasant, you know, so you couldn't have a bad day going in there.  If you had a bad day you need to cool it out right away before you got on that floor at 6 o'clock in the morning.  But, definitely you learned a lot of discipline and who you are and what you're about, and it really made you strong because there were some things that I wish I had never ever seen.  I'll never forget one night when one of our, one of my college, one of my student's husband came in who was in the black mafia in Harlem and had thirty-six gunshot wounds, and we were able to save him.  He ended up with a colostomy, but we were still able to save him.  So, those were the things that make you feel real good 'cause you were part of that team and that team process, but you know it's something that you don't want to see a friend's husband come into the ER, but that's what some of the students were dealing with.  Their husbands were drug dealers or their husbands, you know, were out there in the world doing some things, and they were trying to make it better.
Story_ID: 61332
Speaker 1: Do, do, do, any particular teachers come to mind that were, you know, especially helpful to you that you learned a lot from?
Speaker 2: I think it would be Ms. Renee Johnson who taught psych, and now I'm a psychiatric nurse.  And what happened was I'll never forget it, I flunked.  In nursing school a 70 was a D, and I got a 70, which means I flunked psych.  And it was my favorite, and I'll never forget I went to her, I cried, I begged 'cause I thought I could, you know, get over you know and get those points that I needed so that I could actually, you know, get out of her class.  And she said no.  She said I don't care if it was one point, two points, you know whatever, you're not--I think I had a 69 or something--you're not getting out of it, you're gonna do it again.  You gotta take psych for six more months, and you know what I respected her for that and I learned a lot and that was like the highest score I got on my State Boards 'cause I really focused and I stopped playing around 'cause I remember that was the semester that I was in my third semester you couldn't tell me anything, I'm a junior, I'm hip, you know, I'm almost a senior and she actually flunked me.  I was devastated.  I must have cried for three whole days, you know, but I ended up repeating it and being in another class.  I was a little upset, you know, the whole thing you gotta make new friends, you know, you know, and start from scratch.  But, the good thing at Harlem all the classes were always mingled anyway, you know, and you got to mix and match and people knew each other.  So, it wasn't that bad, but it was the point that I did really feel bad because I knew I could have done better, and she was basically saying this is something you could have done better and, and you are.  So, when I did finish up the next semester I had an A in it, you know, and like I said then I ended up becoming a psychiatric nurse; that's my specialty.
Story_ID: 61333
Speaker 1: Did--tell me about maybe some of the cultural aspects of Har, Harlem [New York]?  While you were there did you, did you experience things you never really experienced before another.  I mean, on, on the positive side?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely there's a lot of positive things.  Like I was saying in Schomburg [Center], you know, we were exposed to that, that art, that history, to understand about Harlem, the good things in Harlem, the spiritual piece.  So, it was a wonderful cultural piece, you know, as far as the arts.  It was fabulous as far as plays.  Those type of things.  People were really talented.  People gave of their selves.  Looking at--
Speaker 1: What, what theaters did you attend--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: You know, they had the Theater of Harlem, you know, right there in Harlem.  Then we went to the Apollo, I mean, come on you can't beat the Apollo.  It was like so cool.  You know to actually say I'm in the Apollo, you know, I'm sitting here looking at a show, I'm booing people.  You know, I'm saying, yeah you doing good.  I mean we wouldn't have that in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania] where I lived, you know, and there were folks that looked like me on the stage who were doing real well, you know who were famous, Smokey Robinson, my favorite.  I still have a crush on him today.  You know The Temptations, The Four Tops.  So, these are people that would be coming through that I could actually see that I was excited about it.  Yes, they probably did that in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but Philadelphia didn't have the Apollo.  So, that was something positive.  All the, all the, the art work, like I said, at the Schomburg, but even better yet 125th street was the most exciting place in my life.  You know that you can go shopping, that you could have fun, that you could eat.  Sylvia's [Restaurant] was amazing on Lenox Avenue, the restaurant Silvia's, wonderful.  She took us in as her kids.  We would get free meals because we were nursing students, and she felt we were giving back to the community.  That's something exciting, that's something positive.  And now Syl, Sylvia has all these franchises, you know, all over the place.  Now you go to Harlem you see buses coming into Sylvia's, and she remembers me and, and that makes me feel real good when she's there, you know, if she's there we always, I always ask for her.  And I've taken my family up, my sisters, and, and my daughter [Cherie Amoore] and my husband [Joseph Amoore] so they could actually see and understand Harlem because they were hearing so many negatives.  So, every December it's like an actual family trip for us to go shopping in Harlem to give back to the community as far as economic development and then to go and, and just see the whole area and go to the Apollo.  So, those are some of the positive things that co-- have come out for me.
Story_ID: 61334
Speaker 1: Now what did you do after nursing school, I mean, did you, did, did you know where you wanted to work and, you know, where--
Speaker 2: No, not really, but then I had an offer in the South Bronx [New York].  So, I went from Harlem to the South Bronx.  If you know anything about the South Bronx--
Speaker 1: The Bronx was that it's very nadir then and it was a ghost town.  A lot of buildings--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --were run down and weren't developed.  It was a, it was a desert almost right?
Speaker 2: Right, and everybody called me crazy, even the students, but I wanted to go to South Bronx for some reason, just for the reasons that you said.  It was like a desert, nobody was there, nobody was paying attention to it, but I felt the couple of times I had been there, there was a clinic there and the clinic was under Montefiore Hospital, and it was a comprehensive health care clinic and I felt that I could help these people.  So, I decided to go from the ER to a comprehensive health care nurse which talked about the whole body and talked about preventative medicine and I thought if I did that again that was giving back to the community, but in a different way.  They wouldn't actually always come in to me, we would go outside and visit them.  So, I'm in a community, which is you just described which is like a desert, very dangerous, a lot of gangs, and I would have to go different homes and visit the people that had children that could not get out, if they couldn't get to the clinic.  I did the immunizations, those type of things, again preventative medicine.  I guess about 85 percent were Hispanic, so I had to learn how to speak Spanish fluently, which was a challenge and I'm glad I did because now I can say I have another, you know, language under my belt.  That was exciting for me.  That was positive and the culture was different there too.  Learned a lot about the Hispanic culture, you know, where they were coming from and where they were at, a lot of times why they were angry with blacks, you know, that kind of stuff.  Watched confrontations between blacks and Hispanics even while working 'cause we had a lot of Hispanics working in the clinic and tried to help mediate that and bring those folks together to understand that we were there to help, to work with people to make them better that were either sick or didn't want to become sick.  So, we also--the, the gangs would protect me as I went to these buildings that folks were in that, you know, were horrible buildings, horrible places to live.  They would be two and three families, maybe living together, maybe two and three beds in the house and five or six people sleeping in a bed or sleeping in shifts.  That was what people did in Harlem and in the South Bronx because it was too hot, especially in the summer.  So, I saw things that I never thought I would see.  Saw people live like I never thought I would see people live, eat dog food, things like that just to survive because they didn't have enough money.  But, I also felt that I was giving back and doing some good things for them.  We would give 'em free medication, free food, you now, free information and insight on diseases, but not only that we would visit their homes, so they would welcome us into their home because everybody wouldn't come out to their home, you know, and it was something that they were proud of in their homes.  And they would make their, the inside of their homes the best they possibly could.  They were clean, they were neat, and that was opposite from what we were being told.  And if they weren't, we would help 'em get it to that point or we would help 'em move.
Story_ID: 61335
Speaker 1: It sounds like--so how long did you stay there [South Bronx]?
Speaker 2: I stayed there for a year and a half, almost two years, then came back and was offered a job at Children's Hospital, child guidance, their psych unit and ran their inpatient unit for about five or six years and did that and again it was working with adolescents.  Adolescents that instead of going into the judicial system, came into the health care system, psychiatric arena, and worked with them.  And it was mostly black males, in particular, who got over in the system and didn't have to go to jail and came to us because they said they were crazy and worked with them, you know, on their issues to try to help them mainstream back into the community.  But, also with Children's we developed a school within the inpatient unit.  So, during the day they would go to school, in the evening they would stay on the inpatient unit.  So, it gave 'em at least the, the educational piece so they wouldn't be losing it.  So, that was real important for us to make sure that that happened especially for these black males in particular.  And the kids range, which said, from ages 6 to 18.  I'm sorry to 21 and so we worked with that population for about five years and then we moved on to what we called Wordsworth Academy which again was a unit for, a school, an educational system, but residential for kids that were disadvantaged.  They would call 'em, African American, again in particular males, and females, but there was always more males.  They really came in from the inner city where the schools couldn't handle them and they would live with us and we would work with them because they had a lot of behavioral health issues.  So did that and then left there after I guess five years and went to work for a place called Growth Horizons.  And Growth Horizons needed someone to run their mental health department.  They had no one and we had group homes.  They had about twenty group homes and only one was a mental health group home and nobody knew the difference because they ran mental retardation programs, which mental retardation as they called it then was much different than mental health, which they call mental health now behavioral health.  And so what I did was oh this is easy I can get my PhD, work there, I'm only responsible for nine clients and about ten staff; I can do this.  And as the years went on, probably like the second year, they asked me to be a partner in the company and so I became a partner, owned some of that company, so I was really proud of that.  I was--I always told 'em the minority shareholder literally and figuratively and so did that and did it for fifteen years, ran that program with group homes and we went from that one group home to twenty mental health homes and 200 group homes totally in three different states.  And then I got tired of community beating us up, because we would actually have people with mental health and mental retardation living in the community and people would not want those things to happen next door to them.  And so after you get finished doing those things and building those things after a while it's like burnt out or time to move on, so that's when I came up with Amoore Health Systems and said I would just do managed health care consulting, something simple again I thought I would do and just had me, myself, and I as a consultant and then for whatever reason the state [Pennsylvania] started calling me about different businesses and different contracts, would we be interested.  And so we went from a company that probably had about $10,000, you know, the first year to now our like seventh year with three different companies, and our budget is probably about 10 million dollars.
Speaker 1: In three years?
Speaker 2: In six years.
Speaker 1: Si, six years.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 61336
Speaker 1: So, you start off--you started a company [Amoore Health Systems, Inc.] just to, with yourself as your only employee?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, absolutely.  I just was gonna do managed health care, go and consult, teach people how to set up managed health care 'cause that was like the big buzz word, you know, six or seven years ago. How to do it, we can help you with your billing or I can come in and train your group on diversity, you know, or I could, you know, train your group on universal precautions, you know, all these little things that different group homes in particular wanted or different agencies.  So, that's where we were and then we were called, like I said, by the state [Pennsylvania] about the ex-offenders program because they knew of my background.  We were called from labor and industry about working with people with disabilities and then just things started moving, so we went with one staff and now we're up to 100 staff and we have about eight or nine different offices and we're also in South Africa.  We'll be doing this in South Africa.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry now when did you come back to Pennsylvania--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: In--when I was in Cha- (unclear) Guidance.  That was probably '74 [1974], '75 [1975], probably like in the mid, late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but you didn't start the business until about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nineteen-ninety--you know we start- yeah, the six or seven years.  We started about--Amoore Health Systems was a shell for about a year.  Late Decem- November 1996 we actually had our first, you know, client.  You know, it was just still me, myself, and I. And so in '96 [1996] we had Amoore Health Systems.  In '97 [1997], we started 521 Management Group, which is our PR government relations firm which in Pennsylvania we're the only certified African American lobbyist in the state, which we're really proud about.  That means we're registered, you know, we have other lobbyists those type of things.  We have offices in Washington, D.C. and in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  We lobby internationally and nationally and also local and state.  And then in 1998, we started REDI, Ramsey Educational Developmental Institute, which is our not-for-profit for children services and adult services where we train welfare-to-work recipients, dislocated workers, but we also have a children's program where we go in the home and actually do home-based programming. And it's something I came up with because a lot of folks that have children that are sick can't get out the house also.  So, we actually bring in PTs [physical therapists] and OTs [occupational therapists], speech therapists and we actually do the work in the home for them, which was a pilot program that the county asked us to come up with something for kids with early intervention from birth to three.  And so we came up with this innovative really good program and they said you can only have about 50 kids and we have about 175 children in that program now from birth to three and a waiting list.  It's an amazing program.  A lot of kids that have autism, behavioral health problems and you kind of sit there and say how can kids from birth to three have all these issues, but they do.
Story_ID: 70026
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the South African branch [of Amoore Group, Inc.] and what's going on there?  I mean, this is all real exciting.  Y'all gained momentum so fast.
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: Yeah and you know--yeah--well, well first of all how did you gain the momentum so fast?  How did you do it?
Speaker 2: I think that one thing because I am involved in politics and that helps us build relationships and I have to real honest with you 'cause I think politics is in everything and I tell people that all the time, especially in business when you're trying to grow and build the business and so you have to understand the political arena especially if you want government contracts.  And that's what we went after first because I think those were long, you know, they stay with you if you play it right.  We can have a government contract for five years.  Well that's really good for a start-up business, and that's what we went after and that's what we were able to get.  You know, we were really blessed to do that, but we also tried to learn and understand the whole political arena and by doing that like I said earlier my mother [Juanita Ramsey] was in politics for a long time, and I did not understand it and then when I thought back at what she did and talked to her 'cause I trust her judgment she has a lot of credibility with me, it was important to meet the politicians in your area, do what you need to do with talking to them and, and see where they're at.  But, also where they can help you to make it a win, win situation because we have to remember that we elect them, they don't elect us, and so that's what you use and they always need us.  It's not all about the money or raising money for them, but it's about them understanding too their constituents and who comes out to vote for them.  So, people know me as a very grassroots person.  Yes, I'm a Republican, yes I've been a Republican for a long time, yes that's how people see me as Renee Amoore the Republican, but I am Renee Amoore the business person, Renee Amoore a woman, you know, African American woman.  They tend to forget that sometime.  But, we did grow fast, but we are very clear on our strategic plan.  We're very focused because it does get dangerous in a business and you can lose business if you go too fast.  So, like I said we started with Amoore and we built that company and we made sure we had about 20 or 25 people in there and then we had 521 Management Group, our government relations PR marketing.  We have like 15 or 20 staff there.  And then we built our training center [Ramsey Educational Development Institute (REDI)] and we made sure that we built that and made it strong so that all three companies are strong.  So, every year or two years we really just worked on that one particular company to grow them and to expand them, but to keep the main focus.  And if you see our logo it says tag: The Amoore Group.  There's a purple circle and as you know purple is my favorite color.  There's a full circle and all our programs come together.  So, there's consistency there in everything that we do and every contract we get it helps each company and so that's what we focus on, that our programs are--our companies are a consortium and they work together and it's a team process and that's why we've been successful.  So, that if somebody wants health care, we got Amoore Health Systems.  If somebody wants training, we got REDI.  If somebody wants PR marketing, we have 521 Management Group.  So, when we go in looking at a contract, if it has all those three things all three of our companies do it, we don't have to outsource with somebody else.  And so that, those things have been planned strategically to do that and to work together, and it is fast.  In the last year, I think we've grown 50 percent because of being in South Africa also.
Story_ID: 70027
Speaker 1: South Africa is exciting for us.  I was just there a week and a half ago.  I love South Africa.  It is a very, very wonderful country.  The ANC [African National Congress] has done a great job in the last seven years since 1994 I think it was when Nelson Mandela had his inauguration and stuff.  It is a very challenging com--country.  People are really working hard to make things happen.  The blacks have come a very long way, which I'm proud to say.  The colors have and I think the Africans have realized that they have to work together to make this happen.  I was invited to parliament, which was exciting for me to see how their government works and what happens.  They're still a little, you know, like the Republican/Democrats.  There's still the ANC against this group, you know, against that group, because they're really trying to get their selves situated.  Unfortunately, because they, you know, the leadership that Mandela picked first have mostly have gone on because they realize that they can make some money too, so they went into business.  So you have a lot of grassroot folks coming up and so you have to continue to have people mentor them so they understand government and what they need to do to stay in power to make things happen for their people.  We're there one to do some lobbying thing, government relations things, and to teach them and we're excited about that.  We're there also basically because of health care because no matter what I'll always be a nurse and I'm concerned about women's health care in particular.  Cervical cancer is the highest killer of white women in South Africa.  People don't know that here because all we hear about is AIDS, the AIDS epidemic.  Breast cancer is the first killer of black women in South Africa.  So, we're there to actually help train people to understand that you don't come in, in the second and third stage of breast cancer.  You have to come and you have to do preventative testing and understanding preventative meaning mammograms.  So, we've gotten with another company and have made mammograms portable so that people can actually take it out to the different villages and do the testing.  Or we've also trained people to have people go out into the villages and counties and towns and let people know what it is to come into a clinic, and we've also gotten them transportation to be able to do that, to bring those people into the clinics.  And we work with a lot of surgeons there, breast cancer doctors in particular, women who are very concerned about the South Africa women, both blacks and whites and the coloreds because they do need treatment and women are really dying very quickly in South Africa.  Yes there is AIDS, but there is also other diseases too that we need to focus on, so our company really deals with education, information, and insight.  We're also in the process of working with the South African government to bring over equipment that we tend to throw away here in the States that they could use and to get sponsors to get that equipment from here to there.  Equipments to--again, mammogram machines or x-ray machines, different equipments that they need to, to go in and look and see where cancer is with folks so--
Speaker 2: The freight is very expensive--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's the problem, you're absolutely right, that is the problem.  And so we found some companies that will do that free sometime.  With the President [George W. Bush] going in 2003 it's going to be very helpful.  He's gonna give 500 million just for health care for South Africa, so that's exciting because that's making history.  We're gonna be able to go over with the president and do that, so we're real excited about that.  I'm excited because I'm somebody coming from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, I'm able to go to South Africa with the President of the United States.  That's something I never thought would happen, so that's very exciting for me, but it shows people that you can do anything, anything.  You know you could dream and have visions and they can come true if you work hard, only if you work hard at it.  And you can make history doing those things.  We grew quick because we, we came in the radar, on the radar screen when we were asked to be the assistant secretary to the Republican National Convention and it was here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And because of that, people knew me and, and seen me as I'm walking down the street with my daughter, oh that's the black Republican.  Again, not Renee, that's the black Republican.  But, the bottom line is I teach people that we need to have a seat at the table.  I don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat, but having a seat at the table helps to change policy.  You know, you can be appointed to boards, that's what helps me look at health care issues.  That means I can say to one of the president's staff or somebody in the White House these are the issues that you really need to look at in my community.  And so that's why it is important for me to have a seat at the table to represent all of us, and if we're not on both sides of the aisle that won't happen.
Story_ID: 70028
Speaker 1: Now, now I just wanted to back track a little bit and ask you how you got involved.  I know your mother [Juanita Ramsey] was involved with Republican parties as a committee woman and, and when you were younger--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how did you get involved in Republican politics when you--were, were you involved in Harlem [New York] in, in politics at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, and worked and did some marching with [Reverend] Al Sharpton [HM], but not--I was just doing it because of the thrill and the excitement and our residence was falling apart.  Like I told you earlier, it was horrible that I've laid the whole thing.  But what happened was for me when I came back, got married, my husband [Joseph Amoore] is from Jamaica what happened was we moved to King of Prussia [Pennsylvania] we were all excited, just brought a house, had a child, Cherie Amoore and what happened was Cherie was on the school bus--your laughing because everybody talks--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --about "My Cherie Amour", you're absolutely right (laughter).  Everybody does that.  But what happened was Cherie was on the school bus and a little white boy punched her in the eye.  She went home to her dad and told him.  Well he's from Jamaica he's saying they deal more with the class whole thing, they don't get into the racial thing as much and he was like all upset and I couldn't even understand what he was saying, and he was just appalled and stuff and I called my mother 'cause those are the things that happened to us when our bus driver would say all niggers go sit in the back, that kind of stuff.  And so since that kind of stuff happened to me, I was saying my mom could handle this one.  I called her and I said you really need to come up here and handle this.  Cherie was punched, I went to the school, they're not hearing me.  She said no you handle it.  That same night I saw on TV an ad for a school board director.  I said I could do this.  I got this qualification, I got that.  Went to the meeting the last day for interviews, got myself an interview, went in and they started asking me questions and stuff and as I sat there I said this is the most racist interview I've had in my life, and I told them that.  It was eight men, white men, and one white women, and they just were very demeaning and talked down to me and said what have you done in this community, you know, what can you do for us.  And then it was like five minutes.  So you know when you interview for five minutes it's not that great.  And the bottom line they said to me, well if you don't get appointed--and that's before I knew that everything was already worked out beforehand they had gotten somebody--if you don't get this position, will you run.  And I said absolutely and I would make sure that all of you would be voted out.  And so I left the room in tears.  They didn't see it of course and went off and said I'm running for school board.  There had never been an African American in this area in Upper Merion [Township] on the school board.  I made little fuchsia signs that said Amoore on board, those type of things, and I was like rah, rah.  Nobody saw who I was.  Nobody knew I was African American.  I had my own radio show at that point with Secretary Butler, so I was able to promote some things on the radio.  And what happened was when we had our first debate people already liked me because they liked what I was talking about and it was really just basically pushing out the other people who they didn't like.  And the bottom line is that I was elected.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen-ninety [1990].
Story_ID: 70029
Speaker 1: I was elected to the school board.  So all of these things are happening at once. New, you know, looking at, you know, slowing down, you know, at, at Growth Horizons, you know, where I was a part-owner and the chief operating officer and vice president, and then, you know, I have a child [Cherie Amoore], you know, a husband [Joseph Amoore], I'm in a new area 'cause we'd had just moved here, and now I'm running for school board.  As I ran for school board, a cross was burned on my lawn when they found out I was African American.  This is right in King of Prussia [Pennsylvania], threatening letters to my family, that whole thing, and people said I shouldn't run and I said I'm running because this is what happens.  They push people away and makes us scared.  If we don't make a statement, it's not gonna happen.  When I was elected, I ran on the Republican and Democratic side and won both sides of the ticket.  I won at large and at large is the whole area, meaning it encompasses everything in the Upper Merion [Township] area.
Speaker 2: Now, you can run on the Republican and Democratic side at the same time?
Speaker 1: Yes, in Pennsylvania you can when you run for school board.  The only, the only county which is interesting there are sixty-seven counties in Pennsylvania the only county that your appointed for the school board is Philadelphia.  Everywhere else you have to run.  So, I was elected to school board even with all the threats, those type of things, and they even threatened me when I ran, I mean when I won because they told me I had to take--there was a thing called at large or just the sectional area.  The sectional you have like maybe three little areas.  The at large is covering about six different areas.  It gives you a lot more power.  I said I want at large, and I did not tell them until the night of the swearing-in.  That means it gave me control on who to pick with the board.  As the board members were fighting on power about becoming the president, I ran my way in to be the vice chair.  So, I became the vice chair.  First African American to be on the school board in Upper Merion which is this King of Prussia area which we cover the mall and you know it's a huge area.  Conshohocken, Sweedlin (ph.), Swedesburg, and I became the vice president because everybody else was fighting and I just worked it.  So, the president had a nervous breakdown, people blamed me, and then I became the chair of the board.  And so it was very challenging for me.  It was a difficult time.
Speaker 2: Did you--I have to ask you did you have anything to do with the nervous breakdown--(unclear)--?
Speaker 1: I did not.  Everybody keeps telling me.  It was not my fault.  It was not my fault.  I mean, I think I might have helped or, you know, did not help, you know, the cause, but it really wasn't my fault.  But, I still see him today.  He still lives in the area, and he is functioning quite well.  But, anyway I ran that board and, and we did a good job and while I was there we, we put up a new building, a new school.  And so the second time I had to run I was really burnt out and I didn't put any effort in it, and I lost by seven votes.  But, again it was a way how to say no in a nice way, then everybody felt sorry for me 'cause I lost.  But, I did miss it.  It was a challenge, and I learned a lot politically.  So, that started it.
Story_ID: 70030
Speaker 1: While I was on the school board, the Republican Party came to me and said, "We have no blacks in this area state committee, will you run for state committee?"  I ran for state committee and won.  State committee as you know probably is that you're, you're on the state level now, so I'm going all of a sudden from local to state politics, which was a whole different thing and real challenging because when you're always the first black you have this stuff on your shoulder that you gotta carry everything and everybody's issues.  And you have to be so careful with that.  You know you have to learn how to balance and juggle those things.  I mean, when I was on the school board we actually had to get two lines because we would get so many complaints especially from people of color, you know, about how their kids were being treated and blah, blah, blah, and it kind of went all over the southeastern region that I was the first black on the school board, so other school boards were calling too.  So, I was going out and speaking to other school boards, and then I was also chairing the Vutek (ph.) board and also the IU, which is working with kids with disabilities in the school district.  So, it was really a lot, an awesome position and a lot of work, you know, and I think I was out probably six days a week between meetings and things like that, and our meetings would go to 1 and 2 in the morning you know, fighting about different issues.  But, I learned a lot and it really helped me to be strong so that when I was on the state level I became a committee person.  You were called a committee person and you represent your area.  Again, I represented this area Montgomery County.  When I went there, I was very upset 'cause when I looked up on the dais there was no African Americans or no one of color.  I said this is ridiculous.  This is why they call the Republican Party mean-spirited.  This is why they call the Republican Party white men, bald-headed white men, you know, rich people, that kind of stuff.  We have to have some more diversity.  For a year and a half I just fought about that, talked about that, and then they were like, "Well if you're that interested, you know, oh what do you want to run for?"  I said, "I'll be the deputy chair of the party," second-in-command.  I didn't want to go for the chair that looked a little, you know, and I still had to learn a lot.  I was appointed to deputy chair within two years of being in the Republican Party.  So, people know me now on the state level.  So, at this point I'm on the state level, which spun into the national level because again you don't have blacks in leadership in our party.  So, as you're building that you can see how your business can build too 'cause your developing relationships, you're meeting people, you're meeting business people.  That's why it's important to use those relationships in a positive way and, and that's why I think we've built, we've grown.  And I know I've taken you a long way to explain, but I think it's important for people to know we have to use those things in a positive way and you also cross the line, we cross the line.  It doesn't matter if you're R or D [Republican or Democrat]; it's about business.  You know, it's about a seat at the table, so we make a lot of policy decisions in this state and that's how people know me.  We make a lot of decisions now nationally because since the Republican [National] Convention.  You know, again I never thought that I would have an audience with the Bushes or Barbara Bush would introduce me, you know, at an event, those type of things, or make comments or meet Laura Bush or do those things and be able to go to a State Dinner.  I'm like oh my God, and you know I can't believe this is me.  Today, I spoke with a group of 150 women in Chester County.  There was a line for a half an hour for autographs or whatever.  I'm saying it's just Renee Amoore, what's the big deal.  But when you think about it, it's somebody that has crossed some racial barriers, somebody that has crossed party barriers, and then I started seeing what people are hearing and seeing from me.  So, whatever I can do to put that information and insight out and mentor to people.  That's what I'm going to continue to do.
Story_ID: 70031
Speaker 1: Now did you go to the last Republican National Convention?
Speaker 2: Um-hum it was here [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It was here and that's why I did the roll call of the state, which they never had had an African American, a woman in particular, to do the roll call.  So, I was the person there doing the roll call saying Mississippi, scared to death, I won't pronounce it right and spell everything right, saying how many votes for George [W.] Bush.  That was wonderful.  It was a wonderful experience.  Before I did that I went, visited all the states in this country to push the whole Republican Party message.  The national party actually sent me around to different states to speak, to different groups, and that was real exciting.  That was one year of doing that.  Again, being able to put that business piece with the political piece to meet folks all over the country, and it went, it went very, very well.  And so once I did that, it was when I got a call from Andy Card [Andrew Card] who is now the Chief of Staff of the president, Renee we want you to do this because you've been so supportive to us, I was like I couldn't believe, I could not believe it.  Not only did I do roll call one night, I did it like three nights and then my voice went and I was unable to do it, so I did it--I think I did it twice.  I did the first night and they heard my voice it was real scratchy, so I did the closing of the roll call and stuff.  So, it was just real wonderful.  You, you know just to hear people screaming, yelling, you're there.  You know, we were able to have a lot of interviews, you know, with different television folks, you know, and then to be on the stage with Chaka Khan.  That was my favorite part, not with the president, but Chaka Khan (laughter) was at our convention.  I did all the diversity piece for the Republican National Convention where everybody was talking about oh that's phony that diversity piece, which I'm sure you heard.  We did all that.
Speaker 1: The, the convention, the traditional, I mean the analysis of it that people generally have is that you saw more diversity at the convention on television that you would ever, than you would ever see in a real Republican Party--(unclear)--because it hasn't been traditionally not since World War II, I guess--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --where you would see a lot of black participation.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and that's the message that we wanted to put out that we're open.  We're one big tent.  We want anybody to come in.  And when people in Philadelphia ask us if they could be involved, we said absolutely and that's what happened.  We also gave a lot of vendors contracts, African Americans in particular, 'cause I felt that that needed to happen and it did happen and we feel real good about that and we'll continue--we see more black men coming over to the Republican Party because they believe in business, you know, and making money and we think that that's okay.  If we can help do in that arena, that's what we want to do.  I think that we have to stop being in the cycle and giving, giving, giving.  We have to teach people how they can do things on their own, you know, and support them and then help them do that and move out from the process.
Story_ID: 70032
Speaker 1: Now, now what is--what, what would you consider the key, the key, I guess, portion of the Republican platform or nationally, I guess, that would appeal to black pe--people?
Speaker 2: Absolutely the health care and econo--first economic development.  Because if you don't have that, you're not gonna have good health care, you're not gonna be able to take care of yourself, you know, those type of things.  So, health care is important, economic development.  Those are the key things.  That's what we hear people asking us about and education, absolutely education.  Those are the things you hear the president [George W. Bush] talking about.  Head Start, you know, you get kids while they're young.  You hear the president talking about health care, you know, how he's putting more money out there for health care.  And you hear him talking about the economic development.  You know small businesses are the biggest amount of businesses that people have, start-ups, you know, that keep this country going.  We gotta respect that, and people have to understand that, and that's one thing that he keeps putting out there.  And we need to open up our ears and listen to that so we can get involved in the mix.  I think it is important for us to have our own businesses so that we can survive, and we can help with economic development.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's certainly true we don't have a lot of large businesses.  There's a lot of room for us to have some start-up businesses.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, and there is money--we have to understand where we can get the money.  There is money out there that you can get, but again if we're not educated and understand that political process we're not gonna get it.  So, you know, we laugh and joke and talk about Renee is Republican and how do I get along with the Democrats, that's because I bring people to the table to get it done, because we're all one people.
Story_ID: 70033
Speaker 1: Okay, so you see yourself as, as black woman first in the community rather than as a Republican first?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely I see myself as a mom, you know, even though my 18-year-old is driving me crazy, you know, a wife, a mother, you know, a businesswoman.  I know my daughter [Cherie Amoore] and I were walking down the street on 52nd street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we went into a restaurant and sat down and I guess the person heard me order and they jumped up and said you're that black Republican because he heard my voice, and my daughter turned around and said she has a name, you know, her name is Renee Amoore, she is my mom.  You know, we, we'd like people to start doing that sometimes versus that's that black Republican.  It gets a little old after a while.
Speaker 1: Well you know there's--we've interviewed other Republicans around the country, one I know particular Republican we just interviewed him in June, you know, claimed that he was a Republican first before anything else and that's, I think that's--and people perceive, I guess, the highest profiled black Republican in the country, I guess, other than [General] Colin [L.] Powell [HM] would be Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and he is seen as someone who is definitely conservative party line first before he's anything else--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and to his, I mean, and you know people, most people don't appreciate that position at all (laughter).  You know he does'nt seem, you know--it's so, I mean--do you have any thoughts on those kind of, kinds of Republicans or those, those people that tend to follow that, that hard line?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is different and unique.  I think he has done a lot of good things, and people just don't know because they can't hear it because they see and hear other things that he says.  And I think it is important for him to really get people to understand who he really is and about.  It might not be important to him as it is for us or for me in particular, but I think he has some things that he can let our community know so they just don't always hear that hard line.  That, that's one thing and that's one thing that I've shared with him because I think that's important.  I think Condi Rice [Condoleeza Rice] is absolutely fabulous.  I think that people respect her for who she is.  She is brilliant, knows what she's doing, and I don't think she always follows that hard line.  Again, and if she does, it's the way it's presented and I think that some of our black Republicans that are hard lines that people may know like Clarence Thomas or whatever, it's all how we present, you know, and all how we carry our self and all how we give to the community or don't, and people don't see him giving to the community.  They see him following that hard line just so he can be a token or whatever people might want to call him because I'm sure you've heard those names that they call him.  But, I think there's more to him than that if he just would reach out a little bit more I think that would help.
Story_ID: 70034
Speaker 1: What, what would you--do you have maybe an example of something that maybe he [Clarence Thomas] has done.  I, I don't what to make this just about him, but you mentioned that he's done some things that pe--people don't know about.  Are those in the context of being a Supreme Court Justice?
Speaker 2: I think there, there's a couple of things.  I think some of his decisions are right on time.  You know looking at them and stuff like that and I try to keep up with it 'cause I like history and, and things like that that go on.  I think one thing is like a personal thing or family thing where he's, you know, adopted or taken in one of his relative's child because they just couldn't do it.  Because we always as black folks tend to take care of each other and our families or we used to a lot, but that's something that people may not know, and this kid loves Clarence Thomas.  He's gotten to do things that he said that he would never do or would have a chance to do as far as getting a good educa--better education, you know, doing some social things, going away, travelling, you know, with the Justice, those type of things.  But, actually to adopt one of your relative's children I think that's, that's something special.  And that's something real important that people just don't know because it's not shared out there, and it might be 'cause it is personal and I understand that.  But, on the other hand, that's a different side of Clarence Thomas that people just don't know.  I think the other thing is that he tends to outreach, but maybe not in our community per se because he goes to a lot of schools and does a lot of speaking you know.  He mentors a lot of people you know, and again I think that that's the side that people don't see.
Speaker 1: Okay, people--I think he's mainly criticized for his performance as a Supreme Court Justice--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which has drawn critique of him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Oh yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and other civil rights--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I think too the whole Anita Hill thing did not help.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I think that people took issue to that, that he was really downing a black women, you know, those type of things and, and they just had a real hard time with that.  And I don't think people even knew Clarence Thomas as much after, until that really happened.
Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that was a negative issue.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that, that happened as he was being introduced to the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: He wasn't a well-known figure.
Speaker 2: No, he had been a lot of things that, you know, as far as judge, you know, he had been a judge.  He ran the EEOC, you know, those type of things.  So, he had a lot of other policies out there too that people just were not aware of.  But, I think that whole hearing thing brought things to a head.
Speaker 1: And I think some of his stances against affirmative action.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, absolutely.  And when people said that he benefitted from affirmative action and then he turned against affirmative action.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was that--do you see that as pretty much true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think that's true to a certain extent, but I also think that we need to really, you know, do some things on our own too, that we don't always have to beg and, and get, you know, people giving us stuff constantly, you know over and over again.  Like we have to let people know that we can get this, we're self-sufficient, self-reliant.  That's the message that we need to keep doing.  We did it during slavery, we did during reconstruction.  We need to keep doing those things.  We tend to get real dependent on things such as the welfare system and things like that and you know you watch it and, and, and you see generation after generation doing the same thing.  When are we gonna infiltrate that, you know, and, and make a difference and, and give some more information and insight so people don't have to live like that.  You know, so those are some of the things that I look at that we can do better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that I think Affirmative Action is okay to help get some people started whatever, but we gotta start moving on too and doing some things--
Story_ID: 69806
Speaker 1: What do you think about reparations?
Speaker 2: I think we need to get something.  Let me be real clear.  I know I haven't figured out what it is.  The mule has played out, you know, but I think even if it's around education or something that will help our people as a whole.  There has to be something to bring it to closure.  It's never gonna bring it to closure around the whole slavery issue until people feel that something has been gotten in return.  So, I, I don't care--I'm just looking at the whole psychological piece.  It's human nature, you know, when you don't bring closure to things people are still gonna be angry, there's gonna be hostility, and people are gonna use it sometimes as an excuse.  There has to be something that we have to work out.  And again, whether, like I said, whether it be some education or private schooling or a college, whatever, we gotta work out something.  I feel strongly about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you feel strongly about that?
Speaker 1: I actually do.  I know we're not interviewing me, but I actually do.  I think, I think we due something, you know.  It doesn't have to be cash.
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not, I'm not even--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --asking for cash.  Something to let people know, you know, if you can give the Indians something and Indian Americans, you know something and you're, you're giving the Asian people something because they were in concentration camps or whatever, please what kind of message does that, does that give our people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it will nev--we'll never get what we're due though.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no no.
Speaker 1: But one thing is for sure we'll only get what we're capable of compelling others to give us. I mean--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --in a sense that you're, you're only gonna get what you're able to actually demand.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I agree with that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's simple politics--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --as Frederick Douglass said.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 69807
Speaker 1: And so as a Republican in this--some--there were some just to argue the other side, I think, there were some that contended that Bill Clinton was our first black president on some level (laughter)--(unclear)--on that one.  But, there was also others that said there wasn't any difference between Bill Clinton and the Republican in terms of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm glad you realized that.  I'm glad you realized that, and I think that Bill Clinton did an extr--excellent PR marketing job.  I think he did very well with that, to pull people in, very touchy feely, and African Americans in particular like that touchy feely, being at the right place at the right time, conventions, the church, NAACP convention, the churches convention, the black national, you know, churches convention; those type of things.  If you look at his administration, he didn't have anybody on the level like the Colin Powells or Condi, Condoleezza Rice.  You know those things were important to look at.  If you looked at a lot of his staff or maybe support staff, secretary, clerks, and don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with that, but I think we as African Americans need to look at substance and what people really produce and what people really do for us.  You know, so I can't say that he was the first black president 'cause I'm not that touchy feely.
Story_ID: 69808
Speaker 1: How have you felt about the--how do you feel about the current mayor [Mayor John F. Street] of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and the administration?  How do you think--do you think that Philadelphia is headed in the right direction?
Speaker 2: I think they are.  I think I work well personally with the mayor.  I think he works well with the Republican administration.  One, he has to because the house is Republican, the Senate, and the governor.  And so it's important to do a partnership.  Again, it has to stop being this Republican versus Democrat, black versus white, rich versus poor.  We have to come together.  For example, the big problem with the school district was a problem in Philadelphia.  I don't know if you know with the state having to take over the school district.  We had to work together as a team, Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites to make that work, Hispanics, whatever, and, and it's getting better.  I'm not saying it's perfect, but people at least sat down and started talking.  That's why I keep saying it's important for us to have a seat at the table so people understand what our needs are and what our children's needs are.  But, I think, you now, they're doing, I think they'll do well.  I think they're working hard, and I think they do a good job.  I'm, I'm very pleased with the communication that we have with the administration.  I think it takes things a long way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about, just for the record, Mayor John Street of Philadelphia--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black, black mayor.  It's the second black mayor in the history of--(simultaneous)--Philadelphia.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I think nobody's perfect and there are always going to be some issues and somebody is always going to be unhappy, but they're doing what they need to do and are staying focused.
Story_ID: 69809
Speaker 1: So what are, what are your future plans?  Do you, do you see yourself running for office?  I know you've been involved in campaigns.  Oh, one thing we--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --didn't tou, touch upon was your involvement in Tom Ridge's campaign.  Can, can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  That was a really good exciting time for me.  It was while I was on the school board, so I was already getting beat up in one arena, I figured why not get beat up on another end.  And basically when Governor Ridge and now this, the Director of Homeland Security in Washington [D.C.] asked me to help run his campaign, I was one, honored; two didn't know what the heck I was going to do as far as to get minorities in particular to understand the message of Tom Ridge and the Republican Party.  But, basically it taught me a lot about it's not always the message, it's the messenger and that's where I learned that.  And that we were able to really bring a lot of people of color, not just African Americans, to the table with the governor, and I think because of that the governor was really able to win this whole election because we were a large piece of it, but it was really getting him out into our community, really getting him to understand our community, really getting him to tell our community what he was going to do as governor because I think our issues are the same as anybody else, education, help, economic development, and that our candidates-- and this is something that I told Tom Ridge, stop focusing on the blacks, you know, what do I need to do to pull blacks in.  What do I need to do to pull this group in?  All people have the main same issues, focus on that, stop separating and I think that's what really helped us.  So, we ran it from Erie [Pennsylvania] to all the way down the hill to Pennsylvania, and we, we had a good time and because of that we were able to get 18 percent of the black vote, which has never happened for a governor, a Republican governor.  So, it's something that we really made headway with, and we went all over the state.  We went to 67 counties, which was a nightmare.  We went from the rural end to the urban end, and it was great.  It was great.  It was a nightmare because that's a lot of travel, and we were really invested.  Remember I was running a company at the same time, a very young company, so here we are trying to get a governor elected, I had just been elected as deputy chair of the state party, so I'm dealing with all those new things, but we were able to integrate those things and make some things happen, develop relationships; develop a better business; and understand the political process.
Story_ID: 69810
Speaker 1: Now, Tom Ridge when he was appointed Director of Homeland Security and when, you know, some of the rhetoric around 9/11 began last fall, you know, many blacks and many what you would call liberal in the coun--country and those who, you know, campaigned for social justice on some level were, were concerned that the traditional target of, of searches and prosecutions in the United States are usually black people and, and Hispanics and to some extent--(unclear)--.  The Arab community was concerned too that they were all going to be--
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: --treated alike and some of these fears have not come, have not matured into what, you know, thankfully into what people, you know, really thought they would be.  Is this--was there something about Tom Ridge we need to know and--or--I mean how, how does he--is, is he different really from what the perception was in the beginning?
Speaker 2: I think that Tom Ridge is a very fair person.  Tom Ridge understands security and defense.  This was a veteran, vet, Vietnam War.  This is somebody who was in [U.S.] Congress for several years.  This is somebody that was a DA [district attorney] in his community.  Somebody always up on what was going on.  Somebody that understood racial profiling.  Somebody that understand that we don't want to have that as far as African Americans.  Somebody that you could go to no matter what you looked like, what color you are, and who you are and what you're about the say.  This is not fair or I like what you're doing.  This is somebody who has an open-door policy that is willing to talk to you and not just talk at you, but willing to work with you to make the best thing happen and make it a win-win situation.  So, I think what we're seeing is the regular Tom Ridge that I've known for a long time that wants to make things happen in a positive sense, wants to make this country safe for all of us, not just for certain individuals and is really working hard to do that.  It's a difficult job when you're trying to pull all these different departments together, there's no legislation, you don't have any money, you know, it's very difficult, but I think he has risen above all that and still keeps his group focused in saying this is what we need to do.  The bottom line is to make each individual safe.
Speaker 1: Do you think that by the creation of this department [Department of Homeland Security]--well the creation of this department has meant the change in terms the power of some other entities like the CIA and FBI and, you know, perhaps even some of the [U.S.] Army or Naval intelligence--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I just wonder if you have any thoughts on that, I mean, the change.  Do you see this change as good or?
Speaker 2: I think it's good.  I think we have to pull some of these departments together.  I think that change is difficult for anybody and everybody.  I think that we've had so many levels of, you know, different departments, and sometimes we have to look at that and take a serious look at it and make a difference and make a change and take a risk, you know, if we think it's gonna get better.  But, I know that's, that's upsetting for people because some people may lose jobs, you know, some people may be put in different positions, but I think that we can't keep everything the same way all the time, especially if we want to try to improve different things.  And why hire all new staff when you can take away from the different departments and, and make that staff even better in Homeland Security or put it under one umbrella instead of having 20 million different layers that people have to go through to get what they need or to get their needs met.  So, I think it's really good for us to look at that one department, you know, supervising and streamlining in that particular area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it would be better for all of us.
Story_ID: 69811
Speaker 1: Now, what, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community in Philadelphia and in, and in the other black communities here in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: I'm hoping that we can really achieve better economic development; that we can have our own companies; we can be more self-sufficient and self-reliant; that we can buy the homes where we want to be; that also our health care would get much better; that we do more preventative medicine; and that definitely education will be a priority for us and for people to help us work towards that goal and objective, those goals and objectives.  But, I really do think that economic development and education and health care are key issues that have to get better in Pennsylvania, not in just Pennsylvania, the country.  We have to.  If we don't have a health care, we can't take care of our self than that's an issue.  If we don't have jobs as far as economic development, that's an issue, and definitely if we don't have any education, you know, what are we going to do, you know?  And we're seeing what's happening where there's groups and there's different populations that don't have education that they need.  We see where people end up.  They either end up in jail, you know, on the streets as homeless, those type of things.  We have to stop that same cycle in any community, not just ours, so that we can make it better.  We need to have a better quality of life.  That's real important for me.
Story_ID: 69812
Speaker 1: Now are you satisfied to stay behind the scenes, you know, in the political arena or are you--do you think that one day you might emerge as, as a secretary or some, some agency or, or even run for office yourself?
Speaker 2: At first--(unclear)--say no, no, no, no, no, but I think as I watch people that, for example, that are in government that are secretaries, you know, or whatever, you know I look at their background too.  A lot of them have been business people.  I think more business people need to go into government to help government run a little bit better, because the government doesn't always understand business.  At this point, you know, I have been asked to run for lieutenant governor, for other positions, and I've turned them down because I'm happy at what I'm doing.  I like running a business.  I like making sure that we can help with the economic development piece in our particular region, give people jobs, help educate people, come up with creative innovative programs for children and youth and adults.  So, I like what I'm doing right now.  Unfortunately, I do think that I'm above the radar screen or you wouldn't be sitting here talking to me.  But, it's still a challenge and I have a lot more things to do and maybe in the future I'll run for something or, or be a secretary of, of health and human services like Tommy Thompson, something like that, but I'm happy what I'm doing right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I like to make money to be honest.
Story_ID: 69813
Speaker 1: Now have, has your, has your--what does your mother [Juanita Ramsey] feel about your success and stuff?  Does she--how does she--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: She's so proud.  She's super.  She feels real good about it.  She's been to the White House several times, so you really can't tell her anything.  She's been in the newspaper with pictures of her and the president, so she's like a happy little camper.  But, if it wasn't for her and, and my family and my dad [John Ramsey] in particular I wouldn't be where I am.  Because they are the ones that inspired me to, to teach me to do what I need to do to be a motivator and help other people to try to be a leader and to always give back.  'Cause I think if you give back, you always get back.  And that's pretty much been their motto and that's pretty much what we've done, but she is real proud and, and I'm proud that she's my mom.
Story_ID: 69814
Speaker 1: I know you are still young.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: Yes, you, you actually are and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you have a lot more, more to do--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --but if you look back at the body of what you've done so far, you know, what do you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My daughter [Cherie Amoore] who's eighteen who I'm hearing more and more and finally believing it that she's just like me.  That just started her first year in Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] majoring in physics and already running for student government president and she hasn't been there three weeks (laughter), so I think that's one.  But, I think also our business [Amoore Group, Inc.], how we run business, how we do things, how we're helping people in the health care arena in particular, not just in this country, but outside of the country and I think that's important.  It was really funny because somebody came up to me, an international lawyer, and, and somebody was interviewing me about something for the newspaper about our trip that we just went to South Africa, and they were like I think Renee can be the next Leon Sullivan, you know, and to me that was a compliment.  To me that was a real big compliment and, and be that in the health care arena, you know, so I, I think that's something that I'm looking at and that I hope that people will see that.
Story_ID: 69815
Speaker 1: And this last question, now is similar to legacy, it's a little bit different.  How would you like to be--and once again this is premature--how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  As a person that really believed in helping people with their quality of life, as a person that believed that we could do whatever we wanted to do, and as a person that, that was a health care professional that actually went out there and actually did what they needed to do in communities that people would not, other people would not go to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you for having me.  I appreciate it.
Story_ID: 69816
Speaker 1: Okay, what does it have on the back? (Laughter) They have everything on the back.
Speaker 2: Eight months old.
Speaker 1: I was eight months old at my parent--with my mom [Juanita Ramsey] holding me up.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That was Renee Amoore when I was--
Speaker 2: Do we happen to know where this might have been taken?
Speaker 1: Yes, at 721 Preston Avenue in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], at my house.
Speaker 2: Hold on--and describe this photograph.
Speaker 1: This is me and my dad, John Ramsey, and I was five months old.

Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is Renee Ramsey when she was two years old in her parents, grandparents' back yard in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: This is with my sister Janice Ramsey, and she was about two and I guess I was about maybe four, and we were in our parent's backyard with our one little swing in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Okay, next photograph.
Speaker 1: That's my mom, Juanita Ramsey, dressed up to go to one of her political meetings I remember, and myself and I'm probably about five or six years old in Bryn Mawr at our house.

Speaker 2: Right there in the middle, Renee Amoore.  I'm Renee Ramsey then.  See there I am right there.  Look at that dress.  Look at the do.
Speaker 1: This is Renee Ramsey in the third grade in 1962 in her little Brownie uniform, and you can see she doesn't have a Brownie hat 'cause they couldn't afford it, but we had the uniform.  On the second row to the left.  And that's Aleta Fitzgerald who was my best friend I kept talking about on the second row.
Speaker 2: Next photograph.
Speaker 1: This is Renee Ramsey at Coopertown High School taking her Brownie picture at the age of nine years old.
Speaker 2: That's around 1962?
Speaker 1: That was like yeah '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: This is Renee Ramsey in the sixth grade getting ready to go into the seventh grade.  I was so happy.  In Coopertown Elementary School class picture.
Speaker 1: This is--I'm pretty sure in the senior high, Haverford High School [Havertown, Pennsylvania] in the ninth grade.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Renee Ramsey 1971, senior.
Speaker 2: This is our nursing school candlelight service in Harlem Hospital auditorium in Harlem, New York, on Lenox Avenue.  That was in 19, it was 1972 'cause it's like our year, you know, candlelight service.
Speaker 1: This is Antioch University in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which I was very excited about, and that was in 1980, no 1979, Bachelor's of art at Antioch.  They called it then Antioch College.
Speaker 2: You wouldn't happen to know who was next to you?  I'm just asking.
Speaker 1: Paul, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yes, these are five of my sisters.  Renee Ramsey is in the middle on the second row looking ravishing (laughter).  And it's in my parent's backyard, and it's about ten years ago.  So what's that, 1992.
Speaker 2: Could you just name them from left to right starting from the back row?
Speaker 1: Oh sure, that's Christine
Speaker 2: On the top row or back bottom?
Speaker 1: Didn't he say down here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, bottom row first.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Christine on the bottom row to the left, then you have Dawn in the middle who's the baby, and then you have Carol who's the second oldest, and then you have Jackie who is the oldest, and then you have Renee Ramsey who is the middle child, and then you have Janice who's right after me.
Speaker 2: This is Renee Amoore at this particular time two years ago speaking to a group of women about business in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: This is at Growth Horizons in Roslyn, Pennsylvania.  This is our corporate office where I owned this particular company, and it was in 1990 where I was the vice president and chief operating officer.
Speaker 2: This is the Amoore family, Joe [Joseph] Amoore, Cherie Amoore, and Renee Amoore having fun at Juanita Ramsey's house, my mom and dad's house, and John Ramsey's house, just playing around having fun. You can see the photos in the back of her wall 'cause she always keeps photos all over the house.
Speaker 1: Approximately ten years ago?
Speaker 2: Ten years ago, approximately ten years ago.
Speaker 1: This is the Amoores being a little bit more sophisticated.  Joe on the left, Cherie Renee Amoore in the middle, and Renee Amoore on the right at the Four Seasons where I was being honored.
Speaker 2: Four Seasons in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: Yes in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: What were you being honored for?
Speaker 1: Fifty top business owners of the year.
Speaker 2: This is Renee Ramsey, I mean Renee Amoore and Joe Amoore, and Joe's a DJ and he was deejaying for The American Legion event, which I was the emcee.  So again, we're giving back to the community.  That's some of the things that we do.
