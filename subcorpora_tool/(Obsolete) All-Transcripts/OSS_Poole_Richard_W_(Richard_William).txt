Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Today is November 21, 2008. My name is Jerry Gill. I   m interviewing  Richard W. Poole in his residence. This is part of the O-STATE Stories  project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dick, you   ve  had a long and distinguished career at Oklahoma State University. First  can you go back and tell us a little bit about where you grew up, a little  bit about your family, if you don   t mind?  I sure will. But first Jerry, it   s great to have you visiting the old folks  down in the home and the retirement center here. I joke about that.  We   re down in Epworth Villa for Independent Living now, but it   s  really a great place. It   s good to have you here today.  I was born in Oklahoma City. I grew up here, went to Wilson Grade  School and Harding Junior High School and the old Classen High.  Threw papers while I was in school and then I was afraid that I couldn   t  go to college because I didn   t have any resources. My folks were still  recovering from the Great Depression which is characteristic of a lot of  people my age. So I went down to enlist in the army in 1946.  You went to high school at the old Classen High School. Anything stand  out in your mind about your years there at Old Classen?  Yeah, most of it I was working, throwing papers. I got two paper routes  so I could save up enough money. As long as I had to get up at 3 in the  morning, why not do two?  So then you joined the army in    46?  Yeah, but then I quit my paper route and the first time I took high school  seriously was my senior year. I was not a very good student in the first  part of high school. I was saving money to buy a car. I did finally get  7  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  one, a 1933 Chevrolet.  Hard to imagine   And then I went into the service. I   ve got to tell you this story though,  Jerry. I was afraid I   d flunk the physical because the only way I thought  I could go to college was on the GI Bill. I was so ignorant   now that   s  different than stupid   I was so ignorant I didn   t know you could work  your way through college. So I wanted that GI Bill badly. I did go into  the service in January 1946, right after the war was over.  Can you tell us a little bit about your career in the army?  Well yes, I went in as I said in January and I was sent to Camp  Robinson, Arkansas, went through the infantry basic training. They  called me in at the end of that and said,    We gave you some of the tests  there. You   re not very bright but you scored high enough that you could  qualify for Officer   s Candidate School.    I said,    What?    And they said  yup. Anyways I went before a board and I got picked to go to Officer   s  Candidate School. I think they were terribly short of officer   s at that  time, you know, it was the end of the war, they were going for the  bottom of the barrel. And of all the things I   d thought I   d go to basic  officer   s school, but they sent me to Fort Sill.  I didn   t know one end of a canon from the other, but I went to Fort Sill  and we started with a class of 66 people; 19 of us graduated. I got  commissioned as second lieutenant and the field artillery at the age of  18. Sometime I   ll tell you if you   re ever interested in a very interesting  story about my career in the army. Then I went to Fort Bragg, North  Carolina and served for a short period of time, then I went overseas and  served with the first Cavalry Division in Japan, 82nd Field Artillery  Battalion and I ended up there as the S2, the intelligence officer for our  battalion. Then I came back home and went back to school. That was my  army career, but I did stay in the reserve. I did finally retire from the  army reserve. I enjoyed my affiliation there.  And you retired as Lieutenant Colonel, is that right?  Yes.  Now go ahead and tell me your story. You said you had     Well when I was in basic training, I finished up and I got KP Duty one  day. While I was in there, I was doing a pretty good job I thought,  mopping and all. The Mess Sergeant came in; he was just a little  intoxicated, he had a date with him and he was showing off. He got all  8  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  over my back and he says,    You   re not doing the job, you start re-mopping  that floor     and so forth. He was pretty abusive but I just rolled  with it and did it. As soon as he left, his assistant there came up and said,     He   s just drunk, don   t worry about him at all, Dick. You   ve done a  great job, go home.     Well I didn   t think any more about it. Guess what? Sometime later I said  I went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The C.O. of that battery I was  assigned to was going on leave. He said,    You   re going to be the Battery  Commander. Now I want to take you to the mess hall.    We went down  to that mess hall, and guess who was the Mess Sergeant? The same man   The same man that had given me that trouble in Camp Robinson,  Arkansas. I used to tell this story to my students. You know what, I  never said a word to him about it. I didn   t come back and try to abuse  power or put anything on him. But I   ll tell you one thing, Jerry. I  watched that guy like a hawk. But when I came in    Oh, yes sir     He   d  salute me    Yes Sir Lieutenant, it   s good to have you here.    He didn   t  remember me. He couldn   t have remembered me, but I never abused my  power over that guy. But you talk about the odds of that happening. You  just can   t believe that. But anyway, that   s a story that   s phenomenal  from my standpoint.  Did he ever get a promotion while you were C.O.?  (Laughter) Well I was only there a month because I later joined the first  cavalry division. But on a promotion, I came back and they said,     You   re too young now to be an officer.    You see I   d gotten  commissioned at 18 and pretty soon they said you had to be 21 to be an  officer. But I learned a lot. I learned a lot.  Then when you finished your army career, can you tell me a little bit  about where you went from there?  Yeah, I hate to tell you this Jerry, but I went down to OU and I  commuted my first year to OU and then I moved down and stayed with a  dear friend. I finished up my degrees   I got two degrees in four years at  OU. I got a bachelor   s in business and a master   s degree. I don   t know  what happened but again, something happened. I was called up in an  assembly at the end of my undergraduate work and they said,    The  person who has the highest academic standing in the College of Business  that   s a male   at that time we had males and females   is a guy named  Richard Poole. I dropped my jaw. So I went up and got the award for the  highest academic standing. Later on I told that story and Raymond  Young would say,    Yeah he went to OU, but he had to come up to OSU  to get educated.     9  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Raymond would say that?  That   s right. He was the Y in TG Y, great supporter of OSU and a great  entrepreneur.  And a great human being.  Yes sir, first class.  So when you got your bachelor   s, then you went up and got your MBA  there then?  Yes. Got them in four years.  Wow that   s great.  Yup. Then I went to work for the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company.  I had worked in the Bureau of Business Research down there. I did a  project for them called the Key to the Industrial Potential of Oklahoma  which was talking about the potential of Oklahoma to accommodating  industry, and they offered me a job. I got, that year, the highest offer out  of the college. Guess what, it was about  350 a month  That sounds  awful. That was the top award at that time  Well I wanted to stay in  Oklahoma. I wanted to have experience in business, so I joined OG E.  So can you kind of share with me your career before you came to OSU?  Well then with OG E I worked there and I wanted experience there. I  knew some day I wanted to teach. But if I was going to teach, I wanted  experience. I had experience in the military, I wanted experience in  business. So after I was there for awhile, the Oklahoma City Chamber of  Commerce wanted me to come over and join them. I went over and  worked with Paul Strasbaugh and Stanley Draper. And I   m going to tell  you, Stanley Draper taught me more than I ever learned in my Ph.D.  studies about how you get things done. A great guy, and the same with  Paul Strasbaugh. In fact I   m going to have lunch with Paul in a few days  here. We   ve maintained a close relationship. We worked on industrial  development together.  While I was working there, the business leaders in Oklahoma City  created what they called the Frontiers of Science Foundation. That was  Mr. E.K. Gaylord, Dean McGee, and a guy by the name of Jim Webb  and so forth. They got him to be the President of the group and they  called up and they said they wanted a young buck to shuffle papers over  there. So I went over as Assistant to the President of the Frontiers of  Science Foundation. Got to know Mr. Webb, and he had served in the  10  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  industry before. He   d been Under Secretary of State. Senator Kerr  identified him as director of the Bureau of the Budget and they brought  him to Oklahoma to head this up. He became my mentor, and I owe so  much to Jim Webb for all that he did for me. I worked for him for a year  and then he said,    Do you want to get your Ph.D.?    I said,    I sure do, but  I   ve got three children.    He said,    I want you to look after my office  building in Washington, D.C. and you can go to George Washington  University.     So I took the family, we moved up there, we also got a bit of a grant  from John Kirkpatrick, Admiral Kirkpatrick who did the big center in  Oklahoma City, another great pioneer and builder. While I was up there,  I got an offer to come back to OSU. While I was there, by the way, I  took a course under the Head of Research for the Federal Reserve, and I  really enjoyed that and learned a lot. He offered me a job to go to work  for the Fed. But I didn   t do it, I came back to OSU. Came back and got a  job as a research assistant, had that support and then some financial help  from Jim Webb and John Kirkpatrick there. Worked at OSU and got my  doctorate then in economics at OSU, and I was the first person to receive  the doctorate in economics at OSU.  The person who received the Ph.D. with you was Dr. Duck-Woo Nam, is  that right?  He was the second graduate. And Bob Sandmeyer was the third  graduate. Duck-Woo Nam and I became really close friends. I   ll just say  it right here, he was a very bright guy. We spent a lot of time together in  the library. He   d come to our house periodically. He went back home,  translated Dick Leftwich   s book on price theory and did a book over  there. He later became Minister of Finance, and he is credited, it   s in the  Wall Street Journal, with the economic recovery and growth of South  Korea. And then after being in that position, he became Prime Minister  of Korea and did a great job. After he did that, he headed up their trade  association which is a fantastic facility. We   ve been his guests back in  Korea a number of times. It   s been a wonderful relationship and we   ve  had him back to the School of International Studies where he   s become a  Henry G. Bennett fellow and the rest. So all these things tied together as  the years passed.  Dick, you must take special pride in receiving the first Ph.D. offered by  the entire college of Business Administration and the Department of  Economics, correct?  Yes, in terms of economics, that   s right. Yes, and maybe we   ll talk about  this a little bit later but we did not offer a Ph.D. at that time in any other  field, just in economics in the College of Business.  11  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  That   s what I was thinking, so literally, you had the first Ph.D. offered  through the college in any study?  Yes.  There must be a lot of pride there. Again, what brings you to Oklahoma  State? What was the tie that brought you back? It sounds like you had an  offer in DC.  Well, I had several ties there. I   m glad you raised that. When I was in  the Frontiers of Science, the top business leaders wanted someone from  academic, with credentials, to come and kind of be the front guy there  with academics. I was the assistant to the President. They brought in a  guy by the name of Bob McVicker who was Vice-President up at OSU,  an outstanding person and extremely bright. I became very close to Bob  McVicker. He said,    You need to come to OSU.    We had a relationship,  and he was later dean of the Graduate College. He was executive Vice  President to Oliver Willham. So they made me an offer. Dean  Swearingen who was dean at that time and Russell Ball, head of the  department, and Lynn was I think ready to come back to Oklahoma  since I was spending so much time in the library with the three children.  So we moved back to Oklahoma and lived out in Vet Village and had a  great time out there. It looked like poverty row, but none of us knew it.  We were all in the same boat and we were all good people and had a  great time in Vet Village. 15B Midi, I remember that, my friend.  Well that takes us down another road   you   ve got to tell me your  experience. I want to hear your Vet Village story.  Well there was so many of them out there. There was a couple working  on their Ph.D.   s in mathematics. Lynn took care of our children and they  had four children and she took care of them, so we developed a real  relationship. I   ll tell you the one thing. This is not good. When we first  moved there, they used to pick the trash up in gunny sacks hanging from  the clothesline. I thought that was pretty abominable. Now we   ve come a  long ways in Stillwater. But when I first saw that I thought, what have I  come back to? Now, they   ve later got that fixed up. This is a terrible  story, but my wife was looking out there one day and a big rat was  coming up to it and the guy next door ran over and stomped on it. That   s  a terrible story, but they got rid of those after a while. Before they tore  those buildings down, we went over and took the mailbox off of 15B  Midi and I passed that on to my children. 15B Midi will live in infamy  with my children.  Now I understand in the winter time, there wasn   t a whole lot between  you and the North Pole.  12  Poole  Gill  Poole  Oh no, and I hate to tell you this. When I opened up the cabinet, I could  almost see the light in the next bathroom in the next accommodation.  We never did talk too loud because we   d hear everybody   s  conversations  But we had a lot of camaraderie and it was a wonderful  experience. We   ll never forget it.  Wonderful. We were talking about you getting your Ph.D. in economics.  But now you went from 1960 as an instructor to assistant professor,  associate professor then full professor and then Dean of the College of  Business Administration from 1960 to 1965. How do you explain this  meteoric rise? I mean this is phenomenal in five years time.  Jerry, I think a lot of things just fell into place. I   ve always said I   ve  been lucky to be in the right place at the right time. At that time of  course I had a little bit of maturity because I was older and I had  experience in the business sector and I had experience with the Chamber  of Commerce where I said I learned so much. I had a lot of contacts in  the state, but I wanted to go back into teaching. So I got my  instructorship and then when I got involved in that, shortly after I started  teaching   and my field was macroeconomics which I really enjoyed a  great deal. Jim Webb got appointed to head up the NASA program so I  started doing consulting for them. I ended up getting a very large grant  and I think a lot of things fell into place. I did get promoted rather  rapidly because of my experience from assistant to associate.  Then the deanship came open and I had a number of people approach me  and I think probably in some ways it was because I had worked so much  in Oklahoma, knew the Oklahoma setting, knew the business community  as well as the governmental community. That probably made my  credentials right for the time. I was the right man perhaps   I hate to put  it that way   for that position at that time. Not because of great intellect  or so forth but because my relationship and work with the community.  Just like the current president, Burns Hargis, is the right man for OSU  right now. He   s an outstanding guy. He knows the community, the  business community, the professional community, the governmental  community. There are times in any institution   s history where you have  to have a lot of outreach to make progress. So I think as I said it was  these relationships that led some people   Oliver Willham, Swearingen  and others   to think I was the guy to be out there.  By the way, I   d worked for Henry Bellmon when he came in, but not  because of politics or anything like that. I   m basically a democrat, but  Henry called me to head up the technical services program in the state  when they got legislation. I mean, I headed this up as a volunteer effort  where I had to involve all of the universities across the state of  Oklahoma. I guess I knew how, more or less, or at least better than  13  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  anyone else on board, how to deal with these various facets of our  Oklahoma economy. That   s about the only reason I can explain it.  Although I do think I was a good teacher. And sometime I   ll tell you a  story about what I consider my greatest compliment whenever you want  it.  Go ahead, tell the story.  Well taking this time period, I   d made this progress, I had research  projects going on, I had a large research grant, I had a lot of graduate  students working for me, I had undergraduates working for me, and I  had several professors involved in this. Larkin Warner was involved in  it. Bob Sandmeyer, Ansel Sharp and others. Well when I was being  asked to serve, I didn   t seek the deanship. I was being approached where  you serve the deanship because you have the connections that would be  effective at this time in the college   s growth and development. Well the  graduate students sent a representative to see me down in my little  research area there, it was on the first floor of Morrill Hall. It had been a  big classroom that we had converted, had desks all over the place for  this research project. They said,    Dr. Poole we know that they   re  promoting you to be Dean of the College of Business and we want you  to do what is best for you. But what we   d like you to know is that the  graduate students hope that you will stay as a fulltime professor and  work with the graduate students.    I   ve had some nice honors and some  nice recognitions, but that   s the highest compliment I could ever have  because of my love for teaching. So that was the little story about that.  Well speaking of that, can you give me a little bit of background on the  process for bringing you in as dean? You said you did not solicit that,  but how did that work? What was the process?  Well at the time, I don   t think we went through as much of the review  process as you tend to do nowadays. It certainly was not as structured as  it is today. And there are a lot of advantages to the structured process  because there can be abuses. What happened is that I think the president  of the university at the time (Oliver Willham), Dean Swearingen, and  Raymond D. Thomas thought that I would be a good candidate for the  position, as well as my department head and some of the faculties. They  said,    Apply for this job.    I didn   t want to apply for it.  So finally, when I said I was courted, I finally did and I have some of  those letters somewhere by the way, where Raymond Thomas had  written me, asked me to be sure to apply, and he wanted me to do it. I  did apply and then there was a review committee and a process that we  went through. And then that was submitted from the college to the  president and then the president took it to the board. I remember the  14  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  board calling me over before they would approve my appointment. I  mean, it was going to be acted on, I gathered, that day and they wanted  to hear from this new prospective dean. They went over a variety of  things and asked me a lot of questions and I   ll never forget one of the  members of the board said,    You know, not picking on anybody, but a  lot of times, economists are sometimes considered very conservative or  most of the time they   re very liberal, it seems to some of us. Where do  you stand on this?    My response was,    It depends on whom I am talking  to. To some people I   m a conservative. To some people I   m a liberal.  But here are my core beliefs on the market economy and how this  works.    They just chuckled on that pretty well and the board did approve  my appointment. That was the process, but it was far less structured than  it was today.  Who were some of the regents? Do you recall at that time?  Let   s see. Boy, the names slipped my mind. But the board was very  supportive of me. And then I took some actions later on that the board  greatly appreciated.  And Oliver S. Willham was president then?  Yes, Oliver Willham was president.  You had some conversation with Dr. Willham about the positions?  Yes, and he encouraged me to apply. In other words, I had to go through  whatever process they had but it certainly wasn   t as structured as it is  today. And as I say, good structure is important because you   ve got to be  careful.  Well, let me back track a little and ask you about some of your  colleagues and some of the faculty that you recall at that time, while you  were teaching and in your career as dean. Do some of them stand out in  your mind?  Oh yes, and there are really so many that stand out. But I   d have to say  one colleague that I had the utmost respect for and he had an  international reputation as well as a national reputation, and that was  Richard Leftwich, Dr. Richard Leftwich. Dick was a graduate of the  University of Chicago. He studied under Milton Friedman, the well  known economist, the market economist who was among monetarist and  believed in the role of monetary policy and minimum of interference in  the system if you had good monetary policy. Dick Leftwich authored a  book called On Price Theory. Dick   s book became the best seller  nationally at that time of any price theory book in the country. Graduate  15  Gill  Poole  students getting ready for their prelims in microeconomics would go buy  Dick   s book because it was so clearly written to get primed to take their  prelim in microeconomics. He was very active in professional  associations. He brought Milt Friedman down for lectures on our  campus.  So Dick clearly was one of these outstanding individuals. In fact,  because of his national reputation   we can get into this later on   Dick  didn   t want to serve in administrative roles either. He was a scholar and  an outstanding teacher. But I finally talked Dick in, like I got talked in,  to being head of the department, which brought us even more  recognition because of his national reputation among the academicians.  What about Wilton Anderson?  Wilton Anderson, he was a go-getter. He was a charger. He really would  take off, and he went after top flight students. He sometimes got  criticized by colleagues around the campus because when he would spot  a good student he   d write them a letter and say,    You ought to come  over and get into accounting.    Some of the people got jealous that we  were trying to raid their students. Well he was an entrepreneur and a task  master; he really demanded a lot. He   d go out and try to recruit the very  best faculty. He   d call them stars. He was out after the stars. And the  accounting department produced a lot of outstanding students and  there   s a long record that substantiates that and it was well recognized  nationally. Now before he came here, my hat goes off to Dean  Swearingen because he recruited him. Andy had been back east writing  the CPA exams that they give to people across the country. So he came  in and he was a very, very, very strong leader.  Another guy I had a lot of respect for was Russell Ball. He was laid  back, a very thoughtful guy. He was head of our Department of  Economics. He worked extremely hard to get things done. Ansel Sharp  was another colleague. He was a macro theorist. You know at that day  and time, I think there was a lot of camaraderie, particularly within the  department. Periodically, we   d get together for lunch and discuss things.  And then at least once a month we   d get together in one of our homes  and discuss current economic issues and we   d have give and take in  those sessions. That kind of camaraderie, even though we had maybe  different positions on various aspects of different economic problems,  brought us closer together and made us a team. So I remember those  kinds of individuals.  I had some dear friendships that I got involved in   later on I did a lot of  reorganization. I felt I had to do this. I don   t want to get into  personalities and all. But when I came in we had a large number of  16  departments and we didn   t have the budget to take care of all those  departments. We had some people that they were laid back and they had  one or two faculty members and called themselves department heads.  Really in about a year and a half, I consolidated about eight departments  into about four departments. That   s where I made a big hit with the  Regents. They said people are always coming in asking for bigger  spread of stuff, and here you   re consolidating. Now there was a strategy  to this. For example, normally in a College of Business you should have  a Department of Marketing, a Department of Finance, and other kinds of  departments listed here: finance, marketing and management. But we  didn   t have the spread there. Now when I consolidated them, I renamed  it the Administrative Sciences Department: Marketing, Management and  so forth. We needed a Ph.D. We didn   t offer a Ph.D. in any of these  others. I said if I leave one legacy for this College of Business, it   s to get  it qualified to offer a Ph.D. in Business. So I charged out to get that  done.  I got word back that internally within the university   I   m getting a little  personal here   a guy heard a conversation between people who were  above me administratively. He said,    Gosh Dick, I   m sure you   re not  going to get that Ph.D. program.    I said,    What do you mean?       Well I  heard them talking that we   ve applied from OSU for too many Ph.D.  programs, that they just don   t feel we can get another one through the  state regents.    Well I said to myself   I   ll censor what I said to myself,  Jerry. I said,    I am upset with that.    I don   t normally circumvent the  system, but I told you I think one of the reasons I think I was selected is  because I had relationships in the state. I went straight to staff on the  State Regents, and I didn   t say anything was going on internally. I said,     I just want to feel you out on something.    I didn   t say I was going to be  turned down in house or anything. I said,    I think OSU for the long term  must have a Ph.D. program in business. We don   t have all these  departments now, it   s in one area. I   m going to call it a Ph.D. in that  area, but just one Ph.D. is being offered, not in three departments, but it  will have a major in finance and marketing and management.    They  said,    Dick, that makes a lot of sense.    I said,    Would you be supportive  of that if it got approved within our system?       Why sure, that makes a  lot of sense.     So first, by combining these departments I got one department. If I go  ask for a Ph.D., I   m asking for one. They said,    You   re a smooth  operator, you   re eventually going to have three Ph.D.   s but you   re  getting it through this one department, Administrative Sciences. That  will make it easier to get through.    So the grease was laid then. I went  back and I went to the people and they said,    Well we don   t think we   ll  get it through.    I said,    That   s not a problem, I happened to visit with  them and here   s what they told me.       Oh? Oh really?    Well it went  17  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  through, it sailed through and I had the support of E.T. Dunlap, I had the  support of the State Vice President in charge of academic affairs there.  And Jerry, if there   s any one thing that I got done for that college it was  getting their Ph.D. program. Now later on, they expanded enough and  got the resources that they went back out and created those departments  and each one had its    Ph.D. programs. But think of where we would be  today if I had not been able to get that program through or if I had sat  back and said,    oh they   re not going to let me put it through here.    That  would have been a disaster  So there   s that story.  Dick, I like where you   re going, and I   d like to follow up with a couple  of questions. In addition to a Ph.D. program what was your vision for  the college? What were your major goals? Where did you feel like the  college needed to go? Where did you take it during your tenure?  Well one of the things that truly guided me   at times there was a gap  between the business community and the academic community. I took  the stance that both the academic community and the business  community had strengths and they had weaknesses, and I wanted to see  the strengths in the academic community combine with the strengths of  the business community for the development of the state of Oklahoma. It  was that kind of approach that maybe led Henry Bellmon to say I want  you to head the Technical Services Act, you   ll be fair with people  around the state and to get that kind of a thing done. So as we worked on  that, it led to an innumerable number of opportunities that we would not  have had otherwise, in my opinion.  In terms of specific goals, you did some reorganization. You also did, I  think you focused in terms   I   m trying to think of the structure you  would call it where you set your priorities and goals for the college.  Well another thing now   wait a minute, getting back to that basic  question, I probably should elaborate. I wanted to see a closer working  relationship. I   d go out to the business community and I   d say I   m trying  to bring these things together and they   d start giving us money. We  didn   t get money given to us before that. And then we   d come back.  Then I tried to get people involved in helping with Oklahoma problems.  We went through a period where academicians said,    I don   t want to  fool with Oklahoma problems, I want to write for my journal or I want  to do this nationally or I   ll go to Washington.    I tried to sell Oklahoma.  Out of that came guys like Larkin Warner who nowadays is recognized  to this day even though he   s retired in Oklahoma City, as one great OU  graduate calls him the    economic laureate    of Oklahoma. He worked on  Oklahoma problems. And then I went to the Kerr Foundation and we got  a big study going where we blended together and got all of these things  going. So it was by getting out and doing and helping with economic  18  Gill  development that we got a lot of these things rolling along.  Now I had one other thing that drove me and that was serving the  students. I said to the faculty time and again,    If we do something, is this  enhancing the opportunities for the student? I really feel strongly about  this. We bring a lot of kids in here as freshman and if we don   t spend  time with them they get down on themselves. If they get down on  themselves in their freshman year and lose their confidence, we   ve in  effect quote killed them.    I worked hard to try and build up the  relationship between faculty and students. I created the first Student  Services Division. I got Walter Starks who later became a Major  General to head that program up. We worked hard to work with  students. I involved the Business Student Council   now there   s a story I  want to tell you about if you   ll give me a chance in a minute. But the  Business Student Council, we did things.  I was the first one to get evaluation of faculty by the students, and that  was hard. People were threatened. I got a program through. And I sold it,  I said,    I will be the only one to see, it will not be used against you. It  will be helpful, we   ve got to have this kind of a program.    It was a long  haul. I had one faculty member who had opposed it. I mean there were  several who didn   t want to do it, but we got it through. And then one day  some parents came to see me and they brought their daughter. They said,     Our daughter   s got a professor who   s just lousy, who doesn   t do  anything. He   s bad and he   s mean to the students. Our daughter   s told us  all about him.    And gave us a lot of stuff like that. I said,    Oh now let   s  see, what   s that person   s name?    I said,    Well let me go check on this.    I  said,    Has she been       So I checked and I encouraged them to keep  attendance records. I said,    Why this girl   s been absent about 40  of the  time.       We didn   t know that.       Now, you say he   s a lousy teacher. I  don   t share this with people, but I   m going to share this with you. Here  are the student   s evaluations.    I went down and they gave this professor  a high ranking and I never had any more trouble with the professors. I  protected this professor from this somewhat influential person who was  just going to raise cain because this wasn   t a good teacher. I refuted that.  So I got that kind of balance through the whole system. I was really  committed. I used to also say to all of my administrators,    Whatever  action we take, what does this do to enhance the productivity of our  faculty in what they   re trying to accomplish in teaching, research and  outreach,    which I pushed, outreach,    as well as enhance the education  of our students.    Those aren   t words. Those are things I pushed,  documented, and talked about all the time. And they paid off I think for  us. Here I   ve gone rambling again Jerry. Sorry about that.  Well you talked about your legacy. Looking back, and you probably  alluded to some of these, but what were your major accomplishments in  19  Poole  your seven-eight years there as dean?  Okay, a lot of people focus on enrollment numbers. I   m not that big on  enrollment, but you have to have it to maintain yourself. We had, during  my tenure, because of some programs we introduced, a roughly 50   increase in student enrollment. That was one. So we had enrollment. The  second thing, and probably the most important thing I told you, was  getting the Ph.D. program in business approved, established, and  implemented. Another one was introducing the student evaluation forms  for teaching and getting that going.  Another one was our relationship with NASA. Because of my work  there, and I served as a consultant to the administrator of NASA which  was James E. Webb, I was able to establish a program at the Mann   s  Space Craft Center in Houston, Texas, where we would send students  down for the summer. They would be given a research project and they  would work on that research project and then turn in the results to the  people down there. I also arranged for the faculty to have similar types  of activities. So we had hands on management types of things going  between NASA and us that was enhancing the faculty. One of the people  in that program was Bob Hamm who is over the College of Business, so  well known by everybody. He participated in that program as one of the  professors. One of the guys who is leading the School of International  Studies now was working on his MBA at that time and participated in  that program and that   s Dr. James Hromas. So we had a whole host of  people and that program, I thought, was very significant.  Another one that I had, I worked with my Business Student Council, I  had a young man on there who was on the Business Student Council, his  parents had a company over in Muskogee. Well we got to working  together, and we agreed with his family that in the summer we would  take some of our brightest students, take them over there to that  program, let them sit with the treasury or the marketing guy or whoever  it may be. He   d work with them and then the guy would go on vacation  and leave them in charge for a little while. Now that took a lot of time,  and we didn   t have the resources to do that on a broad scale, but we  implemented that. Who was that student? One I was very proud of out of  this particular group, a lot of them, but I have a picture with this  Business Student Council. One of these guys, and it was his family, went  on later after he graduated, went to work for the company to get a  doctorate, a medical degree. He is now the United States Senator Tom  Coburn.  Another one was Charlie Idle. He was in that same group. He went on  and has been president of major corporations and major companies. He   s  in that group. Another one is a guy who worked with Boone Pickens and  20  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  is now a millionaire in California. I take pride. That   s my reward for  being an academic. Seeing these kinds of people emerge as leaders, and  I think our old College of Business helped provide them the kind of  environment that they took off in and got that done. So these kinds of  activities and programs, in my mind, kind of stand out. There are many  others that I could mention that truly stand out. But getting that student  services in there, creating that office, and having that go I also think was  important. So those are some of the legacies that I think were important  to the college. At least I take a lot of pride in them.  Are you leaving out Poole Hall?  (Laughter) We did move into a new building, and the students used to  have a lot of fun. We got the new building, we got it all equipped and it  was designed for that building. I mean, the thing was designed to  enhance teaching. We had case study rooms and all the rest. It was a  nice new building at the time. Now it   s an old building and they need to  get a new one. But the students had a good time. They   d say    Where are  you going?       Well I   m going over to the Poole Hall.       I   ll meet you at  the Poole Hall.    I used to tell a story when I would make speeches and  so forth, I   d say,    You know, if I ever accomplish anything, which I  never will, and they wanted to name a building after me, they could  never name a building that   s the Poole Hall. That would never work      But the students had a great time with that kind of a thing.  That was really a step up. You guys were over in Morrill Hall primarily?  Could you describe what it was like over there?  Now on the one hand, some people said Poole took them downhill. He  moved them from a    moral hall      Morrill being moral in a different  sense   to a Poole Hall. But Morrill Hall was an old building. It was  really a wonderful old building. But it was not very new. So that may  have had a big impact on what we accomplished and that building really  did make a real difference in things.  I   ve got to tell you one other story, and it ties in with my philosophy. We  were trying to educate the entire student and Raymond Young, the Y in  TG Y, some people will remember that, those stores of course are no  longer in existence, but one of our graduates had over 500 retail stores  spread throughout the United States and the rest. Raymond Young said,     I   d like to do something for the new College of Business.    Well one  thing I asked him to do was furnish our conference room. I said,    We  don   t have money now. Nowadays if you   ve got a lot of money, things  look nice. If we   re going to compete I have to have a first class  conference room. Would you put the money up to get a conference room  fixed up and furnished?    He said,    Well I   ll do that.    He made it and I  21  Gill  Poole  put a little plaque on the door about it. But he said,    I   d like to do a little  more. I   d like to do something on landscaping.    I said,    Raymond, you  believe in the arts. I would like to take a grant from you and get an art  collection to put throughout the College of Business. We   re trying to  educate students in the broadest sense, including an appreciation for the  arts.    Raymond Young came forward and gave us, at this time it was a  lot of money,  25,000. We bought one piece of art from each of our art  faculty, and then we got Doel Reed   s and some of those that were very  valuable, today they   re quite valuable if they know where they are. We  even got listed for awhile in brochures from the state saying,    Visit the  College of Business Art Collection.    They had a big feature in the  Sunday edition of the paper about this and it gave me a chance to talk  about how we   re trying to educate the students.  I also furnished a student lounge for the students. I had faculty come up  and say,    That   s a waste of money. The kids will come in and tear it all  up.    I said,    If you put the kids in a dumpy environment, they   ll be  dumpy. If you put them in a good environment, I   ve got more faith in  them.    We created that nice first class lounge and the kids kept it up.  I   ve always had faith in young people. Yeah, I   ve had some run ins, but  I   ve had run ins with old people who turned out to be not so hot.  So creating that art collection in my own mind fit in with this whole  pattern of things we were trying to do. Those are just some of the things  that stand out, ranging from an art collection to student evaluations to  consolidating the departments for efficiency. I even transferred some  classes to the Arts and Sciences because of duplication. People said,     Why are you giving up credit hours?    I said,    Because it   s the right  thing to do.    The only thing I did, I went to Whitehurst and I said,     Don   t you ever penalize me for giving these off. I want more money to  promote my faculty. I   m not proliferating faculty positions, but I want  more for salary.    And I got good salary increases for the people. So I felt  blessed that I worked with people   at that time Bob Kamm in  Whitehurst   that supported me and gave me those pushes. We also led  the movement on letting women be a little more flexible in their dress. I  also recruited the first black lady as a teacher who ever came in. I  believe in the development of ladies. We created programs there that at  least kicked off improvement in that area. I keep rambling here, my  memories coming back as I think about these. I   m sorry Jerry that I  ramble so much on those.  How about some special memories? You indicated some people, but  some special events, memories that you have that stand out from your  time as dean?  Gosh, in all honesty, there are so many. I still remember   honestly this  22  is true, my association with a lot of students, especially on the Business  Student Council. I also, as a part of this program of enhancing our  recruiting, enhancing our relationship with the students, I would write  every parent a letter or send them a carbon copy of the letter that I sent  to a student that made the Dean   s Honor Roll or the President   s Honor  Roll. I remember I would sign them. Some of my colleagues would say,     Well how do you have time to do that?    I would say,    If a student can  work that hard to get a good grade, the dean could spend enough time to  personally sign it.    To this day, I run across parents who say,    I saved  those letters that we got, Dean Poole, and that meant so much to us.    I  also enhanced and expanded the Honors and Awards Banquet. We got to  where we filled the entire ballroom and could only accommodate the  maximum capacity. We would invite all of the parents to come to that  and we   d brag on the young people. That clearly stands out as one of the  things that I remember, that involvement with those individuals.  One that I remember very much is my relationship with Fred Harris, the  United States senator. We were having some severe problems in the  nation as you remember, the Vietnam situation. One of the problems we  had, I worked with the senator and with Washington, D.C. to have what  we called the National Man Power Conference here. It was actually a  recording of the meeting of the United States Senate Subcommittee on  Government Research. And I even co-chaired a little of that. Fred Harris  brought it here. We had speakers from all across the country and people  coming from Europe and we filled the auditorium in the new Student  Union. That brought this school a lot of recognition. So I have those  kinds of memories of those kinds of activities and outreach.  I also pushed economic education. We worked with bringing ministers  in to explain how the market economy worked. Let   s face it, most  Americans, and this is not a put-down, are economically illiterate. They  don   t understand how a free market economy operates and what its  strengths and weaknesses are. The economic education program was  aimed at trying to get a better appreciation for that rather than just be  emotional and use terms that we didn   t understand or say anything  about.  One other story I   ve got to share that stands out, when I became Dean,  Oliver Willham came to see me. The people are all deceased on this or I  wouldn   t tell you this story. He said,    Dick, I   m going to give you a  packet of material that now only you and I know exist. You have a  person on the faculty that at one time was a member of the Communist  Party. But this person just went to some meetings and got involved. It   s  been thoroughly investigated and it   s not a problem. But we have this  file, the original charges that came in, and you will be the keeper of that.  There   s nothing un-American here,    and there was a time in the Joe  23  Gill  Poole  Gill  McCarthy era that there was a lot of problems. Emotional people  charged off as they do today on certain issues. I had that file, this  particular faculty member is good. In fact I   d had this faculty member as  a teacher. He never knew I had this, no one knew.  He got an assignment and an opportunity to go overseas. This was after  I   d been dean for three or four years, and I had a visit by the FBI. Now  before this, I had letters and they said,    We   re over here in Europe but  something   s on hold, we can   t go perform our duty. We   re just stymied  here. They won   t redress us and we don   t know what   s going on.    Well I  didn   t know what was going on, but they were stymied and something  was being held up and they couldn   t go to their assigned function. They  were just living and existing over there. The FBI came, and they said,     We   re doing some checking, do you know anything about this  particular professor?    I got up and said,    Just a minute gentleman.    I  went and I shut the door and I said,    Yes I do.    I told them the story  about Oliver Willham, I told them the story about how we had checked  things out, or Oliver had. I laid everything out for them. We discussed  this in great detail. They said,    Dean Poole, thank you. You didn   t  conceal anything, you laid everything out for us, you told us in depth,  and we really appreciate it.     Two weeks later, I got a telegram from the people in Europe.    We don   t  know what   s happened. We   ve been cleared and we   re moving ahead  with our project     To this day, outside of a few close friends now, that  story hadn   t been told. Now there   s a life that was saved because I had  been given this information by a great man, Oliver Willham. I kept it to  myself but I had the knowledge as he said,    If you ever have a question,  you   ll know how to deal with it.    It saved that man   s reputation and he  lived the rest of his life before he died as a productive member of  society. He was not a Communist, I want to make that clear. Anyways, I  thought that was really some story.  Dick, did the econometric model start as part of your work?  Yes, I developed relationships. I really got that going more when I  became a vice president. I had close working relationships with the Kerr  Foundation. We decided, Breene Kerr and Bob Jr. and to some extent  Bill, to undertake a big huge study of government expenditures. I got  Ansel Sharp and Larkin Warner and Bob Sandmeyer to work on that.  They got paid in the summer. We did this massive study. Out of that  came the basis for the econometric model and that relationship and got  funded which is now an integral part and is carried on in the College of  Business activities today.  Maybe you should explain that a little bit. What is an econometric model  24  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  and forecasting?  Well in the simplest terms it   s like, if you build a model of the building,  what does it would look like? Well we would build models for the  economy. Here   s what     For the state of Oklahoma, right?  For the state of Oklahoma. Here   s what the economy is. Here   s this  sector, this business sector. If you put money in here, our employment  goes up here, what that does is ricochet through the economy. Then  what   s the impact it   s going to have on state growth, projected state  income, and taxes and all the rest? So we built this model of the  Oklahoman economy and that   s the basis for the economic forecast that  the College of Business now does annually from that model that they  built. We had a good working relationship there with the Kerr  Foundation to get that going.  There were a lot of contacts that you helped make for the college  externally, are there any individuals you would cite that were significant  that you helped develop a relationship with?  Well, I tied in with the presidents of most companies both in Tulsa and  in Oklahoma City. I made a point of working with the local Chamber of  Commerce. When I came to Stillwater, I joined the local Chamber. I  believed you had to have outreach. I was only the third guy to ever serve  as president of the Stillwater Chamber of Commerce. Now, it   s very  common nowadays to have people from OSU do it. But from the same  token, I got involved at the state level and I worked with the state  Chamber of Commerce and I served on the board of directors there. So I  had access to the presidents of all the companies in the state. They  appreciated me. I wasn   t going to them when I went to see them, saying  would you help me or give me something. If I did, it was after I had  gone and helped and worked with the state and they had a lot of respect  for me.  That   s where I got a lot of extra money to support things. I   d go say,     Here   s what I   m trying to do, will you give us ten thousand a year or  whatever it is.    I had support coming in every year to help with this kind  of thing, to help with the special student scholarships and all the rest.  Now given that, there   s a number of people that made a big difference in  my life. One was Stanley Draper, Sr., Mr. Oklahoma City. He did so  much and he took a fancy to me. He wanted me to stay in Chamber  work, but once I got into academic, we had a close working relationship  and I learned so much from it. My real mentor was James E. Webb, who  I mentioned before. He   d been a successful business man; he had been  25  Gill  Poole  Vice President of Sperry  Gyroscope  Company. His brother was  captured on Wake Island in World War II. At the time, he was the vice  president of a big corporation. He signed up with the Marines and was  an aviator in that. He was a Phi Beta Kappa. He came back after the war  and he went to work in Washington, D.C. for a while. He was appointed  by Harry Truman as Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget. He was  later tapped as Under Secretary of State. He   s the guy who called Henry  G. Bennett to go head up the Point Four Program for the Truman  Administration.  James E. Webb was truly my mentor. He helped me financially, he  helped me make contacts, and he was just my mentor. He helped us  when we went back to school to get my Ph.D. and had three kids, I went  to him. I told this story at commencement when I got the Henry G.  Bennett Award, which as you know is the highest award OSU can give. I  said,    I want to share this story with you students.    I told them the story  that I couldn   t have gone without Mr. Webb who helped me as well as  Admiral Kirkpatrick or John Kirkpatrick helped financially some. I said  to Mr. Webb,    Now. Mr. Webb, I want to pay you some day.    And I  knew he would say,    Oh no, Dick     But he surprised me, he said,    I  expect you to.    I said,    Yes Sir, how do I start?    He said,    First of all, no  matter whether you go into education, or you go into business, or you go  into government, you   re going to be successful enough that you can help  other people as I have helped you. And you   ve got to promise me to do  that.     The second thing he said,    No matter if you get into the academic or  wherever it is, you must give some of your time to public service at the  local level   don   t act like a big shot that you can   t get involved in small  town at the local level   at the state level, at the national level, and if  possible the international level.    I   ve tried to honor those two things. I  have been successful enough. We now have scholarships that we  support. We have a Distinguished Graduate Fellowship. Now a lot of  people contributed to that as well as ourselves. We have two PDS    and  I   m trying to help other students. And I help them in other ways. I   ve  tried behind the scenes, I   ve done things like that.  PDS is the President   s Endowed Scholarship?  Yes. Now I think the endowment is around   well it   s way up there now.  But it   s normally around  50,000 to get it endowed. I have those  programs, and then I   ve served in these national positions. As I  mentioned, I spent time in the local chamber, I did things like that. But  do you know the one thing I learned? The more I did, the more I owe  because I gained so much from all of those things that it came back. But  Jerry, even that guided me in trying to help you when you wanted to  26  Gill  Poole  Gill  go   see that   s the tie back to Mr. Webb and where you see a direct  impact, when I tried to help you get your doctorate back there. Not a big  way, it was modest, but you led the way with that wonderful book on  OSU   s international involvement. And so Mr. Webb was truly my  mentor. And then John Kirkpatrick was also. These people had a real  impact on my life. I could mention so many, but those in particular. And  most of the students I   ve talked to, I think I always tell them,    Someday  you can help and you need to come back and do the same thing.     I know this was a good time in your life. I can tell from our conversation  that the college, and certainly as dean. But a higher calling came along.  Again, you really never looked for the job. Can you give us a little  background about how you got into the vice president position?  Well as I said, Dr. Kamm came to me one time and he wanted me to  move over to Whitehurst as Vice President for Business and Finance.  They were having a change there and they were creating the position. I  didn   t want to go, and that really wasn   t what I wanted to do. But he  said,    Dick, you   ve got to come,    He   s really putting the pressure on me.  So at the time, I went back to the department heads, and I   m sure this  didn   t last for long but I   d been there about five years. I said,    The  president   s after me, and I don   t really want to go, but how do you guys  feel about it?    Well they didn   t want me to go because I guess they  knew I was trying to fight on their behalf. I figured that was my role,  represent them well and they in turn represent our faculty and create an  environment for them to be productive. So they all wrote letters and  went over to see the president and said,    Leave Poole alone, we want  him where he is.    I was relieved and we went on and accomplished  many more things.  Then he came to me in    72 and said,    Dick we   ve got to create this new  program for Outreach, Vice President for Development and Outreach  Programs,    and later I had extension, not the part of agriculture but  outreach in communities and those programs. He said,    I   ve really got to  have you over there.    Well after a while, I said,    Okay I will accept this  position.    But I did stay in the College of Business to see them through  their national accreditation. That was accomplished in    72 and then I  moved over to the job and full time, I had both jobs for a short period of  time as Dean and Vice President. Then I moved over as Vice President  with Dr. Kamm and had a lot of wonderful experiences there with him.  Let me back up and ask you one question that I missed. A little about the  college, having left, but in your time as vice president and since, do you  still stay in touch with the college? Do you still have connections? And  how do you view the Spears School of Business now?  27  Poole  Yeah. Well the first rule I had was once I left, there were some people  who thought, rightly or wrongly, that I   d been a pretty strong and  effective dean. I have to say that because of what I   m going to lead into.  And given that, some people were saying,    God, I wouldn   t want to  follow Poole because he   ll be looking over their shoulder and all.    I had  a rule, once I walked away from that college, I didn   t go back over there  unless I was invited for something. I never criticized anything. I never  told the dean what to do. I did tell whoever was dean, my door is always  open on a confidential basis if you want my input. But I   m not going to  ever tell you what I think you ought to be doing. I   m going to treat you  just as I treat any dean in our day to day operations.  I did have deans that would eventually come to me and say,    Dick.    And  I   d say,    Okay, it   s confidential.    They   d ask my counsel on something  and I would give it to them. But I never went back over there. And later  when I fully retired from the university, I said I   ll never go back over  there and have an office, because there   s too many imaginary problems  that can be developed in people   s minds that you   re trying to control  things.  Now I   ve always maintained love and appreciation for the College of  Business. And the College of Business, Bob Sandmeyer came in there  who was the third Ph.D. graduate out of our program. He did an  unbelievable job. When he came in, we were getting better funding and  he was able to take the program and expand it back out where they had a  Department of Finance, a Department of Marketing and the rest. The  other had served its purpose. Administrative Sciences had grown  significantly. It went back and these departments were created. Bob gave  great leadership. He had many innovative programs and I was able to  support some of them through what I call University Extension. I used to  follow the model of    I   ll give you some seed money, and see if you can  make it grow into things.    One of the ventures I backed was his program  on the Management Executive Briefing program and the Tulsa Business  Forum which have become an invaluable tool not only for the college,  but for the university. I put seed money into that.  I should have also mentioned way back there that we did a book on the  Oklahoma economy. Dick Leftwich, myself, Rudy Trenton and Ansel  Sharp. That   s where we first got back involved in things. I should have  mentioned that way back there. But Bob had all this impact on our  college. He created the SBA Associates, he modernized things. He got  rid of some programs that needed to be changed over time. He expanded  the graduate programs. And he gave great leadership. I   m very pleased  that we now have Sarah over there as dean and she   s giving very good  leadership. She   s very committed to the college and trying to do a lot.  28  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Now when I retired, Bob Sandmeyer was still dean and he said,    We   ve  got to expand our international activities, Dick.    He said,    We   re having  trouble getting some of this going. Maybe it   s a little current to be  saying that. Will you come back, even though you   re retired, and chair  this committee on international relations and so forth?    So I went back  then and chaired. We had lots of meetings. We got a lot of programs  going. We developed out of that the London summer program. We got  people involved in international programs and all the rest. And then of  course all this fit in. Eventually Steve Miller got involved in all of these  things and became very active at the state level and national level on this  stuff. So all of these activities.  I still do anything I can when the College of Business asks me. I still go  to the College of Business Associates. The business community was  very kind along with a few friends in establishing the Richard W. Poole  Professorship for Excellence. The dean knows that and uses the money  to enhance operations in that college, not to put in her pocket but puts  that money in. She supports graduate students going to deliver papers.  They give out awards for teaching and research and extension, or  outreach programs. They   ve been kind enough to name me in some of  those. I   m getting a lot of miles out of those things  The Richard W.  Poole Award for Outreach or they have a stipend with them. So I still  have a lot of ties to the college, but never coming to any dean to say,     Hey you ought to be doing this or that.    I just don   t do that.  Do you see a bright future?  I certainly do. With the entrepreneurship program, I think that will take  off. I think they   ve got an outstanding person coming in to head that up.  The name is escaping me. I   ve seen the credentials, I   ve seen him on  TV, a relay we had prepared. I think the sky   s unlimited. But still, our  basic mission is to take care of those kids and have impact on Oklahoma  as well as the nation and the world. We must always help serve our state  and help our economy grow and prosper where we can. Back to what I  said early on, we have strengths, the business community has strengths.  Oklahoma is going to be a heck of a lot better place if we marry the  strengths of both groups to help build Oklahoma into a greater state.  When you moved over to Vice President of University Relationships,  Development and later extensions along with it, you had some different  opportunities in that area. First of all, can you share with us some of the  units that reported to you?  Well yes, when we went over there, at that time the OSU Foundation  was in the university, as part of the university. That was one of the units.  Public Information, I got that area. The Alumni Association was in it.  29  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  KOSU was involved in that. So we had all of these outreach   now Murl  Rogers     High School and College Relations?  Oh yes, High School and College Relations was a kingpin. I   ve got to  say something about that, our enrollment was down at the time. Bob  Kamm had recruited Russ Conway who was the epitome of the effective  High School and College Relations Director. He was out in that field. He  knew the counselors and all the rest. The true story of his contributions  has never fully been told and I   m just sorry for that because he did so  dog gone much to get things moving in that whole area. Our enrollment  was down. We implemented early off a massive program and it started  with a letter writing program. They were sending letters out from the  colleges uncoordinated. They wouldn   t even sign the dang letters. They  had to just be stamped because the guys thought they were so important.  Wrong statement. So I worked very hard to pull all of this together. We  had a coordinated letter writing program. We enhanced the visitation  program and got all of that going. As a result, our enrollment started  increasing significantly. We had a big increase, and Jerry you played a  role in that because you were out there as a young guy helping us do  this.  Assistant Director Russell, you   re right, is a great great guy and his  story should be told.  Yes.  One of the things that you and I have talked about before, could you  share a little bit about your market philosophy of student recruitment?  Truly some of the genius at that time was having high school and college  relations, which is now the undergraduate admissions office. But you  took more of a marketing approach. Could you share your philosophy?  Well yeah, we had all kinds of   look, we brought together the strengths  of the Alumni Association, High School and College Relations, and  Public Information for a whole integrated program. So we developed  very attractive brochures, we developed a movie that   Murl Rogers was  a leader here that really was effective. He had the people to show it.  Then we had the honors banquets. We   d go to all of these counties  around the state and we   d have these honors programs and we   d invite  the top students in and bring their parents. Then where we could, we  tried to invite graduates that were outstanding. President of Kerr-McGee  or whoever would sit up at the head table and they represent OSU. Then  we would tie into the fundraising scholarships for those people. Our  brochures were integrated and sent out to the students. Russell would  30  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  coordinate all of the contacts, not only with high schools, but with junior  colleges, because we could get junior college transfers. To have an  integrated marketing approach, you had to have all of these units. Your  publications, your PIO, your Alumni Association, and yes even the  Foundation in an indirect way, all pulling together to get this thing done.  I think when you separate those things, get tied up to these other ties,  you lose a lot. I know things change. All I can tell you, success speaks  for itself, go look at the record.  And the record is?  Enrollment increases. At one time we even passed OU.  In head count?  In head count.  Do you remember, I certainly remember your market segmentation.  High market?  Oh yes   It was high, good, average and low market.  Yeah, we had the markets identified and we would concentrate our  resources, absolutely.  Markets for the schools.  That   s right. And where do you spend your time. We never neglected  anybody, but we concentrated where we spent some of the time.  Even the low market, as I recall, we wouldn   t contact them, but if they  contacted us we   d go visit them.  Absolutely, absolutely. If you had it very small, you   ve got a place with  a handful of people, you   re not going to spend the same amount of  resources there, that you spend going to a big high school in Oklahoma  City or in Tulsa or in Bartlesville or Muskogee or wherever it may be.  So some different challenges in development and fundraising? Can you  share some of your issues there?  Yeah, we went through a difficult time there. We had some personnel  problems that were very very difficult. We had problems of health with  people. Well I don   t think it   s inappropriate, time has passed. We had  31  Gill  Poole  some alcoholic problems at times. I faced that in a number of areas. I  always kept them quiet. I   ve got to share one story with you. I could be  tough, but I was also a pussycat in some ways. We had one fellow, it  wasn   t here in this, it was when I was back in the college. I   ll share, I  had similar problems in the VP office. This guy was an alcoholic and I  called him in one time. I said,    Now we can   t put up with this anymore.  You   ve got to deal with this.       I will Dr. Poole.    So he got in trouble  again, I called him in again. I said,    Now I   m going to send you up to  this clinic if you can deal with it. But if you don   t come through on this,  I   m going to get you out of here. It   s up to you.       Oh I   ll do it.    He got  in trouble. He had an auto wreck, he   d been drinking. So I had to  encourage him, rather than embarrass him, to resign; he did. Left the  college.  Vice President, he came back to see me. He said,    Dr. Poole, I   ve come  back to see you. I want to tell you why. I want to thank you, and I want  to apologize to you for both.    He said,    No human being gave me more  chances when I was having my problems. I   m on the wagon now. I   m  AA, I   m a good man now.    But he said,    You encouraged me, you  offered to help me, you gave me chances, and you finally had to  encourage me to get out, and I left. Dr. Poole, I had to reach rock bottom  to start recovering. I just wanted you to know I had to go that route. Now  I   ve got a good life. I   m a productive member. But I always remember  how you tried to help me and did everything. I wanted you to know, I  just had to go to rock bottom before I could pull myself out.    I  appreciated that. Well we had problems in other areas when I went to the  Vice Presidency. We got those resolved.  We were the bottom of the Big Eight in fundraising.  Oh my. We had no fundraising capabilities back there. We   d just gotten  started, actually in the 60   s they created the Foundation. We made some  changes there early on. By the way I went to see Bud Seretean early on,  that   s one of the bigger gifts we ever got. Of course, I was always  wanting to represent the college. But Bud talked about at one time, that  he would like to have a dormitory named after him if he did something.  So I went to see him and he said he was ready to try and do something.  We spent three days with him. I said,    Bud, I   m going to tell you  something. I   m bringing you down a picture. This is what we   d like to  see as a performing arts center at OSU.    I said,    It   s your money, but I  feel obligated to tell you what this could mean versus a dormitory. And I  want you to listen.       Well I don   t know,       Just listen to me.    I presented  that and told him why it was important. I said,    I   d like for all the money  to go to the College of Business, but we need this more for OSU   s image  than to be effective as a state university, to show we have an  appreciation for the performing arts.    He came back for the ground  32  Gill  breaking. A lot transpired that finally led to yes, he was going to do it.  He called me to his side and he said   and he was a pretty dominant  guy   he said,    Dick, I want to tell you something.       What   s that?       I  appreciate you just telling me that it wasn   t your money, but you wanted  to give me a suggestion to think about, because this was the right thing  to do.    And I feel good about that, you know. I really feel good about  that, leading to that kind of a thing.  But anyways, we got the program going. I did hire Charles Platt who had  been with Conoco; he had a lot of contacts and he came up. I think we  made a lot of progress, the Foundation started going. We developed a lot  of new programs. He developed that PDS program and other programs  like that. As I think back on it, you stumble at times but we had one  philosophy that guided us: We   ve got a lot of building to do. We   ve got  to have the friend-raisers, which friend-raisers being whoever we can,  including the Alumni Association, and then we   ve got the fundraisers.  You don   t go out and meet our alumni for the first time and say gimme  gimme gimme. You establish a rapport with them, you tell them how  you   re servicing them, or like I used to do with the College of Business,     I   m serving Oklahoma. By the way, you can help me by giving me  money to continue this service.    And that I think started paying off for  us.  But anyways, my bottom line is this: we will develop some cultivations  today that we will not see the dollar benefits of but those that come after  us will see it. And you see that today at OSU, here and there, all over the  place. People that we developed and got them started on small giving,  and they became large donors. We   ve got a terrific alumni group now.  And we   ve got people who are so committed with giving. You can just  look at the record. The progress that   s been made, as you well know, is  really unbelievable. And you, I   ve got to say again, played an important  role in all of this. You served in so many capacities, and I love Murl  Rogers, he was a great director. He was the right man for the time, and  when Jerry Gill stepped in, he was the right man for the time. I   m just  going to say this, Jerry Gill is Mr. Alumni, what he   s done in bringing  the Alumni together, building a base throughout the state, tireless  energy, and that building up there which is such a center right there in  the heart of the campus. As Larry Boger would say, I tip my hat to you.  One quick question, you may recall, were you part of the decision   I  guess it   s not a secret but we were having some fundraising issues in  athletics that got us on probation back in the late    70   s and we created a  position for athletic fundraising to be in the Foundation. That   s when  Larry Boger had just come on board. I think Dick Young as athletic  director. Were you part of that discussion about creating that director of  athletic gift programs and that office?  33  Poole  Gill  Poole  Well yeah, I was part of that and they needed that, but it goes back even  before that. In Bob Kamm   s administration if you went back, this is  dating back a ways. There was a group of well meaning alumni who  wanted to do some things and they wanted to support, and they were  circumventing the rules. I remember being invited to a small meeting in  the old president   s dining room right off of the cafeteria, and this dates it  back there, in the Student Union. They said,    Here   s what we have  planned and we want to raise the money out here and we   re soliciting the  people,    and I said,    We can   t be a part of that.       Well Dick, you   ve got  to be a part of this, because that   s the only way we   re going succeed in  athletics.    I said,    It can   t work that way.    I didn   t get argumentative,  but I came back and then I talked to one of the people in that crew that  later became very prominent. I said,    I need your help. We can   t go this  route. I can   t have the university affiliated with it, and Bob Kamm can   t  be affiliated with it.    This person supported me and we were able to pull  it away from the institution, so we got separated. Some of that may have  continued for a while afterwards, but boy we divorced it from this  institution and asked for it to not to be done.  So when the investigations later came, that was all external to the  university. It would have been very easy to be popular with some of  those people at the time and say,    Oh that   s well meaning, we   re going  to do with you whatever you want.    We said we can   t do it. That   s when  we said,    We   ve got to have a fundraising arm over there that   s  legitimate to raise money for athletics. Do it the right way, be up front.  No under the cover handing out money to players and all that kind of  stuff.    I   ve been pretty blunt there about what went on, I   m not naming  any names, there   s nothing to be gained by that. But that led to the job  that you later took over there under Dick Young, and you got the Posse  Club and all that stuff going which is legitimate. It   s on board. It   s up  front. Never any criticism of that. Some of the people still affiliated with  that and some of the things they did do, did hurt the university later on.  What were some of the challenges that you had? I mean we   ve spoken of  some of the issues. But just overall general challenges that looking back  you remember. Issues that you had to address as Vice President of  University Relations and Development and Extensions?  Well, the one I touched on was getting the Foundation structured and set  up I thought to where it was accountable and responsive. Got with Dean  Stringer early on and we redrafted the bylaws, all of it so it would be a  more effective, transparent organization. Dean Stringer, who later  became a member of the Board of Regents, he and I worked on getting  all of that done. They had had a system of not really changing  presidents. I prevailed on Raymond Young to bring credibility to it, to  be the new president and he took that job. Came down to Oklahoma City  34  and said,    I   ve got to have you.       Well, I don   t want          We   ve got to  have you Raymond.    He succumbed, like I succumbed to some things  when the pressure is on. That was a challenge to get that thing cleared  up, moving and going in the right track and other problems were dealt  with and that was certainly accomplished.  Certainly at the time, everyone was upset with the enrollment declines  and so forth. So that integrated marketing program, the strategies that we  worked out that you were a part of, the identifying, and then to deal with  a lot of these problems. Jerry, I introduced what I called    management  by objectives    that we used. Now I didn   t want traditional. Yeah, I  didn   t want it to be like the traditional people. It could get so  cumbersome. They had people like at one of the big corporations, even  the secretaries fell into that. That   s a waste of time. But we tried to set  up objectives that were measureable on a yearly basis and then we   d  have goals and our objectives would fit in with the goals. That might be,  we   re going to try and get this many more honors banquets presented.  We   re going to try and reach this many more students. That became our  bench mark for getting a lot of these things done and implemented on  time because the big problem is there   s so many demands on your time  that pretty soon you   re spreading yourself so thin you can   t get anything  done. As I once told you, it   s not all the things you can do, it   s what  you   re able to do. You   ve got to focus. And those really helped us focus  on some of the issues that we needed to focus on. So that program of     management by objectives,    getting everyone to sing off the same sheet  of music, being sure that we weren   t duplicating each other and moving  in the same directions.  Also a problem that we always faced was the territorial position that  most of us in administration face. The deans wanted to protect  everything in their daily bailiwick and they didn   t care   it   s just human  nature   about the other deans. Departments, the same way, to try to get  people to overcome those issues and look at the big picture. How do you  get them to be more   first we   ve got to say, how do we fit in? Look,  we   re a part of the university, how do we fit in to make this a greater  university and what is our role? That was a difficult challenge. It was  never completely solved. But the one way we went about it, we talked to  President Kamm and decided we would have a president   s retreat. So we  took the deans and the vice presidents and went off for two days. Two  nights and days. We had a prepared agenda. We discussed hot issues and  the rest. That eventually led to the President   s Planning Council which  became an institution that helped us get over it. The funny thing is I  always set up a good social evening, formal dinner, bring your wives,  and we   d have a program for them. We established rapport with each  other and found out that we   re all kind of nice guys or nice gals. We   ve  got some things in common and we can have a good time together and  35  then we can get in and do our business too. So the informal part of that  was an important part in getting us to   as Larry would say, let   s try to  sing off the same sheet of music. I thought that was another big  challenge we had.  Another one was to get people to realize that we had to be accountable  to the people of Oklahoma. If we didn   t respond well to them, or we put  them down, they were going to come back and bite us. So I also had the  responsibility of dealing with the legislature, and that was a tough job. I  bit my tongue many a day when I was dealing with those people. But I  had a philosophy that I worked on, how do you allocate your time? So I  identified who the speaker was, and then I became as close as I could be  to them. Then I would arrange periodically   I   ll give you one example.  A speaker would come in, and I   d say all right, I   m going to invite  Speaker soforth and his wife, and we   ll meet in Oklahoma City for  dinner. You invite Mrs. Boger and I   ll invite Lynn. We   ll have an  evening together, we   ll talk about things. And this is best to illustrate  this, one speaker said,    All right now, Mr. President.    He said,    I know  you guys want to do what   s right. There   ll be times we won   t agree with  you. Anytime you have a problem and you think we   re mistreating you,  or you want to get a message to us, we may not be able to adjust  everything you want, but you   ve got an avenue. You ask Dick Poole to  come and tell me about it.    Those channels were established. And that   s  where I was able to go communicate issues to the leadership, this is our  priority, we can get by without this, here   s this.  Also with the outreach, we had some people that said they didn   t care  what the legislature said. Some of them could be pretty mean and petty.  We blocked most of that and I was able to work with them and had a  pretty good rapport with those people but I worked at it hard. But that  was another big challenge, to work in that area. To get people to realize  that we couldn   t be all things to all people was always a challenge, and  to say we   ve got to focus on these areas and get people to eliminate  programs. No one wanted to eliminate anything. I fought against that.  Also the deans didn   t care about outreach programs very much. One  dean was earning some money with this program and transferring it to  tag it for research. I said,    I   m going to cut your money off. You can  invest it any way you want to, but it   s going to be to enhance outreach.        Well we don   t       I said,    That   s the way it   s going to be.    That   s about  the only time I got dictatorial. I   ll give you entrepreneurship money, but  you   re not going to siphon it off. You   ve got to believe in this mission  that you   re carrying out. And to this day we have trouble with full  outreach. But listen, we   re doing so good. Our people are involved.  We   ve made progress. That   s all I can tell you. And that   s why Burns  Hargis is the right man at this stage of our history. He   s got the outreach.  36  Gill  Poole  He   s got the confidence. Our university is going to continue to grow and  prosper even more so. We had great growth, great prospering, and it   s  going to get better.  Dick, speaking of President Hargis, you   ve worked with President  Willham, President Kamm, President Boger in your time. Can you share  some of your thoughts about the different presidents that you served  under?  Well you know, one must really be careful here. They were all different  people. I   ll be honest with you, most of the presidents I can totally  respect. The thing that I guess I judge the president to start with was a  character of human personality. I am a guy who believes in loyalty.  Now, am I going to work for a president that I can go to and he   ll say,     Tell me what   s on your mind Dick,    and he would listen? You see just  giving orders is not enough. You   ve got to listen. I   d say, can I have a  president who would listen to me if I have a legitimate concern? Do I  feel free to go and say,    Mr. President, we   re taking this policy but I  have to communicate with you, here are my concerns and I   m not  coming unless I can articulate them one, two, three, four, five       and he  would take them into account?  I could do that with Bob Kamm, and I did it many times. I went to Bob  Kamm and sometimes he would say,    Dick you made a good point,  we   re going to reverse.    He overruled legal counsels in some areas and  some things like that where they were looking at it in a narrow focus. On  other occasions Bob Kamm said,    Dick, what you don   t understand is  this variable and this variable.    I   d say,    Mr. President, I understand,  I   m on board, let   s go.    It   s that ability to communicate. You   ve got to  believe that both the president and you want to build the university, not  yourselves. Bob Kamm really wanted to build OSU. He was an  honorable man who really cared about people. He and Maxine both. It  wasn   t a false deal. If somebody died or something, who were the first  people there as busy as they were? It was the Kamms if they knew. They  always showed up. His    people emphasis program    epitomizes what  Bob and Maxine were about.  Now I had a disagreement with Bob on a speaker   s policy, I   ll be honest  about that, but we worked together through that and we had a good  process. I respected Bob Kamm, we had a close relationship. We would  kid each other. We   d be out late at night doing programs. We   d tie in  with OU and work together. I   d put on joint appearances along with my  counterpart at OU to show we were tied together as universities. We   d  go around the state with Paul Sharp and Bob Kamm, making addresses  all over the state. We worked as a team.  37  We   d be out late at night, and sometimes, a little story, we   d come back  and on the east side of Oklahoma City on the interstate, there   s that  sewer smell. You know, as you   re driving along? And we got in the  habit, we   d be driving along there and we knew what was coming. Bob  would say,    Dick, did you do something?    Or I   d say,    Bob, I   m  embarrassed.    And we had that kind of humor. The other thing, we   d go  to functions and Bob would say,    Now you know I don   t drink, so Dick  and I make a good team. I do the driving, and Dick does the drinking for  us.    Bob was a great guy. He was always supportive of me and if he told  me I was wrong and told me the facts, I was with him. But I could go to  him.  Now Oliver Willham, he was always supportive. I didn   t get to work  that closely with him, but I had the greatest admiration for him. He was  always supportive of me. One time, I remember, I was popping off on  something I shouldn   t have and he got me straightened out right in a  hurry. I said,    Thank you, Oliver.    I appreciated it, you know. But I was  blessed for the time I got to work with him. After he retired, man I  invited him to every function, I recognized Oliver Willham. I   d seen too  many people   you know there is a tendency to kind of forget   there  was, anyway, a tendency to forget those who contributed so much. I  honored Willham until his death. I had the highest admiration for him.  Same way with Bob Kamm. You and I share that belief. Bob Kamm,  from my standpoint, was a great president. As with all of us, the more he  was in the job the more he learned, the more effective he was, the  greater he grew. He did so much for this university after he left the  presidency. The Centennial History Series and all the rest.  Well, moving on, after he left, Larry Boger came in. Larry was a  different kind of personality. But the one thing, can I communicate with  this guy and the rest? It worked the same with him. I could go in and  say,    Well Mr. President, I disagree.    I remember he would always tell  this story. I went to him when he first came and he said,    They   re trying  to get me to go down here in the community and be tied in with the  chamber.    He said,    You know, a lot of these places I   ve been, we don   t  fool around with that.    I said,    Mr. President you need to go there and  participate     And he   d tell it like that. Dick said,    You need to go down  there.    He says,    Smartest move I ever made.    We had presidents later  who said,    I   m too busy for them    and they ate that president   s lunch  alive. So this president would listen. He   d call me at times behind the  scenes and he   d say,    Now what do you really think of this?    I   d go  through and he   d say,    Good point, but you didn   t take this into account  and this.    I   d say,    I   ve got to Mr. President.    I could always   he would  listen. So I was blessed with Bob Kamm who would listen, and what  little time I had with Oliver, but that was my experience with him. And  then I   d get my marching orders and I was ready to march because we  38  were together. The same thing with Larry Boger. When he came in, we  were going through all that athletic scandal and stuff. He worked so hard  to straighten all of that out, night and day getting calls. He handled some  difficult things. I   ll say one other thing about him, we could be in the  worst of circumstances, and Larry had a philosophy of saying,    The  leader   s got to be positive. If he   s not, then it   s going down the tube.     I   ll tell you a story. When I was trying to raise the money for a  professorship in Larry   s name, I got former Governor Nigh on the  committee to help us. He said,    Dick I   m going to tell you a story about  Larry. We were going through the financial crisis and all the rest, and  I   ll never forget this. Larry was down there. I was bemoaning everything  and how bad things were and Larry said,    Governor, I need to tell you  something. You   re our leader. You   ve got to be positive, even though it  hurts. You   ve got to be positive.    I won   t tell you the whole thing, I  won   t stretch it out.    The Governor said,    You know he was absolutely  right. And I followed it.    Larry followed that. When we were going  through the crises up there, he could even come in when his wife was  having cancer problems. You never knew he had a problem. He was  always positive. He was a delight to work for from my standpoint. I felt  I accomplished a great deal with him.  So those are the three guys I really worked for. I didn   t have the  opportunity to work with John Campbell. When he came, he really did  put the arm on me to stay in my vice-presidency but I had   early on I  need to tell you this story. I went to see Larry one time and I said,    Larry  I want to go back to my teaching. That was my dream; I   d been in all  these jobs. I   ve got to wrap my career up back in the classroom and  doing what I want to do for the last five years, if I can.    He said,    Dick,  I   m going to tell you something, and no one else is going to know it. I   m  going to retire in one year, and I want you to stay in this job for me for  one more year and make it an easier transition.    I said,    Well, Mr.  President, yes I would do that for you. But I have one condition. The  board must act on my change of position before we even know who the  candidates are for the new presidency. Because I don   t want anybody  saying, well Dick Poole didn   t like the new president and he resigned, or  the new president didn   t like Dick Poole and then kicked him out.     So they took my appointment to go back to the classroom. Or up to the  classroom. I always felt that teaching was the higher deal, not the  administration. So I went back to be promoted to teach as a professor.  They went to the board in October and presented out the stuff and then  the first of December the board   s action, and there are big articles in the  paper.    He   s elected to go back to teaching,    and so forth. The Regents  were very kind and gave me the title    Regents Distinguished Service  Professor.    They had Service Professor, but they didn   t have  39  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Distinguished Service Professor. So I got that title and the board was  very kind to me. I   ve always appreciated that. But when the new  president came in and was selected, he wanted me to stay on while I had  already committed. I had an easy out. He talked to the local publishers  and said,    Can you talk Dick into it?    He talked to Senator Shedrick and  they said,    He   s got his mind made up. He bought his new jeep and he   s  going to Colorado for six months.     Hooray for you, right?  Yeah. So anyways, those are the guys I worked for. John Campbell, I  helped him on some things. We had a big program one time that Bob  Sandmeyer worked for him on the role of us on economic development  and I came up with the idea of this big fair. We invited OU and  everyone, the library, all these displays. We had a statewide program  and I helped him with that. He wrote me a very nice letter about that. I  did some other things on the side, but I didn   t work for him. And then of  course, I didn   t get to work with Jim Halligan. Although Jim Halligan,  when he retired, he and I shared an office area together. I became a good  friend with Jim Halligan and I found him to be an outstanding individual  who I had the greatest admiration for. We shared a lot of things together  and had a good relationship. Of course now he   s been elected to the state  senate. But the minute he started to run for office, he moved right out of  his offices in the university and stepped out because he didn   t want to  embarrass the university or have anyone accusing him of using state  property for any kind of thing. So that   s my story with the presidents.  It   s longer than you wanted. But the ones I had the honor to work with  were great presidents.  I want to come back to alumni relations in just a minute. Because you  have such an understanding, could you share about your philosophy  about the importance of Alumni relations and why Alumni Association is  so important to a university?  Oh it   s the glue that can hold everything together. And it   s also the  boiling pot that can give people the chance to get involved and build so  much for the institution. There are so many people that want to be  involved and to involve them in a constructive way is so important. You  build these friends. You never know where they   re going to be able to  come in and help you, whether it   s with legislators or whether it   s with  other people on raising funds or critical issues. Certainly on recruiting.  You   ve got to have a big net. Plus if you have that, as I   ve always said,  you can go and say,    I represent 25,000,    whatever the figure is    people  of the Alumni Association who are trying to advocate this important  program.    I mean that   s just one little place where you can pick it up and  use it. The relationships there, it   s like we   ve just been here to a funeral  40  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  of Mel Jones. Mel was always in the thick of the Alumni Associations.  What an OSU leader he was. They become a part, not all, of the friend-raising  for the university. Raising more and more friends, and speaking  on behalf of the university. Canceling fictitious stories out at the cocktail  parties and the dinner parties. Keep them informed, make them proud.  And they can do so much in little informal ways that create an image of  the institution. That   s what creates the image of the institution. You  can   t do too much. You   ve done such a good job of expanding that. I  again go back to its role in student recruitment. I go back to its role on  fund raising, the legislators, just promoting the general public image of  our land grant university. What would you add to that Jerry?  Well I   d just create ambassadors and advocates for Oklahoma State  University.  Absolutely.  And a lot of the good things I do don   t have anything to do with  fundraising but long term effects.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  Are there some vice presidents, other unit head colleagues, that you  worked with that stand out in your mind that you remember?  My relationship with Jay Boggs was just phenomenal. He and I were  both committed to the university. We coordinated well with each other.  We didn   t try to play in ups-man-ship one on the other. We were blunt  with each other. I had certain strengths, Jay had them. I know a lot of  times Jay would send me something and say,    Dick, would you read  over this. You have got the focus on some detail.    I   m a detail person. I  can see the big picture, but I used to always say   you know I quoted  that lady who said,    We don   t seem to have time to do it right the first  time, but we always have time to do it over.    Well I want to do it right  the first time. A lot of people will dictate out a memo that they don   t  proof and it gets all kinds of resources moving in the wrong way because  it had a mistake in it. But Jay would send me things to read over,  important documents and so forth. But more than that, on the big issues  we   d be together on policy issues. We   d meet with the presidents and  what they called the executive group. We would raise questions with  each other to try to be well prepared. Jay never tried to step in my  territory, he would protect it. I would try to protect his. We would have  give and take. I think the flow there was great.  Now Ron Beer in Student Services was another great colleague. He  really worked with those students. He had great rapport with them and  did so many wonderful things. And Ed Davidson in his own right. We  41  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  kidded Ed, but he had a big role there and just did so many things in the  financial area for us. So I had great relationships with those people. And  of course I loved Murl Rogers. Early on, he was cut from a different  mold. We are all cut from different molds. The thing I admired about  you Jerry, even at your retirement you had Mrs. Rogers there sitting at  that table. Murl is a legend. And as far as I   m concerned, Jerry Gill is  going to be a legend. He already is, but he   s going   as we came, and I  was on that dang committee, Jerry Gill is the    Ultimate Cowboy.    I was  on the committee that got you labeled with that and that   s doggone true.  And I was honored to be on the planning committee for your retirement.  But you can   t stay retired. You   re still out working for your university.  All right, back to you. Dick, this may sound like a silly question, but  looking back, anything you would do differently in your career at  Oklahoma State?  Oh yes, there were times that I lost my temper that I hated myself for. A  very wise man once told me,    Dick, a good administrator never should  lose their temper with a subordinate. It   s okay to lose it with a superior,  but not with a subordinate.    I have lost my temper at times with a  subordinate, and a few times I   ve had the guts to go back and apologize.  I think you can deal with people on tough issues, but you don   t lose your  cool. I sometimes would lose my cool and I felt that   s a weakness that I  had. I wish I could have done things differently there. There are other  times that I may have pushed certain programs a little too hard that I  shouldn   t have pushed. But in general, I tried to listen and I think  sometimes   now this sounds like a contradiction, I should have been  more forceful. I bent over backwards a lot of times   it didn   t show to a  lot of people   in trying to create goodwill and didn   t take people on that  I probably should have stepped on a little harder. But if it became really  tough, I would deal with that. I guess those issues are the ones that   my  personality traits on that. And then I never felt like I had a giant intellect,  and I always had great respect for those that did have a good intellect  and I wish I could have promoted some people even more than I did. But  I tried to promote people following Mr. Webb   s suggestion: Help others.  Not only in financial ways, but in making them successful. And that was  the joy.  It   s probably hard to pick out some special memories, but looking back,  are there some things that stand out in your mind? Highlights in your  career   and I   m not talking about accomplishments, just anything that  gives you a lot of pride?  Again, I   d go back. I think the way the College of Business overall has  emerged in the state, and under Bob   s leadership continued to reach out  to the business community and become highly respected. One of the  42  Gill  Poole  things that we haven   t really touched on is the Centennial Program. That  was a highlight. Larry Boger said,    Look in ten years...      he planned.  This is planning. By the way, I think I failed on getting as much  planning going. Not to hold you back, but I   d like to have seen more  effective planning on folks and our resources. But Larry Boger said,     We need to plan for our Centennial, starting ten years in advance.    And  we did.  By doing that we were able to come up with things like the Centennial  History Series, 25-plus volumes that cover every college. Bob Kamm  was prevailed upon to take that on and head it. There   s no university that  has a record reported like we have. I   ve always been a nut in history.  I   ve always tried to support the history program. I first displayed this  when we were able to take your dissertation, for your doctorate, and  publish it; The Great Adventures is what I call it, in international  education. And that led me to, I was visiting Stanford to see what they  did on their centennial to come up with this idea of the Centennial  Histories. I   m very proud of that. I   m just very very proud of that  Centennial Histories program. Those stand out.  But of course, I guess of all the things I really have enjoyed my time as  Dean of the College of Business. We got curriculum changes through  that were unbelievable. I got some recognition for the college. We got  the Southern Economic Association, a prestigious group, to have their  headquarters there. I really enjoyed my national associations when I was  there. Probably the best job I ever had was when I was dean because I  was close to students, I had this great association with the students that  I   m so proud of. Still a little bit with my graduate students, not much  there in the dean   s role. And then nationally I got involved, I don   t know  what happened, but even by my peers from University of Chicago and  all. They elected me to this small board of American Assembly of  Collegiate Schools of Business. I was on there with the dean of the  University of Chicago who later became under Secretary of State. The  associations I was exposed to throughout my life have just been  unbelievable. The Jim Webbs, the Stanley Drapers, the Bob Kamms and  the Larry Bogers. Nationally, meeting Harry Truman, spending time  with him. So many stories. But that   s enough. I   ve had a great ride. I   ve  been blessed, and I don   t mean that to sound corny, to be able to serve  Oklahoma State University.  What are some historical significant key events that stand out to you? I  mean we had a president that visited, President Nixon. Are there events  or things that you recall     Well I   ll never forget President Nixon   s visit because this was during a  very difficult period in our history. He was close to going out of office  43  and so forth. Bob Kamm called the vice presidents down; I   ll never  forget this as long as I live. He was sitting on one end of the room, the  south end, and I was sitting in the north end there around the room, we  sat around this coffee table. He said,    We   ve got the President coming,  and it   s going to be a big deal because there   s a lot of controversy. It   s  going to be tough. Displays and all.    He got up, walked around the table,  and he sat down on the arm of my chair and he said,    Dick, and I want  you to head this up.    I just dropped on the floor. I said,    What are you  saying?       Dick, I need you to head this up.    Well I headed it. And I  mean, I worked. I said,    Well one thing we   re going to do, this is going  to be an academic exercise. I   m going to try to pull it off without any  great problems.     I worked hard. My office turned into a war room up there. We had all  these people from the White House come in. All the planning, they were  up there. And I kept saying now,    This is going to be an academic  exercise. I   m going to have a place for the protestors to demonstrate, and  there   s going to be a place for the pros to demonstrate. We   re going to  keep them apart. We   re not going to have uniformed policemen running  all over the stadium. We   ll have plain clothes. We   re not going to have  signs. If someone comes up and has a protesting sign, we say,    This is  an academic exercise, would you please honor it.    We   re going to try to  do that all across the board.     I had local people say,    I want to take the crane, hang it up so we can put  a sign up We   re proud of you Nixon and show it for the stadium.    I  vetoed that. People got mad at me in town for that. I had all this  pressure. Then when we decided on the platform party, I said,    It   s  going to be academic.    The politicians out of Washington, D.C. said,     Well we want this politician up there, this politician, including Senator  Bellmon.    I said,    No, if they don   t belong up there they   re not going  up.       Well, we   ll see.    I even went to Henry Bellmon. I said,    Henry, I  need your support on this. I want this to be academic   I can make it  work I think if you   ll let me.    Henry backed me. The only people, I said  all the rest are going to sit up in the press box and Henry led the charge  to sit up there with the rest of them. It paid off. I had letters as I escorted  Nixon off   and I did say I don   t want any problems. We never had a  hitch. The demonstrations stayed. They honored the signs inside. People  responded to that. None of that pro stuff or anti stuff in the stadium. As  we walked off, the President turned to me and he said,    Well I hope I  didn   t say anything that embarrassed you. I know what you   ve done; you  did the right thing and I want to thank you.    I may not have been a big  supporter, but I   ll tell you, when you   re in the presence of the President  of the United States you   re   and I have a picture shaking hands with my  wife and the Belattis who helped me with all of this. That   s an event that  just had to stand out in my mind. Difficult. And later on the American  44  Gill  Poole  Association of University Professors wrote a paper and they said,    This  was well handled, there was no prejudice on either side.    I just had all of  those things. So I felt it was a success. Russ Conway helped me in that.  Ralph Hamilton helped me in that. So many people. And it did work out.  God, it was tough. I   ll never forget that, but it did work out. That one  really stands out.  What does it feel like to meet the President? To be in the presence of the  President of the United States?  For me as an old country boy, I am very humbled. I can talk big around  a lot of people, but you get in the presence of someone like that who is  such a strong personality and truly one of the most powerful people in  the world in terms of representing this great nation, and it   s humbling.  But I have to tell you this other story, if I   ve got a minute. When I was  looking after Mr. Webb   s building in Washington, D.C., Harry Truman,  of course whom Jim Webb had worked for, would come by the building  at the time. This was, of course, after he was out of the presidency. He  came by one day and we started visiting; wonderful man. I   d always  been a Truman   I hadn   t at first. I was for Dewey at first, and then I got  to know Truman. If you read McCullough   s book, you can   t help but say  what a great American   So he came in and we started visiting and he said,    Now you   re from  Oklahoma.    I said,    Yes, sir.    Boy I was even in awe of just being in the  presence of a past President  He said,    Well I   m going to tell you a  story. Now this is from the mayor of Kansas City. Mind you, I wouldn   t  tell this, but I   m just telling you what the mayor said.    He said,    We had  this football player. You   re an Oklahoma State man?    I said,    Yes.    He  said,    Not OU?    I said,    That   s right.    He said,    Well they had this  football player up there and he was great. The high school said you   ve  got to go up to Notre Dame, you can do everything. You kick, run, punt,  you   re a good defensive. Went to Notre Dame, it worked out. They were  just overwhelmed with him. The coach is walking off the field with him  and had his arm around him and he says,    Oh, we   re so proud. We   re  going to want you here. Oh by the way, you are Catholic aren   t you?     He said,    No, sir.       Oh.    Well he says,    I   m going to call my friend  down at SMU. You go down there.    So he went down there and went  through the same thing. He   s terrific  Walking off the field his arm  around he said,    By the way, you   re a Methodist aren   t you?    He said,     No sir.       Well, I   m going to send you over to Baylor. He   ll want to  look at you.    So he went over there and they were walking off the field  and this kid had all he can take. He   d just had been wiped out with this.  They were walking off the field and he said,    Now you are a Baptist  aren   t you?    He said,    No sir.    He just blurted it out when he raised that  question    I   m an SOB    hearing that same question. The guy said,    Oh   45  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  I   ll call OU, they   ll take you up there.    (Laughter)  Harry Truman?  Truman told me that story then he started laughing. He said,    Mind you,  I wouldn   t tell you that story, I   m just repeating what the mayor said.     So to me, that showed the humor of this down-to-earth guy. That   s one  of my cherished memories that the ex-President of the United States told  me.  Dick another story that you shared offline about the connection of Henry  G. Bennett, President of Oklahoma State University going to the Point  Four Program, heading up the International Technical assistants  Program. Jim Webb had some tie in there? Can you tell that story?  Well, Jim Webb was Undersecretary of State with Dean Atchison. They  identified and Senator Kerr thought that Henry would be the right guy to  go. So Jim Webb was the one that made the initial contact. In one of  these books you have a picture of Jim Webb leaning over talking to him  there. He was the one, I think, that called Henry G. Bennett at first or  one of his assistants and got on the line and got Henry Bennett to head  up the Point Four program. Now one of the assistants of Jim Webb told  me later he came down with him to be Vice President of the Republic  Supply Company. Jim came down as President. He said,    You know we  had guys going to Congress to testify about this program from Yale and  Harvard.    He said,    Some of the Congressmen didn   t like those snooty  guys.    He put it that way. He said,    We got Henry Bennett up here and  got him over to testify. He was such a gem.     Henry had a degree from Columbia University but he had that drawl. He  said the senators would raise a question about opposing something and  why and he said Henry would say,    Yes, Senator. Yes, Senator. I  understand, now I understand where you   re   but have you ever thought  about this side?    He said pretty soon he had those Congressmen eating  out of the palm of his hand and the Point Four Program sailed. They all  felt that when Henry got killed in the plane crash over in Iran that that  was a great loss. And as you know from the book you wrote about what  national commentators said about him, about what a great man. So he  had his ties back to the Truman Administration, Dean Atchison, and Jim  Webb of course. Then Webb came here and became very close friends  with his sons, all of his sons, and it was just a great tie there.  What do you hope people say about Dick Poole when they think back on  the nearly thirty-plus years at Oklahoma State University?  Boy I   you know that   s a hard question. I guess all of us have a little bit  46  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  of an ego or something. I wish they could say,    Dick really was  interested in young people and their education. He did want to create an  environment in which the faculty could perform admirably. He was  motivated even though he may not have always done it   on doing the  right thing. He was motivated to do the right thing for his alma mater  Oklahoma State University, that he wanted to do the right thing.    And I  hope they say in most cases, he did do the right thing. A lot of times  there will be things that they won   t know that I did, but that   s part of  life. But I hope they say where he gave it his best shot. I feel like it   s  certainly given me the best ride I could ever hope to have.  Final question, relating back to OSU that you love so much. How are  you feeling about Oklahoma State University and its    future? You  mentioned earlier that you feel very positive about the leadership under  Burns Hargis. Are there other things in terms of our growth? Are you  encouraged about where we   re going?  Yes. And I think the commitment is there. I   ve got to say a word about  the School of International Studies, even the current executive vice  president, provost. We   ve gotten to the stage where we say,    We want  our students to know how to operate in the world   s economy.    The long  run objective is for all of our students someday to have experience and  exchanges overseas so that we can deal   we live in a world economy. A  lot of people don   t want to face up to that. But even today   s economic  programs illustrate this, that we   re not an enclosed society anymore. We  can   t survive that way. So I see a bright future for OSU playing a  leadership role in helping this country continue to grow   I used to have  a speech on this   and become a self-renewing society. We have enough  knowledge to become a self-renewing society.  History tells you that every society rises and declines. We know enough  about the causes   and this is a whole other topic. We know enough  about the history of the rise and decline of nations to avoid decaying.  We can become a self-renewing society. The big question is, can we use  the knowledge that we have? Implementation. Implementation is so  difficult. Having good ideas, having knowledge, yes. But how do you  implement it? And that   s the big picture. I see a great future for OSU  playing a leadership role here, educating young men and women to be  on the world stage and be effective at it. So I believe in the continuation  of the land grant mission, just expanded to a world stage.  Is there anything we left out? We covered a lot of stuff.  I didn   t mean to ramble so much, but I   m just so proud of you Jerry. You  know I take a lot of pride in my students. I take pride in what you have  done for our Alma Mater.  47  Gill  Gill  Poole  The feeling is mutual. You were mentor, so thank you.  ------- End of November 21, 2008 interview -------  This is Jerry Gill. Today is January 12, 2009. I   m in Oklahoma City with  Dick Poole, former Vice President for Oklahoma State University. Dick,  this is actually the second interview we   ve done and I appreciate you  taking the time to visit with us again. He is a former Dean in the College  of Business Administration, Vice-President of University Relations and  Development   a long history with Oklahoma State University. A former  faculty member in the College of Business and Economics, as well.  I want to pick up on a subject that is intriguing to a lot of OSU people,  and that   s about our colors. There   s a lot of where did our colors come  from, logos and how do we developed that. There are some pretty good  stories here. Could you share some of the background with us and  maybe the process?  Well, Jerry that certainly brings back memories. For a long time there  was no set standard color for OSU. It was orange and black, but you  know there are lots of shades of orange. I remember there was a lot of  controversy over this. Some people wanted a burnt orange, some people  wanted a bright orange, and some people wanted other oranges. Finally  they said,    We   ve got to resolve this.    So the Alumni Association said,     We   ll do that. And we   ll have a vote among our membership and we   ll  give them three choices to kind of narrow it down.    When the vote came  in it was one-third, one-third, and one-third for the different colors that  were presented. There was no solution there.  So this went on for a while and people expressed concern. Finally the  Board of Regents went to the president and said,    Mr. President, we  want this thing resolved.    Well guess what, the president came to see me  and said,    Dick, I have an opportunity for you. I   d like for you to try and  resolve this issue.    I jokingly said thanks and I took the job on. But I  said,    This is a very controversial area.    It really is Jerry. A lot of people  don   t realize that because all of us have strong opinions. So I said,    If  I   m going to approach this, I   m going to do it very analytically. The first  thing I   m going to do is appoint a large committee and I   m going to have  representatives of Alumni on that. I   m going to have a Board  Representative on that committee. I   m going to have Faculty  representation on it and Athletic Department representation. All of the  people who have a vested interest in this.     Then I said I wanted to bring in an expert. So I went to one of the large  corporations in Oklahoma and got their vice president in charge of this  area of operations for communications and outreach and imagery. They  48  Gill  Poole  Gill  Poole  had conducted a big study that had cost them hundreds of thousands of  dollars. This person had brought to this meeting all that expertise on how  we would go about it. Well the committee met a number of times. One  place that there was a strong feeling for was the burnt orange which is  kind of like the University of Texas. We had one Regent in particular  that was very strong on this and he really wanted that burnt orange. And  then we had others on the athletic side, Myron Roderick, he wanted a  bright orange.  So we met and worked and first we set the stage by discussion. I brought  the system on colors and there   s what they call a Pantone Matching  System on Colors. I said we need to know what we   re talking about. We  went through these colors and we came up with some alternatives using  this Pantone Matching System. That way whatever we did select we  would have a benchmark of whether this met that standard. It   s what the  printers use in putting out publications.  Well we went through a lot of work. We listened to the experts from the  outside in business who talked to us. I remember we came to the point  where some people, even with the logo, the mascot, we had Pistol Pete,  and there were different images of Pistol Pete. Well, we worked on this,  and I would not take a minority vote. If we weren   t unanimous, we went  back to the drawing board. I had one person holding out for the burnt  orange. I truly think that person was being influenced by someone  outside the committee. But I know we all have a strong feelings and he  was trying to represent. I said we   re not leaving until we have an  agreement. But anyways, that   s how we took this task on and went and  developed it. Now if you want, I can pick up on where we go from there,  but you may have a question at this stage.  How long was the process Dick? How long did this take?  I would say   now my memory is getting hazy here. I would say this  probably took not more than four or five weeks once I got it going. I   m  talking from the time the board said we want something done to the time  we put the committee together. We had big meetings on campus. Then  we moved around, and took action to the Board of Regents which did  finally act on the committee   s recommendations on October 1984.  So Dick again how long did it take? You said four or five weeks?  About four or five weeks for the committee here being at work, hard at  work.
