Speaker 1: Now to our host, veteran PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] TV journalist, Ms. Gwen Ifill.
Speaker 2: Every once in a while when I'm walking down the street, especially in Washington [D.C.], and a little black girl will come up to me and say, I know you.  (Laughter)  She wants to talk to me.  She wants to touch me.  She wants to see basically, if I'm real.  Well, tonight, I am that little black girl, except that I'm in the presence of true greatness.  I get to find out whether Diahann Carroll talks, walks.  I get to touch her.  I get to see if she's real, and so do you.  And I have a little hint. Boy, is she ever.  She is a living legend.
Speaker 1: [Ms. Carroll singing "Everything's Coming Up Roses"] [Applause]
Story_ID: 4785
Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Diahann Carroll.  [Applause].
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you, thank you, how nice to see you.  [Applause] Thank you, thank you very much.  Thank you.  [Applause].
Speaker 1: Wow, that's very nice, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think you have some fans in the room.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's lovely.  It's a beautiful sound.
Speaker 2: Carol Diahann Johnson.
Speaker 1: Oh, my heavens (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, this is your original name.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You were born in Harlem.  Tell us about your growing up?
Speaker 1: Actually, it was almost fairytale.  I had two loving parents [Frank and Mabel Johnson], very, very involved with making me happy, trying to educate me and thirteen years later I had a sister.  But she really was like my doll, my play doll.  So I enjoyed that.  I learned a great deal about having a child in the house, a younger child in the house, that you allowed to live (audience laughter), and don't kill.  But really it was my parents, I will always be grateful for the support that they offered and, and the love and the care.  It was a very important time, of course, for all of us.  It always is, but when you have parents who tell you that the world is yours, that's pretty special.
Speaker 2: Was that where you had your first exposure, exposure to the arts, to music?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My mother felt that it was important for me to see what New York had to offer.  My mother was from North Carolina, and she felt that New York was a special place, that had all kinds of interesting levels of culture, and so she exposed me.  She was always about what is there that will encourage her, that will expose her to whatever it is that she may, may need.  It was, it was wonderful.  We had a ball.  We actually were pals.
Speaker 2: You had other strong women in your growing up.  Your grandmother, your aunt.
Speaker 1: Yes, my grandmother was five women in, in one.  She lost my grandfather when my mother was nine.  And had several boys and three girls.  And she raised all of them alone.  She had a cotton farm.  She also had hogs.
Speaker 2: Were you involved in picking any of that cotton?
Speaker 1: I tried.  Ah, I, I really tried.  My grandmother didn't want me to try, but I tried, and I picked thirteen cents worth of cotton (audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And she thought it was better not to ask you to do that again.
Speaker 1: No, but the, the thing about it, they never tell you this, but, you know, your hands bleed so easily when you're picking cotton, that I thought my, my grandmother was right.  I should stay on the porch and, and let it be done by others.  But that was a, it was a great experience.  I've always felt separated in so many ways, for so many reasons.  And when I think about the fact that my grandmother said to the members of the community where she lived, "My, my granddaughter is not going to do that."  I often thought, I've often questioned whether she was under the impression that she was protecting me or making me understand that I should reach higher.  She never made that clear, but I think I prefer to believe that she was just trying to make me feel that I should reach higher.  She was a very, very strong-willed woman.  She collected money in church that sent my mother to prep school.  And she didn't have the money to buy my mother a winter coat, but she insisted that she go to a place called Palmer Institute in the South.  You've heard of it, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, that's where she went.
Story_ID: 4786
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people who identify when you're telling the tale of a strong grandmother, someone who's strong in your life.  But somehow there's a, there--it's got to be a big leap involved in, in summer, spending summers in North Carolina and living in Harlem and all of a sudden graduating to your first job in JET magazine, which we know, of course, is punching the ticket, JET magazine.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Yes, my first photo, Mr. [John H.] Johnson allowed me to begin to work in his publications, Ebony, Tan [Confessions], JET.  And there was a wonderful woman in New York by the name of Ophelia DeVore who helped prepare me for--.
Speaker 1: But still, that was your first, big effort.  You were actually modeling.  You were modeling what?
Speaker 2: Well, I modeled everything, really, but I do remember, and I know you've heard me say, my father [Frank Johnson] was not--he didn't really approve of this.  Modeling was not, not an occupation for a lady, not a good, Southern Baptist lady, and I think my first, on my first shoot, I modeled lingerie.  And my father saw the pictures, and I was--there was a big hoop thing that went under our clothes at that time that made our skirts, and my father was furious, absolutely furious.
Speaker 1: It doesn't sound like it was that much of you showing.
Speaker 2: No, it was--.
Speaker 1: That wasn't the point.
Speaker 2: --I mean according to today, I, I was fully dressed (audience laughter); very strict, you know.  You don't pluck your eyebrows.  You shouldn't really wear lipstick.  And that was the atmosphere at home.  Later when I grew older, I realized that that's how most parents at that time treated their children.
Speaker 1: Did you find yourself doing what we all do, which is treating our children the way we thought was ridiculous when we were children?
Speaker 2: I have to confess.  I was pretty--I moved a step further.  I was not as bad as the Southern Baptist, ooh, that was strict.  But, but yes, I was kind of very serious, what went on in our home and how, how I wanted to see this young lady develop, my daughter [Suzanne Kay].
Story_ID: 4787
Speaker 1: As we speak tonight, we're gonna roll some clips of your entertainment career, cause I think it pushes buttons, probably not only for you, but certainly for the rest of us.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Your first big break was--it made American Idol look like nothing.  Think back cause the older people in the room will remember this.  It was--.
Speaker 2: Thanks a lot, Gwen.
Speaker 1: --American Idol (audience laughter), oops, oops.  No, I, I mean the more mature.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: It was American Idol before American Idol was cool.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Let's take a look.
Speaker 2: [MUSIC CLIP]
Speaker 1: Things began to skyrocket for young Diahann when she tried out for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1951.  Diahann was invited back to Godfrey's radio show for three weeks straight.  During her freshman year at NYU [New York University] Diahann tried out for 'Chance of a Lifetime,' where she captured the hearts and minds of audience members for three weeks in a row, winning her a three thousand dollar cash prize and a week's engagement at the Latin Quarter Night Club.  That was just the break she was looking for.  Diahann was now immersed within the topsy-turvy world of show business.  Constantly working, she soon found that she had no time for her studies.  So she dropped out of NYU where she was attending college.  Although she went out on audiences regularly, many casting directors counted her out as soon as they saw that she was black.  Things began to change when nineteen year old Diahann read for the part of Carmen in Otto Preminger's 1954 film production of 'Carmen Jones.'  Although the role of Carmen ultimately went to Dorothy Dandridge, Diahann made such an impression on Preminger that she was cast alongside Pearl Bailey as one of Carmen's thrill-seeking sidekicks.  A star was truly born.
Speaker 2: I look at myself sometimes in photographs, and I think what was I thinking? (audience laughter)  Who was I?
Speaker 1: And we haven't even gotten to the fashion in 'Julia' yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, yes, that's coming.
Speaker 1: How much did you earn for your first gig?
Speaker 2: My first modeling, that was my first gig, was modeling.  And I brought home a check for six hundred dollars for the day's work.  My father [Frank Johnson] didn't like that.  My father was a very interesting man (laughter).
Speaker 1: It sounds like it.
Speaker 2: He didn't like that and all of this business about, well, you know, it was not exactly lady-like and it looked almost sinful.  And I said, yes, dad, but I got paid well.  (audience laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You got paid at all.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 4788
Speaker 1: But that clip raised many interesting questions, including what it must have been like to be a beautiful black woman in the 1950s trying to break into the entertainment business.  Clearly, you were before your time.
Speaker 2: I will not argue with that.  I really will not.  It was very difficult.  There were so many avenues that I had to cross, and I was dealing with people who had never dealt with a black person, much less a black person in show business, and a demanding black person.  I was most assuredly clear about how I wanted to look, what I wanted to say, what roles were correct for me.  And there are people who had great difficulty with that.  But I knew each time that I had the support of these two parents [Frank and Mabel Johnson].  My father placed a round-trip airline ticket from Los Angeles to New York, and he said, that's to be used any time you are uncomfortable.  That was a wonderful gift.
Speaker 1: People ask me a lot, is it--do you feel affected by sexism or by racism or which is the bigger ill in your life?
Speaker 2: They're both pretty bad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In the '50s [1950s] though, how much of the reaction to you was that you were someone who knew what you wanted, and you were demanding or, you know, whatever words they used for demanding women, especially black women--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how much of it was that you were just simply black?
Speaker 2: It was such a combination of the two.  And I was also clear.  If I was in the presence of someone, we were having a meeting, and I realized that what was taking place was not what was really taking place, that it was something else, and the meeting was a guise to get me there for whatever, I always said, you know, my parents drive me to all of my meetings.  And they're always waiting downstairs in the car.  And on several occasions, I was told, well, that's not necessary.  You know, we can send you home in a car.  I says, well, they're not gonna leave.  They don't leave.  They just don't leave (audience laughter).  And I found that that was very important for me to be able to say that at the moment that it was uncomfortable for everyone, the one who was approaching in an inappropriate manner, and, and for me.  It was great safety in that.  Yes, it was hard in the '50s [1950s] because sexually we were all so naïve, and a black woman represented something that you tried to--you could feel it everywhere, tried to capture because at that time, our information about each other was that black women were different.
Speaker 1: Exotic.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, just to be--I mean you don't marry them, but you certainly pursue them.  It's an excitement.  It's a very--it was ridiculous.  (audience laughter).  And it was truly ridiculous.  But it became, as we moved along and we became more of an integrated society, and something like television, wonderful television introduced us to each other in different ways, so we had, we had different responses because of exposure to each other.  It was amazing to me, as I moved out into the community, to find out how many people didn't know anything about me at all, not my parents, not my family, not my, not my community, not anything.  And I used to say to them, don't you even know somebody that cleans your house that's black?  You have never seen a black person?  I mean find a way to relate to me.  I had to do that very often working with writers and, and producers.  And look at me, I am what I am.  I'm not, I'm not pretending.  I'm not pretending.  I don't know what your pre--you know, conception, what you thought, but this is who I am.  Let's work with it.
Story_ID: 4789
Speaker 1: Let's talk about who you became.  And why did you change your name?
Speaker 2: I changed my name because when I was in school a friend of mine approached me.  Her name was Elisa, Elisa Oppenheimer (ph.), and she wanted us to go on the Arthur Godfrey [Talent Scouts] show.  And as we started rehearsing and making plans, we decided that the name Oppenheimer and Johnson was really not (chuckle) too pretty.  (audience laughter)  (Laughter) So, she called me that night when she went home, and she said, I'm gonna be Lisa Collins.  I said, okay.  And she says, I'd like you to be Diahann Carroll.  Now, that's one of the first times in my life that I didn't stop to consider in a more profound way that I might be stuck with this name for the rest of my life (audience laughter).  So, I said that's fine.  They were very happy to see us, two little girls from school.  And she played 'Tenderly' and I sang 'Tenderly'.  They accepted me, and I was on the Arthur Godfrey Show for a while, but really the truth of it is, Arthur Godfrey thought my mother [Mabel Johnson] was so pretty, he was insisting that I come back on the show.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Really.
Speaker 2: Yes, it had much more to do with that than anything (audience laughter).
Story_ID: 4790
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'Carmen Jones.'
Speaker 2: 'Carmen Jones,' I really did not want to audition for 'Carmen Jones'.  My parents' [Frank and Mabel Johnson] influence was really greater than you can ever imagine.  And she was a tart, but thank heavens, I had an agent who said, if you can get the role of this tart, I want you to take it.  But I was much too young to, to really understand--.
Speaker 1: Well, how old were you by then?
Speaker 2: Oh, what, nineteen, twenty--we'll go back, we'll count when we have a lot of time (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I was very happy to be there because the working, the atmosphere, the experience of being there with 'Carmen Jones' was--first of all, Dorothy [Dandridge] was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life.  She was very sweet, and, and Harry [Belafonte] was, was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, of course, you're talking about Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  And working there I asked for permission from Otto Preminger if I could sit near him, by the camera so that I could see and hear what he was saying and doing, and why.  And he liked that.  So we became friends, and every day, he'd say, String Bean.  (audience laughter)  At that time, I weighed about a hundred nineteen, a hundred and twenty pounds, and I was this big.  But he was encouraging, what do you--why do you want to sit here?  Why, why would you like to see what I'm doing?  I said, I don't know.  I don't anything about directors.  I don't know what it is.  I want to, I want to find out.  So the curiosity was enough for him to form a friendship.
Speaker 1: So you're nineteen years old or twenty years old, you begin to meet, to hang out with people whose names are now legends, Sammy Davis, Jr., Marlon Brando, what was that like?  Did you ever feel overwhelmed?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, it was very, very heady stuff.  And I thought the best thing for me to do was to be quiet, to listen, to learn.
Speaker 1: Well, how'd you meet Marlon Brando?  Tell us about him?
Speaker 2: Marlon Brando was in Los Angeles shooting, I don't know what, but Sammy Davis always had parties.  Sammy had a party every day (audience laughter).  Sammy had Wednesday parties and (audience laughter) Friday evening parties.  And everyone eventually walked through Sammy's accommodations.  I thought I said that nicely.  (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Very nicely.
Speaker 2: And, and Sammy said to me, there's someone I want you to meet.  And he took me through, went into the library over there, and there was Marlon.  And I had such admiration for him, and I told him how it was wonderful to watch his films over and over because there was so much that we'd never seen before on screen.  And Sammy was going to have this wonderful romance.  He was a matchmaker, matchmaker, but after that evening, Marlon did a wonderful thing.  He sent me a box of books about acting, singing, directing and with a little note, "Dearest Diahann:  Go home".
Speaker 1: Which meant?
Speaker 2: He wanted me to leave California, go back to New York and start working in the theater.  And I call that a friend.
Story_ID: 4791
Speaker 1: Not long after that, you came--got your first Tony nomination for 'House of Flowers' and then came 'Porgy and Bess'.  Let's watch a clip.
Speaker 2: In 1954, Diahann landed the role of Ottilie in Truman Capote's play 'House of Flowers'.  She was nominated for her first Tony Award for her portrayal of the young West Indian woman who continues to remain virtuous despite living within seedy bordello.  During 'House of Flowers' Diahann met her future husband, Monte Kay, a Brooklyn-born Jewish casting director with a passion for jazz.  After settling into the married life, Diahann was offered to play the role of Clara in Samuel Goldwyn's movie version of 'Porgy and Bess'.  Feeling initial apprehensions about the part, Diahann's husband, Monte, convinced her to seize the moment and take it.  In 1958, during production, Diahann met Sidney Portier.  The two were drawn to one another, despite the fact that they were both married.  She tried to avoid Sidney Portier after the birth of Suzanne Patricia Ottilie Kay, but deep inside herself, she knew that she would eventually leave Monte.  In 1960, she was offered the role of Connie Lampson in 'Paris Blues'.  When she found out she would be playing opposite Sidney Portier--.
Speaker 1: [Portier]. I would say that you're one of them socially conscious chicks, right?  [Carroll] Home to me is home, and my family is my family, and whatever problems they've got, I've got 'em too.
Speaker 2: Diahann was now faced with a tough decision: betray her husband or betray her heart.
Speaker 1: Now, Diahann, you know I'm a straight up ahead news person, right? (audience laughter) [Applause].  And it's only because the audience is demanding this--.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) and (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --that I have to ask you about Sidney.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm delighted to have you ask me about Sidney because I'm happy to say to everyone, we are still friends.  We have maintained our friendship.  My child knows his two daughters, by his last marriage.  And I think he--even some of, some of the children from the previous marriage.  It was so long ago that I only have--I've, I've maintained the memories that are good.  He's a splendid human being.  He's a wonderful actor.  He is a good, thoughtful person when you have to talk something through that you're not really certain which direction to go.  Sidney's the one to call.  And I'm proud of that.
Story_ID: 4792
Speaker 1: Tell me about 'Paris Blues'.
Speaker 2: Well, it was difficult because I had a new baby [Suzanne Patricia Ottilie Kay] .  And we were there shooting.  I think Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward were going through what Sidney Portier and I were going through.  It was amazing.  We, we just couldn't believe that the four of us had (chuckle) landed in this movie, while Paul's trying to free himself from so on and so forth, and Sidney's trying to free himself from so--and Joanne and I trying--anyway, we became friends.  (audience laughter).  We didn't have any choice (laughter).  We wanted to know how did you handle it; what did you say, what did you do?  But it was, it was great because Joanne is a great actress, and watching was very important for me.  She understood the camera.  She understood how to work the camera, which is a special kind of art.  And I just loved being there.  It was, it was uncomfortable, of course, from time to time, but it had not developed into anything that either one of us couldn't handle.  So it was lovely being a part of 'Paris Blues'.  It was a growing time in Paris, with dear friends and a good script, Duke Ellington's music, a fine director, Martin Ritt, and he forced us to--I don't like directors who don't make you do the work, but he did.  He made us do the work.  So actually, it was a lovely time.
Speaker 1: We're all going to rent that tonight.  (audience laughter).
Story_ID: 4793
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your husband, Monte Kay.  You married a white man in the '50s [1950s], and I have to say, that seems bold now.  What was it like or did it help or hurt or have any affect on your professional life to be a part of an interracial couple?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I have interesting feelings about that period of time because Monte Kay loved the sun lamp.
Speaker 1: Which means?
Speaker 2: That he was almost beige.  (audience laughter)  And I have a dear friend whose name is Josephine Premice, and I called her, and I said, oh, he's a very nice man, and so on and so forth, and he was a casting director, and I think he's coming back next week.  And we were on the road with a show called the 'House of Flowers'.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she said, I just want to make sure your parents [Frank and Mabel Johnson] know that he's white.  I said, what?  Where is he white?  (audience laughter)  She said (laughter), I've known Monte for many years, and so on and so forth, and so I called Monte, and I said, I don't know if mom and dad--I don't really know how they're gonna--he said, ask them to forgive me for being white.
Speaker 1: Did they?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Monte was an extraordinary man.  He was a wonderful, wonderful man.  I'm so happy I had my child [Suzanne Patricia Ottilie Kay] with Monte Kay.
Story_ID: 4794
Speaker 1: You then went on to star and get your very big--first big professional triumph in Richard Rogers's 'No Strings', amazing musical.  Let's look, watch a little bit of that part of your life.
Speaker 2: [MUSIC CLIP]
Speaker 1: In 1962, Diahann finally won the Tony Award for her role as Barbara Woodruff in Richard Rogers' Broadway sensation, 'No Strings'.  In 1967, she met with writer-producer Hal Kanter about playing the role of Julia, a sitcom that he was developing about a young, widowed single mother working as a nurse in the aerospace industry.
Speaker 2: [FILM CLIP] [Julia] Now what.  [Corey] Can't you leave now, mom?  [Julia] There is nothing sissy about a mother taking her son to a party.  [Corey] Oh, ma.  [Julia]  And there's also nothing sissy about looking your best.  If I do say so myself, you're a pretty sharp-looking fella.
Speaker 1: 'Julia' aired in September of 1968 and was a controversial hit.  By October of 1968, the show was rated number one.  In 1970, Diahann won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Series.  Despite this, no new acting roles came her way, and she began to feel the fire of working on a controversial hit TV show.  While on hiatus from 'Julia', Diahann met British television host, David Frost.  The two hit it off, and David invited her to New York for an appearance on his talk show.
Speaker 2: [FILM CLIP]:  (Clip of Ms. Carroll singing)
Speaker 1: At the end of that season, Diahann opted not to renew her contract and asked to be released from 'Julia'.  In 1974, Diahann was offered to play the lead in the film 'Claudine' after Diana Sands collapsed on the set.  Two weeks later, Diana Sands died of terminal cancer.  Diahann now devoted all of her time and energy to playing the role of 'Claudine'.
Speaker 2: [FILM CLIP OF MOVIE 'Claudine']
Speaker 1: Her efforts were rewarded because in 1976, Diahann received word that she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.  (audience applause)
Story_ID: 4795
Speaker 1: Let's talk about 'Julia' cause that's when I fell in love with you.
Speaker 2: Oh.  It's good to hear that.
Speaker 1: I mean, come on, you were the kind of role model that made little black girls, as I was talking about--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --just completed riveted and a lot of little white girls too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did 'Julia' come about?
Speaker 2: Actually, there was a friend of mine connected to NBC.  His name was David Tebit and he was in charge really of, of casting.  So I flew to California to meet Hal Kanter.  And Hal was sitting in the, in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills [Hotel] with the representative from Twentieth Century Fox and NBC.  And he said, I'm telling you this is not gonna work.  This woman wears beaded dresses and so on and so forth.  And I walked in the door, Polo Lounge, and, and Hal said, you see, if she could look more like the housewife, like that, that's, that's what we're looking for.  And the producer said, well, thank God, because that's her.  (audience laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And he said, I've seen her look like that.  So we went, and we started talking.  I liked him immediately.  I really liked him.  I knew that Hal really wanted to do something, and I felt he was going to try.  What he was not prepared for was the confrontation, but he rode it well.  And we both came out champions because there was so much he didn't know about the--I said, I can't say that, Hal.  I mean a little white girl could say that, but I can't say that.  Why?  I said, well, let's go to your office, and we'll talk, and I'll explain it to you (whispering) because you don't know nothing about black people (laughter) (audience laughter).  So let's go sit down and have a talk about it.  And we did on so many occasions.  And people expected to hear lamps being thrown and so on, but we never did.  I said, if I'm wrong, you tell me, but don't dismiss me.
Speaker 1: People don't remember now, perhaps, what a big deal 'Julia' was at the time.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Julia' made everybody angry.  The black community was angry.  The white community was angry--.
Speaker 1: Wait, back up.  Why was the black community angry?
Speaker 2: Because it wasn't telling it like it is. (audience chuckle)  I got that a lot.  And I said, well, it's very close to the way I was brought up, very close.  My mother's [Mabel Johnson] a nurse, and the other was, you know, who do we think we are, Hal and I, who do we think we are, reaching into something that, untested waters, and we've overstepped our bounds.  With all the criticism, I must say, I ended up in the hospital.  I lost an awful lot of weight, and I was just, you know, we call it today, stress.  But we call everything stress today (audience laughter).  But that was truly stress.
Speaker 1: Are you surprised even all these years later that it is still, in many ways, your recognizable role for so many people?
Speaker 2: No, because it really was memorable.  It really did make a difference.  When you can affect the financial area because then the studio had to pay attention to the fact that this made money.  This attracted sponsors.  And then when the community, for the most part, is very pleased with what you're doing, and it involves a black woman as the star, it was a memorable moment.  We were all--the audience as well as those of us who were creating it, were very aware that we were doing something that was important.  I realized it as we started shooting.  I didn't realize it when I left New York, I have to tell you.
Speaker 1: In the end, you walked away from it.  Why?
Speaker 2: I as about to die.  I was so tired.
Story_ID: 4796
Speaker 1: 'Claudine', now, it wasn't until I just saw that clip that I forgot about that Gladys Knight and the Pips song that was at the opening of the movie--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But I remember everything else about it.  How did that come about?  Now, that was also completely against type or whatever the type you were supposed to be.
Speaker 2: Well, I never had a type in my head.  I just wanted to do the work.  I loved acting, I loved singing, and I thought if you can manage to look attractive while you're doing both, the audience will let you into their home, allow you to be there.  There was a young woman assigned to do 'Claudine'.  She had worked for years to produce 'Claudine'.  Her name is Diana Sands.  We'd gone to elementary school together.  I brought her on to--I brought her to do 'Julia'.  We did many segments together.  Two weeks after she went into rehearsal, they, they discovered, you know, that she cancer.  She knew she had cancer when she went into it, but she really wanted to try to get through this film because she had worked so hard, put it together.  And when I learned that she said to them, please send for Diahann Carroll.  And they went to her, and they said, are you nuts?  You know, she can't do this.  I mean she's--her gowns are gonna cost seven dollars and seventeen cents.  She's going to play a welfare mother.  And she said, she can play anything, send for her.  Two days after I arrived, she died.  It was interesting to me, once again, from a racial point of view, because there was a cliché in the mind of those that were putting this package together, that a welfare mother looked a certain way, behaved a certain way, and had a certain temperament.  And I said, that's just not true.  Everybody can fall on hard times.  That doesn't mean at some point in her life she didn't think that she would have something more glorious in life.  It turned out this way.
Speaker 1: So you were able to open people's eyes about what a woman who is on welfare looks like or is supposed to be like?
Speaker 2: She can look like her, I mean my mother [Mabel Johnson] and father [Frank Johnson] had rooming houses.  I saw people who looked like everything, you know.  They came through, and I, I didn't have clichés in my head like that.  Some of the prettiest women I've ever seen in my life were welfare women, and not all stupid, you know.  They were really just--it wasn't working, life wasn't working for them.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, I have to go back to the dish for a minute.  David Frost.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah? (audience laughter)
Speaker 2: Once again, you know, I've been fort--very fortunate.
Speaker 1: Yes, you have.  (audience laughter)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I would not disagree.
Speaker 2: But, but I'm saying that because I've been fortunate that I've been involved with intelligent men, and men that had a sense of purpose.  I may have gone off track once or so, but for the most part, I'm very proud of my relationships.  I'm very happy that I had them.  David was brilliant.
Speaker 1: You didn't seem at all alike.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I'm watching in an armchair.  What do I know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right (audience laughter).  Well, we, we liked so many things, the same things.
Speaker 1: You were quite a power couple, though there for a while, but you never got married.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I, I--he should have--I said, you need to have children.  You want children.  I don't want children.  I have a child [Suzanne Patricia Ottilie Kay].  And I love her to death, and I think you really need someone--he said, you have my baby".  I said, well, no.  (audience laughter)  But we had so much fun together.  I'm, I really want everyone to understand that.  This was not a fake relationship.  We really had a good time.
Speaker 1: But you did marry again?
Speaker 2: I did.  You, you know, you'll ask me that all evening.  Yes, I did (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You just have to keep track.  Robert [DeLeon]?
Speaker 2: DeLeon.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: From Chicago.  And once again, brilliant.  I think he was in college when he was fourteen.  And it stimulated all of the--and I've--also, he lied.  He lied about his age (chuckle).  And I thought he--.
Speaker 1: How much younger was he?
Speaker 2: About fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Ooh.
Speaker 2: About fifteen years.  And I, I--anyone who knew Robert will tell you that he was really an old person.  He had a great mind, and very, very, very manipulative.  I found out later how, how much younger he was.  But I want to just admit something here.  Getting married, obviously, was not the most important thing in my life.  You don't do it four times if you've given the proper thought (audience laughter), the proper examination (chuckle) of what it means to be married.  You don't do it four times.  I was doing what I thought people do.  They get married, and they, they try to make it work as best they can, but I didn't get the information about marriage is really all about until later in life.

Speaker 1: Now, of course, I'm one of these people who believes that everything you do in life prepares you for what you're about to do next.  And everything you've told us about so far, I think, in some ways prepared you for the role of Dominique Deveraux--.
Speaker 2: I think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: --in 'Dynasty'.  How did you get that role?
Speaker 2: I realized that these things were on the air at night.  They, they were just silly.  They were absolutely silly.  But everybody was having such a good time (audience chuckle).
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: 'Dallas' and 'Falcons Crest' and 'Dynasty' and all, a lot ado about nothing, you know (audience laughter).  And I said, well, that's for me because (audience laughter)--.
Speaker 1: These people are pretending like they didn't actually watch this (audience laughter), but we know they did.
Speaker 2: Sure you did.  It was fun.  Why not watch it?  And so I was talking to my manager, and I said, would you please tell Aaron Spelling that I want to be on 'Dynasty'.  And he said, okay, what else would you like to say?  I said, I think it's time for them to have the first black--the b, the b-word--.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) and (audience laughter), rhymes with?
Speaker 2: Itch.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --on television.  And Aaron loved it.  And what they asked, how do you see this woman?  And I said, I, what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to write this role and keep it in mind that you're writing for a rich, white man.  Forget all about me.  I'll come in at the end, and--but I think you must write for--because that's, first of all, that's your forte.  That's what you do well.  And if you trying to accommodate the color of my skin and the dah dah dah dah, we're gonna have nothing.
Speaker 1: People were gonna figure out you were black anyway.
Speaker 2: Anyway, you know, I have that way--when I walk on camera, I look very black.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But they said, we'll try it.  We'll, we'll see how it works.  And it worked.
Story_ID: 4799
Speaker 1: You always are doing this.  But you kept tapping into all these new audiences, and I, and I find it interesting it cause I, one of my favorite roles that you played, which--you know, you had to blink or miss it, but you were on 'A Different World'.  You played Whitley Gilbert's mother [Marion Gilbert], perfect casting, opposite Patty LaBelle, who played Dwayne Wayne's mom.
Speaker 2: How do you remember all these--.
Speaker 1: I know it all (audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But I, I want to know how that happened?
Speaker 2: Oh, my niece was executive producer of 'A Different World'.  And so I was very aware of it, and she called and told me that she thought this was very important.  I said, please, this is for kids.  This, this show is not--she said, no, not really.  She said, I think you're going to love it, and I think we'll introduce you two.  And I said, ah, those are the words I wanted to hear.  I think you may be right about that.  So, it worked immediately.  We--Whitley was most assuredly my daughter.  There (audience laughter), there was (laughter) no doubt about that.
Speaker 1: This is the role played by Jasmine Guy, everybody will remember.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And then I, I did one or two episodes with Patty.  And it was always fun to be on the set, but I want to tell you something very important about 'A Different World'.  'A Different World' was Diahann Carroll's first experience walking on the lot and I saw the space that was reserved for 'A Different World'.  It was a real space on that lot.  It wasn't a make-shift.  It wasn't, we're gonna be here for two weeks or thirteen weeks and the show was off the air.  It was theirs.  They owned it.  All of the young people working on the show had their cars and their homes and a job that they knew they were coming back to the following season.  They were secure.  I don't even think I was positively pleased about how secure they were because I didn't feel that they understood what it took for that to happen because I had never seen it.  Those children had heard my name.  They didn't know the bricks I had to lay and the walls I had to kick down and, so that they were there.
Speaker 1: They weren't even particularly aware they had walked through the doors you had opened.
Speaker 2: They really were not.  Some of them were, but most of them were not.  And as I stayed, and I watched them at the end of the first episode, I said to them, I want to speak to all of you for just a moment.  And I told them they'd given me my first experience in all my years of seeing a black show, a show about black people that had a real, not make-believe, a real place on that lot, and that they had their homes and their children and their cars.  And they were really working actors in Hollywood.  I'd never been around it.  And I know a couple of them were saying, why?  What do you mean?  How is--I said, we weren't even welcome on the lot when we did 'Porgy and Bess' or 'Carmen Jones'.  Everybody on the lot knew we were just there for a matter of--put up with them, you know, they'll be gone soon.  But that's not the way it felt when I did 'A Different World'.  I was so grateful to have that experience.
Speaker 1: Well, so were we.  You probably don't do this, cause you're living your life, but if you watch your life, and the way it's gone, it's interesting how you keep taking these leaps into different directions that shock us a little bit.  To me, one of your most shockingly successful roles was in 'Eve's Bayou'--.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --which I loved your role [Elzora].  You were not yourself.  I didn't know that was you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know what I'm talking about?  Did you see it?  You should rent it.  (audience laughter)  Why did you do this small, independent film?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had to do this small, independent film.  Look at the people who were involved, Samuel L. Jackson, Lynn Whitfield and Debbi Morgan.  Yes, I wanted to do it.  I wanted to see what they're doing.  I wanted to be a part.  You know, you have to stay in there, in the business in order to know where you are going to make your next leap.

Speaker 1: 'Having Our Say: [The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years].'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were, you were noble in that play.  In fact, it was a play that completely--it's almost, everything comes full circle.  When we talk about your grandmother, and we talk about the kinds of lessons that she taught you, these women in this play were saying that same sort of thing, except to a broader audience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there you were.
Speaker 2: They were these extraordinary women as you know, and I, I think I was one hundred and three.  The role [Sadie Delany] was, of course, important to me because of a woman coming out of the South, these women, with an education.  And one of them became, I think my character became either a dentist or--but they were professional women.  They didn't marry.  They were married to--that's what I'm saying to you about myself.  They understood that they were married to their lives.  They were married to progress.  They were married to moving on.  And, and they lived together until the day they died.  They were extraordinary.

Speaker 1: But during this whole period, your singing career, you never stopped singing, even now.  You never stopped singing.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was that, to you, always the backbone?  Was it the fallback?  Was it your reason for being?
Speaker 2: Well, Gwen, you know, you, you never, you never sell the grocery store (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Excuse me (laughter).
Speaker 2: Always hold on to the grocery store or the candy store or whatever it may be that put your foot in the door.  And I think in the last few years I've come to the conclusion that maybe at this age, I should back away a little bit, but I love to sing.
Speaker 1: But why would you?
Speaker 2: Why would I back away?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, Gwen, you do know that I'm going to be seventy years old, right? (audience applause)
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  That's not an answer.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  You may think it's not answer.  You wait until you get there.  And also, I'm a grandma, so you--it's, your priorities change.  You know, I love it, and I don't want to let go completely, but I certainly don't want to work, work the way I used to work.  It was--and the body makes you pay (audience chuckle) for, for, you know, my gowns this big, and even when I became this big, I put myself in a gown that was this big.  And that's not the healthiest thing to do.  So, down the road, sometimes you have to pay a price for that.

Speaker 1: In 1998, you were diagnosed with breast cancer.  I don't think a lot of people realize that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of a impact did that have on you?
Speaker 2: Oomph.  There's no one that ever wants to hear, you have cancer.  It changes everything around you at that moment, at the very moment that you hear it, and you recognize that the doctor is actually speaking to you.  I learned about my cancer on the telephone.  It's surreal, you know, am I really standing here?  Am I really talking--is this real?  And then he, he said a kind thing.  He said, you're very fortunate because it's, you're in the early stages.  And that's why I started speaking around the country because I wanted everyone to understand, I get a mammogram every year.  And during that period, I started getting a mammogram more--mammograms more frequently.  But it's a very lonely place, very lonely.  In my situation, people who are in show business, I know lots of women in show business who've had breast cancer.  They don't talk about it.  It affects your salability.
Speaker 1: So why did you decide to talk about it?
Speaker 2: I thought it would be helpful.  I thought that women would look at me and say, she's out of it.  She went through it, she lived through it, and she's out of it.  And it would be not so horrendous.  You can, you can, if you take care of yourself, and you are the kind of person that believes in having your mammogram.  Early detection means everything.  You know that, you--I've sure you've heard, and I wouldn't be sitting here without early detection.
Speaker 1: And you are cancer free today?
Speaker 2: I am cancer free today, thank God.  (audience applause)

Speaker 1: In 2001, we were all sitting at home rooting for Halle Berry, watching the Oscars, and when she won, she had that amazingly emotional tribute to the mothers who had gone before, basically, to you, among others.  Where were you?  Were you watching that?  Did you fall off your chair?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I did.  I fell out of my chair.  There's so many people who never think about the fact that Dorothy [Dandridge] was nominated and I was nominated, and we just, it's not important because we, we know it's a part of bigger package of unhappiness.  You know, it's a part of a package that says, damn, are they ever going to acknowledge us in these areas that make, make such a difference in the way you are allowed to enjoy your career and enjoy your, your artistic something that God gave you that you want to go on and, and explore it wherever you possibly can.  So you put those things out of the way.  They're just too much to handle.  You don't--I don't believe in dealing with too much pain.  You know, just a bit, enough to keep me, my feet on the ground.  But other than that, I don't want to know about too much pain, and too much discomfort and unhappiness.  So I was shocked when this beautiful little girl stood there and said, and thank you, Dorothy Dandridge and Diahann Carroll.  I thought look at that, she did her homework (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (audience laughter).  It must have--did you ever get a chance to talk to her about it about it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did, what did you say to her?
Speaker 2: I told her how deeply touched I was.  And that I was glad that I loved her before, because now I really loved her (laughter).  Halle looks up to people who've been around for a long time, and I, and I appreciate that about Halle.

Speaker 1: And how much has changed in the business since you got into it?
Speaker 2: Oh, the business has changed incredibly.  The culture has changed.  People, I mean our values have changed.  It's not, not the world that I recognize.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: We've become so immersed in the actor that makes twenty million dollars a movie that, that there are practically no films worth watching, spending time in the theater.  And I don't know how television has spiraled down to this condition that, that we have at this time, but I do understand it.  I just don't like the answers I come with.  I come up with the answers that we're watching something called 'Idol' or whatever, whatever it's called.  Oh, the reality shows.
Speaker 1: 'American Idol,' 'Survivor,' all of that stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.  But, you know, if we just examine it for a moment, it's the most sensible way for the producer to make a living, cause he doesn't have to pay any actors.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: He doesn't have to have a set, and he will lull us even further into a non-thinking people, and while he gets richer doing it, you know.  So there's too much of that on television.  That's what television is basically today.

Speaker 1: Before we end tonight, I do want to bring us back to where we began.  I was talking about how little black girls see women like you, women like me.  So a little black girl comes up to you and says, oh, Ms. Carroll, I really want to do what you did.  I want to be a star.  What do you say to her?
Speaker 2: First, I, I always say, I don't give advice.  I don't know what to tell you because I don't know you.  I, what information can I give you?  I can't.  And the next thing I say is if you want to be an actor, move to New York City (audience laughter).  Don't go to Los Angeles.  They have a machine out there, it makes little blonde girls, with long stringy hair, and they have wonderful careers.  And you don't fit into that thing.  When they get ready for you, if you are prepared and you've worked in the areas that I have great respect for, in the theater, go home.  That's what Marlon Brando told me.
Speaker 1: That's what he said to you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So go to L.A., use it for what it's worth--.
Speaker 2: And get out of there.
Speaker 1: But use New York to learn the craft.
Speaker 2: And live.
Speaker 1: And you're really, you're really done?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter), I don't think so.
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  (audience applause).

Speaker 2: Oh, I feel the same way.  Do you realize if you weren't on the air, we wouldn't have any news.  Everything is just show business (audience applause).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (audience applause).  Okay, it's all downhill from here for me.  Thank you all very much, and thank you so much, Diahann Carroll.
Speaker 2: I have to say, I thank you for accepting to be here, to be bothered with me for this hour.
Speaker 1: Thank you (laughter) (audience applause).
