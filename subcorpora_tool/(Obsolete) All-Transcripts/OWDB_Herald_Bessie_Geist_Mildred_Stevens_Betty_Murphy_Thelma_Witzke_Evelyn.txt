 Kite  Lemons  Stevens  Murphy  Lemons  Stevens  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  Witzke  Herald  Lemons  We   re at Bessie Herald   s house in Hooker, Oklahoma. It   s April 11, 2001.  We   ll go ahead and start over here with you. We   ll have everyone say your  name, when you were born, and where. That   ll be your identifier on the tape.  Betty Stevens, I was born in 1924 in a dugout four and a half miles east of  Tyrone.  Do you want our maiden name too?  If you want to give it to us.  Mine was Seward.  I   m Thelma Howell Murphy, and I was born in Pratt County, Kansas. I came  here when I was nine months old. I was born in 1916.  I   m Mildred Howell Geist, and I was born five miles south of Tyrone in 1918.  It   s my understanding that I was born in a granary  laughter .  I think you were.  They were building a house and didn   t have it quit ready.  That   s what we lived in was a granary.  We are going to come back to that in a second once everyone is introduced.  I   m Evelyn Herald Witzke, and I was born February 3, 1929 in my  grandmother   s house here in Hooker, Oklahoma.  I   m Bessie Hampsten Herald. I was born three miles north and two and a half  miles west of Hooker, April 20, 1907, when Oklahoma became a state.  You must have been one of the first ones.  5  Herald  Lemons  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Lemons  Geist  Lemons  Stevens  Lemons  Stevens  Murphy  My younger brother said I wasn   t American, because I wasn   t born in the  United States.  We usually like to start really general and have people tell us about a typical  day or the house where they lived, but I think we   re going to start with being  born in a granary  laughter . How long were you guys living in the granary?  Let   s see, you came out in    17?     16.     16, and I was born in    18. Let   s see, you were nine months old when you  came out in    16.  Well, it was probably 1917 when we came, because I was born in 1916.  See, there   s 18 months difference in us. That granary is still there, and my  brother Bob lives on the place now. I told him that I wouldn   t want to go clean  out that granary  laughter . It   s got gobs of stuff in it.  Mementos.  Yes, souvenirs. Of course, the folks were in the process of building the house.  I   m not just for sure. I was showing Thelma today that I had the book. Dad  used to keep a journal. I looked it up and got the year that I was born when we  went through the estate. All he put down on my birthday, which is the busiest  time of the year in June, was Mildred Alice Howell, born such and such June  the sixteenth, cut wheat.  At least they had time to write it down.  Yeah, dad wrote it down. We really had good parents.  So I can tell that you guys grew up on a rural setting, on a farm. What about  you? What was your house like when you were little?  Well, I was born in a dugout, and my mother died when I was five, so we  moved across the line into Oklahoma. I was born in Kansas, but we moved  across the road. I lived with my grandparents. It was just my grandparents  and my dad and I. I have four older siblings, but there   s 13 years difference.  My dad worked on the WPA to help us get through the thirties. My mother  died in 1930, so it was just the start of the depression.  What did your dad do for the WPA?  He took his horses and Fresno and helped build roads.  So did Ray.  6  Stevens  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Stevens  Geist  Witzke  Lemons  Geist  Herald  Geist  Lemons  Herald  Murphy  Lemons  Herald  He helped build the fence around the fairground at Liberal. It   s still standing.  The Second Street road is what he worked on.  I often thought we were the beginning of the WPA, because when I was a  freshman in high school, we started the soup kitchen for the school. The home  economics class served the soup.  We cooked the meal.  We cooked soup everyday for the whole school. What was real interesting,  after I graduated from high school, they hired men that worked for the WPA to  cook the soup.  I remember that. I was over here in the third grade. We had potato soup  running out our ears.  It took me a long time to like soup again. People would send in chickens and  things. Sometimes we had to dress them. Once in a while they   d dress them  and send them in. One day, we always made two great big pots, and this one  kettle just kept boiling over and boiling over. We noticed that the bowls kept  coming back nearly full. When we got down to the bottom of the pot that day,  there was a bar of soap in the bottom  laughter .  No wonder it boiled over.  No wonder nobody wanted to eat it.  Anyway, it took me a long time to like soup.  It was healthy anyway  laughter .  With that lye in it, it wasn   t a good soup day.  What was the house where you were raised like?  Well, my father came in June in 1905 and built a two-room house with an attic  upstairs. Then the family didn   t come until December. They brought an  immigrant car from Illinois. My mother   s sister and parents all came in  December. My grandparents and aunt and uncle and two boys, and there were  two children with my grandparents too, lived in a tent here in Hooker that  winter until they got a house. How eight people could live in a tent and keep  warm in the wintertime, I don   t know.  They probably were huddled a lot.  Yeah, stick together.  They had their beds to keep warm in, I guess. My mother was alone when I  was born, except the older children were upstairs. It was at night, and my  7  Lemons  Geist  Lemons  Geist  Herald  Lemons  Witzke  Lemons  Geist  father had hooked the horses up to go get the neighbor woman to help. I  arrived before they did. Mama thought my crying would wake the other  children up, but I guess I didn   t. Anyway, I survived. We did live there until  my brother; three years later than me, but then it was a dry year. My father  had plenty of moisture to grow things in Illinois, but he traded our homestead,  sight unseen, for eighty acres at West Plains, Missouri. We moved down there  by train. They raised vegetables and fruits, but he decided by December that it  wasn   t the place, and then came to Woodward County. He bought land down  there. We were gone from here for two years. We left in March and came  back in March 1913. I   ve got pictures of us in our covered wagon. It took us  seven days to come from Woodward County to here. There were seven  children and a mother and father. We had two wagons, the covered wagon and  the wagon with other household things. We brought a cow and chickens, and  we had milk everyday. We had some eggs. I don   t know how well they did in  that coop. I wasn   t quite six when we came those seven days.  That   s a long trip for a six-year-old.  My husband   s parents came to this area and homesteaded in 1903. That was  the time the Murphy   s came, wasn   t it? About 1903? They homesteaded  about three miles from where I live now. So our family goes back quite a  ways.  And you said that you can see the place you were born from where you live  now.  Yes, where I was raised. My brother lives there now. It   s about four miles,  but out in my front yard I can see the trees.  Well there isn   t anything where I was born. A long time ago, they just did  away with it. It   s good farm ground.  And you were born here in Hooker? And you said the house is still here?  Yes. My folks, we lived ten miles out, and I took the first year in high school  at an unaccredited eight-month school. I didn   t get a credit for it, but he  bought that place there. It joins the Church of Christ up here, just north.  That   s where I went to high school from. My folks paid the taxes on the  vacant lot south of there. When we got to have the church building, my folks  gave that land to the Church of Christ. That   s the only church home I   ve had.  When we were out on the homestead we just met in our homes. It was three  couples from Illinois.  Well let   s fast-forward to the 1930   s. In those days of depression, maybe  before the dust storms actually started, what was a typical day like in your  house? You   d get up every morning, and what would you have to do? What  was the normal procedure everyday?  She washed dishes, and I dried.  8  Murphy  Herald  Murphy  Herald  Geist  Herald  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Kite  Geist  Murphy  Stevens  We always had cattle, so in the evenings we milked.  Didn   t you of a morning too?  Dad did it in the morning.  I remember one time in the morning, we were milking about 16 cows, I was  going to see how many I could milk before breakfast.  I wasn   t that ambitious, Bessie, in the morning.  Well I didn   t keep it up.  Dad always did it in the morning, but we did it in the evening because he   d be  out in the field. At our house, breakfast was an important meal. It   s always  been an important meal at our house, because we feel like it   s a good way to  start the day. My dad and his father came out here. He mentioned two or  three times when we went out to Liberal, then he mentioned that we went out  to Hooker. Then we went to Tyrone. I   m going to go back and read it because  they mentioned an old car I   ve never heard of. They did that for a couple of  years. Then he wrote that he closed the deal.  That   s when he bought the homestead.  That   s when he bought the homestead and he talked about Mr. Macanerny.  When I was nine-months-old, they brought everything they had and came out.  In the mean time, I   m sure he built this granary that we lived in until we built  the house. We all lived in the house that they built all of our lives.  In fact, that   s where I was married, was in the house.  Well I was too.  Yeah, we both had home weddings.  We both had home weddings in the house where we lived all of our lives.  You were married and then you moved?  Four miles away  laughter .  I   m a little farther away. Mildred and I both go to the same church, so we see  each other once a week. She plays the piano and I play the organ for church  all the time. From the dust bowl days, I first remember    27 when they had the  crash, the stock market crash. I just remember how panicked people were.  People talk now about being so poor, but we didn   t ever consider ourselves  poor because everybody else was in the same boat except the bankers.  The stock market crash was in    29.  9  Geist  Murphy  Herald  Murphy  Herald  Murphy  Geist  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Murphy  Herald  Geist  Murphy  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Murphy  Geist  Herald  But things started in    27.  About that time, wheat was 29 cents a bushel.  25  cents  it seems like.  Yeah, at one time it was.  And milo 25 a hundred.  And a dozen eggs didn   t bring a dime, maybe.  I think it mentions in this little book that I gave you that it was about ten or  fifteen cents.  Do you all remember the one on March 17, 1923?  I think that was the time that we were in the cellar and we heard this noise.  It hit about four o   clock in the afternoon. It was a nice day. It got below zero  by Sunday morning.  That was the time we went to the cellar, because dad had built a concrete storm  cellar right by our house.  It seemed like the end of the world.  We heard this strange noise, and we thought that it might be a tornado. We  looked out, and one of the guys that lived south of us had driven his mules and  had them standing on top of the cellar  laughter . This is when Arlene   s  brother was killed in the tornado at Liberal.  The tornado in Liberal wasn   t then.  It was in    30.  It was during the dust bowl days though. I don   t remember this    23.  It was just a balmy afternoon.  It was black, black.  It rolled in from the north.  We were in town and went home.  Yeah, and we beat it home.  I think there are pictures.  10  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Herald  Witzke  Herald  Witzke  Herald  Kite  Witzke  Geist  Murphy  Herald  Geist  Lemons  It started coming fast and furious after that, especially in the thirties.  You could see it covering up things as it came. That bad Sunday   s the one that  I remember.  In April.  April 14, 1935. My husband was at the rabbit drive. He was out at the high  school. He   d just got a new leather jacket. He started running through cars  trying to find the one he had come in, and he ran up against a barbwire fence  and tore his jacket. He fell down and the rabbits crawled over him.  Rabbits thrived in that time. They just ate everything, so they had rabbit  drives.  First it was the coyotes. I remember when I was small. They killed them, and  then the rabbits came. They had to kill them because they were eating the  crops.   Narrators look at pictures   We had lots of different ones. That one in March of    23was like that. It was  on Saturday. We lived ten miles out.  We had been to town.  He and the boys had come to town to get our weeks supply.  Of course, you always went to town on Saturday.  Mama and we girls and they younger brothers were home. Mama had lots of  chickens, and it came up so quick that it blew them and their wings out. Then  it snowed and got below zero before the next day.  And that was in March that it got below zero?  Uh-huh, 1923.  Well, that   s not unusual for the panhandle.  A blizzard can come. During the dust bowl, or in that area, there was a school  bus that got caught in one of these storms. The children froze to death.  That was in    31, I think.  I was going to say it was either    30 or    31.  Well, I had heard people talk about rabbit drives and Black Sunday, but I   ve  never heard of a rabbit drive on Black Sunday.  11  Geist  Herald  Geist  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Witzke  Murphy  Herald  Kite  Herald  Geist  Stevens  Lemons  Stevens  It was so funny because Ray   s mother and some of the other people thought  God was punishing them for doing that on Sunday.  I was there. My baby was a year old, but I had her in my arms and couldn   t  see her.  Betty, that was up northwest of Tyrone.  It was west of our house.  Did you know how they   d do it? They all line up in a big long line with clubs  in their hands. They   d drive them into a fence.  It was brutal.  It was pretty dangerous because they could hit other people. Then they would  haul these rabbits off. Somebody bought them, didn   t they?  Daddy hung them in the chicken house. The chickens would clean them to the  bone.  That particular Sunday, I had gone with someone to a polo game down here at  Hooker. When we saw that coming, we started home. We didn   t get home,  but we stopped at the first house that we came to and went in their house.  They weren   t at home, but we went in there anyway just to get out of the  storm.   Herald shares photos  That   s what my husband and me in 1923. That   s our  first son and the first garden I had.  That is some kind of garden. Did you grow these or just buy them to set  around  laughter ?  I grew them right back here. When we bought the land in January, before he  was born in May. The sand was piled up in the fruit trees and the grape arbor.  He had to use horses. We were farming with horses and mules then. He used  Fresno and scooped it around until finally, it got leveled. I couldn   t have a  garden until he was two-years-old.  There are still some fences that are piled up from those days.  My husband told me all about how they   d build fences. The next day they   d  come out and it   d be covered up. Then they   d have to build another fence on  top of that. Then both fences would be covered up.  Can you see them?  You know where they   re at. Those banks in the wintertime, when it would  snow and freeze, that made nice places to ride your bicycle or have you horse  12  Witzke  Murphy  Lemons  Murphy  Geist  Lemons  Herald  Lemons  Geist  Lemons  Stevens  Geist  pull you on a sled. Our sled was the hood of a car that the horse pulled. My  folks never did have a tractor they did all the farming with horses.  I remember the day John Deere came out to show how rubber tires would pull  better than the lugs. They didn   t used to have rubber on their tires. They just  had lugs.  Do you know what a lug is?  I   m guessing it   s a tube thing.  It was iron, and they were about this wide. They had a point. They were  rough. They used to start these tractors with a big wheel on the side.  I think that was called the arm breaker  laughter .  For a good reason I guess   The first tractor we got was when she was a year old. Her daddy wanted a  picture of Ernest and her. He had them sitting on the hood of the car. When  we got the pictures back, he said I did get it in there. He kept moving around  because he wanted to get that tractor in the background. That was his first  tractor.  He was being sneaky.  I   ve noticed some of my old family pictures, especially each of our parents,  about once a year they lined everything they had up outside and had a picture.  They had the windmill and maybe the horse and then them and whatever child  was in the highchair and their vehicle out on their homestead.  You said that your family didn   t have a tractor and used horses; did you ever  drive the team in the field?  No, I was just about six. The dust bowl was more of an inconvenience for me.  I liked to play the organ. We lived in one or two rooms and shut off the front  room, and the organ was in there. I would go in there and try and get all that  dust off. My grandmother was always saying,    Betty, don   t make so much  dust. Don   t get the dust all stirred up.    I wanted to play the organ. It   s more  of an inconvenience for me. I didn   t worry about money because we never  went to town much. I had more trouble going to school. I had to go different  places. I went to Liberal one year. I came here one year, to Tyrone. Other  than that, I had a good time catching tadpoles.  The year I graduated high school, Thelma was a freshman at Panhandle State.  She had a job working at school, but there wasn   t enough money for both of us  to go. Dad said,    If you help me, maybe next year you can go to college.     That fall, we did have a milo crop. We used the horses and the wagon, and I  helped him hand pick maize. That   s not an easy job. You developed a very  13  Lemons  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Herald  Lemons  Geist  Murphy  Stevens  Murphy  Lemons  Murphy  Stevens  Geist  Murphy  good arm.  So how does it work?  You have a good sharp knife.  It   s curved. They call it a hooknose.  The milo then had a crooked neck. It would catch on your glove.  Yeah, then you   d grab a hold of the head and whack it off. You   d get three or  four heads of maize, and then wham it at the barge. I did that when I was in  high school.  Our first crop was in    25. We had a few acres of milo, and the wind came  from the north and blew half of it down. Then the next time, it came from the  south and put it down across.  What is Pioneer Queen?  It   s for Pioneer Day at Guymon.  You all would enjoy coming to that. They have a coffee early in the morning  for old timers. That would be a place where you could pick up some  information. It   s the first Saturday in May.  One thing I was going to mention was how we put tape around all of our  windows to keep the dust out, and always set the table with the plates upside  down over the silverware. We put wet sheets over the windows.  Our houses really weren   t that tight.  I was thinking about this, our folks always saw that we did everything. We  played basketball all the time. On the way home, the static electricity was so  bad that you couldn   t see very far in front of the radiator, and the car just died.  We just had to sit there for a while until the charge went out and it started  again.  Did it scare you?  Well, no. It wasn   t the first time it   d happened. It was an inconvenience.  They learned how to ground it down.  Yeah, you drug a chain behind your car, and that kind of got rid of the static  electricity.  You could see the sparks.  14  Geist  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Lemons  Witzke  Stevens  Lemons  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Herald  Geist  Of course we didn   t have paved roads either.  Did you crank your car?  No, we had a starter.  I remember the Stevens had one that cranked; well my dad, too.  We didn   t have a car until 1915, and lived way out in the country. To go to  town or anyplace you   d go in a wagon. You would put comforters down and  the kids would sit on them.  I hated herding the cows in ditches where the weeds would grow more than  anything. We ate, what was it? Lamb   s quarter.  Well and some of them canned the Russian Thistles too.  The WPA gave us meat too. We had meat and prunes  laughter .  You   re trying to tell us a story, I can tell.  I was talking about the bad thirty years. I went to a one-room schoolhouse,  and there was one girl there that could come to school with a bologna  sandwich. I had a steak sandwich or a sausage sandwich. I traded with her  every once in a while, because I thought that was great to have a bologna  sandwich  laughter .  On that line, my grandmother, we lived a fourth of a mile from the neighbors,  and I liked to go up there and play with a girl. It was the Smiths. My  grandmother always had meat and good gravy, but they had made white gravy.  It   s just flour and milk, I think. I liked that better than I did grandma   s. They  couldn   t understand why I always liked to go up there for their gravy.  What was your favorite food? What would be a real treat food?  Probably the first fried chicken every spring.  And the new potatoes.  If you didn   t get your potatoes planted by March the seventeenth, it was  terrible.  I remember my little brother saying, when he knew that the peas were coming  along he said,    We can soon say pass the peas, please.     One thing about it, I don   t think we ever realized how hungry some people  were going. I always think about a story that the lady that owned the bakery in  Tyrone was telling us. A few years ago she had lunch with us at my house.  She was telling about a family that lived in Tyrone. I think there were five  15  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Murphy  Lemons  Murphy  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Witzke  youngsters in the family and the mother and dad. This particular lady, Mary  Acton, she owned the bakery. She said that she   d made it a policy in the  thirties, at the end of the day she sacked up all of the food that was left on the  counter, the bread. She sent word to four different families in Tyrone to send a  child by every evening, so that she could give them the left over bread. She  said this particular evening, this little boy came bouncing in and said,    I   ll tell  you Ms. Acton, this has been the best day.    She said,    Tell me about it.    He  said,    Well, this morning when I was going to school, the coal train had come  in and they were unloading coal. They dropped several chunks of coal along  the railroad track. I ran home and got a bucket and got enough coal to keep us  warm for a few days. When I was coming home this evening, they were  unloading potatoes and they broke a sack and there were several big potatoes  laying along the rail. I picked them up, and now you   ve got some bread for us.  We   ve got coal and potatoes and bread, and it   s been a good day.    What   s  nice about this boy, he is a retired Baptist minister now, living in California.  We could hardly keep from crying. This was in the thirties. We never were, I  guess we didn   t know we were supposed to be hungry.  My sister raised a garden, and one time she had a lot of lettuce. She would  take that in to her brother-in-law, and that   s all they had was just bread and  that wilted lettuce.  We ate jackrabbits.  I liked them.  People would have what they called rabbit fry   s. They   d use a big Dutch oven.  Remember Paul Cherry was just such a good cook. He would cook a lot and  build a fire outdoors. He   d cook it outside, and it was just crispy and good.  It sounds like a community event.  It was, and so were butcherings. Yes, because several families would get  together and butcher their hogs. Some would render the lard and some would  cut it. Dad always did all of that stuff, but he also seasoned it. They   d cut it  and cure it and put it in our cellar.  I think everybody did that, don   t you Bessie?  I think so. My oldest grandson has this big hog operation here with a hundred  sows at the fair twice a year. He bred them up to where he gets champions all  the time. When they butchered together, they   d boast when they got the lard  rendered who had the most lard.  Dad had mentioned taking his and selling part of it, because it was more than  he could use.  That   s how we sealed when we cooked the pork. We   d seal it with the lard,  and it was like it was canned in big crops.  16  Herald  Geist  Herald  Geist  Herald  Murphy  Lemons  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  Geist  Kite  Geist  Herald  Murphy  Herald  We   d fry the sausage down where it was fresh, and then pour lard over it.  I often think about the year that H.F. and I were married. We were married in  1937. All of our income, he was in farming with his dad, but we didn   t have  any crops, so really our weekly income was our cream check.  Eggs, I had eggs.  Well, just getting married, we didn   t have any eggs. That was about  8 a  week.  I remember the first winter we were married. We had some cows to milk and  on Friday night we   d churn the cream and make butter and bring it to town to  buy some groceries with.  The first year I went to college, I had a dollar for spending a week.  So what did you do for fun on a dollar a week?  Oh, you could do a lot with a dollar.  Well, nobody had a car. There was just one car from Tyrone that went to  school. I don   t know, we just didn   t know, we had a good time.  So what were you doing?  I was in an acapella choir and in a quartet, so we got to go on trips. And we  liked each other; we all had a good time.  I don   t know whether I ought to tell this or not, Thelma.  Well maybe you better.  This must be a good one.  When we were kids, since Thelma   s the oldest, Dad gave her a dime. He said  now make sure and give Mildred a nickel of this. She put it in her mouth and  swung at school and swallowed it. So guess who never got her nickel   I wouldn   t go looking for that.  She didn   t get it either.  And they still get along sitting close together.  This winter, we have two trips planned. We   re going paddle wheel boating.  Of course I   m 15 years older than Geneva, but we still do things together.  17  Stevens  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  Herald  Geist  Stevens  Witzke  Stevens  Herald  Witzke  Herald  Witzke  Murphy  Geist  What   s your other trip?  To New York and Connecticut and New England foliage.  And we   ve been to England and Scotland.  So, we have a good time.  What about you other guys? Not waiting for nickels, I guess.  I remember they had penny ribbon. Ribbon you could buy for a penny a yard.  I had a penny to spend to buy a ribbon to make my doll clothes. Some other  girl got that ribbon, and I told Mama that I was sad about it. She explained to  me that she shouldn   t have stolen it. I resigned myself that I didn   t have that  yard of penny ribbon for my doll clothes.  Isn   t it odd now, a child won   t even pick a penny up if they see it on the street?  I still do that.  See a penny, pick it up, all day long, have good luck.  We used to go to town on Saturday, that was our one day, and we   d park in a  vacant lot. People would come by and visit my grandmother. They had a  bakery right behind us, and a restaurant right beside us. You could get  hamburgers for a dime and a grape pop for a nickel. The bread wasn   t sliced,  so my dad would get a loaf of that bread, and then we   d go home at night and  he   d milk the old cow. He   d have hot milk and that bread  laughter . It  doesn   t sound so good now, does it?  Our refrigerator was a water trough and then the well. We   d put the milk in.  Sometimes in August, it   d be so quiet there wouldn   t be any fresh water  pumped, and our morning   s milk would be sour by evening.  I remember the great big old whiskey barrel for the windmill. We   d hang our  jars of milk. That was in the dirty thirties.  He welded it himself, a trough. It was just the right size to set our milk  containers in and run out of our water barrel into that, and then on out to the  stock tanks.  We were too far out in the country to have an iceman come by and bring ice or  anything, so we didn   t have the ice box.  One of my mother   s sisters had this strange thing that she could make ice. Do  you remember Aunt Rubie?  Yes.  18  Murphy  Kite  Stevens  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Kite  Murphy  Kite  Murphy  Kite  Herald  Geist  Witzke  Murphy  Geist  It had two things like this, I don   t know what it was, but she would heat one of  them. It had a coil up to the other one, and she heat this one. It made ice some  way. I have no idea what it was. They lived on a ranch south of Protection,  Kansas.  Do you all remember getting your first refrigerator?  Oh, it was a highlight.  That was us too.  The first one we had had a burner, and once in a while, if it wasn   t quit right,  it   d smoke up the house.  I remember H.F.   s dad, he was rather frugal, he thought that that was being  extravagant to buy this. We bought it to keep our oldest child   s milk cold. He  thought at the first time we were kind of splurging, but we got it anyway, a  Servel.  We had carbide lights. Have you ever heard of those?  Oh yeah. Did you have a big tank?  A big tank outside. When we had our house wired, they used those old carbide  lines.  How long would you have to charge up that big tank with carbide?  When I first lived there, I was just a young bride, so I didn   t pay much  attention. I don   t know, because it was a big tank and it set down in the  ground like that. It would last three or four months, I really don   t know.  You said you had that too.  No, grandma and grandpa did, and you would drop water in it. The kind we  had was a six-volt wind charger. Then we got the thirty-two. It was 1950  before we got rural electric.  I think my thing that when they came through, of course they came to Baker is  the reason I got electricity, I think it was in the early forties. They had to go  up by our house to get to Baker, so I got modernized earlier.  That carbide, whenever it was used, it dried and us kids would use it to write  on grandma   s cellar doors like chalk.  But it made pretty good light, a lot better than a coal oil lamp. How many of  you smoked your house with an Aladdin Lamp?  I felt pretty bad when ours were stolen. We had them stored on the back porch  19  Witzke  Lemons  Witzke  Kite  Geist  Murphy  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Kite  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Herald  Geist  Lemons  Geist  Murphy  because they were pretty lamps, but somebody came in on our back porch and  stole them.  If we had homework to do, we needed to do it before it got dark.  So you could see what you were doing, huh.  Just a little coal oil number two burner sitting by the table.  What   s an Aladdin Lamp?  It had a wick, and it had a mantle.  The first time I remember playing basketball at Optima, they had gasoline  lamps hanging up in the top of this old barn gym for lights. That was a fire  hazard.  We   ve still got a gas lantern, a Coleman.  I had a gasoline stove.  It   s a wonder you   re still here  laughter    It was dangerous.  You always hear of buildings catching on fire back then, and now you know  why.  I also remember back in the thirties, we had a    barn burner.     Somebody was burning barns.  They burned our barns. Our barn was burned. There were eight barns within  about a two-week area. We decided later on, they said it was because the Ku  Klux Klan was trying to come in and most of the people would not go with the  Ku Klux Klan.  Do you remember anything about the Ku Klux here in Hooker?  I remember when Dad came home one day, and he said,    They were after me  to join again today and I told them no.    It wasn   t very long until our barn was  burned.  When was this?  This was in the late twenties? Bob was a baby. He   s eight years younger than  I am, so it was about    32 or    33.  I wasn   t in high school yet, I don   t think.  20  Geist  Stevens  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Lemons  Herald  Kite  Herald  Kite  Stevens  Lemons  Witzke  Herald  Geist  Murphy  We had just come home from a school function.  I   d always heard that about the Ku Klux Klan, but I didn   t believe it.  But Dad, I remember him coming home. Our barn and Laswell   s and Myers   ,  it was about eight of them. They were all big barns.  Great big nice barns, two-story barns.  Then the Oddfellows came back in, and we have pictures of them helping  rebuild it.  They rebuilt it real quick.  In a couple weeks. It was necessary to have a barn for your hay and your  cattle.  What have you got that you   re holding onto over there?  It   s a letter written in 1872. My father was born at Winfield, Kansas. They  had come there to Winfield, Kansas, and his father was killing a buffalo  because they were building a railroad. This is my father and mother when they  were married in 1898.  This is a letter from your father?  From my grandfather when he was born. He was born June 17, 1872. My  grandmother and grandfather both wrote this letter.  So this is a letter from your grandfather and grandmother telling his parents  that they had a kid.  In there, he says that he thinks that the women have been eating too much  buffalo meat because they   d been having a lot of babies  laughter .  Speaking of getting mail, what about people who left Hooker whenever the  dust storms got bad and crops were bad and went to California? Did you  know anybody who left?  Yes, my husband   s family moved to California then. They took what they  could, and when they got to California they wouldn   t let them take in the  mattress on top of their car. They had to leave it, and that was the only  mattress that they had with them.  Did they think they   d bring some germs to them?  I don   t think there was anybody around us.  Pruitts.  21  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Geist  Lemons  Geist  Kite  Geist  Witzke  Murphy  Witzke  Murphy  Witzke  Stevens  Herald  Oh that   s right, there was a family.  A family that lived just about a mile or two from the Murphy house.  West of Tyrone.  That family went, Pruitts.  Pruitts.  Mary and Charles Pruitt were in my class when we graduated from eighth  grade, and then they moved before I graduated from high school.  Otherwise, I don   t think there were very many as far as our immediate area.  Did you keep in contact with those people?  They come back once in a while, to Alumni and things like that.  They come back from California?  I don   t know if any of them are still alive now or not.  My husband   s parents came back after a while. These were the Witzkes that  came back.  Are they the Liberal Witzkes?  Yes, first cousins.  Okay because I see their name in the paper quite often.  There were a whole bunch of Witzkes from around Turpin.  Don   t you think the reason a lot of them didn   t leave is because they couldn   t  leave? They didn   t have money to go. My folks filed on their land. Our    28  Dodge wouldn   t have got us very far  laughter .  We just toughed it out. August of    33 had been a dry year. My mother   s aunt  was moving to Missouri. My husband fixed a car chassis and fixed a bed on it.  We took her things to Missouri, close to Springfield. We left here on Saturday  morning, it was showering a little, and it took us a day to get down there. I  feel sure we drove through. We left early in the morning. We went and  visited an uncle and aunt just over the line into Arkansas. We were gone a  week. We had that empty trailer and we went to Arkansas and got it full of  apples  laughter . That was in the last of August. When we got home, it had  come twelve inches of rain on our farm that day. We   d left the neighbors to  look after things. The sow had had a bunch of pigs on the Fourth of July. She  quit giving milk, so I fed those pigs by hand with cow milk. They drank out of  22  Witzke  Herald  Stevens  Witzke  Stevens  Herald  Geist  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Witzke  Herald  Witzke  Geist  Murphy  Stevens  a pan. I saved most of them. The bigger hogs were in a pen, and the water got  eight inches deep in the house. Our house was the lowest spot all around.  After that, daddy got John Deere blocks and jacked the house up and put those  blocks underneath. I don   t remember how many he had to get.  Well, it was a 28 X 28 house.  What do you mean by John Deere blocks? What were they?  What the pistons and the motor are in of the John Deere motor. And then later  when he could afford it he put a real foundation in.  Do you remember when it started raining how we all ran out and stuck our  head up in the air like a bunch of birds  laughter ?  It wasn   t stormy, but this was a cloud burst. It fell in an hour or so. The big  hogs were in the fence. We had a hog wire fence, and the neighbors that were  looking after things cut the wires because the hogs couldn   t swim. These pigs  that I fed by hand were up around the house. We had drooping boards in the  chicken house, and they were floating up, but those pigs had got on our back  step to the house. It was fastened to the house, and it floated up. It saved  every one of those pigs in that flood. That was in    33 during the dust bowl.  Truth be known, it probably didn   t rain five miles from there.  Not very much anyway.  We   d see the clouds rolling in and think; oh we   re going to have rain. No rain.  That   s how it was. Sometimes there   d be clouds overhead and it   d thunder and  lightning, but there wasn   t any rain.  Daddy built us a shower on the south side of the well house, which was away  from the road where you couldn   t see.  You could hide when you took your bath.  He took a big old oil drum thing and filled it full of water; we could do that  with a hose. Along toward evening, it   d be good and warm. Then we had a  bucket with holes in it, and we   d go out there and take a shower  laughter .  I always remember, this would have been in the twenties when we still had a  range, since Thelma and I were the oldest; we always got to take the bath first  in the tub behind the stove and then the boys later, because they were dirtier   And you used the same water.  Nowadays, they wouldn   t, they   d turn up their nose.  23  Geist  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Murphy  Stevens  Murphy  Lemons  Geist  Lemons  Stevens  Geist  Stevens  Herald  Stevens  Geist  Herald  Murphy  A few years ago, my one grandson spent the summer with me, and I couldn   t  understand why my electric bill was so high. They asked me if I   d had  company, and I said yes, I   d had a grandson. She asked if he liked to shower,  and I said, continually. That made my electric bill go up.  The Saturday night ritual was everybody taking a bath. One time we got the  itch. It was after my kids were born. Five kids, and we got the itch. I felt so  bad. Dr. Cawley said don   t feel bad about that, I had it three times when I was  in the service. We had to take baths and then put stuff on and then take baths  again to get it all off. If that wasn   t a chore.  Did you know which kid brought the itch home?  No, I don   t even know where it came from  laughter . Bruce didn   t get it, but  the kids and I did.  When I taught, it was a ritual that kids had to lay their hands out like this, in  case somebody had it. That way we could treat them before they gave it to  everybody else.  Could you tell by looking at the hands?  They   d get it right in here first. That   s where you usually get it first.  I noticed that we crossed some railroad tracks when we came in, and I  wondered if any of you remembered any tramps or hobos riding express that  would drive by?  We   d generally see them coming about a half a mile before they got there.  Mother would feed them sometimes.  Did you ever have them do any work around the farm?  Yes they did.  I don   t think so.  Help fix the fence or chop wood.  But you know Hooker had a law that black people couldn   t     So did Goodwell.  It   s probably still on the books, that they couldn   t stay overnight.  Did you see the Hooker paper giving the population a few weeks ago? I  believe it said that there were three or four black ones now.  Black families lived in Tyrone for a long time.  24  Herald  Lemons  Witzke  Lemons  Witzke  Murphy  Geist  Herald  Murphy  Herald  Murphy  Witzke  Murphy  Geist  Murphy  Lemons  There   s several Spanish. I read in the Guymon paper that there were 2,100  school children in Guymon and 1,000 of them were Spanish.  What about gypsies?  I remember seeing them.  What did they look like?  They usually had longer hair and colorful clothing, lots of beads.  Big touring cars. Ray, he graduated from Hooker, and he said that one time  they knew they were coming, so they got high school kids to go down and be  in all the stores so they could keep an eye out because they stole stuff.  They say that some of these people that come through, even now, are  descendants of the gypsies. They   ll come through and offer to black top your  driveways and other things. They say they   re organized. I had one just the  other day that drove in and wanted to black top my driveway. He said that  they had ordered out 180 tons of asphalt for Guymon. I said,    Well you   re  about 35 miles from Guymon, you should have used the rest of it down there.     He said they just used 120 tons.  I got calls all the time wanting to have double windows in the house.  You were talking about people riding the trains, when Ray graduated from  high school, about the first or second year he was out of high school, he and a  friend rode the trains to the World   s Fair at Chicago. Everybody rode the  trains.  In the boxcar.  He said that the bums that rode the train all the time would tell you when  they   d stop where to get off because the cops will be up in a block or two and  then walk and catch it on the other side of this town. They   d also tell them  where they could find a cow that they could milk or who had a garden.  That   s why you could have a good time on a dollar  laughter    I still have a letter that he wrote to his mom, telling her that they were staying  at a hotel, and it was right over the trolley tracks, how the trolley went by their  window, what they could get there for a whole breakfast   for a dollar, they  could get eggs and coffee and bacon.  Didn   t he and somebody also go to California that way?  He worked in California for a couple of years.  What did he do in California?  25  Murphy  Witzke  Murphy  Herald  Stevens  Geist  Lemons  Stevens  Herald  Geist  Lemons  Herald  Stevens  Geist  Stevens  Murphy  Geist  Stevens  Geist  Mainly, he worked on a chicken ranch. They sold eggs all over the world.  That   s what my father-in-law did when they went to California. They worked  at a dairy.  He also worked at a sugar place. He hated that, because it was so hot. What  he had to do was just awful, so he didn   t like that at all.  My husband had a flock of white rock chickens, and sold eggs for a hatchery at  Dodge City. He   d come to Hooker once a week, and I   d have to take care of  him. My oldest son he learned to count by counting eggs.  Do you remember the medicine shows we used to like to go to? We   d sit on  benches.  And Chautauqua   s. Chautauqua   s were great.  What kind of products were they advertising at the medicine show?  Liniment mostly.  For all the pains.  I was going to say, it   d cure anything that you   ve got wrong with you.  Some things you don   t even know.  Some of it was to take by mouth and some was to rub on.  The circus would get off in Liberal at the train station and go clear to the north  end.  The Calliope.  Yeah, the elephants and the tigers, that was always real fun. You had to get up  real early to be up there though. Lots of times, we   d go to town just to watch  people get off the train. That was our entertainment.  One time, Knute Rockne and his football team came through and stopped at  Liberal, so Tyrone let school out so they could go up there and see that.  I remember one time in    27 or    28; we let school out so we could go up  because Mr. and Mrs. Hoover were going to have a stop there.  And didn   t President Roosevelt?  I don   t remember him, but we got to go up see Mr. and Mrs. Hoover out on the  back of the train.  26  Stevens  Geist  Herald  Geist  Stevens  Geist  Herald  Witzke  Herald  Kite  Herald  Lemons  Witzke  Herald  Murphy  Stevens  I went to see Mr. Roosevelt.  That was the way they used to campaign was by passenger train. They   d stop  at all these places and come out on the back.  We used to have circuses unload. Roy and I took our boys up when we   d  gotten a movie camera to watch them unload the circus at Liberal. I took  pictures of them unloading the elephants and all. When we got the movie back  to look at it, those elephants were working upside down. I had the camera  upside down. Those elephants were hanging from the ceiling  laughter . They  had all those different roles of movies put in one. Who did that, they turned  those elephants to where they were right. It looked more natural, but it still  wasn   t all together right. It was so funny to see those elephants moving  around hanging from the ceiling.  My grandfather on my dad   s side, he was a staunch Republican forever.  During    28 he went to Washington. I don   t know what he was campaigning  for, but he liked Mr. Hoover.  My grandkids can   t understand why Roosevelt was my favorite president. I  told them he saved our life.  He really brought us out, didn   t he.  The president I first remembered was Roosevelt, in the thirties. No, it was  before that.  The other Roosevelt, maybe.  Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt.  You were remembering the other Roosevelt.  When I was five-years-old I learned to say all the presidents. This is my  grandfather, and my folks gave them this chair on their fiftieth wedding  anniversary. That was a week before she was born.  As sort of a concluding thoughts question, how do you think that living through  these times has effected who you are today?  It made us stronger people.  Trust in God, always.  I just love it. I think that we   ve lived in the most exciting time, to go from a  buggy to the moon.  More happened in our time, it seems like, than my dad   s time.  27  Murphy  Herald  Stevens  Herald  Murphy  Geist  Herald  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  I love it.  Before I was married, my husband   s folks had a two-seated Ford. My sister  that was twenty months older than me and his sister that was a year younger  than me, they were our chaperones, I guess. They were in the back seat. One  time we went to Tyrone after they after they made the road into a highway, he  drove that in ten minutes. That   s ten miles.  That wasn   t paved road, was it?  No, it was grated road.  I remember one time, I was going to the fair at Guymon, and the Lamberts  were in front of us and they couldn   t get up the hill. Everybody had to get out  and push  laughter .  I think about the different things that I have the opportunity to do in my  lifetime. Some of them have been exciting, and some of them have been sad.  One thing that I really enjoyed was my job as the inspector of the election  board at the local precinct. I was there for 50 years. I knew every voter, and if  they didn   t show up to vote, we went and got them  laughter . I   ve always  taken voting very seriously. I   ve gotten to travel a lot, which has been very  exciting. I   ve got seven grandkids and 15 great-grandkids, and I just think it   s  wonderful.  Since I don   t drive myself, I haven   t voted all the time.  Well, is there anything else you want to ask?  I think we   ve covered it.  We   ve hit all the bases. Thanks for talking with us today, and I hope you   ve  had a good time.  -------  -------
