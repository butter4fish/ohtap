 Nykolaiszyn. Also with me is Tanya Finchum. Today  is August 5, 2014, and we   re in Guymon, Oklahoma, at the Hitch Ranch  interviewing Chris Hitch and Rick Furnish as part of the Oklahoma  Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project. Thank you guys for  joining us today.  Glad to be here.  Yes.  Let   s learn a little bit more about how the Hitch family came to this part  of Oklahoma. Can you start us off, Chris?  Yes, I think I remember it, Rick. Correct me if I make any mistakes.  Originally the family was from Tennessee. Not long after the Civil War  they   I guess things were pretty hard to get work or get anything done.  My great-great-grandfather left his family and went out to Missouri. I  think it was Springfield  Missouri  to, I don   t know, catch on with a guy  that was out there. I believe Wes Marlin was his name. They had a dry-goods  store, and they were running cattle out into the plains and then  bringing them back and selling them. I   m not quite sure when he left,  exact year. The current guess is 1884, but the question I   m not clear on  is   originally, they settled up just north of the Oklahoma-Kansas line in  Kansas. Shortly thereafter they moved down here. We always say 1884,  but it   s never been clear to me whether we settled in Kansas or if we  settled here in 1884.  My great-great-grandfather settled here, began the ranch, and eventually  brought his wife. By then he had a wife and I think even a child that was  born in Missouri before they was brought here. Della was born in, she  was born in Missouri, and then actually they moved up around in Barber  County  Kansas  by Medicine Lodge and then they stayed there and then  5  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  they come down by Liberal and the Dry Cimarron  River Valley . Then  they moved on down here. They come here in 1884. Okay, they came to  Guymon. I just didn   t know whether they     To the Oklahoma panhandle in 1884.  We still have some of the property where they homesteaded there, but  this is now the main part of the company. We sold all of our personal,  each enterprise   s personal land up there, but we still have some family  trust stuff that   s up there that   s part of the original homestead from way  back when.  So why this part of Oklahoma?  I don   t know the exact differences in the law back then. Kansas was  more developed. This was still No Man   s Land. It wasn   t a part of the  state. The southern border of Oklahoma of the panhandle is the top of  the slave area. Texas was a slave state, so they didn   t want the  panhandle. I think Kansas was already semi-established as far as the  territory, so that just left this little strip of No Man   s Land. My  assumption is that there was less rules regarding homesteading, and he  started in Kansas and then migrated down here because you could  probably have more land. Is that pretty close to right?  Right, and there was nothing   there was nobody here. It was free range,  so if you could come here and take it and hold it, not necessarily take it  but just establish your place here, you could run your cattle here. The  rule was you could run cattle from halfway to the next water. So if  you   re on the cold water, you could run cattle halfway to the Beaver  River, which is up here, and you could run cattle halfway to the Palo  Duro Creek, that   s down here, legally. There was no fences. There was  no nothing. All you had to do was come here and take care and stay with  it. Nobody wanted to stay with it. There was no people, only Indians and  vagrants and outlaws because there was no law here.  So those early years, it was mostly a cattle operation?  Yes, that   s all it was. It was really pretty migratory. Obviously we didn   t  have semis and interstates and highways, stuff to move the cattle back  and forth, so you literally pushed them. If they needed meat in Chicago,  there was one pretty good way to get there: pushed them some to a  railhead, and then at the railhead they got on a train and left. I don   t  know when Guymon was officially established, but originally they  started out in Springfield and would push cattle out here, would raise  them during the summer, and then push them all the way back.  6  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  I don   t know if they went to Dodge City or if they went to Kansas City  on of those original years, but that   s what they did. Eventually, the rail  was in Liberal. Then it got closer, you know, twenty miles a year or  something like that or fifteen miles a year, so it   d get slightly closer.  Liberal   s about forty miles north, so Dodge City obviously a very well-known  place, it   s about two hours from here. They migrated. The  railroad migrated closer to the cattle, if you will. They had the cattle  where there was grass.  Steamers could only go ten miles without water. They run out of water.  They could carry coal, but they couldn   t carry but enough water to build  steam and run for ten miles. If you   ll watch the towns and through here,  they   re basically on ten mile increments. Liberal, and then Tyrone   Oklahoma  is ten miles. Ten miles from there to Hooker. Ten miles  from there is Optima. Ten miles from there is Guymon. Ten miles is  Goodwell. Ten miles is Texhoma. All down a railroad. That   s the reason  that they kind of went   the towns established where the train stopped.  Well, when they opened up this part of the country for settlement, the  Hitch family officially gained ownership of the land.  Yes, well, they had to homestead it.  They had to relinquish a lot of it. A lot of it that they had used, if  somebody come in and homesteaded it, you had to give it up because  they had the Organic Act.  I think that   s what it   it was a set of rules that defined how much  property you could have. I think like everybody else out here, our  cousins lived down there, and our uncle lived down here, so you   d have  three or four or five homesteads that they were all ours. Our cousins  might still live in Springfield, Missouri, but you wanted as much land as  you could get. Really this whole river for several miles down further to  several miles back to the east was all family land. Brothers and cousins  and stuff all settled in this little valley. In fact, our neighbors were the  Millers, and they were our neighbors for over a hundred years. Finally,  the last gentleman working the land down there died in    98 or something  like that,    97, and all that property changed. It might   ve been earlier than  that. All that property finally changed, but the families have been sitting  next to each other for over a hundred years.  We had a one-hundred-years celebration in    84, and in    88 I went to  theirs. They had been neighbors for a hundred years. That   s a long time.  They was one of the only ones that wasn   t family, was the Millers. If  you could establish your homesteads by the water source   then there  was no water, so you either had to dig a well which back then you  7  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  probably could   ve hit water at fifty or sixty feet. That   s pretty hard to  dig by hand when they homesteaded, so everybody wanted to be the  river. If you could get the quarters by the river, you could pretty well     You got it.     you could pretty well dominate, yes. Like here, there was a home     they homesteaded right here where this house is, was the original.  That house, (not that one, the one before it) burned down in like    93. It  had been added, modified, and changed obviously over the years, but it  was the original homestead. That   s where the house was built. There   s  still several pictures in the Panhandle Pioneer and stuff like that of the  progression that it went through. The dining room walls were about  twenty-four to thirty inches thick, all dirt. If you got all the stuff off the  wall, it was just mud.  Well, tell us a little more about the original house. What do you  remember?  I don   t remember a lot about   I remember the way it was after Mom  and Dad redid it, but they redid it when I was in first grade or something  like that. That house had been redone by my grandfather, I think.  Yes, they redid it in    48 or    49 after my dad came here. They went in  and added on to it. It was a voting precinct for this area. They had an  office off of the east side of the house, and it was basically the voting  precinct. When an election came, everybody came here in this precinct  to vote. A republican would come out, and a democrat would come out,  and they both sat up in the office. That   s where everybody voted. You  didn   t have to go anywhere to vote. You   d just go in the office there.  That   s why I asked him to be here. He knows these little facts that I     They had a basement, and the basement of that house was the original  dugout. Of course, they had cemented the walls, not all the way to the  top. There was a crawl space underneath it. Then in    48, they went in,  and they dug back into the walls as far as they could and removed a lot  of the dirt and put mortar. Then they added on some stuff to the house at  that time. Then Henry and Christine lived in it until Henry died in    67, I  think.  Before I was born.  Then after that, well, Christine moved over in with Ladd, and Paul and  Linda moved into this house and then     8  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  That   s my mother and father.  Then they remodeled it in early    90s? No,    79.  No, no, it was     It was    79 when they remodeled it.  Yes, I was in first     They tore the office off, part of it, and they remodeled up above it. They  made it a lot more livable. It was a nice house, but you could go out of,  in the new house and see the exterior walls of the old house. It was like a  double rock wall. They had rock walls on the outside and rock walls on  the inside. Actually, when the house caught on fire, there was virtually  no way to put it out because you couldn   t assault the fire from the  exterior because the fire was two rock walls inside. The only way they  ever got water on the house and stopped the burning was when the roof  burned off. It was a big fire, burned the tops of these trees, caught them  on fire. This house here was just, roof was smoking. They had water  running on the roof of this one trying to keep it from catching. It was  hot. Hot, hot, fire.  I was at OSU during that time.  Well, during James K. Hitch   s time, was it all cattle, or did he diversify  into other areas?  At the time, we were predominantly cattle. Especially the beginning  years of the ranch irrigation, obviously we didn   t have internal  combustion engines. The gas wasn   t developed, so it took some time. I  believe the irrigation became popular in the    50s, didn   t it?  Yes, late    40s or     Late    40s early    50s. There   s some pictures. I have some someplace of  our first tailwater pit with the water going into it, and everybody   s kind  of standing by, holding hands and really proud of it.  And that was a big deal for this time, to introduce     It was a big deal for the area. It changed the area. We have the Ogallala  Aquifer underneath all of this land. We live in, it   s not quite desert, but  it   s dang sure semi-arid. There was plenty of water. The ground   s very  fertile. We have a lot of days of sun. Sometimes we have a little too  9  Furnish  Hitch  much sun. Whenever they developed irrigation and were able to start  irrigating crops, this area was able to develop two main things that  completely changed the area.  Oh, and one of the other things is we have a lot of natural gas in the  ground, so we don   t have to go very far to get power to an irrigation  motor. We have gas that we can cap, bring it over to the irrigation motor,  and run it off that. When you pump that water, you could grow corn and  other grains which means that your cow-calf production usually can   t  compete with straight row crop. The other thing is it allowed the  development of the feeding industry in this area. Previous to that, the  feeding industry was in two main places. The first place it really  developed was out in California and Arizona. The second place that it  developed was up in Iowa and that area.  Corn belt.  Corn belt, yes. They have nasty winters, and they have, well, they didn   t  have to have irrigation to grow corn. That   s where it developed. We  have a much better climate, really, overall to raise cattle on concentrate  than they do. Over time, the cattle industry grew in Nebraska, Ogallala  Aquifer, Kansas, Ogallala Aquifer, Oklahoma, Ogallala Aquifer, Texas.  You can see a pattern in these central plains here, primarily where the  cattle were. The grass out here, it   s harder country to raise cattle on.  You can have a cow-calf care down in Florida or the southern states  where they grow a tremendous amount of grass. Those guys are able to  have a cow-calf care to the smaller geographic areas. It   s just the  carrying capacity of land is a lot higher. Out here, you know, feedlots  kind of smell, a lot of dust. Well, you build them where there   s not  people and there   s no one to complain about them. They just migrated to  here, and in fact all the packing   was here over time. Started out in  Kansas City, Chicago, and then it slowly migrated. As the cattle moved,  it migrated here.  When you really get down to it, before, we were just a traditional ranch.  We had planted some orchards down here because this was all naturally  sub-irrigated from the water that was available through the river. You  could grow a lot of trees and stuff down here. As it   s dried out, went  from irrigation and over-irrigating, all this bottom ground is not near as  wet as it once was. They had developed it a little bit, but they couldn   t  do anything with the water. You couldn   t move it.  Once that came about, luckily, my grandfather was a pretty good  visionary, and he fed cattle once or twice out in Arizona and lost a lot of  money out there. He said,    Well, I can do that here. I don   t really have to  1 0  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  go to Arizona to lose money,    so he built the feedlot literally on top of  the hill here. My great-grandfather didn   t like the idea. He didn   t like  confined feeding operations. He didn   t like   cattle are supposed to roam  free, so he picked out a pretty nasty piece of ground to build the feedlot  on, which turns out     Actually, it was good.  Yes, it was really good. Because the ground   s really hard, it   s got a lot of  caliche in the ground. Not much     Good rain.  Yes, whenever it rains, water washes off. You don   t get muddy  conditions like you would otherwise if you were on just plain dirt. The  other thing is, because there is caliche in it, there   s a lot of slope to the  land there. Water does leave the pens; it doesn   t sit. It turned out to be  just right, but those are the two main things. They all happened  simultaneously. In the late    40s irrigation developed, and then in the     50s, and I think    52 or    54, was when we built our first small feed yard  up on top of the hill, five thousand   .  Henry   s the one that started farming.  Yes.  He   s the one that started farming. Matter of fact, in 1930 he was  Oklahoma   s largest wheat producer of anywhere in the state of  Oklahoma.  How did the Dust Bowl impact him, because that had to be     It broke him, basically. He was broke, and he couldn   t pay his bills. The  people that was here believed in him, so they stuck with him, and he  paid them back. But he was basically broke. Everybody else was broke,  too. He had financed, the way I understood it, a lot of land through a  insurance company, and the insurance company, basically, he wanted to  give it to them. He said,    I can   t make it.    They said,    Well, if you can   t  make it, we know we can   t make it. We   ll just come out here and live  with you,    so they did. They actually lived in the house with him and  Christine for, I don   t know, close to two years and helped him with his  finances and record keeping and all that.  Things picked up, and he had told me once that oil and gas saved him  and probably most of the ranches here because that   s when they started  leasing the oil and gas. He said they didn   t lease for very much money,  1 1  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  but it was a lot of money then when nobody had any. He said they come  in here, Phillips 66, and they leased every section. In order to hold it,  they come in and drilled a gas well in the center of every section. All  these gas wells that you see around here, those little meter houses,  they   re right in the middle of the section. As long as they produce that,  they can hold all four quarters and nobody else can lease it. He started  farming in the    30s, and then Ladd started the feedlot. Then Paul   s dad,  he got into the pig production. Each one of them started their own deal. I  don   t know what Chris and Jason   s going to start. (Laughter) Never say  never. No, don   t know.  Yes, well, chicken farming   s probably not likely to move out here  anytime soon, (Laughter) so I don   t imagine we   ll get the chickens  running around.  I had a lot of people ask me,    How come they don   t raise chickens out  here?    I said,    They don   t have anywhere to kill them.    They build a  plant, I guarantee you there   ll be some people start raising them.  Henry C. had one child?  He had three.  He had three children, and what were their names? We have     Ladd, which would be Henry C. Hitch Jr., my grandfather.  Right.  Joyce, which would be Josh   s grandmother     The middle daughter.  Yes, middle daughter. I   m sorry, Ladd was the baby. Then we had  Marjorie, and she     Marjorie.  Yes, not Margie. Marjorie. I think she died, maybe, before I was born.  She married a Price.  Price, yes. She was down in Florida. I don   t know how much property is  still jointly owned in the family. I think there   s a little bit here and there,  but they had some orchards and lots of other business dealings down  there. Like I said, that   s really   I stayed here in the Panhandle. I didn   t  1 2  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  go down there a whole lot. I   ve been down to the house. They had a  house that   s a really pretty house down there on the lake. I   ve been to  that, but that   s the limit of my knowledge.  W. K. Price, the guy that married Marjorie, had a friend down there, and  he would   ve been in the citrus business. I guess Ladd and Henry had  went down there to visit him, and they got to going around. They  decided that they wanted to venture into the citrus business, and they  did. They own I don   t know how many acres of oranges. They owned  those for quite some time. Ladd had told us once, he said,    That   s the  worst thing you can own. It   s way worse than cattle,    because orange  tree, from the time you plant it until it   s in full production is almost  seven years. He said,    You talk about having an investment, now   .     What happened is they got one of those bad freezes down there and  killed a bunch of trees. Ladd said it wasn   t near as much fun after that.  Everything worked out because there was some guys from the citrus  business that had a lot of idle land, and they could run two cows per acre  down in that country around those groves. A lot of them raised a lot of  cattle. He   d visit with them. They   d send their cattle up here and feed  them. He had one customer down there, he   d feed fifteen to twenty  thousand head a year through the organization.  Just to give you an idea, on an average year out here, it   s about fifteen to  twenty-five acres per cow, but they   re two to an acre. The density, that   s  what I was getting at with the cow-calf business. You can raise so many  more cattle in a small little plot of ground than we can. It   s kind of hard  to compete.  Well, with Henry Sr., what was   tell me about his wife.  Christine?  Yes.  She was from a broken family. Her mother and dad had divorced. She  was terribly against divorces, which I understand that. She had lived  with her mother, and her mother had went up there and filed on a claim  up by Woods, Kansas, which is about five or six miles from the Hitch  headquarters in Kansas.  You say he filed on a claim?  Yes, they had 160 acres, and they lived out there, her and her mother  and, I think, a sister. They was living there. Well, she was teaching  school at the   what is it? Hidden Valley? Pleasant Valley School. She  would walk over to school and teach, and then she   d walk home. It was  1 3  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  just, like, a half or three-quarters of a mile from her. Well, her and  Henry had met at, I think, some church functions in Liberal. They had  met, so they started dating, and Henry would go over and see her.  Then in the meantime, Henry was running that ranch up in Kansas. His  dad moved him back down here, and his dad moved to Liberal and built  a house in Liberal. They had a house in Liberal. J.  James  K. had a  house in Liberal, he had this one, and he had one in Guymon. Everybody  thinks that   s kind of unusual, but the only way to travel was by horse  and buggy. If you went somewhere, you wanted to have a place to stay,  so they would have a house, not a real big one, but a house. Anyway, he  came back down here. Then they got to dating still, and he married  Christine up there. Her name was Walker, Christine Walker.  She was still alive when I was a little kid. Basically, the only thing I  remember, I was fascinated she had dentures and she could take her  teeth out. (Laughter) I don   t know what was so fascinating about it, but  it was amazing to me. She would take them out once and put them back  in.    Oh, you got to do it again,    but she wouldn   t. That   s pretty much it  is that she could take her teeth out.  She was always a teacher. She loved to teach, so all of her kids would be  around here. I had a brother and sister, and then there was a Mexican  fellow here that he had two boys and a daughter. The ranch general  manager, he had two daughters and a son that was my age. There was  another family here, and they had one of their grandsons living with  them. Then there was another family here that had two girls. We   d all be  out playing and fussing and fighting. Well, she   d go out there and say,     You all are either going to have to go home if you can   t get along or  come in the house and I   ll read to you.    So we   d go in, and she   d read  for hours. Just read all kinds of books, nursery rhymes or Huckleberry  Finn. She just, she was a nice lady, very nice lady. It was kind of like  she was mentoring us all the time.  One of the things you   ll see, especially out here   I remember it, but I  was pretty young whenever the population of the ranch really started  shrinking. Years ago, technology was horribly expensive and difficult to  get a hold of and horribly unreliable, everything you could think of, but  people were cheap. You could hire them by the dozens, and it took  dozens because the best tool you had was a shovel or a pickaxe,  something like that. When I was even a little kid, gosh, there had to be  seventeen or twenty workers out here at the ranch. Now, granted, we had  a lot of irrigation down here on this river bottom.  Put up a lot of hay.  1 4  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  It took a lot of hands to keep that stuff running and going. Now we have  very little irrigation down here on the river. We do have some, but the  stuff that we   ve got now is so reliable, a few guys could take care of  thousands of acres.  We run more cattle.  Yes, exactly. I mean we don   t have a lot of crops out here at all.  Before, in 1974, his feedlot went commercial where they fed cattle for  other people. Prior to that, all of the cattle in that feedlot belonged to  him or the Hitch family. I mean, Henry, Christine, had cattle. She always  fed cattle. Ladd fed cattle. Chris    dad fed cattle. I   m sure your granddad,  grandmother, they always fed cattle. Everybody fed cattle. All of the  cattle there belonged   but the cattle would all come into here. We  would get in a year   s time fifty to sixty thousand head of cattle would  unload here. We would process them all. Some of the bigger cattle we  would take straight to the feedlot. The littler ones we would turn out,  sort them up, and then when they got bigger we   d take them and get  them into bunches.  We were just kind of a, basically a big clearing house. They   d buy cattle  from all over, and they   d all come here. Then we would co-mix them,  co-mingle them, and then they   d go to the feedlot. Steers, heifers, bulls,  Holsteins, it didn   t matter. When they stopped the open range in  Oklahoma, which would   ve been in the early    60s down in the  southeastern corner of the state, there was a lot of people that owned a  hundred head of cows, had no land. They   d just go buy a calf at the sale  barn, take it out there, put your brand on it, dump it out. Go out there  and brand their calves, and every once in a while they   d go gather some  of them. Then they said,    This is no longer  legal , so we can   t do that  anymore.    I think a lot of those big clearing houses, they bought a lot of  that country for pulp wood. Who owns a lot of that stuff down there?  You know what? I     There was a big paper company.  Yes, there was a paper mill in southeast Oklahoma.  They didn   t care nothing about running cattle or nothing, so people  would run cattle on it. Anyway, Henry, he called our cattle buyer. He  said,    Hoot, you go out and buy everything you can buy for a hundred-dollar  bill,    which doesn   t sound like much today, but a four-weight  heifer would cost you seventeen cents or twenty cents. There   s been a lot  of cattle in there, I mean little, inbred, sorry cattle that people didn   t take  1 5  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  care of, but they cleaned a lot of them up that way quick.  At least you   re able to draw awareness to what happened, and I think  that was     Growing up, the only people   my grandfather was around, but he was  bitter about it. Joyce was around; she wouldn   t talk about. It was hard to  find anything out about the Dust Bowl, really, about this area. Anytime  that you were being a little too spoiled around my grandfather,    I  remember when I was growing       It broke into one of those deals. You  didn   t really learn anything. You just kind of felt beat down. Joyce just  really, she wouldn   t even talk about it. It was terrible. They used to take  irons and iron all the centipedes out of the wall. That   s just insane to me.  You know, that   s a great example.  This is something that we still fight today is that the Dust Bowl   you  had a period there that obviously got extremely dry, and people were  breaking ground out to farm, dry-land farming. Once you got rid of the  vegetation, nothing there to hold the ground, and then there was  probably some overgrazing that occurred at the same time. That   s  probably their fault because they had been used to a certain amount of  rainfall and expecting it, and they have a certain amount of cattle, and  then all of a sudden they don   t have them. They don   t have any rain, so  the cattle tromp everything into the ground.  Right on the heels of that we have, in the    50s, irrigation, and the feedlot  developed. So you had the Dust Bowl which was horribly bad on the  diversity of grasses and the quality of grass and fauna that you had out  here for the cattle to feed on. Right after that you had sixty thousand  head of cattle arriving a year to the feedlot. Well, they come to the ranch  first. They tromp around out here and then go to the feed yard. Well,  what do you do there? You overgraze the ground.  It   s real evident. You can go back and see these pictures of the ranch,  and there was no yucca and sage and cactus here at all. It was just grass  for the most part. There was a little bit here and there, but you can see in  the pictures it   s all just grass. Now there are places where it   s 95 percent  invasive species: woody cactus, yucca, brush. All that came after the  drought and the subsequent boom in our cattle numbers passing through  here. Really, except for just a couple of past years, a lot of our property   s  in a lot better shape than our neighbors   .  The story was told, and I don   t know if it   s true or not, but Dad would  get some cattle in. He says,    Ladd, when do you want me to take these  to the feedlot?    Ladd said,    When there   s nothing left out there but  tracks.    That was kind of the prevailing mentality. Modern ranching and  1 6  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  taking care of your grass, that didn   t exist then. Now we   ve been  spending years, and it   s a horribly expensive process of trying to spray  and knock back some of that stuff, let the grass get seeded back in.  Then we have a summer like we had three years ago where everything  that you   ve done right for the last ten years is just washed away in one  summer because it gets so hot, so dry that the only thing that   s left is  weed seed at the end of it. It   s been a pretty tough transition. Even from  the    80s to now, the quality of the grasses and the carrying capacity of  the ranch has decreased significantly. Part of that is just straight rainfall.  The    80s were some of the wettest years, period. They were great. The     70s and    80s were wet. Now it   s drier, but part of it is     The last few years has been the driest three years in recorded history,  drier than the Dust Bowl.  The quality of the grass that   s growing just isn   t there, and there   s not as  much of it. There   s weeds and invasive species in it, so it   s been pretty  tough out here for a while.  A good example of it is J. K. and Charlie in the early 1900s between  their Texas deal and here, one of them owned five thousand cows, and  the other one owned two  thousand . That   s seven thousand head of  cattle. You didn   t market anything but two-, three-, four-year-old steers.  You had to keep seven thousand cows. You had to have a bull for at  least every thirty cows. Then you   d have to have horses and everything  for that. Then you   d have to have the calves on the cows, which, again,  around five thousand. You   d have the five thousand yearlings that you  couldn   t sell for two or three years. You   d have the two-year-olds, three-year-  olds, and four-year-olds all here, so there had to be a lot more  grass.  Yes, simply put, there was more grass.  What happened is the cattle changed the whole ecosystem. They ate out  all the big grasses. Like in these meadows, they said that the grass was  stirrup-high to a horse. It was all sub-irrigated. That was one of the  things that kept J. K. in business when a lot of other people   they had a  real bad blizzard where in    86, 1886?  Eighteen, yes. I was going to say 18 86 .  He had put up some hay, and a lot of other guys hadn   t. All their cattle  perished, while he could sustain his cows. Might not make them as good  as they should   ve been, but he could at least keep them alive. From then  on, they always put up hay. I don   t ever remember a year that somebody  1 7  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  here didn   t bale some hay at some time, forever. I   m sixty-three, and I  don   t really remember every year, but there   s always some hay in  production here. A lot of the times, the older guys, they didn   t have a lot  of free time. Their free time was trying to figure out how they was going  to survive for the next eight months. They worked hard, and they didn   t  go anywhere.  They was either collecting stuff   they was more or less herders and  gatherers. They would try to gather up stuff to survive, for themselves.  They was canning. They planted the orchard. They grew gardens. They  tried to grow watermelons and pumpkins, mush melons, cantaloupe.  They raised some of them on over here. I was just old enough to  remember, but they had some. They tried to raise some other crops, and  a lot of it really wasn   t for fruit. A lot of it, what I   d heard, they raised  some watermelons over around Liberal, Kansas, and they raised them  for seed, seed crops, to sell seed to other people. I didn   t know that. I  figured they just raised watermelons to eat. They raised them for seed.  Can   t afford to eat them. (Laughter)  That   s right.  They probably ate only one...  Yes.     but they all get ripe at the same time.  You don   t exactly have a long window there.  At different times, they raised alfalfa here. They raised seed-crop alfalfa.  We had a seed cleaner and everything here, so certified seed. Back in the  early    50s if you only had 100 to 150 or 200 head of registered Hereford,  Hereford business was good, and you could make a pretty good living on  that many cows. You can   t anymore. They had a registered herd here  and a commercial group. Then at the same time, they had registered  horses here, and they had a commercial group.  They got out of the cow business in, would   ve been early    50s, about  when they got the feedlot business then. They stayed in that business,  oh, until the    60s, and they got back into cow business around    68 and  stayed in the cow business for a couple years. They was basically just  speculation cows. They never got really serious. They   d always buy  some cows or jump in and buy 150, 200 head of cows, have calves,  wean the calves off, and sell the cows, just trying to take advantage of  the market of the seasons.  1 8  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Then in    86, the premium beefs and all started coming out. Paul and  Ladd had decided that they wanted to try to raise better gaining animals  and better quality of meat, so we started AI-ing, artificially inseminating  cows. They did quite a bit of that. We did that for probably close to ten  years, off and on. We raised some tremendous animals, but we was  basically putting as much money in them as we was if we had a  registered animal. We never started with registered animals, so you  never could end up with registered animals.  The packers never would pay you for them. They   d give you the top of  the market for a discount. Paul had always told me, he said,    They don   t  have to pay you a premium. What they have to do is give you a discount.  It   s never,    We   re going to pay you more than this animal   s worth, no.  We   re going to discount you.       You talk to the packers; everything   s a  discount. Then Chris, his granddad and dad was in the packing business.  They owned four packing houses at one time. They owned one in  Hereford  Texas , one in Clovis  New Mexico , one in Booker, Texas. I  don   t know where the other one was at, but I think they had four. It was  all small packaging.  I know the three you mentioned. I don   t know where a fourth one was.  They sold one to some Kosher people. They sold the one in Booker to a  guy that was a maintenance guy that had worked in a plant at Garden  City. That   s the last one they got out of was Booker. They was never a  big contender in the packing business.  About the time they started exiting the packer business is when it  became really aware the industry was consolidating, and they were  starting to really realize economies and scale. Beef at the time, there was  no good beef, bad beef. It was just beef, just meat. It was all commodity,  so the best they could do, the only way you could make more money is  that each one you killed had to cost you incrementally a little bit less.  These guys that were only killing a couple hundred a day were really  inefficient compared to one of these plants down here that kill six  thousand a day.  Volume.  Yes, that   s how you make your money. If you only can make one dollar,  you better sell a lot of them.  Everybody talks bad about corporate farming, but that   s the only way  that farming can exist today. The little mom and pop farms are gone, and  they   ll never return. When I was a kid, everybody around here was a  1 9  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  little farmer. You had three quarters of land, and you made a decent  living. Now, you might   ve done a little outside work on different  seasonal times but not anymore. They sold out to bigger people, or they  pieced out to somebody else. It   s just like the pig industry or the cattle  industry. You have pigs, and you   re farrowing to finish, say, 400,000  pigs a year. You make ten dollars a head profit and pay all your bills,  pretty good money. If you   ve got 150 pigs and you make ten dollars a  head, you   ll go broke. The pig gets bigger, and the little gets out. That   s  the name of the game, and farming   s the same way. In order to farm  today with the cost of machinery, you have to be a big farmer. Tractors  are 200,000 to 300,000 dollars, a drill costs 160     They allow you to do more work. Like I said, this ranch had twenty  people on it thirty years ago that would show up every morning and  work all day long and then go home, and many of them lived here on the  ranch.  Well, you know, my mom cooked for the bunkhouse here. A lot of times  she would feed seventeen guys. Back then, they didn   t have pickups.  They had a guy in the morning, he would take everybody around and  drop them off at a tractor, and then they   d have a service truck that  would go fill it up with fuel. They didn   t have radios or nothing. Then he  would come back at noon and drop them off their lunch. They would  have a lunchbox, and they would bring it in in the evening, and  somebody would prepare them a lunch for the next day.  You didn   t leave the field until somebody come out there and picked  you up that night. If you broke down, you was just broke down. You just  stayed there, and you were there for then. At that point, the Hitches had  seventeen tractors, and they would have seventeen tractors running.  Today, they   ve got tractors that   ll do as much work as those seventeen  tractors would. One tractor. Now, it probably costs twice as much as all  seventeen of those, but they   ve got GPS on them where they drive  theirself. It   s just amazing the stuff that they   ve come up with.  It still only takes one person to run one tractor.  It only takes one person.  More efficient.  Yes.  More efficient.  That   s how it   and in food, food is still relatively inexpensive. I think  2 0  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  the United States, food is 9 or 11 percent (I can   t remember) of the  money that they make on food. That means that   I don   t know what you  have to spend for shelter, but when you get right down to it, we have a  lot of disposable income that   s not spent on staying alive.  The times are changing. I was telling somebody the other day who said,     How come you   re a cowboy?    I said,    You know, really, I don   t know  that I had a choice. My dad made the choice for me.    I was born here,  and when I got old enough that I could do work, they said,    Okay, you  can get up, get your clothes on, come down here. You can catch a horse  and go with this Mexican fellow and rope cattle all day, and we   ll pay  you.    I said,    Dad, everybody else is having fun. They   re in town.  They   re working at the filling station, and they see the girls come in.  They get to visit with people.    He said,    Well, how you going to get  there?    I said,    I don   t know.    He said,    Then you can either do this and  make a little money and maybe buy a car, or you can        Heck, when I got old enough to do something else, I didn   t know how to  do nothing else. If they said,    Do you know how to change the oil in this  car?    I said,    Not really. Have a mechanic to do that. I can get on that  horse and ride him around.    People was the same way. People that lived  a long time ago, it   s not that they didn   t want to learn a lot. They had  more important things. They was trying to survive. We got to get up and  can fruit so we   ll have something to eat in the winter time. Kind of like a  bunch of ants. We have to worry about tomorrow. I don   t know if I was  born somewhere else that I would be a cowboy.  Well, how did your family come to Oklahoma?  They was from Clinton...  Okay.     down around Clinton and Taloga, Oakwood, and that country. My  dad   s dad had always been a sharecropper. He would farm somebody   s  ground, and they had moved four or five times. They was on different  leases. They   d work farms for a percentage, and they come out here  because there was a lot of farming that was still that way out here.  Actually, they was going to go to work at the   Henry and everybody,  they had some land out at Cimarron County, and they was going to  sharecrop that land out there for them. When they got up here, it was in  August, and they was needing help to plant wheat.  They helped them put in the wheat crop and never left. That was my  granddad and my dad and his brother. Jigs, the oldest boy, worked here  for probably, oh   their oldest boy was born here in    51. They left in  2 1  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  maybe    54, so he worked here from    48 to    54. That was right after the  war, and everybody was needing a lot of help, and there was a shortage  of farming people.  Back then my dad didn   t have to go to the war because they tried to  leave one boy. Unless things got worse, they would leave one boy to  work so they could raise wheat so they could feed the troops and let the  other one would go. The oldest boy went. My dad   s brother went in, but  he didn   t have to go. It was getting bad enough that they had already  called him for his second physical when they dropped the bomb. He said  he was on a bus going to Oklahoma City for inducting physical, and they  got a hold of him, stopped him, turned him around, and sent him back  home. He didn   t have to go. Then they come out here, and like I said,  they never left.  Did any of the Hitch men have to go to the war?  My granddad kind of had the same experience. He got exempted. I think  the rule sort of was if you   re producing food you got left out of that deal.  He was in, but he knew how to fly.  He was the only son.  He was in the Merchant Marine. He flew stuff around but only within  the state.  He got drafted by the Navy, though, because he has navies on in some of  the pictures, but I don   t think he ever left.  In the merchant marines, they moved and transported stuff around, but  they never left the continental states. I think he did serve a little bit, yes.  Well, Ladd was really instrumental in the feedlot business, correct?  Yes.  When things started really picking up, did he think about innovative  ways to design that feedlot?  That   s a good question.  Oh, yes.  He was always tinkering.  2 2  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  He was the most pro-education person that I was ever around. He was all  the time   his manager, he was sending him somewhere. There   d be a  school somewhere, and he   d say,    Okay, this guy here is doing a lot of  stuff we want to know about. Here. You go...        And come back and tell me what           yes and,    Tell me what he said.    I went to a ranching-for-profit  school. I   ve been to I don   t know how many different schools. He sent  me to a   who was the guy that herded the cattle? What was his name?  A goofy guy, but he was a herder. He sent me there. I come back, and he  said,    What   d you learn?    I said,    He   s pretty knowledgeable guy,  Ladd.    He said,    Well, can you do what he can do?    I said,    No.    He  said,    Why not?    and I said,    Well, I could send you to a bronc riding  school, and you   ll go for three days. Do you think you could ride broncs  when you get back?    He said,    Why not? Well enough.    (Laughter)  I said,    I think that   s good.    He was all the time   they have all of these  different things like at OSU. I   ve been to those. I   ve been to national  grass conferences. I   ve been   he   s always sending you somewhere.  He   d send us to Denver to look at Wagyu cattle. He told me once, he  said,    My biggest fear is going somewhere and not having something to  read.    He had a satchel with him all the time, and he   d have at least three  books in it. Anytime we went to Panhandle State, if we went to Garden  City College, if we went to OSU, he went into the bookstore, and he  would buy books. There   s no telling how many books that that man  read.  We probably threw away fifteen thousand when he died. We couldn   t  give them away.  He said,    I always like to be knowledgeable enough to carry on an  intelligent conversation with anybody about anything.    He could. He  could talk about a lot of stuff and have a little bit of knowledge about it.  One time we was branding calves right down there. There was some  boys here, and it was right after the Indianapolis 500, so they started  talking about it. I thought,    I gotcha.    I went over there and got in there,  and I said,    Who won this lap?    By God, he knew. I said,    Shit, this guy  knows a lot of stuff, now. If he knows that, I ain   t going to question it.     He was one of those people who had, I wouldn   t say 100 percent but  pretty close to 100 percent recall on reading. He didn   t really read  anything.  He skimmed.  2 3  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  He just skimmed it. It was amazing. Head for facts. He would go  through,    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Mario Andretti has led 7,332  laps of the Indie 500 in his career.    He   ll remember it. That   s what he   ll  glom onto and then,    Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,    and then kick out  another interesting stat or figure. As a kid growing up, it was really kind  of annoying. (Laughter) He just knew facts and figures and all of them.  It was just unbelievable how much he could remember. You asked about  innovating the feedlot. They were built when I was born. They were  already a growing concern. Did he invent stuff? I think that when he saw  something that he thought was worthwhile     He pursued it.     he wanted to explore it, and so he would either contact people, higher  people, do it on his own, even if he maybe wasn   t the person that  thought of something. Innovation, maybe refinement would   ve been a  better way to put it. He was always interested in knowing how you did  that, what you did, and can I do it or do it better.  And I want to try some of it. Like if somebody was doing something  over there, I   d say,    Ladd, do we want to do what he   s doing?       Well, I  don   t know if we want to do everything like that, but I want some of it. I  want a little bit of it. Then we   ll find out if we want to do more.    He was  always,    I want to try everything because you never know what   s going  to work and what   s not unless you try it.    He said,    Some things we can  do, and some things we can   t do, but unless you try it you don   t know.     He was amazing about stuff like that. He was always reading. Then he  got on a health food kick. He would get on to me. I   d go somewhere,  and I   d get a candy bar and a coke. He said,    You ought to not do that.     I said,    Why?    He says,    It   s not good for you.    I said,    But I like it.     He said,    Well, you shouldn   t eat it. I   ve got some   .    What was it?  Some kind of vegetable juice or something.  Oh, yes.  He said,    Here.    He gave me some one day, and it was terrible. I didn   t  like it.  I don   t know exactly what magic it had, (Laughter) but he would  squeeze carrots and celery every morning.  Juice. He had a juicer.  He   d get the juicer, but carrots and celery were apparently the magic  concoction. You couldn   t do it the night before because whatever magic  was in the carrots and juice that night, by morning it was gone.  2 4  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  (Laughter)  That   s right.  You had to have it fresh. I don   t know if you guys   have you ever  juiced a carrot?  No.  There   s not much     There   s not a lot of juice in it, so there   s a lot of carrots that have to be  juiced in order to get a cup. He had, like, a mason jar     A jar, yes.     quart mason jar. My grandmother, bless her heart, she was raised in  a   she was very subservient to her husband, and that was the way she  was raised. I don   t know what time she got up in the morning, (four?)     Yes.     so that she could have all the carrots juiced. Of course, Ladd was  raised at a time when if you wanted milk for breakfast you had to go  milk the cow. Our milking shed   s right there. He would get up in the  morning   before he had to go to school he would get up, go do chores,  one of which was including getting some milk, bring it back to the  house, eat breakfast, drink his milk or whatever they ate and drank, and  then he would get on a horse and go ride to school. The school was, oh,  it   s four miles down the road here, until he was, I think, fifth grade.  During that time period while you were at the country school you just  went at whatever pace you could go, so he actually, over the course of  the years, was an age younger than the classmates that he was in the fifth  grade, so he got in a lot of fights. They liked to fight him.  Of course, he still had to do his chores. He just had to get up a lot earlier  now because now he had to ride a buckboard to town. He   d get up, milk  cows, gather eggs, all that stuff, bring it in, cook breakfast, eat breakfast,  hitch a team, get in the wagon, go to town, drop him off at school. She  would come home, have to make lunch for all the ranch hands, make  supper for all the ranch hands, go back into town, get him, bring him  back home. It was a long day, an exhausting day, I can imagine.  The love for reading, I don   t know how much of this is actually true.  This is where you have a guy with a glass of scotch,    Let me tell you a  story you don   t know about.    (Laughter) The guy that had the general  2 5  Furnish  store in Guymon, my great-grandfather or maybe even my great-great-grandfather,  loaned him some money, helped him to get started at the  soda fountain there in town. It was probably more like a dry goods store.  I don   t know, but it had books in a rack that you could read. Ladd, as a  result of the loan that my forefathers had given to him to help him start  his store, after school Ladd would wander down there and stay in the  store until his mother could make it into town to pick him up. Now, one  of the side benefits is, guess what, she probably needed stuff, as well.  You went to the general store. Well, there   s Ladd sitting there, but what  was he doing? Reading the books that were available for sale, the  magazines that were available for sale. That   s where part of his early  development of loving to read came from.  Now, the tie in with that is that years later in the early    80s, the ag  business was terrible. I mean it was terrible. It was kind of like the Dust  Bowl. We were closer to bankruptcy or about there or whatever, you  know. Maybe it was earlier than that, maybe in the    70s. I   m not quite  sure. It was before I really knew anything about it. One of our cattle  buyer / feedlot manager guys was in, I believe, Saint Louis. It might   ve  been Chicago. Depends on, probably, how much scotch he had. He was  at a bar and was chatting with a young banker. The banker was  complaining about having, they had too much income. They needed a  tax write-off. We needed cattle in the feed yard. They got a napkin out  and penciled out some figures and said,    I think that we can do this. I  think this will work out, and everybody will be happy.     Well, my grandfather hated bankers, hated them. Eventually, Bob  Hilliard convinced my grandfather that    We need to go see this guy in  Saint Louis,    or Kansas City or Chicago, wherever he was. Bob got  Ladd to go, and Ladd finally went. They   re sitting in this   chairmen of  this bank in Kansas city, and the guy says,    Now let me make sure I  have all this right. You   re Ladd Hitch from Guymon, Oklahoma. Let me  tell you, your family loaned my family the money to start this business  which got me through college, which got me this job. My dad was the  guy that had the soda fountain shop. They fed a hundred thousand head  of cattle with this and saved the day,    and all that stuff.  I don   t know if it   s true or not, but that was this huge long story about  this. That   s where it all began. One of those things that you think,     That   s not even possible.    I asked my dad later on, and he verified that  at least the bare bones of the story is true. One of those deals that you  just wouldn   t believe what happened. I can   t imagine. I can   t imagine  riding a buckboard to town.  He was always good about taking power naps, too. (Laughter) He would  sit, and I don   t know how he would do it, but he would brace like this  2 6  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Furnish  Finchum  Hitch  Furnish  and go to sleep. I guarantee I don   t know how many meetings we was in,  if they shut the lights off for a slideshow, he was out. I always wondered  I   d think,    Gosh, I wonder what he   d do if I did that.    I thought,    Well,  he   s paying me. I better stay awake.    (Laughter) He would go to sleep,  (I   d think he was asleep) and then it would be done, and he   d ask  questions. I said,    How can he do this?    They used to laugh about it at  church because he would sit there like that, and he would be braced, and  he   d never move. His head would never move for two hours of church.  The preacher always said he was asleep (Laughter) every Sunday. Your  dad was   he   d get a little noddy, too     Yes.     at the meetings.  How did Ladd meet his wife?  I probably should know that. I probably do.  Panhandle State.  Is that where?  Yes. She was     She was a dance teacher, wasn   t she?  She was a teacher over there at Panhandle State. She was teaching  ballroom dancing and different stuff over here. Ladd had went to school  at Stillwater, and then he went over here and took some classes.  Anyway, they met over there. She was from Vian, Oklahoma. Her dad  was in the   he owned a sale barn at Vian, Oklahoma. She was cattle-oriented  to a point. She rode and everything. She had a saddle at one  time that was   she was the rodeo queen of, it   s a Fort Smith, Arkansas,  rodeo. She rode when she was young.  Did they dance?  Oh, yes.  If she taught dance, I guess they had to.  I can   t imagine my grandfather dancing, but she was.  He did. He danced.  2 7  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Hitch  Shuffle, step, shuffle, step, shuffle, step.  She was a dance instructor. Matter of fact, she tried to make us kids out  here be a dancer. Now, that   s one thing that they didn   t beat on me.  We   d go down there, and she had a little dance studio in her basement,  had rails and mirrors and everything. Her daughter was a dancer. Paul  could dance some, and Jim danced a lot, so she thought we would be  dancers. I said,    Nah, ain   t going there. I ain   t going to tap dance or  nothing.    We didn   t do that.  Could   ve been Fred Astaire.  I could   ve been. Maybe that   s my calling. (Laughter) She was into  musicals, see. She liked entertaining. Their aunt Jane, she still entertains  some.  Yes, she   s an actress from Dallas.  She was Miss Oklahoma, and she sang and danced. Tina, she danced and  sang.  It   s not all work. All work and no play?  No, well     Well, the girls got a lot of     To me that would   ve been more work. I   d rather work than do that.  (Laughter) I don   t like that very much.  Did Ladd graduate from the OAMC, Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  I think he went two years to Panhandle State and then transferred down  at the time.  I think that they went back down there after they got married.  Oh, did they?  Yes.  What was his major, agriculture or     Specifically, I don   t know, ag something, but I don   t know what it  2 8  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Furnish  Hitch  would   ve even been called. Dad was animal science, my brother was ag  econ, I was an-sci, and then I got my master   s at OSU in business. My  brother   s a lawyer. He went to OU, but we don   t really talk about that.  Let   s see here. My dad went to Stanford Business School after that,  many moons ago.  All my family are OPSU  Oklahoma Panhandle State University   graduates. My wife and my two boys, my brother, his oldest son, all  went to Panhandle.  Well, before we start talking more about what   s happening on the farm  today, let   s jump back and talk a little bit about recordkeeping back in  the day and how it   s changed over time.  We spoke briefly about it earlier, but everything that they did was  written down somewhere. We   ve got stacks of little books everywhere.  Whenever you went into town and you bought a barrel of flower in the  late 1800s, they kept a note of that someplace. Obviously, now things  have changed a little bit. We have computers, and we have scanners and  everything else. We   re still pretty fastidious about our record keeping,  but it was certainly a much different type of system back then.  They had a daily log.  Yes.  Everything that they did, they wrote down. They moved cattle, bought  cattle, closed cattle, bought pig feed, bought horse feed. They had a lot  day help. They had a lot of custom farmers back then. Somebody would  come and plow for them, and they paid them three cents an acre. They   d  write down,    So and so, I owe them 160 acres, three dollars an acre.     They burned kerosene. They bought kerosene. They bought heating oil.  All of the goods, they kept records on all of it. Course, you had to. You  had to know where your money went. Had to know how much you had.  Did they trust the bank?  Well, I don   t know. The banks is what a lot of people say caused the  Depression. I don   t know that anybody at that era, for a while, trusted a  bank. I know my grandfather, he didn   t like bankers at all. He didn   t  have a lot of money, but the bank was not federally insured, and he lost  what money he did have. He never got it back when the Depression hit.  That would kind of make you sour. He was struggling to     Didn   t have much, but you did have, they lost.  2 9  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish     struggling to feed your kids. The people never had it quite as bad as  the people that lived in the towns during the Depression and the Dust  Bowl because they did understand how to grow things. My dad always  said,    We didn   t have shoes, but nobody else did, but we never went  hungry. We always had meat to eat and milk and eggs.    When my folks  come here, always here until 1971 or   2, we always had fresh milk here.  The ranch owns the milk cows. They milked, and they gave milk to all  the guys that worked on the farm, the ranch, the feedlot. Everybody got  a quart of milk twice a day or so, raw milk. Then at one time they had a  big chicken house over here, and everybody got eggs for free. Had a  bunch of chickens. They   d go out and gather eggs every morning.  Somebody washed them, and they   d put them out. However many you  wanted, you could take them. That was part of your wage.  He   s right about that as far as the   somebody in New York City that  lives inside of a city, people weren   t very mobile anyway. Then no  food     They had no way to get anything.     yes, where are you going to go? What are you going to do?  Unless you stole it from somebody, that   s basically the only way to eat.  Here, they at least had some food around. They didn   t have anything  else, and the stuff that they had really didn   t belong to them because the  bank owned everything.  And it wasn   t worth nothing. They didn   t have any money to buy it.  Of course the bank was broke, so they didn   t care either.  Nobody had any money to buy it, so it really had no value. My dad said  they always used to keep the calves off the milk cows when he was a  kid. He said he remembered him and his brother taking them to  Oklahoma City, and they   d haul a three- or four-hundred-pound calf  over there that   d bring six dollars. Then the government at one point  went through, and they said we got too many cattle. They come out and  bought them, run them off into the silos, shot them     Buried them.     to reduce numbers. They was trying to push the price of meat up  which they never got done. The only thing that brought us out of  Depression was World War II. Put everybody to work; made them all  forget about not having nothing. If you didn   t have nothing, join the  3 0  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Furnish  Army. They   ll give you some shoes. You   ll shoot at somebody, but  they   ll feed you, clothe you. They had the WPA,  Works Progress  Administration  which it helped some underclass people too. At least it  fed their kids.  We had a Mexican fellow here that was a very knowledgeable old man.  He left New Mexico. They didn   t have nothing out there. It was during  the Depression, so he joined the WPA and went to Georgia. He was  working down there, building bridges and road construction, whatever  he could do. Then World War II broke out. I think most of those boys  that were in the WPA jumped out, and they said,    This might a better  deal than the WPA. At least you get a paycheck.    WPA, they didn   t pay  much. They just fed and clothed you. The Main Street in Guymon was  built during the WPA, was built by the WPA.  Brick.  The brick, they laid bricks by hand for two blocks, all of Main Street.  You mentioned over time you need a lot of hands to help work the land.  In those early days, you had a bunkhouse? Can you kind of describe  some of the living structures that were here for the employees?  Well, this house here, on the back of it there was a room now that   s  basically my wife   s closet. There was three sets of bunk beds. There was  six guys lived there. There was no TV. They furnished their meal. You  get up and go eat breakfast at the cookhouse. Then you went to work,  and you come in, and you ate dinner at the cookhouse. Then you ate  your supper there and then went to bed. That was it. If you want to go to  town, well, you was twelve miles away. Then they had a bunkhouse that  was on up on the hill. It was a basement, and it was four sets of bunk  beds in there, so they could house. It was part of your wage. You got  three meals a day, and you got to live there. Plus, you got clean linens  twice a week and towels twice a week. That was all provided by the  company.  Then in the    70s, they started hiring quite a few of the migrant workers. I  hear a lot of people talking about the Mexicans today, and I said,    You  know, we caused this. We brought them up here and gave them  employment, and then we expected them, after they was here for a  while, to leave. Don   t stay here.    We caused all that by employing them  at the get go. I   d say 75 percent of all the Mexicans that   s here now are  from around   Durango. They would work here, and then they would  write back and say,    Hey, there   s work up here. It   s a pretty good place  to live.    Then more of their family comes.  3 1  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  I got a boy that   s working for me that   s been here ever since he was  fourteen. There was nine kids in his family, and they   re all in the United  States, and his parents are here. They   ve outnumbered us since then.  They have big families. I don   t say    Mexicans    as a derogatory deal. My  wife gets on to me for calling them Mexicans. She says,    They   re  Hispanic.    I said,    Well, they might be Hispanic.    She said,    Why you  call them Mexicans?    I said,    Because they   re from Mexico. If they was  from England, I would call them English.    I wouldn   t call a Frenchman  and Englishman. It   s just location.  Certainly back in the    70s there was no Guatemalan, Honduran     Nope.     Costa Rican. That migration didn   t exist. The people that were here  were truly born in Mexico, crossed illegally, and got work here. There  were no documents. Yes, Immigration would come by periodically.  People would run and hide.  This one boy that worked here   this is kind of funny story. He come  here, he had a social security card, and it was all sevens. Now, what is  the odds of that? My dad looked at it and said,    Marceleno, is this your  card?    He said,    Yes  It   s got my name on it.    He   s illiterate still. He  can   t read nor write, even Spanish stuff. He had this card, and it was all  sevens. He said,    You   re sure?    He said,    Yes.    He wrote it down, and  they paid social security to that card for, I don   t know, until he got  another card. He basically got amnesty when Ronald Reagan gave all of  them amnesty. They could get documentation at that time. Since then, he  married a girl that was from Mexico, too, but she has become a citizen,  and they   ve raised four girls.  Has it been easy or hard to find labor through the years to work on the  farm?  Waxes and wanes. Skilled workers for the ranch, i.e. cowboys, harder  and harder and harder and harder to find. Just a way of life that is dying  off.  You can play with computers now. You don   t have to be cowboys.  Farmville or whatever, you know. Download an app. (Laughter) The  people that work in the feedlot, the people that work on our farms, most  of the jobs, if you have somebody that   s willing to try and learn and  spend some time and not get frustrated and be careful and safe and not  get hurt, you can pretty much teach them almost any job that   s out there.  Prior to 2008, yes, you couldn   t find anybody, but everybody was  3 2  employed around here. The only people that weren   t employed around  here   and when I say    everybody,    there   s like two and a half percent  unemployment. The people that were not employed were underage,  retired, or Latino moms. There   s a reason why you didn   t have them  employed, because they have four children. Well, if you have four  children, and each child requires twenty dollars a day babysitting fees,  that   s eighty dollars. If their job was only going to pay them forty dollars  a day, it made pretty good sense just to stay home.  We were going to do a bunch of different things. This kind of sounds  terrible, but thank goodness everything went to hell in 2008 because it  opened up the labor pool a lot around here. We were going to try a  daycare. We could hire daycare workers and certify it, and we could hire  some of these young women and do it for free. Get them in, and then we  could actually get workers. That   s the desperation we were in. What  compounded that problem was in the early    90s is when Seaboard   Foods  moved in. The pigs moved into the area.  The population of the Panhandle was about 19,000 in 1900 for Beaver,  Texas, and Cimarron Counties. The population in 1990 was about  19,000 in Beaver, Texas, and Cimarron Counties. Maybe the  demographics have chipped into that a little bit, (there   s less people on  the farm, more people in the city) but the numbers were about the same.  When Seaboard moved in, that created a huge vacuum. That was in the  early    90s,    93 or something like that, and    94 is when they began  building their hog operation in this area. Basically that vacuum didn   t  stop sucking until 2008. What happened then is when everybody else  from all over the country got fired and laid off, they migrated here.  While the labor market is still really tight here, and especially for what I  would consider   lots of people want a job, but they don   t want to do  anything. They don   t want to work. They don   t want to learn anything.  They don   t want to sweat. They don   t want to, you know.    Oh, I went to  college. You   re not going to let me run the company tomorrow?    We  have a PhD nutritionist that started out at the bottom of the feed yard  when he came out of college. Now if you hire a PhD nutritionist the first  year out of college, he expects to be running the entire nutrition program  for your company. These expectations are stupid, really.  That   s not any different than the seventeen-year-old kid that dropped out  of high school. He doesn   t want to run a shovel, either. Is good help hard  to find? Yes, it is. There are workers applying, and some of them are  good, and some of them are really willing to learn something and try  something new, even though they have no experience whatsoever. To  have somebody that has a lot of experience and a lot of talent, somebody  finds that person, and they keep them wherever they   re at. They don   t  3 3  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  want that person leaving because that   s who   s going to train all the  people that don   t know anything about it, about the jobs.  Our field is getting where there   s hardly any. Even in the rodeo, what  you will see in the rodeo in the bigger pictures, your calf ropers and  people like that are basically horse people. Most of those people was  ranch-raised, or they had knowledge of horses and had access to learning  how to do that. Your bull riders come from everywhere, and a lot of the  rodeo cowboys today are not cowboys at all, anyway. They   re athletes,  and that   s basically what they are. They don   t have the opportunity to  even start to do it, so consequently when they get older, they   re not  going to do it. Only the people that started doing it when they were  young are going to stay in that game. It   s the same way as what I was  telling you about myself. I didn   t have the opportunity to do nothing  else. If I wanted to get up and do something, they   d quit your job. Or  you could catch a ride with the farmers up there and drive a tractor all  day. I didn   t want to that. Or you could mow the lawn. I didn   t want to  do that.  Well, you know, at the feed yard for example, there   s three main  departments. There   s maintenance, cattle, and feed, to make it real  simplistic. There   s two jobs on the feed yard that I probably can   t teach  you how to do. One of them is welding. I might be able to get you where  you could get two pieces of metal and stick them together decently  enough that it   s not going to fall apart. That   ll take some time, and I   ll  have to invest quite a bit of money in you. We could probably do it, and  besides that, the welders are pretty nice these days. They take a lot of the  guesswork out of it. The other one is cowboying. I can   t teach you how  to cowboy. You either know how when you get there, even poorly, but  you have to know how to ride a horse and saddle a horse and get around.  I can teach you how to drive a truck, drive a tractor, run a shovel. That   s  pretty easy, not a lot of thought to that one. I can teach you how to do  that.  The industry   s got to where a lot of it, too, is getting back into instead of  having knowledgeable people, and the only offsets you can have is to  have protocol, in my opinion. You get a set of cattle, and you think  you   re going to have trouble with them. Your concern is you don   t have  guys that can pick out the sick ones. In order to fix that, let   s just give  them all a shot. We can tell them to do that.    Let   s just give everything a  shot, and then we   ve already covered that. Then we   ll try to treat the  ones that do get sick afterwards.     A lot of the feedlots have went to an operation like that, where you just  treat everything the same and try to lessen your problem instead of  having some people that can take care, saying,    This one   s sick, and this  3 4  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  one   s sick, and this one   s sick. The rest of them, they don   t need that.    A  lot of it has went to where it   d be simpler, and then you don   t have the  people or the people to train the people or can   t get the people to train.  Let   s just do this, and then the vaccination program, we   ll vaccinate for  thirty-two different things.  A seven-way  vaccine , a five-way     Yes, we   ll give them a seven-way, a five-way. We   ll do this, and we   ll  give them a real strong antibiotic upon arrival and hope we don   t have  the problem. It   s hard to find people and to get people to stay and go  through the training. Over the years I   ve seen them try to train feedlot  management here. Well, if they do train somebody and they get a pretty  good guy, if you don   t have an opening for him right then, he   s gone.  Caprock Industries, they   ll see him, and they   ll say,    Hey  This guy just  went through all his stuff. He   s pretty good. I want to see if I can hire  him.    A lot times they get it done because you don   t have an opening for  him. What are you going to do with him? Put him back to doing  something that he   s already done and not progress him? He don   t want  to wait, so he just goes somewhere else. How many people like that have  you had Chris, two or three     More than that.     that they   ve trained for feedlot management.  One of the things you mentioned, there was a time when ag education,  going out, learning about agriculture, and coming home ,and trying to  grow a company to work with somebody else is a pretty common deal.  No one wants to live in Guymon, with the exception of my cousin over  here from Bethesda, Maryland. We don   t know why he   s here, but he  loves it. I   m not going to ask questions. (Laughter)  We   ve had a policy for, well, it started right after I got back in    98,  somewhere in there. We started saying that we take pretty much 100  percent of applicants for internships from anywhere in the country. We  do a little bit of background work. One, they have to be an ag student or  they have to be   we vet to make sure that they   re not just animal rights  activists or something like that. Our policy is if you apply for a job for  Hitch for a summer internship as a legitimate ag person wanting to get  experience, whether it   s in cattle, hogs, vet, farming, whatever, we   ll  take them, period, end of discussion. There   s no interview process,  nothing like that. The difficulty out here is housing. You can   t find any  housing. I   ve tried and pled and begged with Panhandle State to let them  use a dorm, to let them rent a dorm space from them, but it   s not worked  out. That   s usually the barrier.  3 5  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  The idea, of course, is that one of these interns will turn around and  come back. We have one working for us. She was from Florida, going to  school at Washington State and graduated and couldn   t find a job, so she  approached me about an internship. My view on a internship is simple:  We take them all, but there   s a definite start date, and more importantly  there   s a definite end date. It   s like a two-month-long interview process.  She was great. She was there for about three weeks, and the guy was  like,    You don   t mind if I just hire her?    That   s what she was really  hunting. We hired her, and she   s still with us today. In fact, we   re trying  to get her into graduate school at OSU right now.  They   re very few and far between. Finding educated college graduates  that are interested in doing ranch-style work and farm labor is just really  hard. The only ones we hire, by and large, are locals. They grew up in  Guymon, they moved someplace, went to school for a few years,  graduated, maybe got married, and now decided they want to come back  home and raise their family out here. It   s just really difficult to find  something like that. It   s a little disheartening. You come from out here,  and you can   t hire anybody that   s got an education. Lots of people say,     Ah, I   d rather hire somebody from the school of hard knocks.    Then  they have a few interns that are really good, and they start realizing  there   s a lot of times there   s a value there to having somebody who   s  maybe just a tick smarter, pretty motivated, very interested in knowledge  and learning about stuff, whereas a lot of the kids, they   re in it for  money. They come out     A lot of these towns are dying.  Yes.  Boise City, Oklahoma, their average age of the people that   s there is like  sixty-five years old. The family farms is there. There   s some of those  families that I   ve known them my whole life. There was four kids in the  family. All of them but one has left. They   ve went somewhere, got a  family, and they   re moved, and went to college. Now they   re living in  Houston. When the oldest parents die, they   re not coming back. They   re  not going back. If they go back, they ain   t going to take their wives. She  ain   t going to go back to Boise City and leave Houston, Texas. Ain   t  going to happen. If you don   t marry a girl from out in here   the big  corporate farms with the technology, we don   t need a big family. When  my dad was working here in the    70s, we had seventeen guys on payroll  here. Now I got five.  Wow.  3 6  Furnish  Hitch  You know, it   s just, it   s a different world. The equipment   s better. The  pickups last. Back then if you had a pickup that had 70,000 miles on it, it  probably needed to be overhauled and the front end was wore out. It was  a piece of junk. Now 200,000 miles on your pickup, it   s still a pretty  good truck. Runs pretty good. It   s just a different world. Technology  today is so much better, and, too, just like we was saying, the  vaccination programs with your antibiotics and all the stuff that you  have available. When my dad come here in   48, they didn   t even have  penicillin. They doctored cattle here with sulfur drench. It was a liquid.  My brother and I went with him one day, and we was riding along. We  was just little-bitty kids, and my dad used to tell this story. They would  catch these cattle, and they   d take these old whiskey bottles, and they   d  mix this drink up in there. Then they   d catch this calf, and they   d roll  him up on his side and reach in, get ahold of his tongue, and stick this  bottle. Hopefully he swallowed it before it run down his lungs. Well, we  was riding along there, and my brother asked my dad   he   d doctored a  couple, and both of them had expired. He said,    Dad, do all these cattle  die that you doctor?    (Laughter)  My dad said   well, what do you say? He said they talked about a  miracle drug, penicillin. Bad things about war, but there is good things  about war is they can get a lot of new drugs because they have a lot of  experimental patients. Penicillin didn   t come out until after World War  II. Then you had Liquamycin and some of these drugs. The bugs that  was in cattle then, they had never been exposed to any of this, and my  dad said it was like magic. He kept calves that were pretty sick and give  them a shot. Tomorrow he   d be a lot better or well. One time.  Today it   s a different deal. Over the years, I would say that there has  been maybe two million cattle through the corral system here, in all the  time they   ve had their feedlot, maybe more than that. Cattle in, cattle  out. As far as having bugs and everything, there   s probably every bug  that   s ever been known to a bovine is in that ground down there. You   d  better be vaccinating for them and protecting yourself. They never had  Clostridium but, like, black leg and a lot of that stuff until right before  World War II. A lot of the cattle back then, in order to save them, you  moved them because the spores got into the ground.  What you   d do is if you started losing a bunch of cattle, you   d go pick  up what you had left and start driving them from whatever fell off and  died. Don   t worry about that. Just get the cattle on a new place. Get them  away from where they was at. Hopefully, we   ll wait awhile and then  we   ll come back and our cattle might get a little big of immunity to it.  Which translates to a lot more help.  3 7  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  It was called, that disease then was blackleg. The reason they could tell  what it was, like, you   d split the hide on their back legs after they died,  they   d get real stiff. They   d just fall over and die, and then you   d cut it  open, and their flesh would be black. A lot of these things that we   ve  come up with is good and bad. There   s a lot a people that really talk bad  about our drugs and (what is it?) Bt corn, yes Bt corn.  GMOs, Genetically Modified Organism.  Yes, GMOs. They think that   s terrible. I don   t know whether it is or it  isn   t, but those people never been hungry. I guarantee you, if you throw  an ear of corn over there and say,    This is a GMO corn. You can eat it or  not, but that   s all you   re getting,    I bet you they   ll eat it. I would.  No atheists in foxholes. When you   re starving, you don   t worry about  GMO stuff.  Right.  First-world problems I guess.  That   s right. Well, tell me a little bit about your father.  Ah, Paul, born in   43, mother Lala, dad Henry, Ladd Jr. He went to  school in Guymon, went to college at OSU, went to graduate school in  Stanford. My mom was from Bartlesville. They met at college, got  married afterwards, then basically moved back here and lived here until  he died. First generation builds it. Second generation shores it up. Third  generation loses it and lets stories that they have about family  businesses. Ladd, the first generation, built it up. Second generation, he  expanded and shored it up. Then Ladd built it again, if you will. Dad  definitely took a good thing and put a lot of concrete blocks underneath  the foundation to make it solid. While Dad did technically get us  involved with the hogs, there   s no doubt that the reason we   re so  involved with the hogs is not Dad. It was Ladd. Ladd, he always wanted  to go a thousand miles, and he never dipped a toe before he jumped head  first.  He wanted to try some of it.  Yes, he wanted to try some of it. Three hundred thousand head a year is  apparently    some.    (Laughter) Dad was the one that courted Seaboard,  helped pave the way for the state government, the local government,  politicked a lot in favor of getting Seaboard out here. Pre-Seaboard, we  had had a beef packer, Swift, in town. It had closed in the early    80s,  3 8  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  maybe    84,    85, something like that. Guymon   s population in the city  was pretty unhealthy. Dad was all for it, and he was instrumental in  getting it into the local area. Dad, he was certainly his father   s son. Both  of them loved the commodity market a lot, maybe too much.  Seaboard, the hogs specifically, whenever they got involved and we  started growing hogs, there   s a side of the commodity business which is  very unpredictable, seasonality   s cyclical nature of the commodity  business where I don   t raise a Dole pineapple. I raise a pig. As far as the  guy in Dallas, all pigs are the same, right? One pig   s the same as another  pig, so it   s pretty hard to differentiate your product. I don   t have a  packing company where I can put a pretty label on it and sell it as a  premium product. I   m on the other hand. I   m the guy that has everything  just the same, homogenous product. Ladd, he loved it. What you had to  do whenever you   re raising cattle, especially in the volumes that we had  and hogs in the volumes that we were proposing, the volatility of the  market can make you and break you within a very small period of time.  Within a couple of years you could go from doing very well, making a  lot of money, to losing everything that you had.  The commodity markets in Chicago developed as a way to reduce risk  and trade future quantities of a product that is not yet produced. For us,  if you have a fat animal and you know he   s going to sell in February and  you can look out there to the February contract and see that that   s priced  at a profit, you can sell your animals on the commodity board and hedge  the animal and reduce your risk. There   s risk involved with the  commodity board, but it   s sort of like gambling if you don   t have a  product that you   re protecting. If you   re just trading, speculator, it   s a bit  of a   you   re just investing in gambling.  Playing poker.  Yes, buy low, sell high.  It   s like sitting down at a poker table. Whatever somebody   s losing on  the tray, somebody else is making.  Yes, somebody else makes. If we have cattle, though, we   re not  gambling. We   re offsetting risks. We   re laying off risk to the speculator  on the other side of that tray. What evolved was my grandfather and then  later on after my grandfather semi-retired and eventually passed away,  my dad and my grandfather did much, maybe not quite all, but the vast  majority of the commodity trading. They loved it. They loved trade  commodity. Besides, Dad was a consummate politician. He was very  good in a crowd. He could work the crowd. He could talk to lots of  people and really get around. Ladd was sort of the same way, although  3 9  Furnish  Hitch  he did a better job, less at a podium and more in a crowd like a group.  One of my PR managers said,    The best thing we could do ever was to  send Ladd on vacation.    He would go on vacation, and he   d come back  with 45,000 head of cattle that he sent to the feed yard. Dad wasn   t that  type. He couldn   t work that convention and state fair or vacation-type  crowd at all. He could stand up in front of a group of people and talk to  them really well. He ended up spending a lot of time in leadership  positions within our industry with National Cattlemen   s Beef  Association, Texas Cattle Feeders  Association , Oklahoma Cattlemen   s  Association, National Cattlemen   s Association, which was the  predecessor to the National Cattlemen   s Beef Association. He was in  various leadership positions all throughout his career.  He would   ve been the president.  He would   ve been the president, but he died. He would   ve made it to the  presidency, but he would   ve died during the presidency, so he stepped  down and decided not to serve. Between those two jobs, that really  became his career. While he did manage the operations, his philosophy  was much like (my brother and I have adopted, as well) I can run the  company, and I love to run the company, but I can hire you to do much  of the day-to-day operations work. Yes? No? Can you hire this person?  Can you fire this person? What do we got to do about this? I   ll do the  35,000-foot level; you do the minutiae and the detail. I can do as much  good for our company and the industry at large as in Washington DC or  in Oklahoma City. That   s where the real change happens, good and bad.  Dad, and to a lesser extent like I said, Ladd, that   s where they spent a lot  of their career. Now, when they weren   t out doing that side of the  business, they were at home. Like I said, that   s what they love to do.  They loved the commodity business. Dad did 100 percent of the hedging  for the hogs up until the moment he died. Ladd, towards the twilight of  his life, (he was well past retirement age when he died) he had sort of  stepped out of the company, really. He still got up at five o   clock in the  morning and went to the office and spent all day at the office, Saturday  and Sunday, except for church. He went to church. He traded  commodity for himself now. He would do neat little things like,    Chris,  I   m going to give you  20,000, and I   m going to take it right back,  okay? It   s yours. This is yours. I   m going to invest it in pigs, okay?     Sometimes I saw the money again. Sometimes I never saw the money.  I   m thinking that was like he gave himself permission. He could do it  because he was doing it on my behalf at that point.  Whenever Dad died, I won   t say it almost broke the company, but it was  bad. The reason being is that we had done a poor job reducing our risk  4 0  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  on commodity because my dad was the person that did the trading. No  one else had permission to do anything. Not allowed to touch that. That  was his sacred cow. Couple that with a horrible market at the time. Dad  had developed cancer, and slowly but surely had migrated out of the  office. He was still coming in on occasion, but he was pretty much done.  We really didn   t have any direction, didn   t have any hedging. Whenever  he passed away, it was a huge blow to the company, not because we  were left without management. We had management. We just had  150,000 head of hogs that were very ugly at the time. We were giving  them away. I think we were selling a fat hog to our employees for forty  bucks.    Come pick it up.    A 260-pound animal, that   s twenty-five cents,  fifteen cents     They went down to eight at one time.     and our break-even was somewhere in the neighborhood of forty  cents.  Right after you all got full-bore into the business, the hog market was  the worst it had ever been in history, eight cents a pound.  Yes, forty cents a pound, approximately, was our break-even, and they  were selling for     Eight.  I don   t know if we quite got to eight cents, but we might have been  eleven or something like that.  That   s what we paid that time, Chris. I paid eight cents a pound to y   all  and took the pig over to Panhandle and had it processed,  Cost more to process.  It cost me thirty-two cents a pound to have it processed and eight cents a  pound to buy it. (Laughs)  It was a bad   talk about baptism by fire for myself. Now, in Dad   s  defense, (he   s not here to defend himself) he didn   t do anything wrong.  That was the way the work was allocated. He was still alive, and he was  the boss. That   s the way we did it. On hindsight, now, obviously, we  could   ve done a much better job of delegating tasks, and we do that now.  We   ve changed the way we do that by a lot. At the time, that was what  Dad liked to do, and that   s the way we did it.  As far as Dad, he spent, gosh   he was president of Texas Cattle Feeders  4 1  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  right when I got back, right around    98 or so, Texas Cattle Feeders, and  National Cattlemen   s Beef Association. National Cattlemen   s Beef  Association is obviously the national lobbying arm for the cattle  industry. Texas Cattle Feeders Association is the lobbying arm for the  Texas feedlots. Well, we   re not in Texas. We   re close enough to Texas  that we   re in their geographic area. They and the Kansas Livestock  Association were probably the two largest, by and large, CAFO   Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation  representatives. NCBA  represents all of the cattle, and those two represent, more so, confined  feeding operations. Clout-wise, that   s where they were at. Dad was very,  very, very active in those, believed in it. He was a very strong proponent  for the industry for the lifestyle, the business, the thought process behind  it. Really, like I said, that   s what he spent his whole career doing.  I can remember growing up, it was always National Cattlemen   s  Association which morphed into National Cattlemen   s Beef Association.  Where was the winter trip which was in February? San Diego? Was it in  Dallas? Was it in someplace else? This was kind of pre-Santa Fe  becoming the convention capital for the southern states. Even when I  was a little child, that was what we all knew. We took vacations. That   s  where our vacation was, was a National Beef Association   s annual  meeting wherever it was held. That   s how I grew up. That   s really, like I  said, that   s how he focused his career was,    I   ll hire somebody to do the  day-to-day work.    Nobody wants to talk to the politicians    assistants.  They want to talk to the politician. Dad felt like he could get a foot in the  door, whereas maybe if you sent someone else, that wasn   t going to  happen.  Well, how did you start learning the business, you and your brother?  Gosh, I   m kind of like Rick, I     What were some of your chores growing up?  I didn   t have chores, not like that. We didn   t have milk cows. There  were chickens. When I was a little-bitty kid we still had chickens, but  they were gone shortly thereafter. I spent every summer from being very  small   well, Jake   s how old?  Jake is     Thirty-two?  Yes, born in    79.  So he   d be thirty-four? Thirty-four. I   m forty-one, so six or seven years,  4 2  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  somewhere in there is about where the difference     You   re as much older than him as your dad was me.  I can remember when I was a little kid, Jake being a little kid, being  born, and I was hanging out at the barn. Jake might have been three or  something like that, but I was already there. I don   t really remember not  hanging around the ranch. I can remember all the workers being here,  but I was a little kid when that happened. They   d all sit right here,  actually. At lunch time and in the morning we gathered right here, and  everybody got their marching orders and then dispersed like a herd of  cats. I always grew up doing stuff. My brother, he didn   t stay on the  ranch. I never left the ranch. I never worked at the feed yards, I never  worked for the farm, I never did any of that. I just stayed right here.  My brother, he worked for a summer at the shop and the feed yard. He  worked for our vet. He had a lot of different jobs growing up. I don   t  think he ever liked horses that much. I did. I was allergic to them. I  finally outgrew that, but Jason, he never really had that much interest.  He did a lot of different jobs, just not on the ranch. While my dad didn   t  force me into anything. He didn   t get up at the crack of dawn,    I want  you to go do this, this, this, this,    because he wasn   t that way, either. I  don   t think Ladd said,    You need to go out and be doing this type of job  or having this type of labor,    whereas Ladd was twelve years old and  had a hay crew he managed. Very different world. Dad wasn   t pressured  into that. I wasn   t pressured into that. Nonetheless, whenever it came  time to go to college and learn about something, we ended up in ag, of  course.  I think he got to the point to where you didn   t have to. It became more of  a business. You need somebody to take care of the business. You can  hire someone to be a cowboy. You can hire somebody to do this. You  don   t spend your time doing that. You will learn how to run this thing.  Take care of the business end of it; hire somebody to take care of the  labor.  How do you put this? When I went to college and studied animal science  with a focus on business, I could   ve studied Greek mythology if I   d  wanted to. My dad put no pressure on me to do anything, but at the same  time, I can   t remember ever considering a career anywhere else. I never  sat around and said,    Gosh, I wonder what it would be like to be a  lawyer or a doctor or        Dance instructor.  Yes, I could. (Laughter) Now, Lala would   ve been happy with that. She  4 3  Furnish  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  would   ve been thrilled.  Yes. (Laughs)  While I don   t think that we were really what you   d call groomed, we  were groomed. By everything that we did, we were groomed. We knew  the background, maybe not the specifics of what they did and how they  did it, but they kept us involved and knowledgeable about it and didn   t  push it so hard that we just decided we wanted to do something  completely different.  Well, when you came back from college, what was your role on the  ranch?  You know, actually, when I came back from college in    98   that was  graduate school. I graduated from college in    96 and graduate school in     98. Really, I was kind of a man without a country. There was no real  position for me. I floundered around in the office for six or nine months  or something like that, maybe a year. I don   t really remember. Finally, I  got tired of that, and so I quit the office and moved out to the feed yard.  At the time, we had three feed yards. We sold one a few years ago. We  had one here in Guymon, which is just on top of the hill. We had one by  Optima, which is about twenty miles from here. We had another one in  Kansas, near Garden City, Kansas. The first, I went to Henry C., which  is on top of the hill, and just started driving a few trucks. I went through  the rotation.  I said there   s three different departments at the feed yard: your cattle,  your maintenance, and your feed department. I went through all three  departments and worked at the various tasks. The only thing I did not  delegate to myself was cowboying because, once again, while I can ride  a horse and rope a little, I   m not a full-time cowboy. I really wouldn   t  have been a particularly good asset to the cowboy crew. It   s not  something you just walk out there, pick up, and start doing. I did pretty  much every other job on the yard besides weld because, once again, I  don   t know how to weld very well. I can weld a little bit. I can usually  burn myself and catch things on fire, but the metal doesn   t stick  together. I did that at all three yards.  While all three yards are exactly the same, they   re all different. All of  them have little perks and traits and characteristics. We use the same  nutritionist, the same vet, the same feed trucks, the same feed programs.  If you don   t know, you can have two sisters that are identical twins and  not even remotely alike personality-wise. That   s kind of the way our  feed yards were. At the time, I called them the good, the bad, and the  ugly. I won   t tell you which feed yards I assigned the names to,  4 4  (Laughter) but it had more to do with how well the employees  themselves worked within the various departments. You can have three  very distinct departments that hate one another, or you can have three  departments that really you couldn   t tell the difference in any of them.  They   re all best friends. That was educational. I don   t know how  many   probably two, two and a half, maybe three years I did that.  When I got back from that and moved back into the office, they gave me  a title, and there really wasn   t anything to do. It was just   it   s hard to  take a company that   s fully employed and stick a person in and say,    All  right, here you go.    I started going to a lot of conventions and trade  shows, recruiting customers, not full-time but that   s how I   I had to kill  some time and do something. It   s not like I got to the office at eight and  had this list of chores to do in the morning. I   m not an accountant. I   m  not a lawyer. My dad was doing all the trading. I couldn   t do any of that.  I ended up just sort of making it up as I went.  A lot of the time was spent, like I said, at the trade shows, but a lot of the  education side of it really was board meetings. I knew now the physical  tasks you had to do when you received an animal, all the way through  the other end when you shove him back out the door and he would end  up on somebody   s table to eat. I didn   t know how anything else went to  work up at the office. Buying corn for the cattle, contracting on the  cattle, all that other stuff you had to do in order to make the business  run, 401K, health plans.  Now as CEO of the company, I spend almost no time looking at  anything that   s not straight, generic, business-oriented material with the  exception of commodity trading. I love to trade commodities. I do not do  it by myself. Anybody else up there can do it as well or probably better,  but I do enjoy it a lot. Most of my conversations have to do with  employee relations, workers comp, injury stuff, you name it. It   s the  business side of it now. It   s like Rick said. You can hire somebody to do  the manual labor, and that   s not where money   s made and lost. Money   s  made and lost up there at the office. You can make more money or lose  more money in a few days at the commodities board than you can do as  the feedlot manager in a year, a lot of times.  That   s really the way the business has evolved with my brother. We  have two feed yards, and we have a   operation with about 15,000 head  of sows that produce approximately 300,000 head of pigs. We   re  growing our hog operation. We   ll put in around 50,000 more head,  finished capacity. We   ll be somewhere in the neighborhood of 350,000  head by the end of the year. We actually leased the barns at the Seaboard  for a number of years, and we just got them back. We   re growing on that  side, whereas the cattle side is really shrinking.  4 5  That   s a result of several different factors. The biggest one being  drought. The last few years have killed off tens of millions of cows. You  can   t have a cow if there   s nothing to eat. Those cattle went to the  packing facility. If you kill a cow, it can   t have a calf next spring, so the  number of calves being born each year has gotten smaller, really, by and  large, since I got back in   98. It   ll have its peaks and valleys, but it   s  pretty much dropped steadily. We   ve had a reasonably dry period from    98 on. It   s been a lot of factors.  There   s also the generic cyclical nature of the commodity business.  You   ll have good years, bad years, good years. People say,    Hey, I need  to have more cows. I   m going to save a few of these heifers.    Bad years,  they say,    I don   t want to own any of them. I   m going to sell  everything.    The bad years, there   s lots of cattle to feed. The good years,  there   s not as many. We have been basically reacting to what the  market   s given us. We   re shrinking down our feedlot size. We sold one  feed yard, like I said, a few years ago. The feed yards now are not full,  don   t look to be full for quite a while.  We still are really bullish on the ag industry, beef production,  specifically hogs, as well. Long term, this is a pretty tough time period  for the cattle industry. Basically my brother and I had decided whenever  my dad died   Dad didn   t say,    You   re president. You   re not president,     or anything like that. He just keeled over. We kicked it around for a little  while, and what we decided to do was have a dual management team.  We went and looked at the articles of incorporation on the company, and  it required that there be a CEO and a chairman of the board   or no,  excuse me, president. A president and a chairman of the board, but it  didn   t say how many CEOs you could have. Technically, I   m president  and CEO, and Jason is Chairman of the Board and CEO. Additionally,  we have our head accountant, CFO, is kind of an assumed role. I   m  forty-one, he   s forty-two, my brother   s forty-three, so we got a really  young management team, which is good and bad.  The CFO runs the day-to-day operations of the company. Jason and I  have tended to focus, much like my grandfather, spend a lot of time  outside the company, politicking, doing the best we can to fight anybody  that   s against ag. You   ve got HSUS  Humane Society of the United  States , PETA  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals . You   ve  got EPA  Environmental Protection Agency . You   ve got various  different people nipping at you all the time, and we try to defend it.  The nice thing about having two CEOs is we bounce things off one  another. If you come in and ask me a question, I can always put you off  for a day or two until my brother gets around. The other side of it is if  4 6  you do have to have an answer right now, usually one of us is in the  office, and we can talk about it. At first we didn   t know if that was going  to work. It   s had its ups and downs, but, by and large, it   s worked pretty  well. Really, there   s enough work to go around. We don   t need to be  hogging it. We can share it out pretty well.  It   s been an interesting ride. It   s been difficult. My dad certainly had the  benefit of his father being around for a lot longer than I did. In an  industry that   s dominated by sixty- and seventy-year-old men, we are  decades younger than our contemporaries. My cousin over here, he   s  now with the company and working freelancing for us. I have another  cousin that moved back. In fact, he approached me at my father   s  funeral. He grew up in the cattle industry. His father was in the feed  yards. He moved away and was a teacher for several years. Graduated  from Oklahoma State, (go Pokes) got tired of the teaching deal, teaching  eighth grade and ninth grade, I think, and decided he wanted to get back  into the cattle business. He   s running our feed yard up on top of the hill.  We   ve got Rick and his family that have been with us forever.  We   ve got a number of forty-year employees that either are just about to  retire or have just retired. We   ve got a pretty big brain drain that   s  happening to our company. I don   t think we   re unusual. It   s just one of  those things. For a company that   s had anywhere from 250 to 350  employees for the last twenty years, losing a dozen or ten forty-year  employees over the course of five or so years is a lot of loss there. They  know where waterlines  are  that were put in the ground whenever I was  a toddler. It   s tough to replace them, and it   s certainly tough to replace  them with people of their same caliber.  You can   t identify that person until he   s worked for you for a long time,  twenty years. They lived in an era where you got a job at twenty-two,  and you quit the job at sixty-five. You didn   t change jobs three or four  times. Now kids stay at a job seven or eight years   or, I mean, they  change jobs seven or eight times, I think is what they say. From the time  that you graduate school and start your career, you   ll work for seven or  eight different companies. Kind of tough to identify and hold onto talent  whenever there   s turnover like that, as well as the fact that we live in  Guymon and it   s hard to get talent recruited here anyway.  As far as the cattle and the hogs go, we really don   t do things a whole lot  differently. At least the hogs (we just started the hogs) are relatively new  business for us. It is by far and away now our largest business. There   s  nothing that   s even close to it at our company. Would   ve been pretty  50/50 with cattle, and cattle have shrunk and hogs have expanded. We  still use the commodity board. It   s the lifeblood of the company. We  have to use it. The bankers, when we started out, fat cattle were costing  4 7  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  fifty-eight dollars, fat, twelve hundred pound animal, fifty-eight cents a  pound. They   re 162 cents a pound now. Hogs were eight cents. They are  95 to 110. Capital that you need to have, to put 100,000 head of cattle on  feed, you only need 105 million dollars. That   s a pretty dang big note   That   s a lot of money. It was 25 percent of that whenever I came back  from school.  People don   t understand it, but if you see a semi-load of cattle going  down the highway, you could say that that   s at least 100,000 maybe  130,000 dollars    worth of freight right there, every truck. I don   t care if  they   re 400-pounders or 1,200-pounders.  If they   re 400-pounders, they just stick more head in.  They just stick more in there. They cost less, but they   re still the same  dollar figure of money in that truck. It   s crazy the volume of money that  you have to spend for the opportunity to make as little as you can make.  Feeder cattle today, an eight-weight cattle, will cost you around 1,700  dollars a head. First call, that   s just delivered to your place. Then you  have to process them, deliver them, feed them, (some of them   s going to  die) and then sell them. If you could hedge every calf that you got for  thirty dollars, that would be wonderful, wouldn   t it, Chris?  Oh, heck, I   d be drawing more business.  You   re going to invest twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five hundred  dollars to make thirty. That   s not very good investment.  Yes.  That   s kind of the deal we   re in.  The farmers and ranchers of the world are the most optimistic people on  the face of the earth. It doesn   t rain, it doesn   t rain, it doesn   t rain, it  doesn   t rain. We were in the    30s when the Dust Bowl. We were right in  the center of it, and we   re still here. There   s no way you   re not an  optimist if you made it through the Dust Bowl and your grandchildren  are still doing the same thing. The sun   s going to shine. Hopefully it   ll  cloud up and rain a little bit, but that   s the mentality that we have is that  it   s going to get better. Even if it   s great right now, it   s going to get  better, or maybe it   s not going to get worse. I don   t know.  If you   re not committed to it emotionally and mentally, you don   t need  to be in the business. There   s not very many people that are going to get  rich in the cattle and in hogs. The media portrays it as all these fat-cats  living off the largess of the people, but if you look at those deals, they   re  4 8  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Finchum  Hitch  ranches like this that have been in business for 130 years. The King  Ranch in Texas is probably 1,500 sections, and it   s been in placement  over   I think it was in the 1850s when it started. Yes, there   s some  wealthy people in it     Most of them, though, it was oil and gas that made them.     but, by and large, it   s multi-generational entities that have lasted and  been lucky enough. There   s been some strategic planning on all of them,  but a lot of it   s still luck. If you   re the guy that made it through the Dust  Bowl, it was because you got a better banker. You got a little lucky.  They were able to absorb the guy next to him and grow and grow and  grow.  The ag industry, to me, there   s very few people (I can only name one or  two, Mike Smith being one) that has actually gone into the business and  multiplied and multiplied and multiplied. Now he owns two feedlots or  three feedlots, four or five ranches, and come from nothing. I mean,  most people that you see in the business today inherited a base. All of  these people that   s around here, they all had money. They all got a very  good start. It   s not like,    Well, I   m going to buy me two pens of cattle,  and then I   m going to snowball that and keep on going. Then I   ll buy me  some land, and then I   m going to buy a feedlot.    Your return on your  investment is pretty hard to do unless you   re in computers. Ted Turner,  you look at those guys, now, that   s a different deal. Chris was saying  that the guy that   s seventeen years old that didn   t graduate from high  school, look at Steve Jobs. (Laughter) You don   t really need to graduate.  It is definitely a lifestyle decision.  Has wind power had a role on your farm?  We have it. We have some generation units. The ranch is not quite as  simple as mine. My brother and I are 100 percent stockholders of Hitch  Enterprises. That   s 100 percent. Much of the land here actually belongs  to a trust that my great-grandfather, I think great-grandfather   he had  the foresight and the curse, if you will. He saw a lot of these ranches  being torn apart by their children. Whenever the father would die, the  children would squabble over it, sell it off, break it up, break it up to  where one person couldn   t make a living, so they sold the whole thing.  He didn   t want that to happen. What he did was he formed this  complicated generation skipping trust that Josh and I, my cousin, we   re  all beneficiaries of it. We   re not trustees; we   re beneficiaries.  What he did was he kept the land together. The problem is that Hitch  Enterprises that is the extension of his old ranch, what   s morphed into,  4 9  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  doesn   t own much of the property. It   s owned by a trust. Many of the  people who are beneficiaries of the trust don   t live here, don   t come  here, and don   t have anything to do with it. While they   ve not been  greedy,    give me a bunch of money    type deals, it   s still going to be a  problem sometime down the road. It   s like you   re kicking the can further  and further down the road. Eventually, it   s going to come through, that  note, and it   s going to have some interest on it. That   s going to be a  really interesting conversation at that time.  Josh knows what we   re talking about. Josh has come out here from  Bethesda. He   s a perfect example. Came out from Bethesda, Maryland,  thinking he would be here for six months, max, filming stuff for us,  taking pictures, and then quickly realized that six months was not even  remotely enough time to get it all done. Had he not come out here and  found a connection with everything and understood what   s going on and  why we do the things that we do, what is it to him? What does he want?  The most money he can get out of it. He   s a beneficiary of the trust.  Why would he want something else? It   s not that he   s evil or bad. It   s  the nature of the situation. A bunch of the land that they   re building  these turbines on is not really my land. It   s trust land. Some of it is  actually Hitch Enterprises land, but most of it, I think, is trust land.  With regards to how much they pay us, if I understand this correctly and  I may not, those big turbines aren   t quite what you call a real turnkey,  uncomplicated contraption. When you build a farm of them, a multi-unit  farm where there   s twenty-five or thirty or forty turbines, there   s a  whole bunch of weird electronic interferences that happen. It can take  years to get it all fine-tuned to where it   s running well. Additionally,  they   re still on a market for electricity that fluctuates over time. There   s  a base in there. That base is something like, I don   t even know, like  3,000 a turbine a year or some such a number. I don   t know exactly.  That   s the minimum that they   ll pay you for the turbine, or so many  kilowatt hours that they sell, and you get a percentage of that,  whichever   s greater. So far, they haven   t even come close to generating  near what they would have to do to get off the base. Now, long-term is it  a good deal? Yes, absolutely, it   s mailbox money. I don   t have to hire  anybody. I don   t have to manage anyone. I don   t have to do anything,  and theoretically I ought to receive a check every month. The royalties  are much the same way. It   s a way to increase income without increasing  work.  What year did they start on the ranch?  They probably came out in the early 2000s. There was a number of  companies that, I guess they could, so to speak, read the fortune and see  5 0  Nykolaiszyn  that it was coming. The money was going to be there. The tax breaks  and tax incentives were going to be there. They started laying down the  groundwork. They knew that they needed to have some studies to prove  that we had not only the volume of wind that they needed but the type of  wind. They want between these parameters of this slow and this fast, to  blow at a relative rate of this fast for so long. They don   t want thirty  days of no wind and then ten days with 200-mile-an-hour wind. A  horrible example, but to make a point. They   d rather have fifty days of  25-mile-an-hour winds every day. That   s what they need to make it  work, where it   s a nice steady stream of wind that they can sell.  They had to do studies, and so they started coming out, leasing up  options, buying options on the right to lease it later, if they could put up  a tower to measure the wind, figure out where it   s working, where it  won   t, and they   re using the valley here that we   re in, the north side less  so, but it   s going to be developed probably eventually, but definitely the  south side. They   re going to use that. They   re using the valley floor to  generate more wind than it would otherwise. I   m certainly not a  climatologist or whatever it is, scientist that studies this stuff, but it   s  been nice. I think that it   s a prime example that you just really don   t  know what you   ve got. Whenever I was here, there was no highline  wires. There was no wind turbines. You could park out here on the street  and not see a truck go by for two hours or three hours whenever I was a  kid. Now the road   s constantly got traffic on it. Whenever it gets dark,  there   s blinking lights everywhere across the horizon.  Everybody was really against them, right up until the time they started  getting out the checkbooks and saying,    We   re going to pay you for  damages on your land of this such.    Most of the time, like if they say ten  acres they   re going to damage while they   re putting up a wind turbine,  the land might only be worth a thousand dollars an acre, but they pay  you twenty-five hundred for the damage. These guys got their land paid  for and paid for in those specific areas. It   s been good for the surface  rights owners. Long-term, I think it   s going to be a good deal.  We   re actually in a massively energy   we have tons of energy here,  wind, solar, if you wanted to put up, but nobody is because of the wind. I  think that   s the problem. Also, we have lots of natural gas. Little bit of  oil, but not as much as the natural gas. We got plenty of power in the  area, so we   re shipping it out everywhere. We   re thinking about taking  some of the  inaudible  cattle manure, you can digest it, make a natural  gas, turn a generation unit. Before, we didn   t have anywhere to go with  electricity. Now we have an outlet. I think Florida Power is the   was it  Florida Light and Power or     Florida Power and Light.  5 1  Hitch  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Finchum  Hitch  Finchum  Hitch  Furnish  Is that what it is?  Yes.  They   re the actual ultimate purchaser of it. Going all the way to  Memphis is where it ties in to where the system that is actually going to  transport it out there. I   m sure you guys have heard     Underground?  No. No. You don   t put things like that underground. They   re too big, too  much heat generated.  How   s it going? We were curious.  There are some down there, and I can take you down there. Here in a  minute we can take a quick look. It   s got to be huge power lines, huge  power lines. They kind of backdoored into how they   re getting across  Oklahoma. What they figured out is they really didn   t want to try to  fight every single landowner and argue and negotiate. They   re going to,  but they wanted to have a stick to beat them up with. The way they got  the stick is eminent domain. If they are not an electric provider for the  state of Oklahoma or residents within the state of Oklahoma, you can   t  eminent domain. It has to be a service to the state of Oklahoma or to  people of the state of Oklahoma. What they did is they partnered with a  local electrical cooperative, and I don   t know where or which one it was.  Now this guy actually serves the state of Oklahoma in a ploy. Now they  can eminent domain you if they want to.  Now, we all know that it   s not the best thing to beat somebody up if you  can feed them a steak and make them feel good about coming across  your property. They are doing much the same thing, twenty-five hundred  dollars an acre, and I don   t know what total numbers, but big money,  more than the land   s actually worth, to cross the property. There will  still be a few people that   ll say,    I don   t want it, not on me.    Those guys,  they   ll say,    You know what? We   ve got six hundred miles of property  here, and there   s only three different disruptions in it. We   re going to  use eminent domain to cross your property. We   re going to pay you the  same thing that we paid everybody else, but we   re going to do it.    Like I  said, it   s kind of sneaky. It   s a backdoor way to get through it, but I  don   t even know when that projects going to be done. They   ve laid one  line. I know it came from Woodward. I don   t know where from  Woodward it went.  Oklahoma City.  5 2  Hitch  Furnish  Finchum  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Furnish  Did it? You can see it. If you   re driving, it   s on the south side of the  road.  It goes all the way to Oklahoma City. How did y   all come? Did you  come up through Watonga?  Out 412.  Yes, yes, it   s on the south side of the road between here and Woodward.  You can look off and see it at places.  Right before you get to Watonga it   s on the north side of the road. It   s  the same power line, runs all the way to Oklahoma City. It cost them 1.3  million dollars a mile.  They finished it this past year. That   s the first trunkline that they built.  This other one is bigger, and it will service a lot more people. The  system out here, everything that   s built is going through the smaller one.  When the bigger one gets built, there   ll be a lot more wind turbines go  up.  They have that booster station for it, also. Anything that   s generated in  Oklahoma goes to the Oklahoma booster. Anything that   s generated in  Texas goes to the Texas booster. There   s two booster stations down  there, and they might be a half a mile apart. One of them   s in Texas, and  one of them   s in Oklahoma.  There was a time when if the electricity generated in Oklahoma did not  benefit an Oklahoman, you didn   t get the tax incentive. Even though a  lot of these wind turbines were actually in Oklahoma, they built the     it   s not a booster. It takes it from DC to AC or whatever to transport it. I  don   t understand electricity real well. I   m a businessman. I don   t know.  It makes the electricity to where you can ship it. It   s right on the Texas  line in Texas because Texas doesn   t care where it   s generated. It   s put  up and taken a hold of in Texas and then sent. They have the tax  incentive, so all this money started flowing out into Texas. That   s  whenever they figured it out. By the way, if you   re going to work on  them, where you going to work? In Oklahoma with income tax, or are  you going to move right down there into Texas and work where you  have no state income tax?  All the first ones that was put in, they was all in Texas. People would  argue with me.    Well, some of those   .    I said,    They   re not in  Oklahoma.     5 3  Hitch  Furnish  Hitch  Finchum  Hitch  Furnish  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  Finchum  Hitch  Go to the line.  Go to the line and look. They   re not very far in Texas, but they   re in  Texas.  This whole south rim and a bunch of the north. My brother, he   s got the  map. They figured out this little area over here   s not that good for  whatever reason. I don   t know why. This area over here on the north  side is much better, and it   s going to be developed a bunch. It might be  ten, twelve years before it gets developed because they   ve got to get the  lines in and all that stuff.  Got wind?  Hopefully it   ll stop being this windy around here. If they get enough of  them up, maybe it   ll slow stuff down, right? (Laughter) Like having  these trees, you can hear the wind blowing, but it   s not that bad.  That   s what I told my wife. We was driving along, and she said,    How  come there   s only eight windmills over there?    I said,    It   s all they can  put up. The wind comes up here and hits them eight mills and stops.    I  drove on down the road a while,    No it doesn   t.    I said,    Okay.     (Laughs)  Well, as we start to wind down, tell me a little bit about your mother.  Mom, she lived right there in the big house. Like I said, that   s the  original house. It burned down in the early    90s, and they rebuilt it. She  was a teacher, pre-babies, and then she was a housewife. Now she   s a  doting grandmother. I have two kids, and she spends, well, more than  sometimes I think my wife wants her down there. She wants to come  down and hold babies and hang out. Really, she   s just a widow. She   s  seventy-one, and at this point, she   s had some surgeries and stuff.  Doesn   t get around as well as she used to get around. Her days are spent  hanging out at the ranch with babies as much as possible. Never did  work for the company, no background. Her father was a career  accountant for Phillips in Bartlesville.  Did it take much to convince her to move to Guymon from Bartlesville?  You know, she   s also cut from that same roll where, maybe, talked back  a little bit more and expressed an opinion than some of my  grandmothers. Definitely was,    He   s the guy making the money. He   s  the head of the household, and that   s where I   m going to go.    I don   t  think there was a lot of negotiation of it. If you met me when my dad   it  wasn   t like it was a surprise that whenever we graduated we were going  5 4  Nykolaiszyn  Hitch  back to Guymon. If you wanted to be grumpy about it, it   s your ow
