Story_ID: 371161
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you five People ques- People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just so that we can get warmed up.  What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I like the spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, I'd have to say chicken.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: And a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I kind of like the Bahamas.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I have two phrases that originated with my, interestingly enough, with my father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] and my grandmother, that my paternal grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] used to say all the time.  My father used to always kid me by saying, you know, "Never try to be what you ain't, because when you try to be what you ain't, you ain't what you is."  (Laughter) And I always remembered that phrase over the years.  And then my grandmother had one about, I can recall when I went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and, you know, I was all excited about finally graduating and being a Morehouse man.  And we were gathered once there with family, and everybody was congratulating me.  And she was kind of sitting over in the corner, but she wasn't saying anything.  And I went over and said, "Mama, you're not saying anything, you know what I mean.  I've been working hard for this, you know, and I finally finished Morehouse.  I'm now a Morehouse man, you know what I mean."  She said, "Well, very good.  You know, Baby, I'm glad you're a Morehouse man.  You've earned it," she said.  "But I want you to remember one thing for me."  I said, "What's that?"  She said, "Never forget where you come from, because you ain't left there yet."  (Laughter) And I always remembered that through the years.  And then the other one, the last one of course, was she used to tell me this, particularly after I got involved with the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] and the civil rights stuff.  She said, "You know, it really doesn't matter the color of the hand that slaps.  It hurts just as much."  You know, so those, those three phrases have always stayed with me over the years.
Story_ID: 371162
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to talk about your mother's [Charlotte Anderson Dye] side of the family.  Can you remember your grandmother [Charlotte Anderson] or your great-grandmother [Sadie Dallas]?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I remember more my grandmother than my great-grandmother.  I don't ever remember meeting my great-grandmother, because I think by that time she was already deceased.  But certainly I remember my grandmother and my paternal grandmother that I'm talking about now.  Her name was Angeline Dye, Angeline Westmoreland Dye.  That was, her maiden name was Westmoreland.  And she, she's probably one of the people that meant the most to me and contributed most to my life.  That's who I was talking about earlier, about getting those phrases.  And she, she was really part Indian [Native American].
Speaker 1: What type of Indian?
Speaker 2: I think Cherokee, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was a beautiful woman, and very bright, very talented.  And I guess I remember her a lot.  And I don't remember ever talking about a great-grandmother.  It was more of a great aunt, an aunt, who was my grandfather's [Corley Dye, Sr.] sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were around more than anybody else.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather's sister?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Her name was Ida Olive, Ida Lee Olive [Ida Dye Olive].  And we, we kind of had I guess what you would call an extended family.  We all were right there together, so they were very much a part of my life growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandmother, how much education did she have?
Speaker 2: I think my grandmother probably went--I don't think she finished high school.  She probably went, finished elementary.  She may have had one year of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And about the same was the case with my granddaddy.
Speaker 1: Did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: No.  She, well, yes she did.  I take that back; for a while she did.  She used to work, she used to do a little domestic work.  Obviously during that time in Atlanta [Georgia] and, you know, most of the nation, that was probably what was available for a lot of our people.  But she didn't do a lot of that.  She was a seamstress during the early years, and she could sew very well, and she used to do a lot of that.  She would make different kinds of garments and sell them, you know, and different people would come to her as a seamstress.  And then later on, she enrolled in a course in catering, cake decorating.  And she did a lot in terms of decorating cakes, and kind of catering little affairs.  As a matter of fact, she was very close and very involved with Mrs. Mary Jordan [Mary Belle Griggs Jordan], who was Vernon Jordan's [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] mother.  I kind of grew up with the Jordan family, primarily because my grandmother had a very close relationship with Mrs. Mary Jordan who was Vernon's mother.  And she would decorate a lot of the cakes, and work with Mrs. Jordan in the catering business.
Story_ID: 371163
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories to share or things that she might have--you gave us one, you know, a phrase that your [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] told you.  But I'm sure there's other things that she shared with you.
Speaker 2: Well, I think probably the most significant thing is that my grandmother was the kind who was not only grandmother, but she was also like mama as well.  And it was due primarily because of the fact that we, for a number of years, lived with my grandparents.  In other words, when my father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] got married, he just brought his wife [Charlotte Anderson Dye] home.  And we kind of all stayed right there with my grandparents in the same house.  There was good and bad to that, of course.  But it was, she was just kind of the matriarch of the family, and she remained that really up until the time that she died.  But she, she was a very interesting woman.  She was a very enterprising woman, and one that was very religious, but also very knowledgeable about life and about things.  And she was probably the best counselor you ever seen.  Because she could tell you exactly what was going on, and what you needed to do, and how you needed to do it.  And I, even now, much of what I think I carried through my adult life, and certainly even into my marriage and my career, as I look back I can trace a lot of that to the conversations with my grandmother that I used to have growing up.  She truly was a tremendous woman.
Speaker 1: Was there anything in particular that you--that still sticks in your mind that she might have taught you, or gave you advice on?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the main thing was that, you know, she always wanted me to know, to believe in myself.  See, you have to understand that she was one of the champions of that.  You know, I was always the kind of runt in the bunch, you know, in terms of growing up.  And you know, I was, Little Clint [HistoryMaker Clinton E. Dye, Jr.], and I was always the guy that was the smallest in the group.  And naturally, I had to be the toughest in the group, because I was the smallest.  (Laughter) But she would, she was the first who would always say, you know, "It doesn't matter about size," you know.  "It's not your stature that matters.  It's what you got up here, and what's in here."  And you were talking about sayings a while ago, and I remember she was the first I heard say, "You know, now all you have to remember is that you're a little piece of leather, but you are well put together."  She said, "So anytime that you start having any doubts about anything, just remember what I said, that you are a little piece of leather, but you are well put together."  And it was just that kind of thing.  You know, she was always there to be understanding.  Now she was, you had to do what she said.  I mean, she didn't play around.  But it was the kind of love and nurturing that certainly, hopefully, I carried over, in terms of my relationships not only with my wife [Myrtice Willis Dye], but also with my own sons [Trevin G. Dye and Clinton E. Dye, III].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember, well, you might not remember when she was born?  But do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Wow, I really don't.
Speaker 1: Do you know how old she was when she died?
Speaker 2: She was well into her eighties when she died.  She was very close to eighty years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She died about fifteen years ago, I think.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years ago?
Speaker 2: I'm almost embarrassed, I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Story_ID: 371164
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your [paternal] grandfather [Corley Dye, Sr.], tell me about him.
Speaker 2: My granddaddy was a very energetic man also.  He was a carpenter, a painter, and a wallpaper hanger.  He was all those things, and very good at what he did.  He probably was my first exposure to someone being self-employed and having a business.  We talk now here at the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] about entrepreneurship and all these things.  But my granddaddy stands out in my mind as one of those people that we know we've had throughout the years that really wasn't necessarily looking for working for anybody, but wanted to have his own business.  And he pretty much did that.  He was a very strong person, you know, in terms of what he felt a man should do in terms of supporting the family and providing for them.  Now he was also known to have a good time, too, (laughter) and he did that very well.  There are probably some out there right now that can tell me about how during the younger years he was, he was known to be kind of a ladies' man a little bit.  But he, he, he taught me a lot.  I can recall--as a matter of fact, you know, it's very interesting.  As I think back about the Atlanta [Georgia] of my childhood--and of course, segregation was the order of the day.  And I can remember times when I was working with my grandfather as a small child.  I guess I was about--maybe I wasn't that small.  I was about ten or eleven years old.  And I would always go with him during the summers and weekends when he was painting and things.  And during that time, he didn't really have the finances to purchase his own truck.  So what we would have to do is actually ride, we had to use public transportation.  We'd have to actually ride the bus.  And of course, during that time you had to sit on the back.  And I can recall us getting on a crowded bus to leave downtown Atlanta to ride up to Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia], on the north side of Atlanta, to some of the houses that he was painting.  And we'd get on the bus with these paint buckets and drop cloths, you know, and everything.  And we'd get all these stares from the white passengers as we passed through.  Sometimes you had to make your way through even the blacks that were standing, because, you know, there were limited seats.  And we sometimes would have to stand, you know, with those buckets and drop cloths and all those kinds of things, to get to the houses up there that he was painting.  And I learned a lot from that experience, in terms of the stick-to-it-ness and the pride in knowing what you were doing, et cetera,  but I also learned a lot about, I guess that was my first real exposure about race relations in terms of the kind of encounters we had not only on the buses, but also that we had in some of those homes that we painted.  And you know, a thing that happened years later was for me to learn and to have the opportunity as not only the head of the Urban League, but some of the other organizations that I had, that I've been involved with over the years, to actually sit on various committees with the children of some of those folks, you know, who were at the time maybe my age or younger when we were doing that, and to discuss sometimes with them some of the experiences my granddad and I had painting their houses.
Story_ID: 371165
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Share some of those experiences.
Speaker 2: Well, for example, you know, to give you an example.  Of course, during that time, you know, we had to paint the houses of course.  And a lot of the work was exterior painting, although we did have some interior jobs.  But some of the things that stick out in my mind for example is like going--riding the bus, going through the experience I just explained--and then going to these homes.  And we would paint, but just to give you an example: if you wanted water, if you got thirsty during the day and you asked for water, then they would, you know, bring you water to the back steps, right; you know, a pitcher of water and a cup, one cup sometimes for both of us.  And sometimes the cups would not be, they were naturally were not used for their best--whatever.  And sometimes the cups were obviously cracked, you know, where they had put them back together.  And these would be cups--I'm sure you've had the experience of having a cup that you put change in, or marbles, or whatever, or just use it as a kind of receptacle for things that you're holding on to.  And they would obviously just empty the cup out.  And they wouldn't even wash it, you know, they just emptied it out and put it out there.  So, that's the kind of thing that you would have to be subjected to.  As well as some of the most degrading things I mean would be if you had to go to the bathroom.  You know, naturally, they were not going to allow you to come into their homes to use the bathroom.  So, you would have to--you couldn't relieve yourself around their property, so you'd have to use the empty paint buckets or whatever, you know, in the garage and that kind of thing.  And to really think back about some of those experiences, and then on the good side to see how far we've come in a lot of areas, and to be able to sit with some of the children of these same folks, you know, has been quite an experience here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I think sometimes that's one of the rewards of saying you're a native Atlantan, when you can actually see what changes have actually taken place in this city.  And it did a lot for me in providing a different kind of backdrop, which is to do with the work of the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] and some of the other things, in terms of how you're able to do that.  All of that I think about, when I think about him.
Speaker 1: What is your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Corley, C-O-R-L-E-Y, H. Dye, Sr. [Corley Dye, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And old was he when he passed away?
Speaker 2: He was in his seventies, if I recall right.  He had to be about 72, 73, something like that.
Story_ID: 371166
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your father.  What is his name?
Speaker 2: My father, also his name is Clinton E. Dye, Sr.  And my daddy was Daddy, you know.  He, as I said, even though we lived there in the house for most of our childhood in my grandparents' [Angeline Westmoreland Dye and Corley Dye, Sr.] house--
Speaker 1: Where was--
Speaker 2: We grew up in the Old Fourth Ward here in Atlanta [Georgia], around the old David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia].  And some folks in the city that have been here for a while remember that as being called Hell's Kitchen over in there.  That was the bootleg district.  (Laughter) Not McGruder Street, but certainly Irwin [Street] and Sampson [Street] and a lot of areas around there, you know.  We, everybody, not everybody, but a number of folks would, you know, were selling white lightning.  You'd go there on the weekends and during the week and get what they call the quarter shots, you know, the quarter shots and fifty cents shots.  As a matter of fact, when I was growing up, because of my size, my nickname with a lot of the guys--my Dad would always take me everywhere with him, you know.  So naturally, I would go to a lot of the bootleg houses with him and with the guys that he kind of hung out with.  During that day, they didn't have sports bars, so people hung out in these shotgun houses, or shot houses.  And of course I knew every shot house in Atlanta almost.  And they would call me Quarter Shot, (laughter) because of my size.  That was always my nickname, you know, "Here comes Clinton and his Quarter Shot," you know.  But he was, he was a very bright, bright guy.  My dad was probably the first licensed black plumber in Georgia.  He worked for years for a black plumber here called C.C. Hart, Plumbing company [Atlanta, Georgia], which was a plumbing company, one of the few black plumbers here in Atlanta that was located down on Auburn Avenue.  And my dad for years worked for that company, and he did a lot of work in plumbing.  He had, one of the things that he did have, of course, that presented some problems for me as far as I'm concerned, is that he did have a drinking problem.  And I think that that was the biggest influence on me, if you look at the early part of my career.  Because after I finished the School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia], I spent a lot of time working in the field of mental health and addiction, particularly in the line of addiction.  And of course, alcoholism and that kind of thing was one of the main things that I always focused on.  And I still have a very strong interest in addictive disorders, and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 371167
Speaker 1: Was your father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] the disciplinarian in your home?
Speaker 2: Well, pretty much, but I think my mother was more of the disciplinarian.  And my dad would discipline when pushed, but he was more of a compromiser.  She was the disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she, she was the one that was generally going to pull out the switch, if necessary.  But we, you know, we always had ways of dealing with that, I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because this is one of the problems that I told you about earlier, about the extended family thing.  Because you know, we could always play my mother off against my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye], and my grandmother off of my mother.  You know, we could always--when we got in trouble we could put our case between the court of appeals (laughter), which was generally my grandmother, to, you know, kind of see if we couldn't work this out.  And if it came down to really thinking you're going to get a whipping, you know, we would always do little things like go get the dog.  Because we always had a dog that was very protective, you know, and my mother wasn't going to be able to whip us as long as the dog was around.  (Laughter) Because he loved her, but he'd get her if she tried to whip us, you know.  So, we'd do little crazy things like that.  And of course it didn't help, because you'd just--the whipping would be even harder after that, and sometimes even the dog got a whipping, you know.  (Laughter) But I would say that the strongest disciplinarian was probably my mother.
Speaker 1: Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Charlotte Inez [Charlotte Anderson Dye].
Speaker 1: Spell that for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) C-H-A-R-L-O-T-T-E.  And she was, she was short, a very beautiful woman.  She was, she was, like my grandmother said, she was a little piece of leather but she was well put together.  (Laughter) She wouldn't take very much.
Speaker 1: Let me go back to your dad [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.].  Do you know when your dad was born?
Speaker 2: I know my dad's birthday was in April.  I think it was April 10th, I can't remember the exact year.
Speaker 1: Is he still living?
Speaker 2: No, no, he's deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother [Charlotte Anderson Dye], when was she born?
Speaker 2: My mom's birthday was also in April.  I think it was April 11th.
Speaker 1: And how old did they, well, how old did your father live to be?
Speaker 2: My father, when my father died he was about sixty-four.  And my mother died when she was about, she was close to, in her seventies, seventy-two or something like that.
Story_ID: 371168
Speaker 1: So, share some more about your mother.  What kind of mother was she?
Speaker 2: She, she was a little country girl (laughter).  My mother was born down in, let's see, what's the name [Oxford, Georgia]?  It was in, below Conyers, Georgia.  And she, they moved to Atlanta [Georgia] of course.  And there were always, there were ties with the folks in the country from her side, her mother's [Charlotte Anderson] side.  But she, she was a very energetic woman, she did well.  As I think about it, though, I kind of see some of the struggles she had in trying to be in an extended family, and trying to be the head of her family and yet in many respects being treated as just one of the other children there in the house [of Dye's paternal grandparents, Angeline Westmoreland Dye and Corley Dye, Sr.], you know.  And of course, we didn't help it, because you know, when it was to our advantage, she was one of the children there in the house.  But she, she worked for years at Scripto [Scripto Pen Company].  And of course she had her struggles with my dad sometimes drinking and things, but--and of course, that didn't help the situation there, because it was a classic situation with families who were struggling with alcoholism.  You know, you always--and in my case I was the oldest son.  So, in my case it was always that--I won't say love/hate, but kind of the struggle that goes on between me and my dad.  Because on the one hand, I'm his son, but I'm also the one in the house that's seemingly stepping into his role, you know.  So, it was a competition thing going on there.  And you know, it was fine as long as he wasn't drinking.  But if he was drinking, you know, there was always--I had to referee things and be the policeman in the family, and kind of keep things straight.  I can recall on several occasions, again, looking at the situation in Atlanta.  And she worked on the, my mother worked on the night shift at Scripto, which means she worked the 3 to 11 [o'clock] shift.  And a lot of times when she got off it would be like 11, and by the time she came out of the plant, maybe 11:30.  And again, you know, we didn't have an automobile or that kind of thing, so I would have to walk down to the plant to stand outside to be able to walk her back home at night like that.  And of course, you know, it was always a very, you know, tenuous situation.  Because you would have men who would ride around at night, a lot of times white men, and would harass the women or anybody else that was on the street or on the street corners.  It was not common, it was not uncommon that sometimes if you were on the corner, or if you were walking, to have a car pass and people would throw urine or something out of the car on you, you know, just anything.  So I would always wait on her to go, to walk her back home, because my dad may not be there, or if he were there he may be asleep because he'd passed out from drinking or something.  So I'd go get her.  And then of course after I got a little older and got into college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and started working and had a car, then I would, you know, I'd go pick her up in the car.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mom have?
Speaker 2: She went to, I think she went to eighth grade.
Story_ID: 370719
Speaker 1: We were talking about your mother [Charlotte Anderson Dye].  But did you know your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yes, her name is Charlotte also.  Charlotte Anderson was her name.  And I said earlier that they were from Conyers [Georgia], but they were actually from Oxford, Georgia, that's exactly where they were from.  She was interesting, too.  She was probably on the other end of the spectrum from my paternal grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye].  She was the partier, the socializer.  You know, and her advice was always--and what she wanted to know all the time was, "Boy, you got a girlfriend?" (Laughter) Stuff like that.  She loved her grandchildren too though, just as much, and she was always there.  But you kind of got a nice balance, you know.  Because my grandmother on my daddy's [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] side was kind of the second mama, and kind of the disciplinarian and the anchor in the way you needed to go.  And if you wanted to kind of just hang loose a little bit, you know, my grandmother on my mama's side was always the one to, you know, Charlotte was the one to do that.  She loved to cook, you know, and she was always cooking collard greens and that kind of thing, you know.  And my grandmother on my daddy's side, though, she would be concerned--I can recall when those aluminum, the cookware, came out about steaming your food, and that it was healthy and all that.  My grandmother was into that kind of thing.  But if you wanted some real fatback and some other stuff, you know, Charlotte was the one that would throw that together for you.  But she was just kind of like that.  She was the exact opposite from my grandmother on my daddy's side.
Speaker 1: What did she do?  Was she, did she stay at home, or--
Speaker 2: She was kind of a domestic also.  She, in fact, most of the women at that time in her generation worked for white families.
Speaker 1: So, they lived out in the country.  When you went out there to visit, what was it like?
Speaker 2: They didn't.
Speaker 1: They didn't?
Speaker 2: She didn't; her relatives were still in Oxford.  So, we would always go down for those--you know how you have the family reunions in the summertime?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And the people from down there would always come up sometimes to visit.  But she lived right here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we all lived on the same street, right on McGruder Street.  And they lived, my mother's mother and her grandmother lived down the street from us.  As a matter of fact, you asked earlier about my great-grandmother.  I didn't know my great-grandmother on my paternal grandmother's side, but I knew my great-grandmother on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her name was Sadie Dallas.  And I knew her, because she was still living at the time.  I didn't know a whole lot about her background other than she was there, and we'd go up to her house all the time.  But I did, I did have a relationship with her, I knew about her.  And I guess I knew more about the great-grand and all on my mother's side than I did with my, my paternal grandmothers.
Story_ID: 370720
Speaker 1: Let's now begin to talk about you.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Maybe I'll remember something about me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What is your earliest memory of your childhood?
Speaker 2: I guess my earliest memory is westerns, you know.  I was, you know, a student of the cowboys.  You know, I was the guy who would always know about Hoot Gibson, and Hopalong Cassidy, and Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers, and Lash LaRue, and all those folks, you know.  And when they first came on the television, you know, television was very new then, not everybody had a television.  I think it was about as big as, as large as a large cake box.  But you know, if you got a television set, then all the kids in the neighborhood would always come to your house and look at television.  And they would run those same western movies over and over and over.  So I kind of got into westerns, you know.  And I can recall tying a string and a rope on a stick, and that was the horse.  And you'd put this gun on, and you'd ride out in the backyard or down the alley in the back of the house.  And that was your imaginary range, you know.  So you always, there were always cattle and horses to round up, and rustlers to run out of town, and that kind of thing.  And I spent a lot of time doing that, probably almost too much time.  Because I think when I stopped riding the stick, I was probably about thirteen years old (laughter).  And I would sneak out there after school and ride that stick, you know.  A lot of my playmates had gotten to the point that they didn't want to ride that stick anymore, so I'd have to ride by myself.
Story_ID: 370721
Speaker 1: Do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have, there were five of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me the order, and where you fit in in the order.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm the second in siblingship.  I have a sister, Constance [Constance Dye Thomas], who was two years older than I am.  Constance died last year in an auto accident
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so sorry.
Speaker 2: And then me of course.  Then I have another sister, Beverly [Beverly Dye], who is about two years younger than I am.  It's kind of thinned out.  And then we had a brother, Victor [Victor Dye], and then the baby is Delores [Delores Dye Brown].  Out of the five, there are only three of us living now.  Constance died last year in the accident.  And then I guess a few months before that, well, maybe about a year before her death, my brother died.  And so now it's Beverly, myself, and Delores out of the five.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your brother ride the stick with you?
Speaker 2: No, he was too young.  (Laughter) I kind of rode alone, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I had these imaginary companions, of course, my padres--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: --who were riding with me.  You know, as I said earlier, in terms of mental health stuff--I don't know.  Some may have interpreted some of that stuff that I was doing--and talking--as just a little pathological, you know (laughter).  But you know, as I think about it now, though, there were--you know, as we talk about what's happening through the media in terms of crime and in terms of violence and sex and this kind of thing--as I think about some of the values that I learned and that really kind of shaped my life from that point on, I learned a lot of it from those movies.  Because, you know, there were always the white hats and the black hats, and there were always ways that the cowboys always treated women and respected women, and the appreciation they had for justice and right, and that kind of thing.  I learned that stuff from, you know, Roy Rogers and Lash LaRue and Hoot Gibson and all those folks.  So, it was really more than just the sticks and the guns, et cetera.  There was a lot that came through those movies for me--about being a man, and what one should do in terms of respect for women, and a whole lot of other things--family, appreciation for family, all of that.

Speaker 1: Describe what holidays were like at your house.
Speaker 2: Holidays were always kind of like the old 'Soul Food' movie, you know (laughter).  You know, everybody always had the big dinners and things.  But you know, to be very honest with you, it really wasn't necessarily the holidays; it was that way on the weekends, you know.  I mean, I guess every weekend was a holiday.  Because, you know, people would work all the week, and then they'd get together on the weekends.  And folks would just get together in one house or the other and eat.  But that was true not just with your own family, but that was true with the folks in the neighborhood and everything else, you know.  We talk about the village, in terms of the child and all of that, but we truly had that then.  But we would get together on holidays.  I mean, Christmas and the others, they would be a little more special than--you know, out of the normal.  And you would, you know, you'd share your gifts.  Everybody would have their gifts.  And generally, everybody would almost have the same thing, because everybody would want the same thing, I mean among the kids in the neighborhood.  Skating was a big thing, of course.  You know, everybody wanted to skate.  But you know, you'd wake up on Christmas morning, and you couldn't wait to get in there to get your gift and get out.  And of course, long after you knew that there wasn't a Santa Claus, you didn't say it (laughter).  You know, because you were told, "Well, if you know there's no Santa Claus, there's no need to go through all this anymore."  So, everybody was always excited about Christmas and special times.
Story_ID: 370723
Speaker 1: What were some of the street games that you played?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you had, kids played marbles; they shot marbles.  And you always played ball in the streets, you know, football, baseball in the streets or in an empty lot somewhere.  But you know, those were generally the games you played, football and baseball, everybody played that.  You would also do things like ride bikes.  You know, you'd have bike races to see who's the fastest and this kind of thing.  One game that we would very often play was hide and go seek, of course.  You know, we'd find some tree or pole, and that was the base.  And then everybody would have to go and hide, you know.  And I'm sure you played that.  So, we did a lot of that.  It's interesting, traffic wasn't nearly as heavy then, and folks were a lot more courteous in terms of not running over the kids.  So, the street was probably the only place you could play, and that was primarily the kind of games we played in the street.
Speaker 1: Did you roller skate up and down the street?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of roller skates did you have?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I had the, I had the Western Flyers.  I mean those were the only kind.  I mean if you didn't have those, don't come out, you know (laughter).  And there's something else we used to do.  We also used to make scooters with the skates.  You know, once the skates got to the point that they were a little worn, then we would get two by fours and cut them up and make a scooter, and the skates would provide the wheels for that.  Or, we would make boxcars with the--you know, that you could actually put the skates on.  And later, we went to wheels off of some of the carriages and things.  But yeah, I had skates, man.  If you couldn't skate, you couldn't--don't come out; don't come out here, you know (laughter).  And you had to have the right thing, because if you didn't, they'd laugh you out from there if you didn't have the right kind of skates.
Story_ID: 370724
Speaker 1: So, you said the name of the street that you lived on was McGruder?
Speaker 2: McGruder Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was the community like?  Who lived in that area?  What type of jobs did your neighbors have?
Speaker 2: Most of the folks were naturally blue-collar workers, obviously.  There were quite a few painters and people who worked at some of the plants around there, you know, around some of the offices.  We probably didn't have that many professional people.  A lot of the women probably worked as domestics, and that kind of thing.  But then later on, we began to get some folks who would teach music and do things like that, piano, you know.  The church was very much the center of everything.  People sang in the choir, you know, and we did that kind of thing.  Schools, you know, were very important.  David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was right there, and then John Hope [John Hope Elementary School; John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], and some of the other elementary schools.  So, that was always it.  The houses were, they were modest houses, you know, what we called shotgun houses.  And those were the ones, you know, where you could stand at the front and look all the way through it, right out into the backyard.  The bathrooms, during the early part of my childhood, the bathrooms were out in the backyard.  And we used to tell jokes about late at night it always took two people to go to the bathroom, because it's going to take one to hold the flashlight (laughter), and the umbrella, if it was raining.  So, you know, you had to stay in with everybody in the family, because you don't ever know who you may have to get to take you to the bathroom.  (Laughter) But then later on, of course, the city, the county in particular, began to say that all of the bathrooms had to be indoors.  And we were particularly lucky, because my father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] was a plumber, and my granddaddy [Corley Dye, Sr.] was a carpenter.  So, we were able to expand our house considerably.  At first it was a duplex, you know, with my mother [Charlotte Anderson Dye] and father and us on one side, and my [paternal] grandparents on the other side.  And they, my granddaddy bought the house, and then he was able to build on the back of it and make it one house, a single family home.  And we continued to live there, and the bathroom was moved inside, and that kind of thing.  So, we were living high on the hog there, in terms of having, you know, an indoor house, an indoor bathroom.  And during that time, I would say that in Atlanta [Georgia], public housing was the place to be, you know.  We talk now about the projects and all of that.  But during that time, if you could get into the Grady Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], you were doing something, you know.  Because, you know, naturally Grady Homes is the projects, and they had all of the indoor facilities and everything else.  So, everybody was trying to get into something like the Grady Homes, in order to move up from some of the situations that they were in.  But that was the Atlanta; that was black Atlanta pretty much during that time.
Story_ID: 370725
Speaker 1: What kind of outings did your--did your family go on outings?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We would go, there were always picnics, and we would do that.  Or--
Speaker 1: Where would you go on a picnic?
Speaker 2: Well, we'd go the park, for example.
Speaker 1: Which park?
Speaker 2: Mozley Park [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd go out to Mozley Park sometimes.  And then at one point we were--I mentioned to you that my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] was working with Mrs. Jordan, Mary Jordan [Mary Belle Griggs Jordan], Vernon's [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] mother.  And they, they had property down near, where was that?  I'll think of it in a minute.  But they had, she had a large plot of land down there with a lake on it.  And from time to time, everybody would get together and they'd take us all down to that lake.  And naturally, by her being in catering we had plenty of food and stuff like that.  And a lot of times, if she wasn't going, she'd allow us to go down there.  So we'd go down to that lake and spend time on the property down there.  But that was pretty much it, those were the kinds of outings.  Sometimes you would go to places like Rock City up in Chattanooga [Tennessee], and different kinds of places--get the kids together and go up there.  Granny had a truck, so everybody would pile in the back of that panel truck, the same one we would use to paint in (laughter).
Speaker 1: So eventually you did get a truck?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to ride the bus anymore?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had a truck, and later on a station wagon.  And you know, everybody was doing pretty good.  And I think that probably the first real situation in terms of employment was the post office, of course.  A lot of kids got jobs at the post office, and were able to make a fairly good living there.  I would say that the post office at one time probably accounted for, the major contributors to the black middle class in Atlanta [Georgia].  Because it wasn't uncommon that even if you had a college degree, you know, you ended up working at the post office, you know.  There were a lot of folks at the post office with degrees from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and everywhere else who actually worked there and retired.  I, for example, all during the time of my going to college, I worked at Lockheed [Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To support my education.
Speaker 1: Do you ever, did your mother [Charlotte Anderson Dye] ever take you and your siblings to ride the Pink Pig?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't remember riding the Pink Pig but maybe one time.  I never was into the Pink Pig (laughter).
Speaker 1: I just know that it's Atlanta tradition.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was there, and I can remember it.  But you know, I don't remember as much about riding the Pink Pig as I do about carnivals and things.  You know, there used to be a lot of carnivals that came, and the circus would come through Atlanta very frequently.  And we probably spent more time at the carnival and the circus, and stuff like that than actually riding the Pink Pig.  To tell you the truth, a lot of times during that time it was always--it depends on how much you wanted to withstand when you'd go to places like that.  Because naturally, your experience is going to be quite different from the white kid who's getting on the Pink Pig.  And you know, they would do things like that.  We even had friends that worked at places like Macy's and Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, so they would encourage us to go.  But I really don't recall going that much.  Honestly, I don't recall taking my own kids out there but maybe a couple of times to ride the Pink Pig.  My wife's [Myrtice Willis Dye] on me now about taking our little grandchild to ride the Pink Pig, you know (laughter).  So I guess I'll have to do that.
Story_ID: 370726
Speaker 1: When you think of your childhood, what are some of the sounds, the smell, or the sights that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, sounds and smells.  There's some good ones and bad, to be very honest with you.  Sounds would be sounds of the laughter in the house, the music, of course.  You know, you'd always get together every Friday night, and we'd have Friday night fish fries every night, and not always just to pay the rent, you know (laughter).  But sometimes it was the entertainment.  And I always remember the music, the dancing, the sound of beer bottles and everything else that was all a part of that, and of course, that same smell with the food and the, everything that was going on.  But, you know, I can also remember during that time sometimes the sounds of arguing, because that was certainly a part of it sometimes.  I can recall being awakened by someone fighting or fussing.  I can, I can recall the excitement of going into some of those bootleg houses I told you about, and just kind of seeing what people were doing and saying, and sometimes the violence that may develop.  Because, naturally in some of them, sometimes there may be gambling or whatever else going on.  Or, somebody gets mad about somebody, "Spilling my drink," or, "Looking at my lady," you know, or whatever, or arguing about somebody taking their money (laughter).  If you'd get drunk and fall asleep, then somebody would get your money.  And the things that occurred, I can even recall--I can recall being awakened one night by my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye], with everybody excited and crying and screaming, where someone had reported that my daddy [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] had been shot.  Because he was out in one of the houses, and they claim something happened and he got into it with somebody, and the guy shot him.   And fortunately, he didn't die from it.  But for years, and up until his death, he carried the bullet.  And I can recall, even growing up after that, he was frequently showing me the bullet, where it worked its way and it was right beneath the skin in his chest there.  I can recall the scare that we had--I don't know if you remember when, we called Fat Hardy [John Hardy].  Fat Hardy was a guy during the time I told you about, with the white lightning and the bootleg liquor.  The South was kind of known for that in certain areas.  And this guy was making liquor out of old radiators, car radiators, and really producing batches of white lightning that killed a lot of folks.  And I remember my daddy came home one night all cramped over in pain.  And the big scare was that he had gotten ahold of some of the liquor that Fat Hardy had made, that had come through Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 370727
Speaker 1: So those are kind of the sounds. And then I can also remember the sounds of, the hoof prints of horses, you know, on the pavement going down the street.  Because at that time Highland Bakery [Atlanta, Georgia], which was in our neighborhood, and is still in there--they've turned them into lofts now.  But their wagons, their bakery wagons, were pulled by horses.  As a matter of fact, even the people who would come selling ice--because you, you've got to remember, during that time--I don't know how old I'm appearing here--but during that time, they didn't have refrigerators, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They had ice boxes, and you'd have to buy the ice, the blocks of ice, and actually put it in your refrigerator.  Those, initially those wagons were pulled by horses.  Some of the folks would come by with horses.  And then, you know, they got wagons, I mean, and trucks, and they would come in that.  But I can recall those horses going up and down the street.  I can also recall that in the summertime they would get so hot, they'd fall out in the street; the horses would fall down in the street.  And we were talking about what kinds of games we played.  Well, sometimes the game was to get the horse up, or throw water on the horse.  Or the game may be to steal a piece of ice off of the back of the ice truck, you know, as it went down the street.  There were little things like that.  But those are the kinds of sounds and smells I remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, you have some vivid memories (laughter), so that's good.
Story_ID: 370728
Speaker 1: So tell me once again what elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually attended three, a total of three elementary schools.  I started off at a school called the C.W. Hill School [C.W. Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], which was--
Speaker 1: Say that again.
Speaker 2: C.W. Hill, H-I-L-L.  And that was the school that was, probably the high school--the elementary school for most of the kids in my neighborhood.  We would go there, and we actually had to get rides.  There was a guy that would kind of provide the transportation for all of us to go over there, a group of us.
Speaker 1: How far was it away from your home?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, now when I look at where it is, it's like right outside (laughter).  But then, it appeared that it was--I guess it was only--if we think about it is now, it's over around the, you know, on the other side of the civic center [Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center, Atlanta, Georgia], back over there.  And, but I lived over near David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], which is in the Fourth Ward.  So, we had to actually walk; we would have had to walk from here over to C.W. Hill.  It's over in the Pine Street area, back over in there, if you know anything about the city.  But we had a guy, there were a few guys who their children were there, too.  And they would actually provide transportation, and you'd pay them.  My parents [Charlotte Anderson Dye and Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] would pay them weekly to pick up the kids, to drop them off and take them back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Steve Jackson [ph.] was the first person that did it for us.  And then after that it was a guy called Claude T [ph.].  That's all we ever knew, Claude T.
Speaker 1: Claude T?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and he started doing it.  And I went there, I attended C.W. Hill until I was, I think about in fourth or fifth grade, something like that.  And then we transferred to Nathan B. Forrest School [Nathan Bedford Forrest Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Nathan B. Forrest was one of the schools, one of the white schools.  And of course, when things started changing in the neighborhood, that school was given over to us, and we started attending Nathan B. Forrest.
Story_ID: 371169
Speaker 1: We were talking Nathan B. Forrest Elementary School [Nathan Bedford Forrest Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the second elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After I left C.W. Hill [C.W. Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], of course, as it happens, the geography begins to change.  And they redistricted, and blacks began to move into certain areas, and then those schools were given over to the black families.  And Nathan B. Forrest was one of the schools that was in the Forrest Road Avenue [sic. Forrest Avenue; Ralph McGill Boulevard] down there.  You know, the interesting thing about Atlanta [Georgia], just to show you what I mean by that, is that there were streets in Atlanta, and are still streets in Atlanta, the same street, but the name changed depending upon the makeup of the neighborhood.  And you know, a street may be called Randolph while it's in the black community, but then when it goes over the hill and crosses over into the white community it became stuff like Glen Irish Drive, you see, or Forrest Road, and that kind of thing.  Well, Nathan B. Forrest was one of the schools that was in that area.  And after the neighborhood began to change, the school became black, and we were switched, transferred from C.W. Hill over to Nathan B. Forrest.  And as I was saying earlier, you know, we didn't know who Nathan B. Forrest was, and really didn't care, in terms of the name.  It was just a school, and it's only later that you begin to learn the history some of the names and what they stood for.  And of course, he was seen as one of the most ruthless Confederate soldiers that existed, and certainly not a friend of black folks or anything else.  But that became our school, you know.  That name, that was our school.  And I attended there until I was around, I think I was going into the sixth or seventh grade.  And they finished the construction of John Hope Elementary School [John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], and that was right in the Fourth Ward.  It's right down near The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] now.  And John Hope, of course, you know what that name was.  Everybody was very excited about going to not only the new school, but the school is named after somebody black, and you know, we were very proud of that.  And I finished elementary school at John Hope, and then went on to David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia], and that's where I finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what year are we in now, in elementary school?  Around 1954?
Speaker 2: Right, '54 [1954].  Of course, I entered, I finished elementary school in 1954, and then went--entered in the eighth grade at David T. Howard in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 371170
Speaker 1: So, in your elementary school, tell me about your teachers that were there.  Do you remember any teacher in particular that might have encouraged you or influenced you at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, teachers were there.  I think the biggest influence though on me was the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The principal was Mr. Ralph Long.  Mr. Long was the principal at John Hope [John Hope Elementary School; John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], and Mr. Long was a very large man, you know, very overbearing, you know.  I mean, he could, you know, he'd walk into the room and everybody would say, "Mr. Long is in the room."  He didn't take anything.  He wanted you to do exactly--he was rather unconventional in terms of what he might tell you he'd do to you.  Obviously, he didn't read the books about what you should not do to children at that time (laughter).  He would not hesitate to resort to a little corporal punishment if that were necessary.  But he was a person that I think influenced me a lot in elementary school. Because he kind of added to what I had already gotten about discipline, and about, you know, treating folks right, and act--behaving yourself, and what your responsibility was.  So I think he probably, in elementary school, in terms of John Hope, did more than the actual teachers.  Teachers came in and, you know, they went.  But of course at that time maybe he was also quite an influence, because you know, you had even fewer male teachers then than you have now.  So, all your teachers were female.  But here was Mr. Long, who was a strong, black man (laughter) who took care of business, you know, and I kind of liked that.
Story_ID: 371171
Speaker 1: Tell me about the materials or books that you were given at your school.  There's so many different stories of different schools.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sure the experience was the same.  You know, we always got the books that had been discarded by the white schools.  You know, it was very seldom that we had anything that was new.  You know, you got a book with everybody's name written in it, telephone numbers or whatever, and books that were torn.  You know, your main concern was to get one that was together.  You knew it was going to have a lot of writing in it, but at least it was together and not falling apart.  And I guess before I graduated, though, the books started improving a little, and we started getting--if you got a new book, man, you really cherished it, and you protected that book; it was great to get a new one.  And we were always taught to cover our books.  You know, even if it was old, you still covered the book.  And you'd get the brown paper sacks, and you'd cover it and write your name and everything on there.  But yeah, it wasn't uncommon for your books to always be the discarded ones.  And really it was the same thing about--you know, you're going into schools and situations where the desks are rickety and written all over and carved all into, and things that had been well-used.  But no, the books were always secondhand, which is attributed to what kids were able to do, you know.  Because in spite of that, kids were able to learn and to get a good education.  And I can't say enough about the teachers then.  You know, and I talk about Mr. Long [Ralph Long], but you know, all of the teachers really showed a lot of, a lot of concern for the students and put a lot into it, you know.
Speaker 1: John Hope [John Hope Elementary School; John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] was a new school?
Speaker 2: It was brand new (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it newly constructed?
Speaker 2: It was brand new, it was a brand new school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was like around '55 [1955] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 371172
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What other extracurricular activities were available?  I mean, was there a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] or a Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America] that you attended?  Did you take music lessons?
Speaker 2: To be very honest, the Boys and Girls Clubs--you know, I mean we don't like to talk about this (unclear), but the Boys and Girls Clubs, they started in the white community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Y was for black kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Y?
Speaker 2: The Y (laughter).  You know, I mean, you know, the Butler Street Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] was the thing in the city for all of us, you know, I mean even during the days of Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and all of them.  You know, the Butler Street Y was the place to go, you know.  Even during the time that you didn't have trunks or anything, you know, you could go and swim; you had to swim nude (laughter).  I mean, you could go to the Y to swim.  And the Y was not only the recreational and athletic part of the community, you know, it was the political part, you know.  That's where everybody got together and they did things.  So there was always that.  And there were always those kinds of sports to get involved in.  And the schools always, as far back as I can remember it had a choir, you know, a club, a glee club you may want to call it during that time, where you could sing in the choir.  And the programs that were put on were always very exciting.  Everybody waited to go to stunt night, whenever that was.
Speaker 1: What was stunt night?
Speaker 2: Stunt night was always, it was called stunt night in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  But there were always programs that were put on, where kids could sing and do skits and that kind of stuff.  So, everybody liked that.  I don't ever recall anybody having a big football team or band, or any of that kind of stuff.  But you know, you always had the choirs, and you always had the clubs and things to have activities.
Story_ID: 371173
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was always good in terms of my work, because I learned very early, but I got tired of fighting all the time, you know.  Naturally, if you're the smallest you're going to have to fight the hardest, you know.  So, it was kind of like you may have to develop the attitude that, you may beat me, but you're going to know you're in a fight.  So, you're not going to bother me too much after that.  So I always got the respect I needed, but I also learned early that--this is going back to my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye]--that the way to control them is to be smarter than they are.  So I may not be big enough to play on the football team, you know, but if I was smart enough, I could control the football players, (laughter) because they were still coming to Clint [HistoryMaker Clinton E. Dye, Jr.] for the answer and stuff like that.  And then I learned that a lot of the girls also liked cute little smart boys (laughter).  So, I couldn't play football, but I could certainly help them with some other stuff that they needed to do.  So, I was always a good student.  And then, very honestly, that was always stressed in our home.  You know, I mean we were taught very early that academics and that kind of thing was very important, and that you did make good grades, no matter what.  And all of us learned that early, and I think that's why everybody did fairly well academically.
Story_ID: 371174
Speaker 1: You talked about the other activities in the neighborhood, and you spoke about your [paternal] grandparents [Angeline Westmoreland Dye and Corley Dye, Sr.] being very religious.  What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, as a child, I grew up in a church called Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], which was right across the street from where I lived.  So it's kind of hard not to go to church every Sunday, you know.  You got tired of hiding in the house, you know, when everybody would go to church.  So, and then my grandmother was insistent that you would be over there.  And like I say, they had a lot of activities, like the choir and everything else--the children's choir and whatever.  So I spent a lot of time in Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church when I grew up.  As I got older and started chasing Myrtice [Myrtice Willis Dye], that's my wife--she was at Wheat Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], the church that the Reverend William Holmes Borders pastored for years.  And of course, there was a lot of respect for Dr. Borders in terms of what he had done and was doing with the civil rights things and desegregation, and the police force in Atlanta [Georgia] and a lot of other things.  But the truth of the matter is I was attracted to Wheat Street because of Myrtice.  Her father was kind of on the deacon board down there.  And he had told me very early that, you know, that if I really wanted to see his daughter there were two things that I was going to do--that I'd have to be at Wheat Street, and I would have to go to college (laughter).  So she was going to college [at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, and so I got involved in Wheat Street very early, and I'm still a member of Wheat Street Baptist Church.

Speaker 1: So now you're getting ready, you're twelve, thirteen, getting ready to go to high school.  Did you have any dreams or aspirations at this time?  What did you think at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought I was going to play football, (laughter) because I was so good out there on the field in the neighborhood, you know.  I said, "Oh, I can still play football."  So you know, I guess when I went to high school I said, "Well, I believe I'm going to play football."  But obviously, that didn't happen.  I went into David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1955 in the eighth grade, and met another person for the first time that was a big influence on my life.  And that's someone named Ann Long [ph.].  Ann Long was the sister-in-law of Mr. Long [Ralph Long], who was the principal of John Hope [John Hope Elementary School; John Hope-Charles Walter Hill Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Ann Long was my homeroom teacher during the five years that I was a student at David T. Howard High School.  During that time, they had a system where kids were grouped in the various sessions, sections of the eighth grade based upon their scores and their records from elementary school.  I mean, when you were in the eighth grade you were grouped according to how good a student you were.  I ended up in, there were thirteen sections of eighth graders when I went to David T. Howard.  And I ended up in eight low thirteen section (laughter).  Did you see that movie, 'The Dirty Dozen'?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: With Jim Brown and all of them?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, they used to call us the Dirty Dozen.  (Laughter) And Mrs. Long was our homeroom teacher, and she was one that was that motherly type.  She taught English.  But she was that motherly type, you know, and she was kind of like my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye], with the, you know, "No matter what anybody says, you can do this."  And that's the way she taught, I mean, the class.  You know, I mean, she let us know that no matter what they say about eight low thirteen, we're going to be fine, and you're going to do this, and we're going to prove them wrong.  So, throughout the five years at David T. Howard, we had some of the best students by the time we got to the twelfth grade, and they came out of the eight low thirteen.  And if you look at what they have done in this city and even elsewhere, me and the kids that came out of that group have done exceedingly well.  And I think it's all, it can all be attributed to Mrs. Long and the kind of role she played.  She was, she died a few years ago here in Atlanta [Georgia], a very unfortunate death.  She had a fire in her home, and of course she had burglar bars as I understand in the windows, and they weren't able to get her out.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But she was a tremendous person.  But that happened when we went.  And obviously, I never played baseball, I mean football.  And my daddy [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] wanted me to play in the band, but I rebelled because he wanted me to play saxophone, and I wanted to play drums or something, I forgot.  So I spent most of my high school years just academically, and being in some of the clubs and some of that kind of thing, and watching Myrtice [Myrtice Willis Dye] toward the end, you know.
Speaker 1: Watching what?
Speaker 2: Myrtice (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Myrtice, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 371176
Speaker 1: Now you're in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], and schools are starting to be desegregated.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What's going on in your area?
Speaker 2: Well, because we were then coming up to the '60s [1960s], there was a lot of talk about what was going to happen.  And the lesson we always got, and what we were always told is, you know, you've got to be twice as good as the others.  And that was kind of the philosophy that we all followed, and that's why the interest was on academics, you know.  You know, you gotta, you can't just be good, you got to be twice as good, you know.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was your school--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, was your school ever desegregated?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was always all-black (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The faculty and the student body, you know.  So, things were beginning to happen.  And of course by the time I was in the twelfth grade, and football and sports, and all that was a big thing.  But of course I was in the band, and things were happening in high school.  But I had a cousin whose name was Thad Olive [Thaddeus Olive, Jr.], and those were two other people that had a tremendous impact on my life, Thad and Melvin Olive, they were brothers.  They were, I talked earlier about Ida Lee [Ida Dye Olive].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They were her sons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were my granddaddy's [Corley Dye, Sr.] sister's children.  But Thad was a very bright guy.  He had, he was always the one that was talking about college and that kind of thing.  And we'd talk a lot about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was the first one that started telling me about Morehouse College, and being a Morehouse man, and he wanted me to go to Morehouse.  And by that time, in high school, I was already thinking about how I was going to eventually end up at Morehouse College, because that's where Thad went to school.  And everybody wanted to be a Morehouse man, you know.  And then my, in my family, my grandfather and everybody, there had always been a close relationship with a number of people who had gone to Morehouse and who were physicians, like my name for example.  I was named actually after Dr. Clinton Warner's [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner] daddy, Pop Warner [Clinton E. Warner, Sr.] because my grandfather was friends with Pop Warner.  So, well, I was named after my father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.].  My father was named after him, let me get that straight.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 371177
Speaker 1: But at any rate, so in high school, you know, things were happening.  And by the time I graduated in '60 [1960], of course the civil rights thing was in full bloom, with the Freedom Riders and that kind of thing, and the desegregation of the lunch counters here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And as a freshman at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], that's pretty much what I helped with.  I had, I had a very good time during my freshman year at Morehouse.  And they had told me I had too good of a time (laughter), because I stayed on academic probation most of the time.  It was always--every semester I'd be called in, and they'd say, "Now, Dye [HistoryMaker Clinton E. Dye, Jr.], you know, you're going to have to get it together this semester, or you won't be around here, you know."  So I had dropped out of Morehouse and decided I am not, that this is the end of my freshman year.  "I'm not going to continue over there.  I don't need college anyway."  So I got a job at, I had been working with my [paternal] grandfather [Corley Dye, Sr.], like I told you, as a painter for a while.  And so, I was fortunate enough to get a job at Lockheed [Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin].  And I'm thinking, "Well, you know, the kind of money I'm making at Lockheed, I'm not going to make too much more than that if I get out of Morehouse, so I don't need to go through all that grief, you know, at Morehouse."  So, I dropped out of Morehouse.  I said, "I'm not going to college."  And I started having clothes tailored.  Man, I was wearing tailored clothes.  And during that time, they opened up a Playboy Club here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I guess they got a list of everybody who made a certain amount of money or whatever.  And they made the mistake of sending me a Playboy Club key, a card.  So I was hanging in the Playboy Club, man, like I was Hugh Hefner himself, you know.  And I was having my suits tailored, and I bought a new car.  And I was doing, I was doing it, until I learned that they were having a layoff at Morehouse, I mean at Lockheed, and I was probably going to be bumped.  So they told me I'd better go back to school, one of the guys there.  And I went back to Morehouse.  But what I'm saying is that during the '60s [1960s], which is about the time that I came out of Howard High School [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, the Freedom Riders were starting, and people were talking about that and stuff.  And they weren't actually in the movement, but they were talking about the '60s [1960s] and the Great Society.  And I had a car, so I--and very few of us had cars then.  So I ended up working with Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], and Ben Brown [Benjamin D. Brown], and all the folks who were instrumental in the desegregation of the lunch counters here, and that kind of thing.  And I would be one of those that would actually drive the kids from the campus down to McCrory's [McCrory Stores] and Kresslers--Kessler's, and the stores downtown.
Story_ID: 371178
Speaker 1: Let me go back just a tad.  Because part of this story was that you had your eye on your wife.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, your wife-to-be.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a player, now (laughter).
Speaker 1: And her daddy told you that you had to go to college.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what happened with the idea that to be with her that you had to--did you go back to college thinking about that at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was on my mind.  Well, you know, I was going to go to college anyway, because it was there.  But the real thing--well, yeah, that was a part of it, too.  Because, you know, we would have these discussions.  At the time, she had already, she was already at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  She was at Spelman College, and we had gotten this Most Popular Couple in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Y'all went to the prom and everything, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the senior prom.  But we, we had done all this, and she was at Spelman and I was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So it was kind of like, after I dropped out of Morehouse, it was kind of like, "Well, you know, you really need to think about going back to school, if you're talking about getting married."  You know, and we had had our first sociology course, and all the studies about marriages that fail when, you know, you're not on the same level, you know, all this kind of stuff.  So, yeah, that was an influence, and he talked to me a lot about going back to school and what my plans were.  But I really saw what was happening in terms of not having a college degree.  And you know, since I had been working at Lockheed [Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin] and places like that, you didn't have the seniority, and people had bumping rights through the union and all.  So I didn't see that as being my future.  I knew that Lockheed--and at the time Lockheed didn't offer that much about where I wanted to go.  Because really at the time that I was at Morehouse, I always thought I was going to be a doctor.  You know, I really had a desire to be a physician until I took chemistry, you know.  Then I decided, well, maybe not (laughter).  You know, maybe there's something else.  But I went back and majored in sociology, and took all the courses in psychology and that kind of thing, and I did very well at Morehouse after I went back.  Interesting enough, I did better when I went back and had to pay for my own tuition than I did that freshman year when I was there on scholarship.  I had a different appreciation for it when I went back, because it was my money and my time, and I had to do some things.  So it worked out really well for me.  But yeah, I think obviously knowing where I wanted to go with the relationship with Myrtice [Myrtice Willis Dye] and what we had talked about, I knew that I had to get back on track and give up the Playboy Club and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 371179
Speaker 1: Okay so, with your car, you're helping to work in the Civil Rights Movement with the college students, and that's about '63 [1963].  Where were you, and what were you thinking about when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, all of us, I mean that was just, I mean that was just unheard of, you know.  It was very difficult to even believe that that had happened.  I mean Kennedy was, I mean, he was it.  You know, I mean he was bigger than life.  Nobody ever thought anything would happen to Kennedy.  I probably got the same feeling later when something happened to Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy], you know, and certainly Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know.  But when Kennedy was killed, you know, it was almost as though you felt, well, "What's going to happen now, you know?  What's going to happen to us now, you know?  I mean we don't have anybody that's there who really understands what we're trying to do, or what we're trying to push for, or anything else."  And I think very honestly, everybody was like, "Ooh, what's Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson] going to do?"  You know, we don't really trust Johnson.  So, is he going to become president or what, you know.  So, yeah, there was a lot of fear I think about what was going to happen after the death of Kennedy.  And then it also kind of brought home for me that people could be that violent, you know, that actually people would kill you, you know.  And it really brought it home that if you're stand on certain principles and you get out there, if you're too far to the other side of what folks think and want, they will actually kill you.  So I can recall us talking about that a lot after the death of Kennedy.
Story_ID: 371180
Speaker 1: We were talking about Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], and off-camera I asked you about Vietnam [Vietnam War] and the draft.  So, tell us what happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's why, that's why, you know, I avoided the draft.  Because as I said, during that time there were, there were certain standards, physical and otherwise, that you had to meet in order to be drafted.  And since I was under the height, you know, I wasn't as tall as--I was below the cut-off.  And the same thing about weight.  Well, you know, they just told me, "Well, hey, you're healthy, but you're below."  So, you know, I got the deferment, and I didn't have to worry about the draft anymore.  So, I never had to go.  Of course, being on Morehouse's [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus and all this other stuff, you know, we were always very sensitive to everything that was going on.  That's the one thing about--even though I was working, having to work, and I couldn't get involved in all the activities a lot of folks got into--Vietnam and some of the things that were going on relative to the Civil Rights Movement, were very much a part of the culture at Morehouse.  I guess my greatest blessing I think is to know that I had an opportunity to meet a lot of the folk, and to be around a lot of the folk that we talk about.
Story_ID: 371181
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the people that you worked with and got to meet during that time.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you got to understand that during that time Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] was, the president at Morehouse College was Dr. Benjamin Mays.  And Dr. Benjamin Mays was more than a president.  I mean Mays was a daddy, he was a counselor, he was a role model, he was all that.  Bear in mind that a lot of the kids-a lot of the guys that were at Morehouse came from families where--Mays was probably their first--other than a preacher or something, Mays was probably the first black man that they met that had that kind of position and everything else, not to take anything away from their fathers or anything else.  But he was their first real direct role model.  And when they said, "You are a Morehouse man," or "You're going to be a Morehouse man," that meant a lot.  You know, because that was Benjamin Mays you know, and everybody wanted to be like Dr. Mays.  You didn't want to do anything that Dr. Mays didn't approve of.  You know, you wanted to, you wanted to make Dr. Mays happy, you know.  So, you know, there was just a lot on that campus that kind of fed that.  You know, I mean, you wanted to be called a Morehouse man as much as you wanted to graduate, you know (laughter).  And there are people today who never finished Morehouse, but they still consider themselves Morehouse men (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Morehouse men.
Speaker 2: You know, so we had that, and that's the thing that was going on then.  So, I met the Mays.  I was able to sit at his house, you know, me and some others, with his wife and himself.  Because they would open up their home to the students just to come sit and talk.  And then you look at people like Whitney Young, you know.  Whitney at the time was the dean of the Atlanta School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia], you know.  And even before getting into the Urban League [National Urban League] movement, you know, I knew Whitney Young.  And to grow up around the family of Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], you know, and to know Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], you know; to know Maynard Jackson and Dr. Borders [William Holmes Borders], and people like that.  You know, you had the opportunity to actually know those folks, and to know people who have done other things.  Like David Satcher [HistoryMaker Dr. David Satcher]--you know, to have been at Morehouse when Dave was there as a student; to be able to really sit down and say, "Well, you know, I can recall the time--."  You talk about W.E.B. Du Bois. And here's a little child, I mean a kid, a young man, and I can remember Du Bois and all of them being at the AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] campus, and the kind of stuff they talked about.  And people would come home and talk about things that were going on.  So, Atlanta [Georgia] holds a very rich history, and it's kind of--not to mention being around Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, the time that he was active in Atlanta.  So, I kind of cherish that, the fact that I have had that experience; I was young enough at the time to be able to relate to those in my age group, because a lot of these people were not in my age group (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 371182
Speaker 1: Yet old enough to have had the experience of being exposed to them through other relationships I had through other people.  I think that was, that was a great thing.  But then there were times that hurt, too.  You would ask them what was going on on the campus at that time.  You know, I lost a lot of friends who decided to go on those Freedom Rides, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of them were hurt very badly.  I mean one of my best friends, he didn't die, fortunately, but he's right here in this city [Atlanta, Georgia] right now, Charles Percy, who was a classmate of mine at David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Very bright guy, I mean, he could have gone probably to any school in the country, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or anywhere.  But he elected to drop out and to go with the Freedom Riders.  And we see the 'Eye on the Prize' [sic. 'Eyes on the Prize'] and some of the things like that in Birmingham [Alabama] at the museum and all, he's in there.  And we talk now sometimes here, because he was in my class at Howard High School, about his experiences and the sacrifices they made.  So you know, all that's kind of a living thing for me, in terms of what we experienced and what we went through.  It kind of hurts sometimes that our kids don't know enough about it and can't relate to it any more than they can.  But those were interesting times in this city, and in this nation as a matter of fact.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964] is when you graduate.  Is that correct?
Speaker 1: From Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: From Morehouse, you mean?
Speaker 2: From Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Well, I actually finished Morehouse in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was supposed to finish in '64 [1964], but I dropped out that year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For that year, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --to have a good time.
Story_ID: 371183
Speaker 1: But yeah, yeah, I finished Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] actually in '65 [1965].  And then I went on to--after that, I had been working at Lockheed [Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin] to the entire time.  I went on to, well, Myrtice [Myrtice Willis Dye] and I got married that year, in 1965.
Speaker 2: And she graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: She finished Spelman, and I started working--that's during the time in '65 [1965] when I first got involved professionally with the addiction field.  I told you I was interested in alcoholism.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It probably was a throwback to, you know, my family situation.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I started, I was fortunate to get a job with the project that Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] had treating skid row alcoholics.  And I got a job as a case aide, and that was relegated to folks who had a college degree and was just beginning in the field of human services in that area.  So, I worked as a case aide with that project.  And our job was actually to, among other things, was to actually go the courts and be kind of an advocate for those individuals that have been arrested for public inebriation.  And our job was to convince the judges to refer those individuals to our project rather than sending them to jail.  And then we would work with them around their alcoholism, with the understanding of the courts that they wouldn't get back into trouble anymore on the streets, you see.  And that's how I entered the field of addiction, in terms of treating alcoholics.  And I did that I think until a couple of years, and then that's when I entered graduate school [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia] because I kind of felt I needed more training.
Story_ID: 371184
Speaker 1: So in 1967 I went into, I entered the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  That's when I was talking Whitney, Whitney Young and some others I think that had just left, and I had had some contact with them.  And I went into graduate school and studied clinical social work.  And of course, that was a two-year program in '69 [1969] when I finished, and I was beginning to have various jobs in the mental health system in Georgia working in the Georgia Regional Hospital I believe.  I had to, because I actually went to school, graduate school, on a scholarship that the state put out because what they were trying to do was to recruit more social workers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, there were funds that were made available to students who qualified to go to graduate school.  But you had to work one month--two months for every one month that they financed your education.  So after completing my graduate program, I had to give the state back what amounts to two years for the time that I was in graduate school.  So, I got a job in the Georgia Regional Hospital as one of the clinicians on the mental health program out there.
Story_ID: 371185
Speaker 1: Okay, when you finished working there [Georgia Regional Hospital], then?
Speaker 2: When I finished there, I went and took a job at Economic Opportunity in Atlanta [Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia].  That was at the height of the heroin epidemic in the country, and I think Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] at the time was president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, there was a lot of concern about the amount of crime throughout urban America.  And the crime was related to, they felt, the number of heroin addicts that were actually stealing to support their habit.  So, the federal government came up with a program for establishing treatment centers, community based treatment centers throughout the country.  Georgia got a grant to do that, to establish treatment centers in some of our urban communities, and I became the director of that program for economic opportunity in Atlanta [Georgia].  What we did was we placed, among other things, methadone centers in some of the targeted communities that had the highest incidence of drug abuse in those areas, the feeling being that if we can get the addicts into the treatment centers and get them on methadone, then they won't have to steal on the streets to get the heroin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you really believe that the program worked?  Or were the addicts now selling the methadone?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well, you know that happened.  Well, to some extent, I think it worked.  I think as I look back on it that some of the success obviously came, in my opinion, for us in those areas where we used the methadone as more of a detox, and not maintenance.  You know, you could use them both ways.  The problem came when a lot of the programs would get these folks hooked on these large maintenance schedules, and then all they did was transfer the addiction from the heroin to the methadone.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But counseling, and job training, and all that kind of thing had to be a part of that.  And you were more successful when you went into it with the idea that you're going to use it as detox schedules, and bring people down and get them off of both the methadone as well as the heroin.
Speaker 1: So, is that the type of program that you-okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's pretty much what we--we had people on maintenance, but we pretty much tried to stress the detox.
Story_ID: 371186
Speaker 1: How did you see the community change, if you saw it change at all, because of--was there any impact in the community because of these programs?
Speaker 2: To some degree.  I think as--unfortunately, as it happens with lot in our programs, they come in as special initiatives with temporary funding, and then you're not able to institutionalize those into your permanent system.  And the experience I think that we had with that was very similar with what we had in mental health, when there was a period of time when the federal government put out all those training grants and those ten-year, I mean those five and ten-year programs for states to develop comprehensive community mental health centers, with the understanding that at the end of the period the state and the local governments were then to pick up the funding and the continuation of those programs.  Unfortunately, what happened is that most of the local governments just used the money while it was there, and then when the money ran out, then of course, that was no longer the priority and they didn't continue the services.  And I think that's why even today we have such a tremendous problem, even here in Atlanta [Georgia], with there being inadequate mental health services.  That, coupled with the fact that we started--we meaning nationally we started the initiative to deinstitutionalize the mental health system by closing a lot of the state hospitals.  And you closed them at a time when there were no community centers and services to pick up that service.  And to some extent, in some communities, that's why we're still having a problem with the homeless population being so mixed.  Because they're still, I would imagine a substantial number of folks who are in those populations who are mental health patients who don't have facilities and don't have anywhere else to go.  They are attracted to urban areas for the same reason anybody else would come--to find jobs and to do other things, and they end up on the streets of major cities.
Story_ID: 371187
Speaker 1: So, you held that title [director, Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] until 1973?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then you went to--
Speaker 2: And then I think I went to the Atlanta Regional Commission [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was this program about?
Speaker 2: The Atlanta Regional Commission is the area where our planning agency for the Metropolitan Atlanta [Georgia] area--and that program that I was with was actually, had the responsibility of dealing with at that time the health planning for the region.  And I was doing basically the same thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --in terms of addiction and that kind of thing, but in a planning area rather than being direct services.  We were more concerned with looking at how the region was responding or not responding to the needs.  And of course in some cases you had to look at the interaction of the two systems, meaning mental health and addiction.  Because there's still, there was still a tendency for areas to get funding for substance abuse and then use the money for mental health rather than for substance abuse.  And they didn't want to mix the two, because they always felt in some cases that the people with addictions tore up the mental health programs because they were acting out, and different kinds of things.  But that, that job, the stay at the Atlanta Regional Commission was a very good one, because it gave me the experience of working with a number of governments within the region.  And I think it was during that time that I really began to get my first appreciation for the fact that we had to begin looking more regionally, in terms of the kinds of problems we faced.  That's happening even to today, meaning the problems that face Atlanta.  They're problems that can't be solved just by Atlanta, but there are going to be solutions that will have to be done on a regional basis (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Basis, yeah.
Speaker 2: Which means you have to work through other governments to do that.
Story_ID: 371188
Speaker 1: Then the Atlanta Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia].  And what was your position there?
Speaker 2: Well, I left the Atlanta Regional Commission [Atlanta, Georgia] and--
Speaker 1: This is in 1976 that you left, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I came to the Urban League for the first time in '76 [1976] as the director of community services.  I had met a while back, Lyndon Wade, who was then the president and CEO of the Atlanta Urban League.  I met Lyndon during the time that I talked to you about the Emory project, the Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] project, dealing with the public inebriates.  Lyndon was the chief social worker with that program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Lyndon is also a graduate of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I was able to get a job working on that project as a case aide under Lyndon, and he supervised the social work services.  So, I had known him for that time.  And so when the position became available at the Atlanta Urban League, he had come over the Urban League to head it up.  I came to the Urban League as the director of community services, and did that for several years until I was eventually promoted to the vice president of the Atlanta Urban League.  And I did that until I decided that maybe--because Wade had convinced me that maybe I needed to get a Ph.D.  I don't know why, but they did.
Story_ID: 371189
Speaker 1: Since the program was here in Atlanta [Georgia] and I didn't have to go anywhere, and it was going to be at the School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia]--and they offered, the program offered an opportunity not just to be in social work, but be in, to study in other areas within the school.  And I had become interested in organizational behavior and business, and that kind of thing.  So, I was able to put together a program, a Ph.D. program that was in the School of Social Work, but it had--my cognitive area was in the School of Business [Clark Atlanta University School of Business, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I left, I left the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] and took a job with the state [Georgia State Department of Human Resources; Georgia Department of Human Services], with the mental health division of the employee assistance program, so that I could complete my dissertation and my work at the School of Social Work at Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  And that's how that happened, that's how I left the Urban League.  And of course after finishing the Ph.D., I continued to work in state government in the division of mental health, as well in the legislative area, in terms of working with the elected officials.  And I did that until I think it was, about almost seven years ago now.  And I returned to the Urban League after Lyndon Wade left, I mean retired, and I returned to the Urban League as its president and CEO.  So I've been doing this, it'll be seven years this coming April.
Story_ID: 371190
Speaker 1: I want to step back and talk about some things as you were in these various positions.  Missing and murdered children [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders]--back in '79 [1979] and '80 [1980], talk to me about what was going on where you lived, and how the people were responding to what was going on.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, everybody, even if one did not live directly in the communities where the kids were being abducted, you know, everyone was very concerned and frightened about what was happening to the kids that were being murdered, and really not knowing who was doing it or, you know, or anything along those lines.  I think the other part of it, too, is that for a lot of us--I described my childhood and the areas in which I grew up [in Atlanta, Georgia].  Many of us were very concerned about the kinds of kids that were being abducted.  Because these were kids that we always felt had the street savvy, you know.  These were not, these were kids who knew how to operate on the street.  They were very enterprising, and they were good in terms of the kinds of things that they were doing.  And I think for the first time, you know, this city just began to feel that something was happening to our children that nobody could imagine was happening from within our community, you know; it had to be something from the outside.  And I think that was the big fear, too, that, hey, what if the person, the perpetrators are white, and this assault on the black community and they're killing our kids.  And you know, everybody was, you know, the private discussions went around, "Well, what should we do?  You know, maybe we need to get ourselves together, because this is an assault, you know.  They're on the kids now, you know, but we've got to look at what's really happening here."  And I think everybody was really fearful, and ready to say, "Well, you know, we're going to have to do something about this.  You know, I mean, how much of this can we take?"  Those were the kinds of discussions that were going on.  And then of course, there are always, you know, anytime there's a crisis, you turn within.  There were always discussions about what are the families doing, you know, and why isn't the churches doing more?  So, you know, there was enough blame and enough finger-pointing to go around about what was happening.  But that in and of itself was a tremendous assault in this town, in terms of what happened to those kids.  And I think there're still scars from it, you know.  People are still very upset to think that something like that could happen in a city, this city, and more importantly, that the person's family accused of doing it was a quote, one of our own, you know, kind of situation.  But the missing and murdered children thing will continue to stand out as probably one of the greatest tragedies that hit the city.
Story_ID: 371191
Speaker 1: Did you talk to your children [Trevin G. Dye and Clinton E. Dye, III] about at that time, when your children were old enough for you to talk to them about it [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well, you know, everybody was very concerned about this.  And you know, you would always talk to them the way, you know, "You don't have to be so fearful that somebody's going to get you," you know.  You know, "We're going to continue to do what we've always done, and you know, Mom [Myrtice Willis Dye] and Dad is here and the family is here.  And it's not like you're really out there by yourself like that.  So, it's not you, but we have to be concerned about what's happening to everybody else, you know."  We certainly wanted them to feel that since it wasn't them that they didn't have to be concerned.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were going to be concerned anyway, but I think everybody was doing that.  And probably everybody began to tighten up a little bit, in terms of what you were doing and were allowing your kids to do; it's no question about that.  As I think of even what's happening now, you know, it's just, you know, some of the same fears that people are having now about what's happening are the same things that we were experiencing then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, that was a tragedy in the community.
Story_ID: 371192
Speaker 1: In 1996, the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics] came to Atlanta [Georgia], and it brought a lot of prestige and a lot of change to the city.  What are your thoughts about the Olympics?
Speaker 2: Well, I think obviously in many ways the Olympics had a positive impact on Atlanta, there's no question about that, I think economically, and the amount of prestige that was even increased with the city being able to host it, and what people found here.  Of course, all of us took a certain amount of pride in knowing that people like Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and Maynard [Maynard Jackson], you know, black America played a great role in this.  And it's actually a continuation of what role we played in this city, you know, over the years.  A lot of Atlanta's greatness is as much contingent upon what African Americans have contributed to this city as anybody else.  But the on other side of it, you know, I think we were not ready as a city to understand what the aftermath was going to be, in terms of the traffic, in terms of the explosion, and in terms of everything else that's happened.  And then for me, I was at the state at the time that the Olympics was here; I was in the mental health division [Georgia State Department of Human Resources; Georgia Department of Human Services].  I was on duty the night that the bombing occurred in Centennial Park [Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I think, as I think about the Olympics, and certainly as I associate it with the discussions we're having now about homeland security and terrorism and everything else--and as I think about what happened in New Orleans [Louisiana] with the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] situation--I think the one thing that we did not do is to--and I mean locally now, I'm talking particularly locally--we didn't learn from the fact that we knew we were not ready--we were not ready to handle the Olympics, to be very honest with you.  We're fortunate that we didn't have any more to happen than did happen with the bombing, because our systems were not really in place, I don't think.  There are still some, there was always some question about whether or not the same thing that we've talked about--about the lack of communication, the lack of not knowing what roles we should play--we certainly had a lot of that during the time of the Olympics.  The state system wasn't being coordinated with the feds, and a lot of it was not even in place fully.  So we were not, I don't think--from my evaluation, we were not ready to handle that.  And we had, we had bated breath the entire time, you know (laughter). I don't think anybody was any happier than we were when they had that final thing and closed out the Olympics.  But we haven't learned a lot about that, and we haven't done a lot to put that in place, in terms of our being in a position to really respond to crisis and things.
Story_ID: 370753
Speaker 1: I'd like you to talk about the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia], and your role in it in the community. Just--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, first of all, I had always been attracted to the Urban League, primarily because, you know, very early on, as I said, I always knew about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and the School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  And the Urban League was always very much a part of that.  And then to grow up around people like Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], who eventually ended up at the Urban League, I always had that kind of tie with what the Urban League was doing.  And of course being a sociology major and reading-- you know, I knew about Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  I knew about the Niagara conference [Niagara Movement], the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League, and how all that developed.  So, I was always intrigued with that.  But the other part of it is that, you know, the Urban League has always been an integral part of this city.  But the first, Atlanta [Georgia] was really the gateway to the Urban League movement coming into the Deep South.  And I was very much aware of--because I'd hear my parents [Charlotte Anderson Dye and Clinton E. Dye, Sr.] around the house and folks talking about what the Urban League was doing in housing and things like that--Mr. Arnold [Harold Arnold] and others that were down there at the Urban League.  And so I always said, "Well, if I don't go into medicine, I want to do something with the Urban League.  I want to do something with an organization like that."  So, that's pretty much the way that I got involved.  When I went to the School of Social Work after Morehouse, Whitney Young, I think, had just left going to become the director of the National Urban League.  So, there was a lot of talk around there about the Urban League, and very honestly, the Atlanta University School of Social Work was among the first black schools of social work in the country.  And that school played a big role in training black social workers in this country.  The problem was during those times social work--the black social work students were pressed to have a place to practice.  And they could not do it in the Deep South, in the southern states, because of segregation and discrimination.  So, the Urban League became one of the major forces for providing opportunities for social work students from AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] for example, to be able to do your field placement.  And that's why if you look around the Urban League movement, many of the older--I say older now--the guys who are more seasoned, let me use it that way--the guys are who are in their field years were graduates of the Atlanta University School of Social Work.  Because what they would do is after they'd finish their education, then they would be hired.  Well, I was exposed to all of this, you know, this history and these guys and what the Urban League did, plus they got some money and then and they got the scholarships.  And so I went into social work.  And of course, Lyndon Wade had by that time gone to the Urban League.  And so, that's how I got into it.  That's how I began to think that the Urban League was the way that I wanted to go, and why I-in this coming April, will have spent a total of twenty years with the Urban League movement.
Story_ID: 370754
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African community, the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that we certainly need--I don't think that we need to be concerned about there ever having to be another quote, black leader.  I don't think we need a black leader, necessarily.  But what I do think that we need is to begin to do two things.  We need to embrace and understand that we do live in a more diverse world, and it will become even more diverse for our children and their children.  But at the same time, we need to have an appreciation for the benefits for us to begin to strengthen the infrastructure and the fabric of the national African American community--economically, and politically, and otherwise.  It doesn't mean that we all have to be Democrats, you know.  It means that we have to begin to see the diversity, even within our own communities.  We need to become more concerned about economics.  The Urban League [National Urban League] now is pushing again the agenda that we need to be focusing more on wealth accumulation and not just jobs--that we know that in this country, as elsewhere, that wealth is intergenerationally built for the most part.  And that's what we're going to have to start doing, looking at being producers and not just employees all the time.  I think it's good to see a lot of our kids now embracing the whole concept of entrepreneurship and business development.  That's great, because they can use their own talents to do that.  They don't have to want to work for someone all the time.  And even on another level, that we have an appreciation that not everybody needs to go to a four-year college, you know.  So, we're beginning to see that, and I think we need to do more of that.  But by the same token, we've got to start doing it the way the old folks used to do it.  We need to sit down more and see what we need to do as a community.  We're still losing far too many HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], and even with all the progress we've made in terms of academia and getting into some of the best Ivy League schools in the country, it's still a fact that most of the advanced degrees that are in our community, the Ph.D.s, et cetera, are awarded by black schools.  So, there's still a value.  We cannot abandon those resources, we need to strengthen and build them.  So, I guess what I'm saying is what I see for our community is to continue to understand that we have to learn to play on a broader and more diverse stage.  But at the same time, we have to understand that we need to build within our communities the skills and a knowledge base to create the best actors on that stage.
Story_ID: 370755
Speaker 1: What message would you have for the future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, to kind of remember what my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] said to some extent, "Don't forget where you come from, because you ain't left there yet."  Not to say that progress hasn't been made, and that we need to continue to move forward, but I think that we need to stop thinking that there's a shortcut.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And far too many of our young people think there is a shortcut; that they don't have to do it the way it was always done, because they didn't experience that.  And we need to value healthcare.  You know, I, for one know that one of the things that I intend to do a lot more of since I've gotten older is really begin to kind of reexamine what I really value.  And it's amazing how as you get older, a lot of things you thought were important, are not nearly as important.  Family is very important to me, it has always been.  As I think back over what I've done and probably what I could have done, I could have done a lot more had I not been concerned with bringing everybody along.  I think a family is, when you're the head of the family or you're a major player in a family, you should look at that family the way a good farmer or a good gardener looks at a rose bed in a rose box, a flower box.  Your job is to see that the fertilizer and the soil is there, and that the conditions are good for all the flowers to grow.  And that's pretty much what I have tried to do over the years, to see that everybody in the family has an opportunity to be nourished and to grow; it makes for a better garden.  There's no need to have a pretty rose when everything around it is dead (laughter).  And I think that there's where we need to be with our community.  You know, when we can embrace that it's not mine or yours--it's ours and that's the way we need to move forward--then I think we'd have a better shot at doing a whole lot of things we need to do.
Story_ID: 370756
Speaker 1: When you look back over what you have done with the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia], what stands out the most for you?
Speaker 2: Well, when I think of the Urban League, we've helped a lot of people.  And I haven't done as much as--as I look back over, say, the last--not the last twenty years--but the last seven years I've been back as president/CEO--the one thing that I think that I'm most disappointed with, and what I have not been able to do since I've been back, is to be focused more on getting the resources to attend to the fiscal health of this organization.  And I think that that's what we do too little of in our communities.  The Urban League, this agency was founded in 1920.  So that means that this year, we're eighty-six years old.  We at this point should have done like everybody else.  We should not have to be concerned about funding, or we should not have to be concerned about what grants are going to be there or not going to be there, and whether or not we're going to sell four to five gold tables or a dinner, or whatever.  You know, we should have gone the way that most organizations have gone.  We should have been building endowments in the community, and the way that the fiscal health of these organizations is institutionalized, et cetera.  So, we have not paid enough attention to how this organization will survive and continue on, in terms of attracting the kind of resources and talent that it will need to address the kind of complex challenges that lie ahead.  And too often we do that with most of our institutions.  We don't pay enough attention to assuring that they will continue and be in a position to do the kinds of things that they're going to be asked to do as we move forward.  And of course, the great thing that could happen is that they no longer needed.  But unfortunately, we don't see that happening any time soon.  But we certainly should be in a position of being able to focus even more on moving our constituency along, and not have to focus on us fighting to survive to be there to try to do something for us, if that makes any sense.
Speaker 1: Yes, it does make sense.  Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about that we did not talk about?
Speaker 2: No, other than to say that, you know, that we--as I look at all this, it's kind of like what Whitney Young said once in a speech made at the School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia]. Whitney said, "One thing we have to remember is where we are now in this country.  You know, we may all have come over on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now."  And that's kind of what we need to do, and how we need to look at things that we talk about within our respective communities, you know.  Some of us may be doing a little better than others, but until we can adopt--truly, I think from my perspective, a philosophy of true inclusion and not embrace exclusion on any level, we're certainly not going to be able to move forward as a community nor as a country until that's totally and openly embraced.
Story_ID: 370757
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a little piece of leather that was well put together (laughter).  No, I, you know, I really haven't thought about that a whole lot.  I guess the big thing would be that, you know, I want to be remembered as someone who truly tried to help folks.  I get more joy, sometimes to my own demise, out of seeing someone else succeed and grow.  And it's kind of like, I guess sometimes I have more pride in being the gardener, you know, who keeps the soil good, and wants everybody in the box to grow, other than always focusing on owning the box, you know.  And I think there's a difference.  So, I want to be known as someone who truly tried to help.  And the one thing I always told my sons [Trevin G. Dye and Clinton E. Dye, III] is that, you know, "Your daddy may not be able to pass on a whole lot of money for you," though I'm trying to do that.  But I certainly want to pass on a good name and a reputation for them, you know.  I want them and people to be able to say, you know, "That at least their daddy really showed them how to be, you know, upstanding young men."  And I think once you lose your reputation, you don't have anything.  So, that has always been my motivation, that I don't want anybody want to be able to say that Clinton Dye [HistoryMaker Clinton E. Dye, Jr.] did anything that was underhanded, or out of selfishness or whatever, and that he truly--if I can't help, then I won't get involved.  But I think that the whole concept around integrity and everything else is what we're still dealing with in this country.  We still haven't reached the point that enough of us embrace that.  You know, anybody can get the ink and the cameras, and whatever.  But there's so much more to that than the publicity and the attention you get.  See, in the final analysis, what have you done for someone?  And even in this business, if it ever gets to the point that we are truly not trying to help a constituency, or trying to keep one to keep our jobs, then we're really in bad shape.  You know, the idea is to work ourselves out of business.  One of the greatest things for me would be if every organization like ours, and all over, were able to close their doors and say there's no need for this anymore.  Then I think that would be the day that all of us would be looking for.  That's kind of where I come from.
Speaker 1: Well, I thank you, Dr. Dye, for your time and for your stories.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's very important, and I'm so glad that you took the time to allow us to capture your story.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
Story_ID: 370758
Speaker 1: Well, you know, like I said, Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] was always kind of in and out, you know.  Windsor [Windsor Jordan], his brother, was there a lot more than Vernon was, because Vernon was always away in school or whatever.  But he would come.  And you know, Vernon was always like he is now; he was always serious about what he was doing.  I can remember when Vernon--I can remember one incident that was very funny.  I remember when Vernon was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  And I don't know if it was his first year or whatever, but they were having this party.  And they kind of got a little loud, so the story goes.  And Vernon--somebody was going to call the police.  And of course, Vernon, it sounds like having had that first week in class.  You know, he was going to be the attorney for the group, you know (laughter).  And I think as the story goes, he almost got all of them arrested because of his trying to play, I guess at the time, the Johnnie Cochran of that day.  But he was always a very serious guy.  And Vernon was always, we always thought he was very smart and very cool, and the kind of guy that everybody kind of wanted to be like.  Windsor was the partier and the good-timer, and Vernon was always the studious guy, although I understand Vernon was doing his stuff, but he just knew how to do it.  But he, you know, the thing about that was not so much Vernon and Windsor as it was Mrs. Jordan, his mother [Mary Belle Griggs Jordan], and his dad [Vernon E. Jordan, Sr.].  Because even though we all worked for her, a number of us, after we got older she would actually take us on her parties as well, to serve the party.  But you learn so much by doing that, because you learn how to interact with people, and you learn how to be diplomatic.  Now here we are, as I said, her clients were probably some of the most prominent white families in Atlanta [Georgia].  So you learned a lot about race relations, and how to communicate, and how to handle yourself in that kind of environment.  And I think that was the thing that helped Vernon in terms of later on in his role as head of the National Urban League, and what he has done.  I think he learned that from those kinds of experiences.  And certainly some of the contacts and relationships he formed during those years, I think served him well later on.
Story_ID: 370759
Speaker 1: But I can recall going on those parties, and like I talked about, sitting on the committees with some of the folks, the children of those folks that my granddaddy [Corley Dye, Sr.] and I painted those houses for.  But I also had some other good experiences with the children of some of those folks when I was serving those parties as well, you know.  I mean a lot of that, a lot of that really paid off.  But I tell you this.  When we were talking about experiences, and I was telling you about my [paternal] grandmother [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] and the little saying she gave me--I remember one thing about Mrs. Jordan [Mary Belle Griggs Jordan] that I learned.  She had a practice of--we would always go over and we would prepare--we didn't do any cooking and all, but we loaded the station wagons and the vans and all that to go over.  And we'd meet down at her house.  She would make all of us sit down before we went out on a party, and she would make us eat, you know.  And a lot of times, it was family style.  We sat down at the table down in her basement; that was where she worked out of at that time, it was massive.  But she would make us eat.  And a lot of times we would say, "Well, we're not hungry."  You know, she would make us eat.  I mean that was the policy, we had to eat before you left there.  And this went on for years.  And finally she said, we asked her, "Mrs. Jordan, why do we have to eat?"  She said, "Because, first of all, you cannot work around food if you're hungry.  And if you're hungry, it affects your attitude and it affects everything.  So, I want you to be full when you go to these parties."  But she also probably knew that we'd be eating off of those trays, and we were going to be doing everything else.  But the point is this.  And I have said this to my board on a couple of occasions, going back about resources and working in the non-profit sector.  Just as we couldn't be hungry and serve those parties, our staff can't be hungry and deal with some of the issues we have to deal with.  So, it's not just a question of when I talk about the financial health of our organization and what we do.  And the same thing applies to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and whatever else: you can't be hungry trying to feed the hungry, you know.  We have to see to it that people are replenished, and supported, and nurtured.  And sometimes it has to start at home, you know.  And we can't forget that.  And I tell my people that sometimes--that the only difference sometimes between the folks who walk through this door and want help, is that you're sitting on the other side of the desk.  And you have to remember that.  So if you can't give them anything else, you got to give them respect, you know.  Because like my grandmamma said, "It matters not the color of the hand that slaps, it hurts just as much."  So, these are the kinds of things I remember most about Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and his mother, and that experience and everything else.  You know, Vernon was Vernon Jordan then, just like he's Vernon Jordan now; that didn't just happen.  And for me, even today I think Vernon--even though there have been a number of heroes and folks within the Urban League movement, Vernon Jordan will always be Mr. Urban League, no matter what.  And Vernon has set the standard that all others behind him are going to have to meet, one way or the other.  And said or unsaid, Vernon is still Mr. Urban League, that's who he is.
Story_ID: 370760
Speaker 1: Well, that's actually, I mentioned that my wife [Myrtice Willis Dye] and I were the cutest couple, or the popular couple in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And you know, they, when you graduate during your senior year they have all these different superlatives they call them in the class, Most Likely to Succeed, the Most Humorous, the Most Talented, the Most Athletic.  Well, she and I won the Most Popular Couple, and that picture was taken during our senior year for the yearbook.  This was in 1960, the year that we graduated.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's just a little picture of me when I think was around ten.  That was taken as a kid growing up in Atlanta [Georgia].  It looks like a little school picture, elementary school picture that was taken.
Speaker 1: Very good, next.
Speaker 2: The same thing there, I've just gotten a little older.  I think I was about twelve when that picture was taken.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess I was about thirteen or fourteen.  You can see the part in the hair.  The part was very popular at that time.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, here I'm getting a little sexier.  That's, I think at the time--I told you I was working at Lockheed [Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin] and getting clothes tailored.  This was like one of those first suits I got tailored.
Speaker 1: This was during the Playboy era (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, those were the Hugh Hefner days.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought I was really doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is my paternal grandparents.  That's my grandmother, Angeline Dye [Angeline Westmoreland Dye] and Corley Dye [Corley Dye, Sr.].  These are the parents of my father [Clinton E. Dye, Sr.].  I mentioned that my father, my grandfather, was a painter and a plumber and a carpenter, and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Spell those first names for us.
Speaker 2: Okay, Angeline is A-N-G-E-L-I-N-E, Dye and Corley, C-O-R-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Very good, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my father and mother [Charlotte Anderson Dye] along with my two sisters and myself.  That's me there in the middle.  I don't know exactly how old we were then.  That's Constance [Constance Dye Thomas] I think, to his right.  And then me, and the other little girl is my sister, Beverly [Beverly Dye].  That was before the other two kids were born.  I told you there were five of us.  There were only three at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good, next.
Speaker 2: And this of course is my mother and my father.  I think at the time they had been married about two or three years.  But that's, they were a very young couple at that time, as you can see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a great shot.
Speaker 2: I guess I was trying to look like my daddy in that other shot.
Speaker 1: Go ahead. Set it up for me there. Thank you, magnificent.
Speaker 2: This is, this picture is a picture of my grandfather.  And that's the infamous truck I was telling you about.  That was the first truck he purchased to get us off of those public buses in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we would use that truck to actually go to the various jobs we had.
Speaker 1: It looks like the early '50s [1950s], from the vintage of the car.
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it is, the '50s [1950s], that's what I was about to say.
Speaker 1: All right, how about this one?
Speaker 2: This young man was my best friend.  His name is Willie Foote, F-O-O-T-E.  This picture was taken I think around 1961 or '62 [1962], right after, shortly after we finished high school.  This is the young man that we were talking about, the experiences in graduate school and all.  He was killed my first year in graduate school at Atlanta University [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was away in Florida, and got word that he had been shot in an automobile altercation.  Some guy bumped his car, and when he got out to go see about it, you know, a guy sitting in the back of the car in the back seat pulled a gun and shot him.

Speaker 1: This is just a family portrait of myself and my wife [Myrtice Willis Dye], it's my family.  It's Trey, Clinton III [Clinton E. Dye, III] is the kid that's to my wife's right.  And then on the other side is Trevin [Trevin G. Dye].  I think there's another picture that we'll be looking at and you'll see how they--at a time when they were older.  I think of each of them--Trey must have been about eight or nine at the time, and Clinton was about seven or so.  So, that's two years difference in them.
Speaker 2: That's good, next.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is another one.  They were a little younger there.  Trevin is the one with the little Afro, he's the younger child.  And that was taken at our grandmother's house, I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this picture is my wife and myself.  She, this was taken in 1981 I'm sure, because this was the year that she got her Ph.D.  And that's actually at her graduation when that picture was taken.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: This is the same scene.  She just took the picture with the two boys, Trey and Trevin.
Speaker 2: This is the same picture, but this is your--
Speaker 1: Yeah, my [paternal] grandmother.
Speaker 2: Your grandmother?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Angeline [Angeline Westmoreland Dye].  These are just pictures at her graduation at Lane University [sic. Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee] where she received her doctorate.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This picture here is a picture of myself and my siblings.  And we talked earlier about how many--there were five of us.  And to my left is Connie [Constance Dye Thomas].  She's the one I was telling you was the oldest, that was killed last year in an auto accident.
Speaker 2: When you say to your left, are you in the brown with the stripes?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm in the gold shirt.
Speaker 2: The yellow shirt?
Speaker 1: The yellow shirt.  And that's Connie on the right, far right.
Speaker 2: Okay, the viewer's right.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, the viewer's right.  She's the oldest.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then that's me next to Connie.  Then the other one next to me on my right is Beverly [Beverly Dye].  And then that's Victor [Victor Dye], and then the last one is Delores [Delores Dye Brown].  So, if you were to go from Connie to the left of the photograph, then you would have the order of siblings here.
Speaker 2: Okay, perfect, next.
Speaker 1: That's me joking around with my sons.  That's Trevin, the younger one there in the middle.  And Trey is to the far left, the viewer's left.  We were at an affair somewhere on one of those outings I told you about that we would go on, and we were just horsing around there taking photographs.
Speaker 2: Very good, next.
Speaker 1: They've done very well, incidentally.  Trey is an attorney here in town [Atlanta, Georgia].  He got his degree from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and he's doing well.  And Trevin got to finish in the San Juan [California] schools.  He's with Jetro [Jetro Holdings, LLC], a Japanese, Japan external trade organization.  So the kids have done real well; they did what their mother told them to do.
Speaker 2: What about this one?
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: This one here.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was taken, again, on one of those trips.  Oh, I know where this was taken.  This picture was taken at Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio].  Trevin was enrolled at Oberlin.  That's on the campus of Oberlin College up in Ohio during his freshman year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That of course is just a picture of me at the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] that I've taken recently, I mean when I first returned to the Urban League in 2000, the portrait that was used.
Speaker 2: What is this one here?
Speaker 1: This? It's just a news clip when I was with the drug program, from my job with the drug program.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, the description here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this picture was just one of the news articles, the many news articles that were in the paper.  At this particular time, that's Councilwoman Panky Bradley.  She and I had worked real hard to get a treatment center open in her district.  And this is the opening of that--Exit House [Atlanta, Georgia] was the name of that.  It was one of the methadone treatment centers that we had during that time.  This was in nineteen-what? Sixty-five [1965], '66 [1966], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
