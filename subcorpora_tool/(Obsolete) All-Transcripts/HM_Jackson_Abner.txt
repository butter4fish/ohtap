Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Cabbage and spinach and maybe throw some ham hocks in there.  Fried chicken, I've given up fried chicken.  So that used to be my favorite, but I figured I was gone take off one these days and fly, and I don't think, I don't think folks right appreciate that.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: And, sir, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, suppose if I think about it probably, probably in--during the holidays like October, November, December and the first of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.  I just go wherever I want to go when I, when I can get away.  I've been going to Bimini [Bahamas] for, for the last twenty years.  And my son [Michael Jackson] told me, he said, "Daddy, you need to go to Bimini."  So I, I'll probably get there before the end of the year; wait till October, the weather's a little better I understand.  But I, I--now, see there, there I go rambling.  I saw a picture in one of the first 'Ebony' magazines they put out, and Count Basie was standing on the stern of the boat (laughs), he said, "Bimini, oh!" and then all at once Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] come into picture, when he was with Hazel [Dorothy] Scott.  I said, "I got to go there!" (laughs)
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna get there one of these days.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Whatever it takes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, "Whatever it takes."  And then, then, people ask me, "How are you doing?"  And I say, "Doing better than most." (laughs)  And they'll say, "I knew you was gone say that, Val [Abner Jackson]."  But, yeah, it's, it's--that's a couple of them.  That's it. And they're not really favorites  I just use them indiscriminately whenever, whenever the occasion presents itself.
Story_ID: 8745
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your background, and can you give us the names of your parents and their birthdates and spell their names for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My dad was Abner Ber--B  as in Bernard, Jackson, Jr.  And, of course, he never did use Bernard, but B is Abner B. Jackson, Jr.  And daddy was born, seventh of January 1910.  Mother was Janett, and sometimes, the way she spelled it, they said Janet, but it's J-A-N-E, two T's.  And she was born on the, on the twenty-sixth of March, 1914 in Moberly, Missouri.  Her maiden name, maiden name was--her mother's maiden name was Penney.  And, [James Cash] J. C. Penney was, kind of interesting, J. C. Penney was born in that same area.  So that, when they was crossing, ain't too sure (laughs).  But I had, I had aunties, had aunties--had one auntie that was superintendent of, of the blind in, in California for a few years.  And another one was Joan Fontaine's secretary.  Both of those, both of those are deceased, of course.  But they came to Wich state, Wichita [Kansas] back in early 1900s from Moberly, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have stories about her ancestors on her side of the family and what they were doing during slavery or during Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Never talked that much about that.  The--my oldest daughter, she, she's doing, she's off on this genealogy bent, and she done tracked us back as far as South Carolina.  And so that's what, I said, "That's where that Indian come in."  Cause if you notice a picture of my mother with high cheekbones, they were them Cherokee Indians over there in South Carolina.  But we still talk about it.  We stopped in Tucumcari, New Mexico back on one of our vacations one year, and we got the best service in the house.  My mother [Janett Jackson] could work a room, boy (laughs).
Speaker 1: So, your mother's side of the family had roots in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: South Carolina and--no, Gramps [Abner Jackson] my, on my dad's [Abner Jackson, Jr.] side of the family, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she haven't got, she hasn't got too far back with, with my mother's side of the family, other than Moberly, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's one Penney still in Moberly, we just found out two weeks ago.  She got all excited about that, in the nursing home.  And she got to talk to her on the phone.  So our next trip to Wichita [Kansas], I guess I got to go to Moberly (laughs).  I've never been there.
Speaker 1: Now, so your father's side goes back to South Carolina?
Speaker 2: South Carolina, yeah.
Speaker 1: What part of South Carolina?
Speaker 2: She told me, South Carolina, Giddings, Texas and Bonita, Oklahoma, where my dad was born.  And then he came, went to Kansas City [Missouri], and then he came into Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas, of course.  I guess I'd better make that distinction (laughs).  But that's how they got to Wichita, by that route.
Story_ID: 8746
Speaker 1: My grandfather [Abner Jackson, Sr.] used to be mail--on the mail, mail run for the railroad.  And I don't know which railroad it was either.  They never did talk too much, and, of course, you might have run in the same situation.  They didn't, they didn't talk too much about yesterday, yeah, didn't talk too much about yesterday.  So everything we know right now, we done had to go through obituaries and, and funeral programs and all that stuff to kind of get some background.  And my dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] put, and my dad said, "I don't have to have no obituary."  So they put on his, nothing but 'The Lord's Prayer' (laughs), in lieu of obitu--in lieu of the obituary.  So--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He didn't have any obituary about himself at all?  Just you say, 'The Lord's Prayer'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just had 'The Lord's Prayer'.  He, he didn't want no obituary on there.  He said, "I ain't"--he said, "I lived, and that's it."  And so mama [Janett Jackson] put on his tombstone out there, "Rest in Peace" (laughs)--R.I.P., he'd like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now how did you grandfather--did you know your grandfather who started this business?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, gramps, 'Dapper Gramps' [Abner Jackson], that's what we used to call him.
Speaker 2: What was that again?
Speaker 1: Dapper Gramps.  Yeah, he loved to play Coon Can, you know the game?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, he said, "Some coons can, some coons can't."  That's all (laughs).  But, yeah, yeah, Gramps--see, we moved over--we moved out of the house over here on Cleveland [Street, Wichita, Kansas] over into the basement of the mortuary over on Water Street, the one you see the picture out there on the wall.  We moved over there when I was four years old, stayed there thirteen years.  And Gramps stayed in one part of the basement, and we stayed in the other part, which it wasn't nothing but three rooms.  So it had one room for us and one room for Gramps.  And he was quite a character, quite a character, loved his cigars.  He'd smoke them till the ash get that long.  And then just nod his head (laughs), wherever the ash went, yeah.  But he was a good businessman.
Speaker 2: What did he do for a living before he started the mortuary?  How did he do it?
Speaker 1: He went to--he moved to Kansas City, Kansas, and it was a cat name--a guy, a funeral director named Nathan Thatcher, Thatcher['s] Funeral Home, still in Kansas City, Kansas, they started hanging around as old [Masonic] lodge buddies.  And Gramps was a Thirty-Third Mason and so was Mr. Thatcher, is the way I understand it.  And they just, Gramps just started hanging around the mortuary, and then he decided to go to school there in Kansas City, embalming school.  And twenty-six, like I said, July the tenth, 1926, he decided to move to Wichita [Kansas].  And we had a storefront over on Main Street.  And then he--in 1932, he built that mortuary, the building, single-purpose building.  Of course, couldn't get no financing, but he had--I remember him stating he--twelve, all of $12,000 to build that building.  I said, "You sure stayed with the twelves, didn't you?"  He said, "Yeah, twelve, $1,200 of capital to, to keep me open for a few days and it cost me $12,000 to build the building."  And saved all this money, saved all this money.  My, my dad would turn over in his grave if he figured out that Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I had, had, had gone through the processes of financing, financing some of the improvements we made around here and the acquisitions.  He didn't believe in borrowing no money.  Said, "Well shoot, all you got to do is set it over there."  But, it came right down to a very, very independent family, very independent.  Seven [days a week], twenty-four [hours a day], 365 [days a year], they say.  That's, that's how much time they put in the business, and afraid it wore off on us.  It really wore off on my son [Michael Jackson] here lately cause he, he gets home, he gets home whenever.  Genie and I, we--he takes a lot of that off of us now, so we don't have to really do seven, twenty-four.  We got a answering service, now after seven o'clock in the evening. Shoot, when my dad was running this place, shoot, we had one line, and one phone.  Nobody was the, nobody went anywhere without somebody manning the phone, manning the door.  So we started out early putting in that seven, twenty-four.
Speaker 2: Now, when your grandfather started this business, was he the first black funeral home director here in Wichita or were there others?
Speaker 1: No, there was, there was a Butler Funeral Home here, and he ran them out of town.  That's the way he likes to brag about it, said, "I run one of them out of town" and say, "Bring them on, bring on the rest of them (laughs)."  But he was very confident in his--he always told us, said, "Don't worry about the money anyway" and he said "It's the service that counts."  He said, "The service bring in the money," and, and he believed that.  He believed that.  In all he--there's been one, two, three other funeral homes here, and we're the only ones that's, that have stayed or sustained three other black funeral homes.  One of them is in, in Topeka [Kansas], it's Johnson Funeral Home now, and Butler, he just closed up.
Story_ID: 8747
Speaker 1: What about your father [Abner Jackson, Jr.], now?  He took over the business [the family's funeral home] from your grandfather [Abner Jackson, Sr.] ?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, they did one of them, did one of them legal things.  You know how everybody's talking about, make it legal.  He, the old man gave, gave Gramps a little stipend, cash up front, and then, and then paid him so much a month; kept him in Sansabelt [clothing brand] slacks and, and Banlon [type of knit clothing] shirts.  He loved that.  He had two great--you know, he was a character.  I say he was a character.  He had two great doberman pinchers, and them suckers would sit like they lions, you know how they show the lions on, they'd sit, sit there by his chair.  And he watching television, and them dogs sitting there.  "Gramps, it's me, I'm coming in."  He'd say, "Okay, all right."  He'd pick up his newspaper, all folded up, and if one of them dogs raise his head like that, (bam sound) (laughs).  So I--that's the only reason I got in the house.  Yeah, he, he was a character, but very good businessman.  And that, that's a blessing cause they knew how to manage.  And we wouldn't be this far without them.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your mother do for a living or in the community, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, mother [Janett Jackson] was a church woman.  Mother loved the church.  I mean she's, a she's a musician, and she, she had choirs and youth choirs, chancel choirs, all that stuff.  Anything that had to do with the church, mama was involved.  I even took her to a couple national conventions with me cause my wife, my wife was, Erma [Jean Stripling Jackson], she, she was secretary to the Kansas, Kansas State Convention President.  And so we'd load mama [Janett Jackson] up every now and then when she felt like it and we'd go to the national convention.  She got a kick out of that.  Of course, all you had to do was give my mother a room full of folk, boy, and she operated.  She knew half of the folk before you (laughs), by name before she left there.  Yeah, but I--some folk try to equate Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I, say, "You more like your mama.  No, you more like your daddy."  I say, "Well, my name is Abner (laughs)."  My dad didn't take no, no hostages.  But he had a heart that big, but you'd never see it.
Story_ID: 8748
Speaker 1: Reflect back on the neighborhood you grew up, and that's the historic neighborhood here in Wichita [Kansas]--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and tell me about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Okay, we were two blocks from the river on Water Street, and on Water Street, there was a, there was the Water Street Hotel, which was a black hotel.  That's where the [Kansas City] Monarchs [Negro League baseball team] and all the, all the, [Lucius] Lucky Millinder and his folks [Lucky Millinder Orchestra] used to stay when they were in town cause they, they couldn't go to the major hotel, five-star hotels.  They wouldn't accept them of course--Duke Ellington, he stayed down the street here about three blocks at, at a Dr. P. M. Bell's house when he was in town.  I was trying to think the other day, and I--and it'll come to me one of these days, [William] Count Basie, he stayed in a private home too when they was in Wichita.  But we had all of them in here.  We had all of them.  But the Calvary Baptist Church [Wichita, Kansas], which is now in the Kansas Black Historical Museum [sic, First National Black Historical Society of Kansas], and then the St. Paul AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church was the other church that's on Water Street.  So on Sunday morning, we'd have oodles of people from the West Side and the East Side.  We called the West side--a lady just reminded me a little while ago, she said,  "Yeah, you all stayed on the West side."  I said, "Yeah, that's right, and we didn't let y'all come west of Market [Street] either (laughs)."  And Market's one of the streets that, that runs through Wichita [Kansas].  And they would all come--we'd all, we'd let them all come to church (laughs), cause that's how I got my wife [Erma Jean Stripling Jackson] too.  She lived on the East side (laughs), and I wouldn't let her go back home.  But--.
Speaker 1: What would happen if you went on the wrong side of the--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, you, you'd, you'd find, you'd find your compadres over there, asking you, point blank, what you doing over here?  And we'd do the same thing to them.  But the town was separated into what we called--the street out here, 13th Street, (unclear) everything off of 13th Street where the park is--they call it McAdams Park now, it was named after--it was McKinley Park when I was growing up.  But we also had the YMC [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], Hutchinson Branch YMC was there on Water Street.  And so far as black businesses, they were all on kind of like Greenwood [Street] in Tulsa [Kansas], they were all on Main Street, had restaurants, pool halls, doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs, the whole bit.  Actually, our first mayor, black Mayor of Wichita who was A. Price Woodard, he and his dad had a law office there on Main Street.  And it was kind of interesting.  We got exposure--as, as a youngster, I got a lot of exposure to entrepreneurship without even having the ask to see, just observe, you know.  And it's helped.  It, it--I tell folks, I tell my kids all the time, "Don't, don't pay attention to what people say.  Sometimes watch their body language," and I, and I--Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I was, was fortunate that we were exposed to these kind of people that, they might not say that much, but you can watch their body language, they was watching your back, as I say too sometime (laughs).  But it was, it was, it was interesting.  See, the courthouse is over there, the Sedgwick County [Kansas] Courthouse.  The city building was moved farther south, and, of course, it didn't hurt for us to have a newspaper route.  We knew everybody up and down Water Street in Wichita and Waco [Street], and they knew us.  "There them Jackson twins. Uh, oh." (Laughs)  No, we wasn't that bad.  But we got a lot of exposure growing up.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite activities when you were a little kid?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Going down, going down to the river, which I said was two block away from us, catching crawdads, some, some part of the country they call it crawfish.  And we were catching crawdads and bring them home and then go up and down Main Street or some place and try to sell them (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay, people would buy them from you?
Speaker 2: Aww, heck, yes, you take them tails off and, and that's the best old shrimp you ever seen in the world, ever eat in your life.  And you put them in some red peppers and boiling water and (swish sound), and it was rough then.  We had a, we had a, we had a lady that, she wasn't much older than us.  The artist that we have on the wall, his mama, oh, man, we'd take them over to Gwennie's and we'd have a feast.  And the other thing was, of course, playing baseball, basketball, anything with games on.
Speaker 1: You spent a lot of time at the Y [YMCA], playing things or?
Speaker 2: No, the Y wasn't, the Y wasn't that--they didn't have gym or anything in the  Y  when it was over on Water Street.  It was more or less administrative.  About the, the only thing, that the  Y  offered was, was Camp Hyde, which was, had the horses and the cabins and all that stuff during the summer, about two weeks out of the summer.  So everybody was jockeying for positions to see who was going (laughs) going out there.  But so far as having a gymnasium or outdoor basketball courts or anything like that, they had 'em around the school.  Right next door to, to the museum [Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum], there was a school called Douglass [Elementary School, Wichita, Kansas], named, of course, after Frederick Douglass, where most of us on the West side went to school, 'til the eighth grade.  And, of course, you playing on rocks and sand and everything else, but we had, there were basketball courts, baseball diamonds and all that kind of good stuff out there.
Story_ID: 8749
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: Me?  How many?
Speaker 1: How many family members--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Just Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just you and your brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Genie and I, yeah, that's the reason we're so spoiled, yeah, yeah, just Genie and I.  But I got a bunch of what they call 'mentor sisters', you know.  They, they kind of looked after Genie and I as big sisters.  One of them just left here earlier this morning and she, she calls on the phone, she identifies her, "It's big sis."  She eighty-three years old. (laughs)  There's a little difference between eighty-three and sixty-nine, but I get a kick out of it cause she likes it.  So, but other--no, dad, dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] and mama [Janett Jackson], they quit after they had Genie and I.  I guess they didn't want to go through the trauma no more.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories surrounding the birth of you and your brother?  'Cause you and your brother have become famous twins here in the city--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah, and, and everybody's always, well, it's easy to say, "Val [Abner Jackson] or Gene, which one are you?", or that kind of admission to.  They had--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Is there a story around you all's birth at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, other than the front yard was full.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughs), really people coming--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, some folk--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --when you all came along?
Speaker 2: A lady--another family just left here, the Jones family, and she told me she went to school with mother [Janett Jackson].  Mother and them lived 1117 Madison [Street], and the Jones family, which is a pretty good-sized family, lived at 1130 [Madison Street].  And that was one of the things, she mentioned, "I was out in the front yard when you all were born." (laughs)  But other than, other than that, people just spoiled us.  I tell folks, I tell folks sometimes, "I was born and raised and spoiled right here in Wichita [Kansas], I didn't even have to leave town."  But nothing really exciting.  A bunch of firsts, you know, first this, first that, first this, first that, so far as political appointments and, and civic things.  They always want to make sure them Jacksons, one of them Jacksons is involved, "Look good on the letterhead," I tell them all. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Tell me this, I think when did you first become aware that you not only had a brother, but had a twin brother?  I mean I, I mean and when did you really become aware of that and what did that mean to you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know what you're say--I know what you're asking.  And I think about that every now and then.  It's when, when I--when we was always dressed--they always dressed us alike, you know, whether it was bib overalls and short pants or even the same color tennis shoes.  But when I got away from that was when I knew I was an individuals when they, they started letting--mother and dad start letting us dress different than each other.  But, yeah, that little picture--those pictures I gave you, you're probably notice them when you have time to look at them, we all look alike, always dressed alike.  And I guess that's when it really stuck that I was, I had a twin brother.  And we went from there.  That's about it, yeah, that, that's about it, Larry.
Speaker 1: But you had a sense when you were little that you were something special?
Speaker 2: Oh, heck, yeah.  I tell you people just spoiled us to death.
Speaker 1: So you got some mileage out of it?
Speaker 2: Got some mileage out of that.  Them Jackson twins is bad, but they can't do no wrong (laughs).
Speaker 1: So what was the best part of being a twin?
Speaker 2: The best part of being a twin is, is the, folk that you've known for years still can't tell us apart, I mean at this age.  We'd come home with the, "Which one are you?"  I'd say, "I'm the other one."  And they said, "Ah, this must be Val [Abner Jackson]," you know.  But that was the best part of being a twin.  And the other part, when we--they used to tease us about our wives, and even when we were courting,  "You sure you with the right one?"  (laughs) And we'd play that up, yeah, we'd play that up Larry and, it had it's thing.  We took the--they used to take, take photos on the sidewalk downtown, down on Douglas [Street].  And Charlie [McAfee] and Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I, Charlie and Genie and I was walking down there, we'd just got out of the [U.S.] Army, and they had the picture.  And I think Charlie still got that picture too cause we had it blown up.  But people look up there and say, "Now, which one is that?"  "That's Val, no, that's Genie, and that's blah, blah, blah," and just smile.  Then they ask, ask Charlie.  "I don't know."  He lying, you know what I'm talking about (laughs).  But those were, those were, those were good days.  I, I did--they used to tease Genie and I about switching places.  I put twelve years on the fire department before I decided to come back over here.  And they'd always talking about, "Are you, are you Val or Gene?"  It wasn't no Anderson or Abner, it was, "Are you Val or Gene?"  And had to go through them changes.  And we'd change seats at school and that kind of little mischief and stuff, yeah.
Speaker 1: See if you could get away with all that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and keep the, keep the teachers on the stick, yeah, yeah.  So we--it wasn't no, it wasn't no mundane operation--situation at all there.  If Genie and I was in a room, there was always something going on.  And Genie said, "I'd get him in trouble all the time, and I still do I guess."  But--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So you're the troublemaker?
Speaker 2: I'm supposed to be the troublemaker.  Genie's our spiritual leader.  That's what, that's what we talk about, Charlie [McAfee] and I, said, "Well, we got to talk to our spiritual leader and see if, see what he's got to say about it."  But, yeah, Genie, Genie's always been a little reserved, but talk, ooooh, he can talk.  I think it's rubbing off too cause I talk a lot more than I used to.
Story_ID: 8750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about what it was like growing up in the family business and mortuary.  You all actually lived in the mortuary--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --when you were kids.  Did people tease you about that?  Did other kids tease you about that?
Speaker 2: I still got a few of my friends, one is a Bishop here, Joseph Gilkey [Sr.], and they had a roast--they roasted Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I, ah, four or five years ago--no, longer than that.  Yeah, 'bout four or five years ago.  And, and Joe always tells the story, said, we used to knock on the door and ask if Genie and Val [Abner Jackson] could come out 'cause we knew we couldn't come in and play (laughs).  But, yeah, it's, it--the one thing I think I, in my, in growing up which I'm, I'm proud of the fact, I still got friends that date back forty-five, fifty years ago, that are about my age my now or maybe even older.  And they still acknowledge, we still acknowledge each other as friends.  And I don't think too many folk can do that.
Speaker 1: I think you're right.  I mean you were saying off-camera that you and your brother had been answering the phone for the mortuary since you were six or seven years old--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, coming out to attend the services, to serve the people and stuff and all ranges of--from every walk of life in the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, see, my first time, the first time Dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] pushed Genie and I out in front, we were back there on the door just as comfortable as all outdoors.  It was time for the viewing, and dad told, told--said, he told me, he said, "You open up the casket and Genie, you hold the flowers."  All at once it got quiet (laughs).  And, and he got so many compliments behind, behind that he just thought, oh, he said, "I, I'm there.  I'm there now."  But, yeah, it has, it has.  And some of those same folk tell me stories all the time about our attitudes and etcetera when we were growing up cause I went to school [Frederick Douglass Elementary School, Wichita, Kansas], I went to segregated schools up until I was in junior high and them teachers, them teachers during that time, they would take you home or, or give you a swat and call home before you got home and told your--so there was that, there was that connection that, that we were on, on our best behavior wherever, cause somebody was always watching you.  And I, they didn't have come, they didn't have to come with names.  They didn't have to say, "Val or Genie," they just said, "Them twins." (laughs)
Speaker 1: That'd cover both of you.
Speaker 2: That'd cover both of us, and then we had to stand before the throne.  Daddy said (motion).  I don't think it hurt me.  And folks--I'm noticing a lot here lately, especially them grandkids.  My daughter was telling me just a couple of days ago that somebody came up to her in church last Sunday, and said, "What are you doing with that belt?"  Said, "Don't you know, you, you can't, you can't use, use that belt on them kids."  She said, "Hey, I'm either gonna kill them after they five years old or I'm a have them squared around before they get five years old with this belt." (laughs)  And that, that, that, that Biblical thing, spare the rod, spoil the child, my folk didn't believe in that sparing the rod.  Jesus Christ, I can't--I get to thinking back there, Larry, and it--and it, it really comes down to I'm still here, you know, ain't got a whole bunch of bruises on me.  They always kept it, kept it in a logical place where they could put clothes over it.  So, you know, ain't no big thing.  But, yeah, see there I go.  My wife [Erma Jean Stripling Jackson] used to tell me all the time, said, "Why don't you write stuff down cause you get up there, and you get off on something, and you start rambling."  I said, "Yeah, okay."  I mentioned her, and a couple of weeks ago Genie and I got a community service award from St. Paul Methodist Church [Wichita, Kansas], and I told them, I said, "Well, I'm through, I've started roaming, rambling," and I said, "I can hear Erma telling, me, sit down, shut up." (laughs)  No words, all she had to do was (nods head).  Forty-one years I had that lady, and they didn't think it was gonna last twenty-five minutes after I got married.  But she stuck with me for forty-one years, gave me four nice children, all of them good.  And I been blessed, personally, I been blessed.

Speaker 1: What school did you go to and how did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--school was a piece of cake.  I guess it was a reasonable amount of intelligence, math, reading and writing and all that stuff, it didn't bother me.  I made good grades in, in school [at Frederick Douglass Elementary School, Wichita, Kansas] until I got to, till I got to high school and let them peers out there talk me into not doing my homework and all that kind of good stuff.  And then it got worse when I started out there at Wichita U [Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas].  I lasted a year and a half out there.  But just, just--fortunately I--my dad, my dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] had a high school education.  My mother [Janett Jackson] had a high school education.  My dad would, my dad would do, do his buss--do his business plans, keep his books and all that other good stuff with no formal training at all.  So I, so I kind of, I think, I think I really did, since you asked me, I think I felt like, you know, hey, you know, I can pick this up like osmosis, and I learned that word early in life, osmosis (laughs).  I can pick this all up by osmosis.  I don't have to get no formal education and sit up and listen to one of them professors lecture for fifty-five minutes, and then tell you class is out, and then the next day come back, and he want to give you a test.  Naw.  So I didn't last--that's as far as I, that's as--we--when they integrated the schools here in Wichita--that was a cute story behind that.  When they integrated the schools in Wichita [Kansas], I--Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I, Genie and I, and, of course, all the rest of 'em that were our age, went to junior high called, intermediate school, they called 'em then.  And we were--the first day of school we was sitting up in the classroom.  And the teacher came in, and she looked, and she took another look.  And she looked at her roll, and everything. She said, "I think you gentleman are in the wrong class."  "You're not supposed to be here until next year."  That's when they were starting in the ninth grade, eighth grade, eight, eight years through, through the black segregated school, and then start the intermediate schools in the eighth grade, in the ninth grade.  And we said, "Oh?"  So she got, looking again.  And she said, "Aren't you them Jackson twins? " I said, "Yes."  Said, "Well, I know your--I pass your, I pass your, your dad's place here on Water Street going over to visit my friends over on Waco Street."  "And I, I'll tell them that you're in our class."  I said, "Thank you."  That's all I needed, but she was, she was amazed at the fact, fact that here, here are these two black twins--and twins too, sitting in her classroom when she, she had the eighth grade and they didn't start over there till the ninth grade, started intermediate school till the ninth grade.  But, and then I went to [Wichita] North High School [Wichita, Kansas].  I went to North High School, and all the, all the guys and everybody--all the kids I grew up with were trying to go [Wichita] East High School [Wichita, Kansas] cause it's, it had, it had a majority, a more complement of blacks at East High School.  There was only thirteen blacks in my graduating class, high school graduating class.  And, man, you don't want to go over there, said, man, you can't even swim in the pool.  So, so Genie and I, we ain't got no sense.  When they, when they, Wednesday when they had, had swimming day, we stripped down buck and went in there, and nobody put us out of line.  We went every Wednesday from then on (laughs).  Old coach was very good, he, he--and both of us played athletics, baseball and football, not too much basketball cause the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], when they moved over here on, on Cleveland [Street], they had a gymnasium over there.  And it was more competition over there than it was on, on a high school basketball.  So we never did get wrapped up in that, but otherwise--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And what positions did you play in football and baseball?
Speaker 2: I played, I played end or wide receiver and in, in baseball, baseball, I played outfield.  I thought I was Carl Furillo (laughs).  I played, I played the outfield.  My brother threw--pitched, and I caught him every now and then.  Charlie [Charles] McAfee, he played first base, slow as right there on a fence.  I played--I--we had Charlie bat third in the lineup, and I batted clean up.  And I--the only reason we scored, I, I tell him all the time, the only reason you ever scored I had to hit a homerun cause you so slow (laughs), he's so slow, if I hit a single or whatever, he'd never make it to second base.  But that was one of them kid things.  And then we had baseball during the summer.
Speaker 1: Oh, just for the sake of those who are listening to this who hasn't heard Charlie McAfee, Charlie McAfee is a nationally known, nationally known, well, probably internationally known architect--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Architect, right.
Speaker 1: --in Wichita [Kansas] here who grew up with you.
Speaker 2: Best friend.  Best friend, get me in a lot of trouble, but he's still my best friend.  Yeah, they had--Charlie, Charlie was quite a basketball player too.  But his all, all his stuff came out--he didn't play high school, but all his stuff came out when he went to the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska] with big old Wilt Chamberlain and all them son-of-a-guns who was, who was floating around in the league that time.  You probably notice when you talk to him, he got a memory like a son-of-a-gun.  He, he can relate back so far, man, it just scares me sometimes.  But we're cut if off, he is, he--we've been friends for years.  They used to call us the 'Three Dungeons'.
Speaker 1: Three what?
Speaker 2: The 'Three Dungeons' (laughs) because we were always together, yeah.  I think you got a picture of some of, some of the people that we--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, I have.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --we're still related to.
Story_ID: 8752
Speaker 1: So when you were ready to graduate from high school [Wichita North High School, Wichita, Kansas], did you have an idea what you--did you think you were gonna take over your father's [Abner Jackson, Jr.] business or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, no, it took me twelve years, thirteen years, you might as well say, to even make up my mind.  I stay--I tried to stay away from here as long as I could cause I knew what they was--I was looking at seven, twenty-four.  And I wasn't ready for that.  My wife [Erma Jean Stripling Jackson] and I opened up a real estate company, and the, and the worse part about it, we was right across the street.  And when they got busy, I'd run over here, my wife would come over here sometimes and answer the phone and help mama [Janett Jackson] out.  But, no, I, I tried to stay away from here.  I put twelve years, twenty days and thirty minutes on the fire department (laughs).  And I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved the fire department.
Speaker 1: Now, you have to be pretty, pretty strong to be a fireman and be in good physical condition--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was in good physical condition, yeah, yeah.  I, I really was Larry.  I was in good physical condition, dragging them hoses and jumping off the back of the trucks, yeah, yeah.  And we got, we have a young man that, a young man, and David's the same age I am, that we went on the fire department together.  And he stayed, made chief and put in thirty years.  And arthritis done caught up with him now.  I told him, it wasn't nothing but that water (laughs).
Speaker 1: So this was the city fire department in Wichita [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, yeah, city fire department.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a fireman for twelve years?
Speaker 2: Twelve years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twelve years and twenty days, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were able to respond to calls and do all the stuff--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, get up in the middle of the night, slide down the pole and all that other good stuff.  All that stuff you see in, all that stuff you see in the movies, yeah, I, I did that.
Speaker 1: So this was right after Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas] or?
Speaker 2: No, I went into the Army in '53 [1953], which would have been that, right after Wichita State.  Of course, they called it Wichita University then.  And then when I got out of the Army, I--my wife and I were married [March 15, 1953] before I went in, and I told daddy, ain't no way in the world you can support my lifestyle.  So I got me a job at the fire department (laughs), with his blessing though cause he'd, he'd be there.  He'd be there probably almost three, four times a week cause they had the best dominos players in town up there.  And he thought he was quite a domino player, so he was checking on me and then still having fun anyway.  But, yeah, that, that, that's the twelve years after--and I, I left there in '67 [1967].  And dad said one day, he said, "Well, one of y'all got to go to school and get a license to hang on the wall."  So I lost and Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] won, which was fine with me.  He, he went to embalming school.  And then when he came back from embalming school in, in California, then that's when dad started saying little, saying, "You ain't going, make up your mind whether you stay or not."  I said, "Daddy, I make more money over in real estate in, in two, two weeks than I make over here--I could make over here in two months."  He said, "Well, you got to make up your mind. " So I said, "Ah, okay."  So one day, one day I closed the door, turned the key, put the sign in the window, and dad didn't believe I was gone stay anyway.  He, he liked--I think daddy respected me more as being independent and I respect him cause he, he, he was an independent person too.  He didn't ask nobody for nothing.  So far as--if it took another job to, to achieve his goals, he got him another job, even with running this building.  He used slip home at night, slip home during the morning hours or some place cause he worked, he always had a second shift, and maybe embalm or go out and make a pick up and then slip back to work.  And I think I got some of his independence from him, but that, that's the only--I never had a job other than on the fire department away from here other than when Erma and I, my wife and I had the real estate company.  And he talked her into going to school, and by osmosis, she taught me (laughs).  I had to quiz her, so I got me a broker's license, she--cause she got a broker's license too.  And when she died, when she died in '94 [1994], I just (fast wind sound), forget it, I'm through with it.  I got--getting too old to do two or three things at once.  And so I've been over here ever since.
Speaker 1: Now, you went to embalming school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: You never went.
Speaker 2: I never, I never went.
Speaker 1: Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] went.
Speaker 2: But the plan was, I found out, the plan was to send Genie to school or whichever one went, and then after he came back, then I was supposed to go to school.  It just didn't ever happen.  So I didn't--I, I tell my son all the time, I, I done got you and Genie both through embalming school, got your license and you got your little diplomas on the wall, so I ain't, do nothing.  But I know how to embalm, sure do, picked that up by osmosis too, but it ain't legal.  And I don't do it, and they won't let me do.  I say, they, I'm talking about my brother [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and my son [Michael Jackson].  They quite-quite a few, quite a technician themselves.  So I don't have no problems.  So I'm just a people person.  And I'm hanging around out in the front, and, and do arrangements and, and conduct funerals and all that kind of good stuff.
Story_ID: 8753
Speaker 1: I guess in the funeral business, correct me if I'm wrong, there're two different aspects to the businesses it seems to be or maybe even three.  One aspect is the embalmment of a person, and that's quite different from actually serving the grieving family and--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and being a host for a funeral service.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then the other aspect, I guess, is dealing with the place of internment, wherever that is, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, you can--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Unclear) make that arrangement with the graveyard.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So tell, just tell me about how does one conduct this business and what are the components of it?
Speaker 2: The first, the first aspect of it is very important, the embalming and, and cosmetology and, and getting the person ready for, for the family's approval, of course.  And that takes a lot of it.  I mean that, that's, that's one of the things that Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson], Genie and Michael [Jackson] both were very well schooled in.  And they still do a good job.  But that son of mine, he takes pride in that, which I'm glad.  And he gets a lot of compliments, and he kind of shrugs them off, you know, a forty-two year old--forty, Michael's forty-six.  And, but then the next phase runs into where you meet the family.  You meet the family and, and set some arrangements together and make the arrangements for the cemetery and make arrangements for, for the actual carrying out the funeral program in itself.  But the real test, the real test is when you're conducting--at least I think it is, when you're conducting the services and so forth at the church or chapel or whatever--cause you got folks come in there, "I'm her cousin.  I want a seat up in the front."  "You should have come with the original family, son."  And it's a way you say that, you know.  And, and usually goes down, but it's dealing with folk on, on a one-on-one basis that--we tell, we tell them, we got this young lady up in the front, Stephanie, that is very good.  We were blessed to get her as far as I was concerned.  She, her daddy and I was raised up together about two blocks from each other over on the West side, and we never lost contact.  And she always wanted to work in the business so John asked, John asked if maybe we might have a opening one of these days.  And we, we dealt with that.  We're very concerned about who represents us in whatever capacity, and I think that's one of the, one of the things that wears some folk out.  There was a story, there was a story that--I don't remember who told it to me, but it's been a few years ago, that a dad would send his son to college, got him a, got him a B.A. degree and almost a Masters in Business Administration, and blah, blah, blah; and waiting on, waiting on him to graduate, put a little sign on the door with his name on it and blah--and then called him in and had a conversation with him.  And he said, "I want you to start, start out there in the, in the garage and the yard with so and so, and learn everything that he does and then we'll talk again, and I'll see if I'll move you inside and turn you over to one of the counselors.  And you'll learn everything here."  And the son kept saying, "No, I don't think so, dad."  He said, "Well, what do you want?"  He said, "I want to sell you my fifty percent." (laughs)  His dad gave his fifty percent of the business when he got out of college.  "I want to sell you my fifty percent."  Was it dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] or somebody or another--it had to be a funeral director that had to tell me that story.  But he said, "That's what you call an ingrate."  And I, I never want to put myself in that position, but there's not too many, as you, as you probably know, there ain't too many people across the country can go back four or five generations, cause it's always a break off at some time.  There's nobody with a family name that, that's actually running, running a operation.  A lot of, a lot of funeral directors nowadays, especially the older ones, they'll pick up somebody and make them general manager of the mortuary and, and just go home and send me a check.  Yeah, and we haven't been that fortunate.  We haven't had to do that part of it, but it's a seven [days a week], twenty-four [hours a day] and a lot of folk don't want to be in this business.  When mama wants, got to go to the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] meeting, and there's something, something that mama's planned for the children or either for herself personally, you know.  You do the best--next best thing, whatever keeps you at home, (laughs) which a lot of times you turn down those invitations cause you got something else to do so far as the business is concerned.  I think that's about probably, that's probably the most restriction that I've ever run into this business anyway.  Of course, they, like you say, they got telephones and pagers and all that kind of stuff now, and first thing I do when I walk in a room, I put my telephone there on the side, and set, on the table or either the chair next to it.  I turn the volume up on the boy 'cause ain't no telling when I get a call.  And if I get call, "Bye y'all, I'm gone." (laughs)  So it's, it's challenging.  It really is.  It is challenging.
Story_ID: 8754
Speaker 1: Are there any particularly memorable events that have taken place in your career here as a funeral director in regards to funerals?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all the time.  For the--it's an emotional thing, especially if you've known people for so long.  You get, get through maybe the first part of it, but when it comes down to, to the last rites and all that other good stuff, at least I do, I always get the feeling I need to say something, which I don't do it that often, but when I say something, I'm too emotional cause I start relating back to what we used to do.  I don't know whether you ever heard, heard of Attorney Chester Lewis?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Chester--Chet, well, he, he was our, our man.  I mean Chet was something else.  He'd, he, he wasn't that much older than we are, but we put a lot of confidence in Chet.  When we built this building, when my dad [Abner Jackson, Jr.] built--no, we built this building on this side.  My dad built the other side.  We just had to intimidate the mortgage company and take Chet down there with us to look over the papers before we signed (laughs).  And he did it.  But when we had the funeral, when they had the little service cause Chet was cremated, when they had the little service out at WSU [Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas], the place was, was jam-packed.  Folks was getting up making remarks as, as to their association with Chet.  And Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] got up and said something, and he couldn't get through it, so I, I said, "I ain't gonna do it no more either."  But it, it's folks you've known for years.  And you asked me about a picture on the wall there, said, "Who is that?"  And I told--said something like "Tater Smith and little boy, big boy, Tater and all of them."  I have, I had waited almost to they were fixing to march out, and I got behind the microphone and I started--I don't even remember what I said, but I couldn't finish it.  And Tater's wife come up to me after that, and she said, "I know what you doing--y'all was real close."  Said, "Yeah, closer than a brother."  And, of course, when you grow up, when you grow up in a neighborhood, when you grow up in a neighborhood where you know ninety percent neigh--people in the neighborhood, you just can't, you just can't, cannot get around not having some association with them, even if you read their name in the paper, it's still, still you--they're still people that you care about.  And that's, that's what happens here a lot of times with Genie and I, there are folks that, that we've known for all these years.  And you start flashbacks--that's a good one, and flashbacks start happening to you.  So you just try to give them the best service you can.  And try to stay off of it, but it's hard, it's hard.  It's hard, yeah, it's hard.  Yeah, I got a couple of them over there now that I grew up with.  One of them used to live right across the street from us when we was over on Madison [Street].  And Richard--Richard's seventy-eight, I think, something like that.  But my mother [Janett Jackson] used to be--my mother was smart, boy, ooooh, she was smart.  She would, she would set us out on the front porch when we was down here on Cleveland [Street], set us out on the front porch with a big old tub of popcorn, and then tell them, tell the kids over across, say, "Come on and have some popcorn."  Well, they'd babysit for mama for about a hour and a half. (laughs)  She had some place to go while they was sitting there eating my popcorn.
Speaker 1: These are the rewards of knowing everybody.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah, you don't have no, have no problem with, with--they, they eventually called 'em babysitters, but there was folks, there was folks in the neighborhood that, that tracked you, if you was doing right or wrong, most of the time we were wrong.  Then you got a phone call, you know.  "Val [Abner Jackson] down here acting a fool."  So explain why you was acting a fool.  "Oh, no, so--no, no, no, no, no, Sister Helen, she ain't never told no lie, and don't you be sitting up here talking about she lying," you know, that kind of concern, which it, it didn't go over too good, but after you get old enough, you can appreciate it.  And that's what--that's the reason I alluded to that anyway, that they--there is an advantage.  There is an advantage.  [First Lady] Hillary [Clinton] wasn't wrong when she made that statement about the, the neighborhood is--how'd they put that last--?
Speaker 1: It take a village to raise a child.
Speaker 2: It takes a village to raise--that's right, Crowe yeah.  She wasn't wrong about that cause a bunch of them, ooooh, families over there, nine and ten people, the mama had to work; no, no daddy in the house, just went from one house to the other, and, and felt comfortable.  Folks looked after you.  And that, that really makes a difference--or did make a difference in my life, I know.
Story_ID: 8755
Speaker 1: When they have wakes, it's--folks figure that, all across the country, some of them are still, still having wakes.  We, we, we have what we call familitation--family visitation, the family can come down [to Jackson Mortuary, Wichita, Kansas] the night before, and we don't serve no coffee, cookies or crumpets and none of that kind of stuff like some of them do, but we have a situation where from 9:00 o'clock in the morning till 7:00 o'clock in the evening, after the family's given us permission that the, the deceased lies in state for public viewing.  It gets it away from them.  But, yeah, like you say, the repast of dinners and all that kind of stuff, they all have them at the church or they have a couple of places in town they rent sometimes.  They'll take them out to Ryan's or out to Hometown Buffet or whatever, which means they don't have to clean no dishes up and whatever, but no, the repast and everything, usually at the church.
Story_ID: 8756
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently than you've done so far?  I mean do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: In my life span?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I think the exposure from the time that they--that I was birthed at 1117 Madison [Street, Wichita, Kansas], that, that the, the blessed part of it is the fact that there was folk that, that are still concerned about, about me individually and my brother [Anderson Eugene Jackson] individually and in association with the business we're in.  I think that--of course, it was, it was, it was--we were kind of raised with, with the attitude, "Don't do as I say, but do--don't do as I do, but do as I say" attitude.  When my daddy [Abner Jackson, Jr.] said--and my daddy, he had all the help in the world, we were down on the school ground playing basketball and he walked out there to the curb in front of the mortuary [Jackson Mortuary], and they said, "There your daddy looking for you."  He had all the help in the world. (laughs)  We knew that he had--we had to go home, but that was--ah, I wouldn't change nothing.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Might, might be more appreciative during my younger days than I, than I was.  But that's all them flashbacks come back, and I tell, tell my Bishop friend [Bishop Joseph Gilkey, Sr.] that, you know, it took me almost thirty years to figure out why them sisters would say, "Them saints would sit there and say, 'How you doing today?'"  I'm blessed.  To figure out what that meant rather than trying to decipher the words and just to figure out what their honest feeling was.  It comes outta there.
Story_ID: 8757
Speaker 1: This position, and this notoriety has opened a lot of other doors for you to do public service and--(unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you find yourself on boards and, and advisory councils and other things.  Tell us something about some of the things you do?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I was on, first thing I was on, and--was the Metropolitan [Area] Planning Commission, which was in charge of, of all the zoning, zoning and planning so far as Wichita [Kansas], which was nice.  And I didn't know, at the time I was appointed, the time I was appointed, I didn't even know what the heck the doggone thing was.  And then I, of course, first, first, first couple of things and other things that, that I've been appointed to, [Wichita] Chamber of Commerce and, and the, the--there's a private, private, public organization here a few years ago, and them jokers talk too fast for me.  And they started taking me for granted.  And that's the worse thing in the world to take me for granted.  And they had the, they had the, they had the reappointments spread around, you know, oh, what's his name.  He's president after Bowen, vice president--senior vice president after Bowen.  He said, "Well, I know, Abner [Jackson], you gonna, you gonna stay on for another three years."  I said, "No, I don't think so."  And it got so quiet around there, boy, you could hear a pin drop.  So rather than embarrass him, I just walked out during the break and never went back.  Nobody called, know what I'm saying. But, yeah, you're put in that position, or at least they put that position on, you know, you'll be doing a service and what (unclear), and then my friends and I that had been put in the same position, we just said, "Well, we'll just compare notes."  It's kind of like Jesse James, etcetera.  I'd go down to the meeting, find out what's going on, and come back and hand them one of the brown envelopes, and say, "This is what they trying to do."  Ed Sexton, Ed Sexton was one of [Robert] Dole's when he was up there at, as chairman of the Republican Party.
Speaker 1: [U.S.] Senator Robert Dole?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum, right.  And old Ed and I--I was on the Metropolitan Planning Commission at that time, and Ed was in town.  And I tried to talk to him before we got to the meeting.  And we was sitting up there, and I was thumbing through this doggone planning book.  And I said, "Ed, you know, they gone turn your, your neighborhood into, to a facilities yard, they be dumping gravel and heavy trucks and all that stuff going through there."  He said, "Let me see that."  So he read it, and he got up and made one of them long, drawn-out speeches in protest.  And, of course, they listened to him 'cause--and then the next couple of days after that, the, the director of the Planning Department called me up, and he said, "Abner [Jackson], where'd you get that book from?" 'Cause it was all marked up, underlined and all that other good stuff.  I said, "You gave it to me."  He said, "Oh, I gave you the wrong book," he said, "And I'm in trouble."  I said, "You sure are 'cause you ain't getting it back." (laughs)  But that, a lot, lot of the positions that, that we had volunteered to be a part of was only to find out what's going on and, and just pass the information on to whoever else can use it.  But, oh, yeah, always ask me, always ask me, I'm always here, especially after I turned fifty, turning them down.
Speaker 1: So what do you plan on doing in the future?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beside going to Bimini [Bahamas]. (laughs)  Nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay, you all are pretty popular, and I know sometimes, I know in my hometown where even the, you know, funeral home directors become politicians.  That happens in a lot of hometowns.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) big time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Unclear) politics.
Speaker 2: They want to turn into politicians, that's right.  No, I'm--I, no I, no, ain't for me.  They tried to get me to run for the city commissioner.  See, our city commission government, we're city management type thing.  Well, for, for years, you ran at large, and they go one, two, three, four, so far as, as the votes as to whether or not you're appointed.  Well, now they go in districts.  They got districts out.  But some of the, some of them high-powered jokers tried to get me--and they said money wasn't no problem and--to, to run for the city commissioner.  I said, "No, man, no, un-un."  And that's the best, best thing I could've told them, best thing I could've told them.  I, I hadn't--I have learned over the years, Larry, that never put yourself in a position where you're obligated to other folks, as to what you do or whatever, and I, and I picked that up early.  And they gonna buy a [Abner] Val Jackson, you know.  You can't buy Val Jackson.  This Val Jackson ain't even got a price on him.
Speaker 1: So you think you have more influence actually not being in a position like that?
Speaker 2: Ah, heck, yes, especially one's, the elected, elected position, yeah.  You know, we have, we have a, we have and always have had a traffic pattern.  And my brother [Anderson Eugene Jackson], he loves to put stuff out there on the counter.  People pick up the newspapers, pick up the little tabloids and all that other good stuff or stuff he think they might be interested in.  And we, we always had, had an influence on, on a few things.  But so far as being in a, in a position like Billy McCrae--Billy McCrae was one of our senators, and his daughter, his daughter--and he and his daughter both were commissioners.  And both of them got, got, got tired out.  And so they don't want--and they, you know, there's no longevity to none of it.  And I, I can hear my, I can hear my sibling [Anderson Eugene Jackson] or my children telling me, "You got to be out of your mind."  I ain't running for nothing.  And, and, and I know where they got it from, my body language. (laughs)

Speaker 1: As you look back on the years, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope, I hope my legacy is other than, is the fact that I like people.  I can, I can deal with people and, and respect them and do business with them in all veins of life, and, and still keep my own character going.  I--and, you know, of course, that's flashback too, back to when we were talking about how long I been, been around the mortuary business.  But that's giving me that confidence in myself that I can almost do anything.  I can almost do anything if I wanna do it; just thought of another one of my deals.  You asked me a while ago about some of my favorite sayings,  whatever I want to, most of the time  (laughs).  They get a kick out of that, just like you laughed then, (laughs), boy, they get a kick, said, "Well, you, Val [Abner Jackson], I know you do, you keep on walking, yeah."  But I think that would be my legacy, is that, that I'd like to pass on, is that station, station, station, station, station, and just respect people for who they are, and stay away from the ones you don't want to be bothered with, cause they probably don't want to be bothered with you, if they can pick up your body language.  So then you won't have no complications going.

Speaker 1: Now, did you parents, were your parents proud of you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, they were proud of me.  My mother [Janett Jackson] was always bragging on us, but my dad [Abner Jackson Jr], he was reserved.  But, and he had a stroke just about week before, before he died.  And he leaned up, and he said, "Don't leave me."  Never asked for me (laughs)--independent, never asked me or whatever.  If it's cutting the yard out there, you know, he'd get you started and then come back inside.  But they--yeah, that, that's--dad, dad gave you them compliments and you could feel them, but he didn't mouth them, you know.  He didn't mouth them, but he, we would feel it, cause then he'd give you more, he'd give you some more challenges.  I guess that's what I need to say.  He'd challenge you.  My grandson, my grandson--and we still do, or they do, now, I don't do it very much, maintain their own facilities, painting and, and cutting the grass and all that other good stuff--I told my grandson, Ron [Jackson], "I had a pair of clippers and hoe to edge around here.  And now you got a machine that just (hums)."  "Ah, you didn't need it Grandpa."  I said, "The heck I didn't and your daddy [Michael Jackson] did too, 'cause we didn't that machine until after Gramps [Abner Jackson Sr.] left here. (laughs)  Gramps, Gramps would sit out there and tell you to take that hoe--he even had two hoes, one lawn hoe, you can stand up and chop, chop the edge off the grass, you know, and make it even with your sidewalk and all that good stuff.  And then the sharp one, where you get down on your knees (chopping sound).  And when, when he didn't make you go back, you know you made, did a good job.  So that was his way of compliment in some respects, yeah.  He didn't, he didn't, he didn't--'cause if you didn't do it right, shame on you, you better stay out there until you did do it right or stay out there long enough to please him.  And he'd let you know he appreciated it.
Story_ID: 8760
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, how would you like to be remembered?  This is slightly different from legacy.
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered other than a good family man and a Christian, one that believes in, in the higher being and one that, that, respect, gets respect type of individual, yeah, I think so.  I think so, right.  I don't, I don't, I don't really believe, and I'm being hypothetical about the whole thing, I really don't believe ain't nobody don't like me, cause I like everybody (laughs).  I wouldn't stay up late at night trying to figure out the ones that don't like me.  And if they have, they kept it a secret.  So that, I guess that, that's being remembered too, but, yeah, that, that would work for me.  That would work for me.  Like I tell Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and, and my family, I said, "If more than three people at my funeral, you know I must've did all right." (laughs)
Story_ID: 8761
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a newspaper article they put in the, in the local newspaper here when I was made chairman of the board, chairman of the Metropolitan [Area] Planning Commission [Wichita, Kansas].  That's, must have been 1967 or eight [1968] or somewhere in that neighborhood.  And they, they used an analogy that Jackson--that I, I was wearing two hats; in one of them, I was sweeping out the cars or cleaning them up, and the other one was I, I was looking over properties to, for zoning purposes, etc., which was part of it.  And then they wrote all that, and I haven't read that thing in so long, I don't remember what they wrote about.  But it didn't make no difference.  It was another one of them ego tripping (laughs).

Speaker 1: That's when Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I were in the Army.  We were stationed in Fort Taylor, New York.  That should have been about 1955, '54 [1954] or '55 [1955].  And we went over to Bayonne, New Jersey at the Army Base over there for soldier of the month awards.  We didn't make soldier of the month, but we did get, get our picture taken.  We, we were stationed at, we were stationed in New York for two years.
Speaker 2: Can you name the people that are on here?
Speaker 1: I can't, I can't remember the two guys in the middle (unclear) and, but Genie, Genie and I were on, on the ends.

They [Women in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] called theirselves roasting Genie [Anderson Eugene Jackson] and I one night, and that's where we were, all dressed up, had a tie and white shirt on and the whole bit.  And on the left, of course, is my wife, Erma [Jean Stripling Jackson].  Erma and I was married for forty-one years.  I, as I said, off camera, we had four children, two boys and two girls (sigh), and that's where, that's where, where Bishop [Joseph] Gilkey [Sr.] told them that he couldn't come in the house.  They know they couldn't come in.  They'd knock on the door and ask if we could come out.  That's where he broke that out there.

I haven't been back to see them since, but they're supposed to have some type of verbage underneath it.  But that's where that's from.

And we were--and that's, of course, my, my friend, Charles McAfee in the middle there.  We had applied and, and got, got a franchise for thirty hotels across the country.  I think we got about twenty-eight, twenty-nine in our head, or at least, that could make it work in the, in the communities, in the black communities and borderline communities.  Brand new--that's the president for Cendant.  And, you know, my--that's Genie on the, on the right, the far right.  We had a big, big shindig, invited them to town, fed them and invited some, some friends of ours.  And that's where that happened.
Speaker 2: Did you all get the hotels started or have you--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: No, no, the bank ran out of money (laughs), which is nothing unusual.  Actually, they loaned us more money than they ever thought we gone pay them back.  But, you know--.

Speaker 1: Reverend J. W. Hayes was pastor of that for years.  My, my grandfather [Abner Jackson, Sr.] was a deacon, and he used to work at the post office, and when they were building that church [Shiloh Baptist Church, Wichita, Kansas], he'd leave the post office and change his overalls, and then lay brick.  So they built that church, the constituency built that church over there.  And it's kind of interesting, a couple of, a couple of years ago, they were talking about moving that, moving the church over on--a block over cause they was gonna build that expansion, (unclear) on the other side of--.
