 Neurohr  Skarky  Today is October 15, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian at Oklahoma State University. I   m here today with Ms. Evelyn  Storm Skarky. This is an interview for the O-STATE Stories oral history  research project of the OSU Library and this particular group of  interviews is of the Women of Willard. We   re very excited that you all  are here this weekend for your fiftieth Reunion.  Looking forward to it.  And for the opportunity to interview with you. Thank you for  participating in the interview today.  Our pleasure.  Can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up and about your  parents?  I was born and raised in Kingfisher County. Lived on a farm about ten  miles northwest of Kingfisher. I had two younger sisters and a younger  brother  and  they all attended Oklahoma State University. My high  school years were during the drought of the    50s, so a farmer   s daughter.  I won   t say we had a bad life. We had a good life, but it was different  with the drought because there were no crops for a number of years. Had  a lot of things that were, as my dad used to say,    the banker owned  them.    But he always said that with a smile. He was a very progressive  person in that when I was a freshman and had some problems with one  of the courses, I wrote him a letter and told him I wasn   t coming back. I  got a letter, I wished I had saved it always because in it he told me that  he had been a farmer all his life. He said,    We put a crop in the ground  and then we pray and if it goes like it   s supposed to, we have a crop in  the spring. If we don   t, we start all over and we do it again.    That was  his way of telling me that I needed that education. I needed to stay where  5  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  I was. He had had to leave school. His mother died when he was a little  boy and he and his brother had left high school. He was a sophomore in  high school and had to be at home and had to help plant and do all of the  things that were necessary for a living and in doing that he   it was kind  of the basis for what I am or what I feel I am today.  My mother was born and raised in Loyal, Oklahoma. She had about a  year and a half or two years of college education. She went to the  Women   s College in Chickasha,  Oklahoma . When she and my dad  met, they married and she didn   t continue her education, so she was a  homemaker. I liked being raised on the farm. My children, when they  were little and we moved back here, loved to go back to the farm. They  always felt that was a good place to go and our middle daughter lives in  Kingfisher and has raised her two children there. So it   s kind of a full  circle.  Did anyone else in your family go to OSU?  Yes, my sister just younger than I who has been gone for twenty years,  she came for one year. Probably of all of us,  she  should have been the  one who stayed. She didn   t like school. She was a very adept at  mathematics and she went home and she found a job as a bookkeeper  and probably one of the best ones the Co-op ever had in Kingfisher. I  have a sister, Barbara. She had a degree in home economics from here.  She taught and then worked at the Enid State School in their program  where they teach the youngsters how to live out and go out into an  apartment and live on their own. Then I have a brother who has a degree  in agriculture from here. All four of us attended and Marie was probably  the most capable, but her interests were elsewhere.  Did your parents influence you to choose OSU?  I think in the    50s with a farm background, this was probably the school  for me to attend. However, I had thought I was going to go into nursing  and a good friend, one of the teachers at the school, his wife had  graduated from Southwestern and they had a good nursing school and  she was scheduled to take me out there to enroll in nursing. We had a  nursing course in our high school home economics class. I changed  schools and I also changed tunes and chose to come over here.  Had you been to OSU before?  No, I had not been on the campus before.  What were your first impressions?  6  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Well, very big for a country kid. And  a  beautiful campus where the  grounds are all immaculate. I knew one of the men who was responsible  for the campus, his daughter had been my friend in high school and they  had moved over here two years earlier. I was not surprised at the beauty  of the campus because of all the things that Wilbur always talked about,  but there were like seventeen thousand students on the campus at the  time. I don   t know how many are here now.  Twenty-three thousand now.  So that was a pretty good size group probably because a lot of the  veterans were starting back to school.  From the Korean War?  No, more just from kids who had been in the service, like my husband  was in the service and then came back. Then there were a large number  of veterans that were in classes here. I think that enrollment was  probably higher right then than it was and maybe because they drafted a  lot of people.  They  saw that staying on the farm was not going to be  the thing to do.  What was your major?  Vocational Home Economics.  And when did you graduate?  In May 1959.  When you came to OSU, was Willard Hall the first place that you lived?  Yes. I had a very interesting room. My room was right over the front  door. Of course, all of these young ladies were searching for that man of  their dreams. It was a very popular room because as freshmen you had to  be in the dormitory at eight o   clock. And you could not leave unless you  went to the library from eight to ten. Our room became the one that  everybody peeked out the window to see who got the goodnight buzz  and who didn   t because there was no scamming anybody about,    I got  that special kiss.    Because everybody upstairs was watching. (Laughter)  There was no fairytales. (Laughter) They had to tell the truth.  Well the freshmen had to be in at 8 o   clock, but you could go to the  library and study from eight to ten o   clock, how did they know if you  were really going to the library to study?  7  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  I would best say that    you better have been at the library.    (Laughs)  Was there a sign in sheet?  No, there was no sign in sheet, but I think there was that intimidation  that this is the rules. Today   s society is a little different about rules.  They were pretty well followed in our day. I know that I only went to  the library two or three times a semester then because I probably had a  lab or something and I couldn   t get there. I worked in the cafeteria at  Willard. My time from say five to eight was limited from time to time.  What did you do in the cafeteria?  I was very fortunate. The first semester I gave out coffee and milk and  drinks. And then the second semester, the dietitian that was in charge  came one day and asked if I would like to work taking tickets and  money. I did that for a year and a half.  Did you like that better?  Yes. That didn   t make a whole lot of difference, but it was a big boost  for me to be allowed to take care of the money. I worked with an older  lady that had been there for some time and she became ill and the  dietitian said she was not going to be back for an extended period of  time. The lady came and asked me if I would like to take that position  and to help them and I was allowed to stay and do that. It was an  interesting job. I got to meet all of them. I got to meet all of the people  from our dorm and two boy   s dorms across the road. (Laughs)  So the Willard dorm served?  Served. Yes. You got a meal ticket at a certain place and it could be used  at numerous cafeterias. I got to meet a lot of interesting people.  What were the boy   s dorms that it served?  Oh, I don   t know. It was across west. I don   t know. I can   t remember the  names. Murray? Murray was one. And then one of them was   it was the  old one across from the Home Economics building. It was long and  skinny. I don   t know even know if it   s still there anymore.  I   m sure there   s maybe a picture in the yearbook. Okay help me  visualize what the cafeteria looked like.  The cafeteria was small in comparison to what you think is a cafeteria  today. You went in one door. You went around. You had two or three  8  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  choices of everything to choose from. Food was always very well  prepared and very attractive, edible. You don   t think of college or you  don   t think of school cafeterias as being really good food, but it was a  very well run cafeteria. I think one of the things that I remember most  about eating at Willard is on Sundays. The dining area was all   every  table was clothed and you had a hostess that set up the head of the table  and the guests and you were a guest. I mean, if you came and you came  in and sat down at one of these tables, the hostess was expected to  introduce you to anyone at the table to visit with you. Run much like  what we were learning in home economics. It became very festive.  When my parents and when my brothers and sisters came for Sunday  dinner it was beautifully set up. My mom was very impressed. Of  course, having gone to a girl   s school that was something they   they  dined on the tablecloth all of the time. It was interesting for her. The first  time she came she was like,    Oh wow.    But I think it led a lot to us  learning who sat beside us to eat, rather than it just being    bring you  tray, sit down, and eat, get up and leave.    People made a real effort to  get to know the different people that came in and sat at their table.  I saw that change   I was only in the dormitory my freshman and  sophomore year and I knew I   d stay friends with the dietitian and with  several people that continued to work there the four years we were in  school. And whenever we had a party, I always got an invitation to come  back because they would have sundae parties and everybody would  make their own sundaes and they would say,    Well, come join us.    But  when they stopped doing the tablecloths, I think you saw a difference in  the way people meshed at meal time. Just that one day made a big  difference. I think it added a lot. For someone who had never been in a  situation where they actually went to a restaurant where they had a  tablecloth on the table, I think it was a real learning experience, a real  graceful thing.  Who served as the hostesses?  Whoever sat down at one of the ends, and it was designated. The tables  were running north-south. It was like the people that sat in the chair at  the south of the tables   those were the hostesses.  And how many seats would be at the table?  There were eight. There were three on each side. It was small enough  setting to where people could have a good conversation and get to know  each other.  Was the food all you can eat?  9  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  No, no. It was servings.  Was there a salad bar or anything like that?  You had a number of deserts. You had a number of salads to choose  from. A couple of entrees. So there was a selection. I know that my mom  liked to make custards. Bake custards and some of them, as youngsters,  we liked and some of them we didn   t. She was delighted when she came  and I took a baked custard and it was cold even. It wasn   t hot out of the  oven and she was delighted to see that I took that and chose that to have  to eat because it was something that she had been trying to get us kids to  eat for a number of years. But there were different things that you had  maybe that you had not had before or maybe that you had and nothing  else looked as inviting. And that custard really looked inviting.  Are there any other foods that stand out in your memory?  No. The one thing that I remember about the cafeteria, as far as my job,  was cleaning the coffee pot and you can imagine the coffee pot was like  a hundred-cup one. One of the old-time commercial ones and I had to  get on a three-step ladder to get up so that you could get the brush down  the pipe and clean it out. (Laughs) So it was a lot of fun. A lot of fun.  Okay, you mentioned that your room was above the door, the main  entrance. Can you describe what your room looked like?  (Laughs) It wasn   t very big. It looked very big then, but I   ve been in  some of my grandchildren   s since then and it   s not very big. There were  two single beds, two desks, two closets   the closets were no bigger than  the size of a regular size door and that depth, but someone said once,     Well, you   ve got from the ceiling down.    Like, oh yeah. It did have a  lavatory in it. Well for a farm kid, I didn   t have indoor plumbing until I  was twelve or thirteen, but cleanliness and having something to be able  to use in your room was a lot different than having to take everything  down to the public bathrooms. That in itself was an interesting aspect of  dorm life. (Laughs) Trotting down the hall in your nighty and your robe  and carrying all of your items with you to take a shower, to go to the  bathroom. There were sinks there if you wanted to brush your teeth or  something there.  We decorated the window. Not with a very heavy curtain because we  found out very soon that it wasn   t going to stay that way very long  (laughter) with the room that we   d been assigned. It was like,    Okay,  we   ve got to have that out of the way so we can see everything that   s  going on downstairs.    (Laughter)  10  Neurohr  Skarky  I   ve heard stories about a buzzer system, that each room had a buzzer.  Yes, when you had a guest, they had to go to the desk and ask for you  and give you the room number and then they buzzed the room and you  buzzed back. There was one instance when I was a sophomore. My  buzzer went off about five o   clock   I can   t remember if it was Friday or  Saturday night. I wasn   t expecting anyone and a lot of the girls were  gone for the weekend, busy doing things. I went down to see who it was  and it was a lady who needed a babysitter and she thought she had  buzzed the right room and we went through a different number of people  we knew that did babysitting. The house mother   s name was Mrs. White  and I said,    I didn   t have anything planned. If Mrs. White would check  me out,    because our parents had to check us out in order to do anything  like that, I said,    If you will       and she knew me well enough to know  that I wasn   t scamming her, but she said,    I will sign you out.     So I went to the car with this lady. She and another lady were going to  Oklahoma City to  the  Home Show. They were going to be back by  midnight. This was about five o   clock in the evening  and they dropped  us off at the movies . I had three children and I was to take them to the  movie and I was to take them to eat and then take a cab to their  apartment. I had no idea where I was going after dark except that I had  an address and a key. And midnight came, no people returned, one  o   clock, two o   clock, three-thirty in the morning. One of the things that  the dormitories have is the house mother who was there through the day  and then you had the night house mother and she liked to sleep after ten  o   clock. She did not like to be up herding anyone and so anyway, they  took me back to the dormitory. By the time we got there it was four  A.M. and the lady, she looked at me and she shook her head and she  said,    Where have you been?    and I said,    Mrs. White can explain to  you at breakfast.    Because I had to be at work by six. I said,    I   ll see you  downstairs at breakfast.    So she went back to sleep.  I went to my room and got two hours of sleep, went down to work, and  when the house mother, Mrs. White, came down, she said,    Goodness, I  heard you didn   t come in until 4 A.M.    I said,    Right.    She said,    Was  everything okay?    and I said,    Well, the ladies just didn   t come back  from Oklahoma City.    And I said,    At midnight I didn   t know what to  do. Let alone one, two, or three.    So she kind of shook her head. She felt  bad that she had probably sent me out. Probably felt better that it was me  than someone else. But anyway the night house mother came down later  and she said,    I can   t believe what they did to you.    And I said,    I  apologize for waking you up at four o   clock in the morning.    She was  able to laugh about it. But I think when she saw me she was like,    Oh,  my gosh.    And she didn   t realize anybody was still checked out.  That was the thing, when she saw me, her first thought was that I had  11  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  skipped out. But Mrs. White had not communicated with me that I was  properly signed out. If you had a date, they came, they buzzed you and  then they waited in the living area which was beautiful   had lots of nice  sofas and beautiful furniture. A neat place to meet somebody for the first  time.  Was it like a doorbell kind of a buzzer on the wall?  Yeah, one of the little round buttons. You could hear them going off on  date nights. Weekends, you know, they   d be going off. Somebody would  holler,    My date   s here     (Laughter) Lots of fun. I had forgotten about  the buzzer. (Laughter)  What about the telephone?  Well, the telephone, you had to sit in a line on the floor beside and wait  your turn and that was not a fun thing. I had a good friend whose  boyfriend was injured in a shooting accident and I sat with her on the  floor most of the night waiting for news of him coming out of surgery.  The telephone thing sticks in my mind for that reason. I was already  dating  someone  that I would marry. I didn   t get a lot of telephone calls.  I didn   t have to make a lot of telephone calls or wait to get any, but it  was a little room. Had a really little bit of privacy. We at least had a little  bit of privacy. It was about as much as anybody would give you, but you  had to wait your turn. Sometimes it seemed forever.  Was it on a table or on the wall?  I think it was on the wall, but I   m not sure. I can   t remember. I know  that the one Barbara and I sat next to all night, we went down into the  lobby down on the first floor and had given them that one that was in a  booth. We used to have phone booths and given them that one so that  they would have a direct call to us. I remember sitting down there way  into the morning before we got news that he was going to be okay. He  had been in a hunting accident.  Do you remember, was there diversity in Willard? Ethnic or  international diversity?  Yes. In the school of Home Economics, there were a lot of foreign  students. There was a lot of age difference, too. I know that some of the  men that came from Murray Hall were four or five years older than I  was. It was the same in Willard. There were a lot of different   we had a  lot of students from Ethiopia and Pakistan. I know when we had our  fair   I can   t remember what it was called. Home Economics sponsored  it each fall and there were like seventeen rooms and people from  12  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  different countries brought in their clothing and products and what we  could call souvenirs and set them up. It was very well attended by the  people from the city of Stillwater. It was just like a small United Nations  night. A lot of those students, the ladies lived in Willard. I always  thought they were very well accepted. I think the experience of having  worked with them, showing what their life had been like that, and how  they were brought up and the things that they had lived with probably  influenced a lot of how I would react when I meet someone that   s from a  foreign country.  I will say, most of them spoke, not really broken English, but English  that   probably very proper English compared to what we spoke or even  speak today because so many foreign countries take English for five, six,  seven years, where we do not have that length of time to study it here.  But there was a great diversity not only in ethnicity, but also in age.  There were a group of seniors that lived across from me when I was a  freshman and we felt kind of lowly at times. (Laughs) Sometimes we  were treated kind of lowly, but that   s okay. (Laughs) We had our chance  then the next year when the freshmen came in. There was kind of a     Pecking order?  Yeah, there was a pecking order. (Laughter) But some of those people,  you got to know them really well and you admired them so much  because they were older and their class work was almost finished and  they were going out in the world. It was a good experience for a  freshman to be that closely associated with them. And sometimes the  freshmen got even. (Laughter)  Does anything in particular come to mind?  Yeah, but it   s not for camera. (Laughter) Not for camera. Well, I will tell  one. My freshman roommate is a part of this group, Georgia Kerby. We  had two upper-classman two doors down from us. They would always  go down to the library and study and we got into their room one night. I  don   t know how, I can   t remember that. But we took a closet door off  and my roommate, who was supposed to be in her room because we  were freshmen   you didn   t go out into the hall, except to the bathroom  and you better have to really go, she was carrying the door over her head  down the hall and she met our proctor and the proctor just took one look  (laughter) never said a word. Just passed her by. Never said anything.  But anyway we hid the door out onto the roof through one of the girl   s  rooms  that led  onto the roof. We put it there and we all went back to  our rooms. I can still hear Kellyville   s  this was not her name but the  town she was from  scream and the words (laughter) when she opened  that door and that closet door was missing. (Laughter) Everybody knew  13  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  something dramatic could happen. There were a few things.  Did they get even?  No, I don   t think she ever got even. I don   t think she ever figured out  who did it. (Laughter) Maybe she would have gotten even if she had.  But anyway, there were a lot of girls that you   some that you knew you  could have fun with. You could hear Kellyville, but she was a neat lady.  But I   d like to know today what happened to her and where she is, she  and her roommate both because they were interesting people for  someone who just got to college. They were very sweet people when  you got to know them and someone that you could play a joke on and  survive. (Laughs)  When you were talking about the event, the diversity related event in the  different rooms, were there tables that they would have their things out  on? And then they were there and they were just interacting with people  that came in?  It was set up like a show and tell. And each of the students from their  own country was given a room and they could display their items and  then people just went from room to room and visited, asked them  questions.  So there wasn   t a formal kind of talk or presentation?  No.  It was one on one?  It was one on one. And it was something that the college really   I mean  not just the school of Home Economics, but the college itself. Because  we had had this great background of people coming from all of these  countries and it gave them a chance to share. I was always very  impressed with it and even more so because not just the students and the  college, but people who lived in Stillwater really backed it and came. As  I got older and understood how some of their programs worked   and  then also I met a lady, it   s probably been twenty-five years ago, who was  responsible for foreign students coming into Oklahoma City and meeting  them at the airport, finding them a place to live, matching them with  people and so I had a greater appreciation then of the people from  Stillwater accepting. Because Stillwater, Oklahoma was a fairly small  place for them to go. I have a friend that works at the airport now and he  is always excited when school is going to start in the fall because OSU  comes down and has this big banner that says,    Welcome to OSU     As  the foreign students are getting off the planes, many of them, I mean,  14  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  they   re lost. No bigger than Oklahoma City   s airport is, they   re lost. But  seeing the sign, and then there are greeters there that welcome them.  When I look back at what the people that lived in Stillwater did for this  program, they were accepting and that was a part of the learning process  for those people that came and then also for us who were other students  that came to the college.  That   s wonderful. I haven   t heard about that.  I participated. The first two years when I was in the dorm, I helped them  set up and host them. One of the students would just be in that room, and  welcome them and introduce and that kind of thing, so that was the most  formal part of it. Was just that we were there kind of as the go-between  and to visit with anyone that came in the room, that kind of thing.  Where was it held?  In the Home Economics building. Just one classroom right after another.  And so it was a free event that was open to the community?  Yes, and I wish I could think of what it was called.  Maybe it   s in one of the yearbooks.  Could be.  It   s wonderful to hear about that. Do you remember anything about the  Dean of Women?  Yes, Dean  Zelma  Patchin was one of those people that would come on  Sunday and she ate at the cafeteria. She sat at different tables. Never saw  her sitting just with somebody she knew. She would sit at different  tables and visit with the students and that   s how she got to know the  different people that lived in Willard.  Was there a dress code any place on campus?  I don   t remember. I know we wore a lot of skirts and sweaters. Slacks, I  don   t know. Jeans were maybe for picnics and stuff like that, but I don   t  necessarily know of a dress code. A little more dressed up than today.  Did you ever hear about the    Panty Raid    on campus?  (Laughs) Oh, I was in  the  dormitory  during  the Panty Raid, yes.  15  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Tell me what you remember about that.  (Laughs) One of my best friend   s brother said he made it to the second  floor of Willard Hall. I remember him telling that in front of her and she  was shaking her head like,    Oh, no.    I know it happened and I cannot  remember that I was in the dormitory that night. I may have been out at  the library because I don   t recall being in the dormitory. But I do  remember this young man telling me.    You   ve got to be kidding.     So the boys would just descend into the building.  Yes. I don   t know how they got in. Somebody had to almost have left  the door open because the entry was to the front door and to the desk and  buzzing in. So, I   m not sure how they got in. (Laughter) I know that  young man yet today. I may go home and ask him and tell him I was  asked that question in an interview. He   s an Oklahoma City attorney, so  (laughter) that   ll be an interesting question. I may have to call him next  week and see.  Tell him we   d like to hear his story, too, for our interviews.  Okay. Oh, that would be funny. I could almost see him going,    Oh,  you   ve got to be kidding.    Oh, funny.  What do you remember about the library?  Well, I spent a lot of time at the library. I took several library science  courses.  Can you tell me about those? I haven   t heard about those.  You haven   t heard about those? The first one, I think I took one  freshman and sophomore year. I got to be pretty good at looking up  things and knew where to look because I had the course. My husband  was an engineering student and he was so up to his ears in math courses  and labs and when he needed help to go to the library once, or he needed  some information, he said,    I don   t know where to go.    I took him up  and showed him different places to look and he said to me,    Where did  you learn this?    and I said,    Library Science 101.    I don   t remember if it  was 202, but whatever. I don   t know whether people thought courses  like that were zero courses or they were not necessary, but I know that  with the papers that we had to write our junior and senior years, home  economics and for class work, we were always looking up something,  and psych classes. I mean I would have been lost without those courses.  They really did a good job.  16  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  We learned about the Dewey Decimal System and how to apply it and  how to get into a specified area and find what you were looking for in  there. Different ways to locate something in particular and I was very  glad that I had it. What I think is interesting is when my girls were in  school and wanted to look up something up at the library, of course, now  they go to the computer and have it do it for them. Wikipedia would be  their resource, but I could go to the library and I could take them and  help them look up something and not have to have the librarian  help .  We lived in Bethany for thirty-three years, so I knew the Bethany  librarian and how to go in and look for stuff without having to have  them look it up for me. I thought they were very useful courses. I think  all students should have to take a library course. (Laughter) That was not  in engineering.  So that must have been an elective for you, then.  Yes, I think in Vocational Home Economics, we had two electives. My  husband in engineering, he had to have twenty-four more hours than I  did to graduate and he probably didn   t have five electives in a four year  course.  Where in the library? Was there a classroom where they taught these  courses? Do you remember that?  I don   t remember. I don   t remember being that we were actually in the  library for the courses, but I don   t remember.  So was the reason you took the second one because you really liked the  first one?  It was very beneficial. It was very beneficial. Then, your freshman and  sophomore year, you   re not writing a lot of papers but I knew that when  I got into our junior year there would be a lot of classes that we   d have  to write papers and need to know the resources. The School of Home  Economics did not have their own private library. I don   t remember if  any of the other schools did or not. I came, having lived on the farm. I  went to Dover High School. We had an excellent library for a small  school and Kingfisher, which was ten miles away, had a good public  library. I had utilized both of those, so just knowing that we were going  to be able to go in and find things that we didn   t have access to before.  Did you have a favorite study spot in the library?  Usually, whenever it was very quiet away from everybody else because I  was not a genius student and I needed quiet. Some people could have  other people next  to them  or at the same table with you, but I liked to  17  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  just be by myself. Somewhere there was just nobody else so I could  really study.  Have you been back in the library?  I have not been. I haven   t for a long time.  Oh, well you need to come.  There are a lot of the buildings that I haven   t been in. I was here, oh it  was probably    89. It   s been a long time since I   ve been in the library.  It   s changed since then. You   ll be surprised.  It was always been such a beautiful place though. It was always so  immaculate.  There   s some renovation going on right now up on the first floor. But  yeah, hopefully you   ll have the opportunity to come by sometime. Let   s  talk about other traditions that Willard might have had that stand out in  your memory. Holiday traditions, Homecoming traditions.  Well, for Homecoming, we always had a house decoration or a float and  I participated in that that one year. I think one of the traditions that I  remember best was the Monday night dance hour. One of the girls in our  group, she was proctor and she was responsible for that. A couple of  times, she needed to be gone and I filled in for her. If you were the  person in charge, you weren   t allowed to dance and, of course, the boys  would come from everywhere to dance with the girls.  Years later, I was in Kansas City, Kansas at a square dance convention  and I met a square dance caller and he told me that his wife had  graduated from OSU. He had gone to school here for two years and it  was when I was a freshman and a sophomore and he said,    Where did  you live?    and I said,    Willard Hall.    And he looked at me kind of funny  and he said,    I probably danced with you     (Laughter) I said,    You   ve  got to be kidding.    I said,    Well, maybe.    I didn   t remember dancing  with him, so I told him,    Maybe that was one of the nights that I was in  charge and couldn   t dance with somebody.    We never figured that out,  but anyway, that was a big tradition. All the dormitories had them and  it  was  a good place for the guys and the gals to get together and meet each  other. If they were dancers, it was a wonderful place.  Was there live music for those dances?  No, I think we had records.  18  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Did many of the girls have record players in their rooms?  Oh, I don   t remember that we did.  What about radios?  Yeah, there were radios, but I don   t remember any record players.  Was there a television?  (Laughter) No, I don   t think we had television   we didn   t have  televisions down in the waiting area.  How about in the Student Union?  I don   t remember that because I was in the Student Union between  classes to study, so I wouldn   t have been looking for a television.  Television was just   I don   t know.  It was still pretty new.  Pretty new.  My family at home  had our first TV in 1949 and    55 was  not long after that. So still a new thing.  Did you meet your husband at OSU?  No, I met my husband when I was a freshman in high school. He went  off to the service when I was a sophomore and then he came out of the  service in June. When I graduated high school in 1955 I was working as  a waitress in a restaurant in Kingfisher and he came in and we had  corresponded some. Then my last two years or my last year of high  school, the young man I had been going with, I decided that I wanted to  have more fun as a senior. We had a small class and there were things  that we needed to do as classmates and so anyway I hadn   t been dating  anyone. He came in and said he had gotten out of the service and was a  couple of months early and he was going to OSU to school and I said,     I   m already enrolled.    So we were here together our freshman and  sophomore year and married between our sophomore and junior year  and both finished together in 1959.  Did you go back and visit Willard after you were married?  Yes. I   ve been there a couple of times. When it was renovated, one of  the young ladies that had been a part of the reunion group had died and  we asked if we could put up a plaque and put up a memorial to her.  When it came Homecoming that year, we were allowed to go in as a  19  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  group and to present our plaque and to see where it was going to be. In  more recent years when my husband had a young man that worked  under him that was going to be married here he invited us to a wedding  and the reception was in Willard Hall, which was kind of interesting  because it was really different. It really had changed and he invited his  boss, who didn   t expect him to attend. We showed up and I told him  then,    Can they sneak me upstairs to see where my room was?    He got  someone to go behind the scenes and take me up to where the rooms  were. Of course the one over the door and then they come down at the  other end of the hall that I had stayed in. He thought that was really neat  that I got to go and see those.  That   s great. Do you remember any controversy when the named  changed from Oklahoma A M to Oklahoma State University?  I think the controversy, if there were any, was because we were going to  have to learn all these new songs. All these words. I tried to think of if I  could sing the ones that we had before. You   re not too sure if you can  remember those.  Can you still sing them?  No, no. (Laughter) OAMC, OAMC, OAMC   I can remember that part.  I think we   re all alarmed at change. I think it was like,    Oh, my gosh,  tradition is down the tubes.    But that was not true. I can remember us  learning, talking about,    Oh my goodness, we   re going to have to learn  all these songs.     This group of women has really stayed close through the years. Have  you been to the reunions?  Yes, I only missed one when my husband was ill and I couldn   t handle it  so I did not participate. But together, we went to all of them    til he was  gone and then I continued. They have been great support. One of the  gentlemen is a minister and later we had a lady who was a minister.  They were always there for you. The group has stayed together, I think,  because we all came from small communities where there was  togetherness   cohesiveness. You just had to go out and work and do  things, be together as a family, so I think that part of our lives has  really   and believe me, there   s great diversity in this group. We have  one of about everything. A lot of the ladies have taught for many years.  All of their husbands  come and participate . But when I tell people that  we   re still getting together after fifty years, they can   t hardly believe it.  And it   s an interesting group. It   s an interesting group.  Do y   all keep in touch via e-mail?  20  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Neurohr  Skarky  Everybody but me and I   m the only one that doesn   t have e-mail. I think  that was a direct question. They   ll be surprised to know it   s coming.  (Laughter) I thought this weekend I should have looked to see how  many stamps I owed of people getting together for this group so I could  have brought them a stamp for the things they   ve been through. They   ve  been good about it. I have just finished sixteen classes. Learning to use  my new computer, so.  Well congratulations.  Hopefully e-mail will be the next step.  You   ll probably love it.  Oh, I think I will.  Do you have any further stories about your time at Willard or OSU?  I think my time at OSU has to be with my husband and this group. He  was a top notch engineering student. I had a wonderful life provided   a  wonderful life for me, for our family. I never worked outside the home. I  was a stay at home mom. And that mainly was because I remember once  we thought we were going to have to move and leave Oklahoma City  and my husband said,    I would rather eat beans and peddle somebody   s  gas.    And I said,    I could get a job. I could go and teach.    Which I had  never done and he said,    No, I don   t want you to do that.    I think that  this group and being a part of this group is very special   very, very  special. The friendships, I mean we love each other, we support each  other, we care for each other. Then the fact that I was very blessed to be  able to spend two years here as a married student and had a good  marriage for forty-eight years, so that   s very special.  And then you have a grandson here.  I have a grandson here. Loren and I have five grandchildren and four of  them will probably be OSU grads. Our oldest daughter is an OU grad.  She married an OU grad and they have one of those red kids. (Laughter)  But the funny part is that he has indicated that he might be interested in  veterinary medicine and I told him,    You   ll never guess where the  College of Veterinary Medicine is in the state of Oklahoma.    But  anyway, no, all of the grandkids love OSU except for Gram  Shoemake .  He   s hopeless. No, when Carol said she was going to go to OU to  school, it took my husband about six months before he was going to pay  her bills because he just was   but she went with friends and she did  well. She   s had a good life and that   s the most important. They all have.  They   re good kids and they   ve raised good kids. Zac  Kannady  is a  21  Neurohr  Skarky  junior in the School of Engineering and his sister and the other  granddaughter are juniors in high school. So they   re going to be here  very quickly.  Well thank you for the interview. I appreciate it very much. It   s been  wonderful.  Thank you. Glad we could share.  -------  -------
