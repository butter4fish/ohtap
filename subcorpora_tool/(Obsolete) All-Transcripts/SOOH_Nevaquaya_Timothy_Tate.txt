 Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is November 17, 2013, and  I   m at Riverwalk, Jenks, in the Nevaquaya Fine Arts Gallery which  Timothy and his wife, Alicia, just opened. Timothy, you   re Comanche  and Choctaw and Chickasaw. Your father, Doc Tate Nevaquaya, was a  celebrated painter and flute player, and you are continuing the art  tradition in your family but in your own individual style and way. Thank  you for taking the time to speak with me.  Yes.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, at the Indian hospital in 1966.  And grew up around     I grew up in Apache, Oklahoma, so that   s where I   ve been for  approximately forty-seven years.  Your dad began painting and earning his living that way about the mid-    50s, but what about your mom? Can you tell us a bit about her?  Mom and Dad met at Haskell  Indian Nations University  That   s where  they started their relationship, and then he brought her to Apache. He  worked a regular job, and he painted on the side. Mom knew that there  was something really special taking place. He showed a special talent.  He really knew a lot about the history of the Comanche people, and he  started to paint about it. Mom was really supportive of what he was  doing.  How many siblings do you have?  5  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  I come from a family of nine, which I have four brothers and four  sisters.  What was your exposure to your grandparents on either side of the  family?  Well, the only grandparent that I knew was my mother   s mom. Her  name was Amanda  Cooper  Foraker, and she was a full-blooded  Choctaw. That was the only grandparent that I got to know. My dad   s  mom and dad had passed away in the   40s. That was Victoria  Nevaquaya and Lean Nevaquaya.  Do you have some memories of your maternal grandmother, then?  Yes, yes, I do. She had stayed with us quite a bit throughout our lifetime.  She was always, she was the head cook whenever she   d come around,  and we used to think that the food that she was cooking was Comanche  food. Me and my cousin was talking, and all that time it was what a lot  of the Choctaws traditionally ate. We thought it was coming from the  Comanche people.  Banaha, isn   t it? (Laughter). How much were you around the Comanche  language growing up?  I was around it all my life when I was growing up. Dad used to have a  lot of the Comanche artists come over to the house, and they would sit  around and talk. There were people like a gentleman by the name of  Leonard Riddles. We called him Black Moon Riddles. He would come  on over. Then there was a gentleman by the name of Bill Poafpybitty.  Sometimes Rance Hood would be there, Robby McMurtry, and  Weckeah Bradley. Anyway, when they got together the majority of  them, they spoke fluent Comanche, so it was in the home quite a bit.  Were you involved with Native American church growing up?  No, not really. I know that my grandfather was a Peyoteist, and then  later on   my dad knew quite a bit about it. He, early in his life, was  involved with the Native American church. Then later on he really  devoted himself to his artwork and painted about it a lot, but he didn   t  attend them regularly like he did when he was younger.  How about just regular Indian church, Baptist church, through your  mom? Did that impact your artwork at all?  Yes, it did. A lot of the belief when I was growing up was about the  Lord. My mother, she was a devoted Christian. During my lifetime I   ve  6  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  become a Christian, and it really did have a big impact on the production  of my art. It really led me into probably the most positive direction I   ve  ever went in my life. My dad also was a layman speaker, so we   ve been  around this all of our life, and it did have a great impact on what I was  doing. It helped me to see things in a very positive light, especially about  the culture that I come from. A lot of people say that Christianity really  pushed our culture aside, but if you really studied that right, it was more  positive than negative. It was just there were a lot of people that really  misrepresented Christianity, but once you come to know the Lord and  his ways, it   s very much different.  Was your dad   s artwork the first Native artwork that you saw, that you  were conscious of as being Indian artwork?  Yes, yes. Actually, when I was young I used to observe Dad quite a bit  growing up, where Mom and Dad   s bedroom, he had his table, and he  painted every day when he got off work. That was a daily thing was to  watch Dad paint. Then on some of the scrap paper, he would give it to  me, and I would start drawing. We had been exposed to it all of our life.  Right alongside, sitting on the floor or something?  Yes, yes.  What is your earliest memory of making art on your own?  I   d say a long time ago, me and my sister Joyce, we used to draw in the  dirt a lot. We   d make big drawings. To me, I didn   t realize we were  making art. We were just drawing because we loved it, and the tools that  we had, we just used our fingers. We   d always try to out-do each other.  That was probably the first time that I really produced anything. It was  always horses and Indians because we saw Dad drawing, and it had an  effect on us. We thought that was the way to go.  Did your folks come look at the drawings?  No, no, they never did. It was natural. We never asked them to come and  look. After we got through, well, then we started approving it, then erase  the ground again, and we   d start over. That was part of our growing up. I  guess that   s where you could say my art career really started. (Laughter)  That   s great. Did you have any other family members who were artists?  Yes, the oldest one, Sonny, he actually is a flute player and a flute  maker. Then my brother Edmond, he   s a artist, and he really paints in  the style of Dad, which is what we call Oklahoma traditional Indian art.  7  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Also, he is a composer of music. He   s an expert in Peyote religion and  also sings a Northern style of music, as well as Southern-style music.  He   s been doing this for quite some time. Then my younger brother  Calvert is also an artist. He   s also a composer of flute music ,and he  makes them. My brother Joseph, he   s a flute player, although he doesn   t  make them, but he likes to compose music.  Did you go to many art shows with your dad when you were young?  What was that like?  Yeah, the first art exhibit I attended with Dad, I was probably about five  years old, which was in Lawton, Oklahoma, at a place called Cache  Road Square. That was my first exposure to what an art show was all  about. Then later on, he started to get more advanced in his career and  started to exhibit at the Galleria in Norman with Reba Olson. So I   ve  been around these events all my life, got acquainted with a lot of the  older artists. A lot of them are not among us anymore, people like Fred  Beaver, Willard Stone, Solomon McCombs, and Blackbear Bosin. When  I was growing up, I was really immersed in the Oklahoma traditional  style of art, and to me I believe that was the only art that really made  sense to me.  When I started to grow up, I started to emulate what my dad was doing. I  started to listen to a lot of the stories that he told about the Comanche  people and the history, and I started to paint like that, or draw, really.  Then later on, I started to paint. Then when I started to get more  advanced in what I was doing, I began to realize that there was  something more that I needed out of this, and I began to deviate from  what I   d learned through Dad. Dad   s style was a very disciplined style.  It was very historical, especially for the Comanche people. He was really  instrumental in bridging gaps and helping the other races understand  who we are, and what we came from, and the beauty of the culture.  That   s one thing that you can learn through a lot of Dad   s paintings.  How early did you start thinking of yourself as an artist?  Well, that thought, I don   t know if it really ever occurred to me. I think  that from the beginning I was already drawing, and I never saw myself  as an artist. It was just a way of life. I believe that to say,    Well, I want  to become an artist,    that never happened. I think that this was my  destination. It   s the only thing that feels right to me, you know. Working  a job, a regular job, for me would probably destroy me in my spirit  because art means a lot to me. That   s all I knew when I grew up, and  that   s who I wanted to be. I knew that that   s what I was at that time.  That   s who I am. There was no doubt, so that question really never  existed. I mean, people have asked me, but it was something that I was  8  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  born to be, I believe.  What were your experiences with art in primary school?  I think a lot of it was probably being exposed to the French  Impressionists.  In elementary school, you saw some of that work?  Yes, and I began to realize besides Native American art, there was a  whole different world out there, and I wanted to explore it. The thing  was, was that I knew that the disciplines that my dad taught were really  instrumental in helping me develop, especially in human anatomy and  the anatomy of animals. I began to study a lot about what the French  Impressionists knew it was all about, and it was really interesting  because they had a different approach. I believe that that was  instrumental in helping me develop this style that I   ve been working in  as of late, but I always tell people that the work that I do is deeply rooted  in traditional Native American art.  How about middle school and high school? Were you getting some other  art instruction at all?  No. At Apache grade school and Apache High School we had arts and  crafts which was really, it was nice, but it was not enough. It was not  advanced enough. I   ve always believed that   I was deeply involved in  drawing all the time, and I really wasn   t a great student academically. I  was more involved in producing and drawing because it meant more to  me than what I was learning at the time. To me, the art classes were  really not   they were more based in craft than art.  When did you sell your first piece of art?  I believe the first initial sales that I made were really the flutes. This  took place probably back in 1981. That   s when Dad taught me how to  make flutes by hand. Anyway, me and my brother worked on a few  commission pieces. Dad, he guided us through the process and showed  us how to tune them in, and make them play, and make them look nice.  Once that project was completed, then there were some people at the art  show that liked what they saw, and I made my first sale. That was a  pretty big deal. I think I was in the ninth grade at that time, and that  really inspired me, knowing that somebody thought enough of your  work that they would purchase it. The price was fairly good for that day  and time, so after that, that   s when my flute-making career really kicked  off, right there.  9  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Then in 1987 was probably the first time that I sold my first painting to a  gentleman by the name of Bob Clayborn. Anyway, he was good friends  with my dad, and he collected a lot of my dad   s paintings. Dad told him  that I was starting to paint, so he said    Well, I   d like to see some of his  work.    I took the paintings over, and he liked what he had saw, so he  purchased three paintings that day. After that, that really was  instrumental in helping me to be more serious about what I was doing. I  began to realize that people saw value in what was being done.  Now, when you were making Native flutes, were you playing, too     Yes.     or not as much maybe as your brothers, or just about the same?  Well, I was really starting to compose music when I was around eleven  years old. We   d heard flute music growing up. At that time, I didn   t  know that it was a lost and dying art, but I was exposed to it, and I began  to make a lot of noise with it in the beginning. I think one day I was  actually getting on Dad   s nerves because he was painting and I was  playing the flute. He went ahead and stopped and took his glasses off.  He goes,    Timothy, come here. I   m going to show you. This is how  you   re going to play the flute.    It was a really simple way that he  showed me. I closed up all the note holes. He said,    Don   t let any air  escape. It   s going to make a sour note.     He climbed up the scale and climbed back down, and he said,    Right  there is all you need to know. Practice it. Later on, you   ll start to hear  music,    and he was right. Almost immediately I began to experience  sounds that started to actually make sense, and I began to make music. I  began to emulate a lot of the powwow songs, sometimes even trying  Peyote songs. Later on, I heard Dad. He composed some flute music that  were Comanche hymns, so after that, me and my brothers, we all started  doing that. That   s how I developed. Then I began to compose my own  personal music.  Going back to right after high school, what did you do afterwards? Were  you just starting to make flutes, were you thinking about college, or     During that time, I was making flutes regularly, and I was drawing.  When high school come to an end, I got into the military for a little  while. I wanted to experience that.  What branch?  The Army. When I got out, I came home, and I started working on flutes  10  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  again and drawing. Then a friend of mine come over to the house one  morning and said,    I got you a job. You can   t make any money doing  what you   re doing.    I thought,    Well, what am I going to be doing?     (Laughs) He introduced me to the world of concrete at that time, so I  started working a regular job.  There in Apache?  Yes, well, it was actually in Lawton, Oklahoma. I started traveling back  and forth every day. That   s what helped, supported a bit of my career. I  started to collect a lot of art supplies and tools to build my flutes. While  I was working, I was really painting and making flutes at the same time,  which is really kind of tough, but art was always in my heart, and I  always made time to produce it. That was when my career really started.  What was the first booth show that you did by yourself?  The first one-man show     Or booth show of any kind.  Probably   goodness, let me think here. Probably going back to 1993 at  Red Earth. Yeah, that was the first time that I had gotten a booth and set  up and exposed my artwork, around that time.  You told me a story, I think, about Doris Littrell at that show. (Laughs)  Can you tell us that story?  Well, one day during that show Doris Littrell come up to my booth. She  looked at what I was doing, a crowd of people around. She said,    This is  going to be the next Doc Tate Nevaquaya     I mean, she really put me on  the spot at that time. I was really surprised to hear something like that,  but it gave me a lot of confidence. I believe that she had probably seen  something that I was unaware of in my work. Later on, I began to do  business, and she started to exhibit my work in her gallery, which is a  really big deal. I really thank Dad for that because he was the one who  really led the way. Dad said,    Even though you have this last name, you  still have to pay your dues.    He was right because being in the art world  really wasn   t easy. Dad knew it.  When I was developing in my career, Dad would come and critique my  work. He was really tough on me. I mean, he really raked me over the  coals because he knew that to make a living in Native American art  could have some challenges. He was preparing me, although at that time  I thought that he was just picking on me, but he was telling me the truth.  He would point out the mistakes that I was making. He helped me  11  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  sharpen my skills. I believe that   s really what helped me to develop into  the style that I   m working in now. It was a lot of his disciplinary  teachings that was instrumental in helping me develop.  How soon did you move from that flat style into the style that you   ve  been developing?  Well, that probably took a period of about, approximately twenty-four  years. That change came when I was really frustrated because I was  experimenting with the realistic art. I was really getting involved in oil  paint. To me, the work that I was doing looked like what everybody else  was doing. I began to question myself a lot about what was so different  about what I was doing. I messed up on a painting. I was really  frustrated at that time, and I didn   t know which direction to go.  I began to look at the mistake. It was a splotch of paint, and there was  something there that was very interesting. I had seen this before, but my  logical way of thinking was telling me that this isn   t right. I would  always either put the painting away or I would try to correct it, but this  day was different. It was probably about three o   clock in the morning  when this took place, and I began to explore and really just mess the  painting up. It seemed like the more chances that I began to take, the  more the painting actually improved. I began to realize that something  marvelous was taking place. It was almost like speaking and learning a  whole different language in a matter of minutes.  I began to realize that something special had happened. That   s when I  began to develop in this style. All the drawings I had done in the past  that were really failed attempts at what I was wanting, I began to repaint  them. All of a sudden, this new approach brought it alive. It brought life  into what I was doing. I think during that time I lost a lot of sleep  because of that. It was almost as though every time I closed my eyes,  this wonderful vision and this new language would start to erupt. I   d  have to get up in the middle of the night, and I   d start painting again.  Sometimes I would paint for seventeen hours nonstop. It was probably  one of the most triumphant moments that I   ve ever experienced in the art  of painting.  I began to realize that this style developed, and it seemed to be very  unique. I believe the wonderful part about it was nobody was painting  like this, and I began to realize I found my style. It was at a time when I  was doing some soul searching. I didn   t realize that this could   ve taken  place a long time ago, but what stifled a lot of growth was my own  logical way of thinking. When I began to explore outside the box, that   s  when I found my style.  12  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  What was an early gallery that you worked with once you found this  newer style, looser style?  Well, at that time, I know that when I was exhibiting with Doris, she had  really got up in age and got out of the business, so I moved over to  Tribes  131  Gallery, with Hannah Pate. I was exhibiting there. Then  later on when I started working a regular job again, well, I wasn   t able to  produce because this job was really   we were working seven days a  week, and I was barely producing at that time. Later on, I just went  ahead and left the gallery. One day I decided to leave this job and  continue in my artwork full-time. Anyway, when this new style  developed, I had a friend down in Santa Fe. He goes,    I know a gallery  that might accept your work.     I gave him five paintings, and he took them to the Michael McCormick  Gallery, and he talked about what I was doing. When he showed them  the work, Michael just immediately took to it, and he began to realize,     I   ve never seen anything like this.    He asked my friend, he said,    Is he  prolific?    (Laughter) He didn   t know how much I produced, but he just  said,    Yeah, he   s prolific.    He said,    Tell him to come out to Taos  because I want to meet him, and I like his work.    He immediately began  to hang my paintings in his gallery, so that was the first gallery that  picked up this style of work. I   ve been there since 2007, clear up to the  present time now, which is 2013.  Neat. The business side of art is sometimes the hardest part to master.  How did you figure out how to price your work, and even transitioning  from one style to another?  Well, pricing them out is very difficult. My approach initially was I  knew that I was new to the art scene, even though I   d been to art shows  with Dad, but approaching it by myself was different. I started out  selling my paintings at a very low price. As sales took place, I began to  realize in time I could raise them. People actually valued the earlier  works. There were some good sales at that time. This was back in the  mid-  90s. Then later on, probably around 2006 when I started to  experiment with this new style, I began to realize that people were more  attracted to it. It was done in oil.  All of my works now are my oil paintings. The medium   s a lot more  expensive and takes a lot more time, so I began to gradually rise the  prices, which is kind of tough. Whenever I started dealing with the  McCormick Gallery, they get their commission, and you have to make  sure that you   re going to get what you worked for. He was helping me  price them. We experimented early to see what people   s reaction would  be, and there were people that really liked the paintings, and the sales  13  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  were really good. That   s pretty much how we managed to price my  paintings. It was really a trial and error.  Were there some other business challenges that you encountered?  No, there really wasn   t. It was just getting my work exposed, which the  McCormick Gallery done a really good job. They were always having  events at the gallery. They would always put my name in a lot of the  advertisements, so the sales were always taking place. There was no real  challenge there. But earlier in my career, there was challenges a lot. I  didn   t really quite know how to market my work. That   s why I   d always  had a job to support myself. It was always nice whenever I was working  and I   d make my regular paycheck, and then I would sell about two  paintings. That really helped out a lot.  That was really good, but there was coming a day and time when I  realized that I needed to do this full-time because I really felt like I  really wanted to develop in a better way, and working a regular job was  slowing down my growth. One day when I did quit, it was a pretty big  decision, but at that time, though, I was really confident in what I was  doing. There were times whenever I did run into some tough times. I  thought about,    Maybe I   ll go back to work,    and then it seemed to me  that something wonderful would always take place. I would realize that I  was in the right place at the right time, and this is what I was supposed  to be doing. It was like I   d found my place in the universe, and it was to  be an artist. That   s what I knew I was here for.  I don   t know if your dad got to see a lot of your new style as it was just  getting refined.  No, Dad had passed away in 1996. That was probably about ten years  later when I found this new style, but I believe that Dad had saw  something in my work and the way I was developing. He was the one  who advised me to get involved in oil paint. He said, he told me,     Timothy, I see what you   re trying to do. If you use oils, I think you can  achieve it.    So he saw something that I was really unaware of, and I  believe it was from his years of experience. He knew that I was trying to  explore, especially in color because the colors that Dad used are a lot of  earth tones and a lot of primary and secondary. Anything outside that, he  really never experimented. It seemed to me that was the direction that I  was headed toward, so that was Dad   s advice to me, was using oil paints  and exploring color. I think in a way he probably saw from a distance  what was getting ready to take place. There are times when I wish that  Mom and Dad were here to see what   s going on now, but I know that  they   re with me in spirit.  14  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  I know when your dad did pass away, it was such a shock for the Native  art world. I can   t imagine what you guys went through. Were you able to  use your art to sort of work through some of that?  I believe that at the time of Dad   s death, that actually made me stronger  in what I believed in. It made me stronger in the arts, and it helped me.  That was what Dad loved, and it was something that I loved, and when  Dad wasn   t there, I thought,    Well, this is just a way of carrying on.    I  was going to do it anyway, but it was just like that made me even  stronger. I think that some people, it weakens them, but it had a different  effect on me. It was a way of honoring Dad and honoring his memory,  was to develop in what I was doing and share this with the world.  I believe that   s a lot of what Dad had done. He shared his knowledge  with the world through his art, showing people that this was the way of  not just the Comanche people, but he painted about different other  tribes and showed the beauty in them. For me, this is my way of  honoring Dad and exposing the world to another place. My thing is to  create a sanctuary for others, and I believe Dad did the same thing. After  his death, it did strengthen me.  In 2002, you won First Place in painting at the American Indian Artists  Exposition in Anadarko. How did it feel to get that award kind of on  your home turf? (Laughter)  Well, a friend of mine had advised me to   he said,    Have you ever been  in an art competition?    I said,    No, I   ve never been in one.    At that time,  I believed in what I was doing, but putting it in a competition was just a  whole different world. He goes    Why don   t you just test this painting  out and see what happens?    He goes    Just take a chance.    I said,    All  right.    So I went ahead and went down and registered two paintings and  two drawings. Anyway, I saw the other pieces that were being set up,  and I thought,    Oh, God, these guys, they already won.    That   s what I  thought. (Laughter)  Anyway, we come back after the judging had taken place. I   d saw the  ribbons on some of the paintings that I knew were going to win, and I  thought,    Okay.    I saw people gathered around one painting. I looked,  and it was mine. It had a purple ribbon on it. I   d won Best of Show. It  was a big relief, you know. I don   t know why I felt under pressure. I  guess I thought just the fear of being rejected in a contest, but it ended  up winning. Then the two charcoal drawings that I had won Second and  Third place, so it was a pretty triumphant moment right there.  Thought you might enter a few more competitive shows after that.  (Laughter) In 2012, you did a two-man show with your brother Calvert  15  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  at Southern Plains Indian Museum called Breaking Tradition. Can you  tell us how that one came about?  Well, me and my brother Calvert, we both started working together, and  we were sharing a studio. We both started out in the Oklahoma  traditional style of art, based upon Dad   s career, what he was doing, but  we both started breaking away. We were experimenting, so both of our  careers were really in the traditional arts. Now if you look at them today,  you might see a slight resemblance of traditionalism, but it   s totally  changed, so I thought,    Why don   t we title this show called Breaking  Traditions because we broke away from that?     I remember at one time back in the   60s and   70s, there was a lot of  controversy on Indian art. I think T. C. Cannon and Fritz Scholder were  the ones who really started breaking the traditions. This is just our way  of breaking away from what we   d learned through Dad. But I believe  that Dad had given us some good basic fundamentals, and that   s what  helped carry us over into this new style of artwork.  Anyway, I thought that was an appropriate title for the show, and it was  most successful. The artwork was totally different from what a lot of  people expected to see. They were expecting to see the flat, two-dimensional  style, but then when they come into the room and they saw  these paintings, they began to realize,    Hey, these boys did break away.     (Laughter)  That   s a big show to do. How many pieces did you     I think we had approximately twenty-eight pieces. We really worked  hard for that show. I think we painted for approximately six months.  Then we had a friend come over, and he hung the show for us and did a  really a nice job. Yeah, we really knuckled down for that one.  Have commissions been a big part of your work?  Yes, as of lately. I   ve got a commission from the Comanche Nation  funeral home to do a mural, which is pending right now. They want a  scene of a thunderstorm with buffalo in the foreground. The painting  will probably be, I think, four foot by twelve foot. Then one of the first  commissions that I did receive was from the NAGPRA  Native  American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act  program from the  Comanche Tribe. They wanted that painting to be done with images of  the history of the Comanche people, so that was a pretty tough project.  Was it a mural, also?  16  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  No, actually it was just, it was a regular small painting. It was probably,  I think, twenty by twenty-four, and it was done in watercolor. It was just  to symbolize the Comanche way of life and how they buried the people.  I did nine paintings, and they selected one, which is probably the most  simplified one because there were some that were really complicated. It  was a pretty tough project. Now that painting   s exposed in Washington  DC and at the NAGPRA office in Lawton, Oklahoma.  Will this be your first mural, for the funeral home? Have you done a  mural before?  No, this will be my first mural project, so I look forward to the challenge  of it. I think it   s going to be done in oil.  Wow, great. You and Alicia just officially opened your gallery this week  and also got married this week. (Laughs)  Yes, we certainly did.  How did you become interested in opening a gallery together?  Well, one day we went to dinner at the restaurant, at Los Cabos, and we  decided to take a walk. We saw some of the buildings that were empty,  and she said,    Tim, how would you like to have a gallery here at the  Riverwalk?    I thought that was a really nice idea. I said,    Yeah,    so we  started to walk around and look inside the buildings and began to  exchange thoughts. She said,    Well, we can make this happen.    She  goes,    Do you want this?    I said,    Yes, I do. Let   s see what happens.     We went ahead and wrote up a proposal, and we presented it to the  Creeks here, the Muscogee Creeks, and they seemed to like the idea.  They drew up a contract, and we signed it. They gave us the space that  we asked for, so that   s how that all started. It was really a bit of   we  were daydreaming and actually made it become a reality. (Laughter)  That   s wonderful. I know you   re going to carry, as I understand it, not  just your work but work by other artists, too.  Yes, I believe that   s really something that I   when we were dreaming, I  thought,    I remember when I first started getting into galleries. It   s  pretty tough, but,    I thought,    this is my way of helping others and  exposing them.    I thought we could promote some up-and-coming  artists. If nobody   s going to give them a chance, we   ll give them a shot  here, and hopefully we can help them live out their dreams, what they  wanted. There was a lot of people who helped me, so this is my way of  helping others in this community and all the up-and-coming artists who  may give some beautiful gifts to the world. I   d love to help them.  17  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Let   s talk about your practices and techniques a little bit more. The style  that you   ve been referring to, which I think is particularly effective at  capturing action, it kind of reminds me of those like high-speed  photographs     Oh, yes.     where there   s those little trailers of light and stuff, streaks of light.  Were you consciously thinking of that, or     No. I   ve always been asked,    There   s a lot of motion in your painting.     In the beginning, I didn   t have the technical capabilities of producing  motion. That really is just a by-product of what I was exploring.  That loosening up   .  Yes. I believe, to me, the kaleidoscope of color and the works that I   d  been doing really give the illusion of motion, so I began to realize this  was the way. If I wanted to put motion, I would use a palette knife and  use different colors and blend them in a really neat way. I began to think  it was really based upon the palette knife, how you would smooth the  paint out, and how the kaleidoscope of color would come together, and it  would give this neat illusion. I began to really explore that, but that   s  how the motion was put in.  So are you using brushwork at all, too, or is it mainly palette knife?  Well, initially, all of my paintings start out with brushwork, using  paintbrushes. Then once you reach a certain point, then I   ll start to  explore with the palette knife. That   s when the real fun starts because in  the beginning you start out with this idea, but once you get this idea to a  certain point that   s really recognizable, then that   s when this neat  dynamics start to come in. Color dynamics is what I always call them,  and that   s when you begin to explore. The beautiful thing about it is that  there   s such an influence there that anything   s possible. Anything. This  can go in any direction you want. I never thought that I would reach a  level in thinking like this, especially in the arts. That was one thing  about the traditional art was it would limit you, but this style seems to go  in any direction you want.  I think that what helped me get there was based upon the basic  fundamentals of what Dad had taught me early. Then it was just a matter  of time before I went into this mysterious world which I love very much.  When that style developed, it really changed the way I think, it changed  the way I approach art, and even a strange philosophy began to develop.  18  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Something new, it seemed to me. At night I   d get up, and I would write  things down about what I was feeling, and it was all based upon  painting.  The beautiful thing about it is when people do see what this produced, it  has a profound effect on a lot of them, things that I thought were not  possible in my work. Some people, it provides a nice sanctuary that they  can escape through what   s been done. I never thought that I would ever  reach a point like that. To me, at one time it was almost impossible. I  was trying to produce something that I thought was meaningful, but  technically I was struggling. But it seems to me now, this has been  probably the greatest breakthrough that I   ve ever experienced in my life.  It was through this new style that   s developing, and I don   t think that  this style will ever stop developing. I believe that it   ll go on as long as  I   m still here on this earth.  Does sketching play any kind of role in your work?  Yes, yes, the majority of the works that I do are sketched out. At one  time I used to go into a full, complicated sketch process, which I learned  through Dad because through all of his paintings, he had to sketch it out  first. Then he would transfer it onto the board that he was working on. I  was doing the same thing, but when this style developed, then I began to  realize that I didn   t have to go into a full sketch. Just get your point  across, and then transfer it onto the canvas. Then once you get it  established and to a certain point, then you can explore. That was really  something that I think made artwork more fun than work.  So some of your subject matter is Plains, Comanche, or some of the  Apache fire dancers you   ve done.  Yeah.  Do you also do Choctaw and Chickasaw subject matter?  Well, I   ve just started to explore the Choctaw culture. I   m still doing  research, but I did do a couple of paintings of Choctaw dances. I believe  one of them was the Four-Step War Dance. Then there were others  where I just did individual paintings of the women. I believe that the  regalia that they were wearing was very colorful and beautiful, and the  music that went along with it was really something different. I was used  to hearing Southern Plains music from the Comanches and the Kiowas  and the Apaches, but now that I began to study the Choctaw culture,  their music is quite different. It was very meaningful. It went right along  with their dances. Their music was what inspired some of the paintings  that I   ve been working on. It   s pretty interesting, so I plan to do more.  19  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  I look forward to seeing those. What   s the role of story in your work?  You know, in the beginning when I was developing early in my career,  there was always a bit of a narrative. The painting would always tell a  story of a hunter, or an encounter with the buffalo, or the Peyote  religion, but as of lately I get an idea, and sometimes it is based upon a  story. I take that idea and explore it. It   s almost as now. It seemed to me  I   d really got so involved in the technique that the subject almost seemed  to become secondary. I believe that there   s a sublime story that can be  told through color and form and through the image, and I believe that  today a lot of people have their own interpretation, which is a wonderful  thing. To me, that   s probably the most correct you can say about a  painting is what it makes you feel and how it speaks to you.  I always believed that on the work that I   ve been doing, there   s a spirit  there, and I   ve come to realize that. It   s through the years of being  exposed to the people that I   ve come across and the stories that Dad told,  and now it comes natural to me. I believe that the people that have  collected my work, they feel it. In the beginning when I was first  developing, that really wasn   t there. A lot of my work was really  technical. It was really devoid of any spirit, so there was a perfect timing  for when this evolved. It seemed to me, back in 2006 and 2007, that   s  when the electricity really come into my work. (Laughter)  How about titles? Do they come easily? Are they important, or     Yes, you know, a title can really say a lot. It can give people a really  good understanding. I know that I   ve been guilty of not titling my  paintings in such a good way, but to me, I really hate to see somebody  do a nice job and then just have either no title or something terrible.  Today I   m beginning to realize that it   s really important to title your  paintings. It will help people understand and also develop in thought.  It   ll have an effect, so it   s very important to me.  How about your signature? Sometimes that   s an art, deciding how you  want to sign your painting and where, etcetera.  For me, as of lately I usually just etch my name into the painting while  it   s still wet. I do it very small. I want people to be more focused on  what   s going on than reading my name. I think it   s more important for  them to get into the painting, so you   ll barely see my name. It   s there,  but it   s not wide open. It   s not easily seen. You have to look for it.  Hopefully, people will see my signature all over the canvas and say,     Well, this is Tim.    (Laughter)  20  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  How important is humor in your work?  Well, humor really never quite existed in my work. (Laughs) In the past,  I   ve done a few cartoons because I   d watch Dad. He was a wonderful  cartoonist. He knew how to make you laugh with his pictures, but for  me, mine was always more serious. One day I   d gotten the tail end of  one of Dad   s funny cartoons because I was drawing a football player,  and it was a real serious drawing. Dad says, he goes,    Let me have a few  minutes with that.    He was getting ready to eat dinner, so he drew up a  big giant football player, and he had a big belly and a big helmet on. He  made my guy look so small, it looked like he was really going to knock  this guy off his feet. I was a little upset, but when I thought about it, it  was really funny. It was just the way Dad did it. This guy   s face was  sticking out of his helmet. He had a big nose, and there was a Band-Aid.  (Laughter) That was Dad. That was his sense of humor.  That   s cute. What is your creative process from the time you get an  idea?  Once I get an idea, I start to sketch it out. There   ll be about three or four  different sketches, and I   ll pick out which one best will do. From that  point on, I   ll go ahead and transfer it onto the canvas. Even the canvas, I  hand-stretch my canvas. I make my own frames. I like the idea that at  any time I can make any size that I want. I   ll select a size. That   s really  important. I hate wasting a good idea on a small painting. I want this  thing to come alive and speak to people, so usually I like to work with  larger pieces. Once I   ve decided what size it   s going to be and after the  sketch is done, then I   ll usually paint the background black. I   ll use  acrylic.  Then I   ll transfer the drawing onto the canvas, and once I get that  established, then that   s when I start to paint in the idea. That   s done with  a paintbrush. Once that is established, well, that   s when I start to move  into the palette knife. Some of these paintings, some of them take about  two to three days to finish, and there are some paintings that I   ve labored  over for about three to four weeks.  Do you tend to pick up one piece and work straight through until that   s  finished, or do you work simultaneously?  Yes, I pretty much will concentrate on one painting. Every once in a  while (it   s very rare) I will have two paintings going at the same time.  There are some paintings that I have to let dry so I can go to another  phase of it. With oil paints the drying process takes a lot longer. During  that time, I   ll go ahead and start on another idea that I   ve been working  on, but usually I pretty much will work on one painting and see it all the  21  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  way through. Working on two doesn   t happen too often.  What is your creative routine? Do you paint more at night or during the  day, or     Well, for a long time I was painting during the day, but as of late I   ve  switched over to nighttime. It seems to me I   m becoming very creative  late at night, especially around three o   clock in the morning. Those have  been some of my most triumphant moments. Late at night, I   m all by  myself, and it seems to me when you start to come toward the finish line  and everything   s working right, it   s like the Super Bowl but you   re by  yourself. It   s really, it   s a great time, so nighttime to me seems to be the  best times, or early in the morning.  Looking back on your career so far, what   s been a really pivotal  moment, a kind of fork in the road for you?  That one I really going to have to think of the best way   . Well, I think  a very pivotal moment was when Dad passed away, that right there. I  began to take everything more seriously at that time, and I began to put  more of myself into my work. That was, I believe, when I got really  deeply involved was when Dad   s life ended.  What has been one of the high points in your career so far?  I think really that was in my personal life when I began to develop this  new style. That right there probably had to have been the most  significant because I found a way to express myself and how I felt about  what I was doing. That right there was a really powerful point in my  career, finally finding my own style. The beautiful part about it is it   s  started to become accepted. That was what I wanted, but I didn   t know  how to do it. One day when it did happen, I began to realize that this is  what I   m going to do.  How about a low point in your career so far?  (Laughs) Well, I   ve had a few of them, yeah. I have to think on that  because I   ve come across a few speed bumps. Some of them happened  in my personal life. I think, too, when I was working seven days a week  and I wasn   t able to paint like I wanted to, it seemed to me that every  time I was out on the job I   d have a fantastic idea, and I realized that I  wasn   t going to be able to produce it. That felt like I wasn   t advancing  the way I should be. I don   t know if you really would consider that a low  point, but it was a very frustrating time. Then eventually making the  decision to become a full-time artist, I knew that I was walking away  from a regular paycheck that   s very dependable to a world that was very  22  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  uncertain. Once I got involved in it, I did have some pretty lean  moments financially, but there were also a lot of breakthroughs.  But, yeah, there were some low points there, and there were a few times  I didn   t know if I was going to be able to make it full-time. Then again,  when I started this new style of work, I began to realize that,    Hey, you  can do this. You can do it.    I tell other artists who are going through  some struggles to continually explore because through your consistency  you   ll find yourself. It   s there. It   s there for everybody. It   s just a matter  of how bad you want it. I always tell others to keep studying your work  because there   s things that   s taking place that you don   t see or you   re  unaware of. There   s just a right time, and the only way you   re going to  see it is if you do it every day, every day. One day your signature style  will evolve. It   ll come alive for you. I believe that everybody has that  chance, and my advice to them is to continually produce, continually  explore.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about before we have a look at  your artwork?  Well, I know that starting the gallery was a really big deal in my life. I  hope that all the artists that we exhibit here will all find their place in the  universe. I hope that I   m instrumental in helping them find it, and I hope  that I   m instrumental in helping their dreams come true. I hope that they  advance far more than what they think in their own minds. I want to be a  part of it. I hope that I can help them receive that.  Well, let   s take a look at some of your paintings. Would you like to tell  us about this painting, Timothy?  Yes, this painting right here is really symbolic of a Peyote meeting.  Whenever the ceremony really gets going, once they begin to take in the  Peyote, I think that something very inspirational takes place and these  gentlemen are able to speak in such an inspired way. A lot happens  inside the meeting, so for me this is just a new expression of how I felt  about it, and being around it, and enjoying my life, and watching my  brothers participate in it. For me, this is something that evolved out of  that. The title of the painting is called Dancing Stars which, actually, I  let my son Sage title. Me and his mom asked him what he thought about  the painting and what would be a nice title, so he said,    How about  Dancing Stars?    So we thought that was really appropriate.  That   s wonderful. How about this painting?  This painting right here is what we call a Mountain Spirit, which  really   when I was growing up, I was raised right around the Chiricahua  23  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Little Thunder  Nevaquaya  Apaches and some of the Mescalero Apaches. I used to attend a lot of  their ceremonies, so as of lately they   ve become a primary focus of what  I do. This one right here is from the symbolic of the Gooday family  which are Chiricahua Apaches that settled in our area. This is regalia  that they   d wear, but also the abstract design is pretty much my way of  bringing out the spirituality of the dance and how I feel about it. When I  developed this new style, it actually helped me to pretty much bring life  to the spiritual world that we are really unaware of, although we sense it  and feel it. In the painting, it really helps it come out. This is one of my  favorite subjects.  How about this piece?  This one is called Love Song on the Plains. When I was growing up, I  was always exposed to flute music. I used to hear a lot of stories about  the Comanches and how they would court the one that they were  interested in, and they would use a flute. That was how they gave their  love calls. Now, the flute had a lot of different uses, but this was one of  the primary uses among the Comanche people, so this one is titled Love  Song on the Plains.  That   s really nice. Well, thank you so much for talking with us today.  Thank you, Julie.  -------  -------
